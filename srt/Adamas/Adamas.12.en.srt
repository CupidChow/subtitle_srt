(gun clacks)

10
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,913
He fooled me?

11
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,877
How dare he…

12
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,049
Go bring the real Adamas.

13
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,429
Your father knows where it is.

14
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,390
Got that?

15
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,645
I'm talking about Lee Changwoo.

16
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,993
I think we're done talking.

17
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,665
Jeez.

18
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,417
(thuds)

19
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,210
You bastard.

-What happened? Where's Mr. Ha?
-What?

25
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,954
He's in there.

26
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,958
Damn it.

00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,587

-Really?

00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,590

-Go on.

Sangam Market
where Hwang Byungchul is campaigning.

38
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,940
The bomb must be there.

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,985
Mr. Kang, hurry up and let his camp know.

40
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,153
SUHYEON:
<i>Hwang Byungchul wasn't at the ceremony.</i>

41
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,948
He should've pushed everything aside
to be there,

42
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,409
but he wasn't invited.

43
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,743
It must've been intentional.

44
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,413
They wanted him
to be somewhere else at the time.

45
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,422
Gather our people immediately.
We must go to Sangam Market.

00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,941
-Hwang Byungchul!
-Sorry? Who is this?

50
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,360
(chanting continues)
Hwang Byungchul! Hwang Byungchul!

51
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,659
It must've been tough.
We just need to cut this thing off now.

52
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,661
Okay.

53
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,416
Do you want some water?

54
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,340
Thank you.

55
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,012
Let me tape up your hand again.
It's gotten loose.

00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,531
Where did the tape go?

(revving)

60
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,256
Mr. Hwang.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,093
What's wrong? I'm in the middle
of communicating with my supporters.

62
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,844
(laughs)

63
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,098
What?

64
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,810
Let's go.

65
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,783
Excuse me.

66
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,536
Can you hurry up with the taping?

67
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,038
I'm suddenly feeling very dizzy.

68
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,046
Excuse me?

69
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,847
Should we evacuate the people?

70
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,224
No way. If we let them know,
things could get too crazy

71
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,225
for us to get out of here.

72

74

00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,753

79
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,825
What?

80
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,620
Hey, go start the engine already.

81
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,662
-BODYGUARD: Yes, sir. Hurry up!
-BYUNGCHUL: Now!

82
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,544
Hwang Byungchul is the target.

83
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,755
Let's go!

84
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,302
What's your deal? Move!

85
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,012
What… Move out of the way!

86
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,097
-Wait, wait.
-What?

00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,308
I'm Prosecutor Song Suhyeon.

-You're in danger, sir.

90
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,813
What's wrong with you?

91
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
You're their target.

92
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,441

<i>Realizing the gravity of this attack</i>

103
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>targeting unspecified individuals,
the police declared they'd form</i>

104

<i>a special investigation team
and get to the bottom of this incident.</i>

105

<i>to the suicide bomb threat
which took place</i>

until I give you further instructions.

115

Hurry up. Now!

116
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,492
Hurry up. Run!

117
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,996
Go and lock the doors. Don't come out.

118
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,126

-Oh, my goodness.

MS. OH: Well…

120
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,716
That girl is here.

121
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,335
It's been a while.

122
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,464
Right.

123
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,008
Long time no see.

124
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,970
What brings you here all of a sudden?

125
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,974
What brings me here? I'm not sure.

126
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,645
Still so pretty, sis.

127
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,563
If you're talking about Ms. Yoon,
she's inside.

128
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,233
But I doubt you're here
to see your older sister.

129
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,905
You've become so mean.

130
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,200
Is it because of Minjo's death?

131
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,122
Those mean words
make you look even prettier.

132
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,177
The old man summoned me.

133
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,556
I guess he wants someone dead again.

137
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,971
Are you awake?

138
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,348
Yes.

139
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,351
Are you feeling okay?

00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,271
(gasps)

141
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,733
What is this?

142
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,115
The suicide bombing has become a fact.

143
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,369
But I'm glad you're safe.

144
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,040
That's good enough.

145
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm sorry for your trouble.

146
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,593
And thank you for being alive.

147
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,305
That's all?

148
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,934
-What?
-Is that all?

149
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,103
Say a little more.

150
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,397
I barely managed to survive.

151
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,318
(chuckles)

152
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,696
You're lying in bed handcuffed.
How can you be smiling?

153
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,115
I even put on an explosive vest.

154
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,076
I've got to stay strong.

155
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,083
Ms. Kim.

156
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
Listen carefully.

157
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,714
Narcotics were found in your blood.

158
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,883
What?

159
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,264
(grunts)

160
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,686
Oh.

161
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,272
Then the police might think

162
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,775
that I committed it under the influence.

163
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,445
No, no one thinks you committed it alone.

164
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,364
They think someone pulled the strings.

165
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,117
Naturally, they will dig
into who's behind it.

166
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,703
(Seohee sighs)

167
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,664
What?

168
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250
To reveal that I was kidnapped,

169
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,753
I must single out Team A.

170
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,258
But then the SIH will inevitably
be brought up to the surface.

171
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,343
Will they be safe?

172
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,970
Don't worry.

173
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,307
They already got dragged out
even if not for you.

174
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,559
It's already begun.

KOREAN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

176
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,114
At 7:23 p.m. yesterday,

177
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,242
the suspect showed up in a suicide vest
at the lobby of this building.

178
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,454
We immediately called in
the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team

179
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,624
and the bomb was deactivated
safely at 10:46 p.m.

180
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,000
The bomb will be

181
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,711
analyzed thoroughly in a safe location.

182
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,463
Afterward, we will organize a task force

183
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,924
to focus on investigating the case.

184
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,384
Sir, there has been a report
that this culprit has something

185
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,721
to do with the terrorist attack
at Candidate Hwang's campaign rally.

186
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,264
REPORTER: Is it true?

187
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,434
What's your stance about Hwang's argument?
Do you think it's credible?

188
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,939
That matter
is currently under investigation.

189
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,234
It certainly was a conspiracy
to assassinate me!

190
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,322
Just three days
before the presidential election,

191
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,533
this kind of terrorist attack took place.

192
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,995
It means they thought

193
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,747
I was likely to be elected

194
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,709
and pulled this despicable scheme
to stop me from becoming president.

195
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,669
STRONGLY CLAIMS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

196
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:07,257
I know there's a mastermind behind this.

197
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,386
BYUNGCHUL: Are you sure?

198
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,721
Was the call really
from Kang Hyukpil of the SIH?

199
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,306
Yes, I'm sure.

200
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,516
Good.

201
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,311
It's going to make a nice picture
with just a little touch.

202
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,647
You know who Mr. Kang is.

203
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,108
He works for the president.

204
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,695
This is going to be the perfect chance
to wipe them all out.

205
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,863
(laughs)

206
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,867
Please understand that we can't share
any more details about the investigation.

207
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,619
That's all for today.

208
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,331
-REPORTER 1: Mr. Kang, wait.
-REPORTER 2: Mr. Kang.

209
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,500
-Mr. Kang.
-REPORTER 3: Just a moment.

210
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,545
It won't end only with you.

211
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,297
Everyone in this field
knows who is behind you.

212
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,468
They will use me to go after the VIP?

213
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,972
It's an undeniable fact that the VIP
is connected to the SIH.

214
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,433
HYUKPIL:
Consequentially, the SIH is intact

215
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
while Hwang's side was bombed.

216
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,271
They could take the fall for this.

217
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,231
Mr. Kang, that bomb.

218
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,735
You know where it came from
if it was Team A's doing.

219
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,657
Compare it with every bomb
produced by ARES.

220
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,200
See if any component matches.

221
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,163
That's why they needed me.

222
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,873
The target was

223
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,251
Hwang Byungchul,
whom I went after obsessively.

224
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,088
They'll tie in the SIH too.

225
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,761
(sighs)
Darn it, that sure was a fatal blow.

226
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,264
We'll fight right back.

227
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,809
Tell the police the truth.

228
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,854
-The truth?
-About my father's case.

229
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,107
That you witnessed the case,

230
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,194
and the Adamas
is the missing murder weapon.

231
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,114
You tried to look into it,
and some unidentified people…

232
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,283
Are you following?

233
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,160
You want to drag Chairman Kwon into it?

234
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,669
A TERRORIST ATTACK TAKES PLACE
AT CANDIDATE HWANG'S CAMPAIGN RALLY

235
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,227
Mr. Lee ordered it.

236
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,814
You weren't aware of it?

237
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,321
Hyunjo gave his permission, I heard.

238
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,920
May I leave?

239
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,605
(door opens, closes)

240
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,440
I apologize.

241
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,360
I thought this would make way

242
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,196
for the legalization of firearms--

243
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,489
Shut it!

244
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,660
Father.

245
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,914
You fool.

246
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,461
-Sun?
-JEONG: Yes.

247
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,547
The chairman summoned her himself.

248
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,841
Really?

249
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,887
Will it be okay? He might get furious
about this incident.

250
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,556
It will be okay.

251
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,726
-Pardon?
-The chairman would know

252
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,938
why his stupid son needs me.

253
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,484
He caused a huge mess out of things,
and the world's going crazy about it.

254
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,446
Somebody has to clean that up

255
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,032
for his sake, you know.

256
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,371
KWON: <i>Everyone else knows
that Mr. Lee made a fool out of you.</i>

257
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,708
Your dog attacked you,

258
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,002
but you don't even know
that you were attacked.

259
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,546
How can you become the owner of Haesong

260
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,840
when you can't even
control your underlings?

261
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,050
How dare you!

262
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,598
Father, it was all for your sake.

263
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,059
Those rats from the SIH

264
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,478
dared to dig into your past.

265
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,813
-I wanted to wipe them all out--
-So,

266
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,274
are they gone?

267
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,736
-It's not over yet.
-Enough!

268
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,698
What happened in the past

269
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,618
isn't yours to meddle with.

270
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,250
The Adamas

271
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,004
is already broken.

272
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,885
The murder weapon doesn't exist anymore.

273
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,474
The Adamas is broken?
What do you mean by that?

274
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,899
HYUNJO:
I don't understand. Why would it break?

275
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,360
How could a diamond…

276
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,740
(Kwon sighs)

277
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,580
The Adamas is a fake?

278
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,209
Then where is the real one?

279
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,046
Father.

280
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,923
Only Lee Changwoo would know.

281
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,094
(sighs)
That bastard switched it?

282
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,513
At that time 22 years ago?

283
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,015
(Hyunjo scoffs)

284
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,351
(laughs)

285
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,521
So?

286
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,690
What do you mean, so?

287
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,442
That bastard is still alive.

288
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,154
He dared mess with the Adamas,
and you're keeping him alive?

289
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,780
-Then should I kill him?
-Of course!

290
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,699
He deserves to die countless times.

291
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,952
Then how will we find the real one?

292
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,040
We must find the real Adamas

293
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,459
and bring it here.

294
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,385
It wasn't a coincidence

295
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,222
Mr. Ha came to this house.

296
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,932
(gun cocks)

297
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,476
(clicks)

298
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,771
I'd like to write a memoir.

299
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,357
Ms. Yoon, check if there's

300
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,568
anyone eligible to ghostwrite it.

301
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,573
The name is Ha Woosin.

302
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,101
Hey, sis.

303
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,103
Hi.

304
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,271
Have you been well?

305
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,610
It's been a while,
but you don't seem glad to see me.

306
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,113
I thought about you often.

307
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,322
(whimpers)

308
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,328
Every time I kill someone,

309
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,831
I imagine it's you.

310
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,543
Sis.

311
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,129
You must be happy.

312
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,215
At your happiest moment,

313
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,970
we'll meet again.

314
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,557
(Sun laughs)

315
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,282
KWON: <i>The Adamas is already broken.</i>

316
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,951
<i>The murder weapon doesn't exist anymore.</i>

317
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,453
It was a fake.

318
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,247
KWON: <i>We must find the real Adamas</i>

319
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,541
<i>and bring it here.</i>

320
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,084
(scoffs)

321
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,753
He spared Ha Woosin's life

322
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,466
to find the Adamas.

323
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,314
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha.

324
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,777
Mr. Ha.

325
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,406
Mr. Ha?

326
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,160
Mr. Ha.

327
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,246
Where did he go?

328
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,003
DONGRIM

329
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,505
(ringing)

330
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,633
Mr. Ha, where are you?
Nothing happened to you, right?

331
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,343
Jeez, talk quietly.

332
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,470
Thank goodness.

333
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,805
I was startled because you weren't home.

334
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,766
DONGRIM: <i>I thought Chairman Kwon
had killed you already.</i>

335
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,267
What are you doing at my place?

336
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,478
I was scared to be home alone.

337
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,938
What if they come to retaliate?

338
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,939
(scoffs)

339
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,816
Didn't you think
it'd be more dangerous there?

340
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,693
DONGRIM:
<i>Still, there's strength in numbers.</i>

341
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,155
If something happens,
I'll call the police while you face them.

342
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
Or should I be with my parents
at the hospital?

343
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450
Suit yourself.

344
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,952
DONGRIM: <i>Where are you, by the way?</i>

345
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,412
It's dangerous to be alone. Come home.

346
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,581
Sleep on the couch, not the bed.

347
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,547
Where are you?
Should I go to where you are?

348
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,173
I said, not the bed.

349
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,096
He's just so fearless.

350
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,059
Goodness, I'm tired.

351
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,080
(sighs)

352
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,133
(Agent Park panting)

353
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,342
How did it go?

354
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,303
The signal is blocked.

355
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,804
It's the same for mine.

356
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,347
They blocked it intentionally.

357
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,975
It's a means to protect
the infiltration agents.

358
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,228
After what happened at the ceremony,
this place is almost unapproachable now.

359
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,689
What are you going to do?

360
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,860
The headquarters will do their work,
and we'll do ours.

361
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,446
We've got an unexpected problem here too.

362
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,782
Ask me any questions.
I'll tell you everything.

363
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,662
Lee Changwoo murdered
Song Soonho 22 years ago,

364
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,248
but it was actually Chairman Kwon.
Is that what you're saying?

365
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,625
That's right.

366
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,295
Can you prove it?

367
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,924
An arrest warrant might be issued
with Ms. Kwon's testimony.

368
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,801
The arrowhead is broken,

369
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,014
<i>but there may be a bloodstain</i>

370
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,308
<i>left inside the arrow shaft.</i>

371
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,896
If it turns out to be Song Soonho's blood,
the game will be over.

372
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,106
Even if there isn't any blood,

373
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,400
we can compare the evidence
with the scar on his skeleton.

374
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,570
-Okay.
-I've still got a chance.

375
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,864
MR. LEE: <i>Mr. Choi.</i>

376
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,578
What is it, Mr. Lee?

377
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,121
MR. LEE: <i>Mr. Ha is here.</i>

378
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,752
He wants to meet the chairman.

379
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,722
(knocks on door)

380
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,123
I need to talk to the chairman in private.
Will you give us some space?

381
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,960
(sighs)
How dare you--

382
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,587
Hyunjo, he's my guest.

383
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,229
I met the man you sent.

384
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,735
And I received your message.

385
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,616
How similar. Those eyes…

386
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,842
HYESOO: What are you doing? This is rude.

387
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,848
That writer is here.

388
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,980
Aren't you glad?

389
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,523
You two seemed quite close.

390
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,777
I know you aren't jealous,
so what's the meaning of this?

391
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,361
(sighs)

392
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,948
You're a smart woman.

393
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,493
Did you really not know?

394
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,580
Why that writer came to this house.

395
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,712
Maybe he approached you.

396
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,299
A lonely woman

397
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,384
is such easy prey.

398
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,721
You have a point.

399
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,933
But sadly, he's not interested in me.

400
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,226
Although I am.

401
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,979
Don't blame me.

402
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,650
It was Ms. Yoon who recommended him.

403
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,613
Shouldn't you be busy right now?

404
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,658
Ms. Kwon seemed to know something.

405
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,286
I wonder what she will say to the police.

406
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,000
Your father was just like you.

407
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,671
Being a hound didn't suit him.

408
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
Just what happened?

409
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,594
I was betrayed.

410
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,181
Me.

411
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,184
KWON:
You're becoming more popular by the day.

412
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,938
The media are calling you
a Robin Hood figure.

413
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,481
(laughs)

414
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
The notorious thief
is now a national star.

415
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,610
Thanks to it, anything you steal

416
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,821
gets branded to be dirty
and corrupt right away.

417
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,325
The management support department
will be expanded to a specialized team.

418
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,995
Of course, you'll be in charge.

419
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,792
Sir.

420
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,504
I'd like to stop here.

421
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,716
CHANGWOO:
I think this is where my part ends.

422
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
Is it because of that woman?

423
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,389
Is she pregnant or something?

424
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,311
(sighs)
I didn't know it was twins.

425
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,897
He wanted to leave, didn't he?

426
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,989
I'm certain that I've been
more loyal to you than anyone else.

427
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,450
I did everything you asked.

428
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,493
And I carried it out.

429
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,662
Now,

430
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,707
I'd like to be forgotten.

431
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,544
Would you be forgotten
just because I forget you?

432
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,672
The whole organization remembers you.

433
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,593
Everyone we've discarded
was sent to their grave, right?

434
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,095
-Sir.
-No exceptions are allowed.

435
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,766
-Sir.
-Go back.

436
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,354
(sighs)

437
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,572
(sighs)

438
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,556
Please promise me

439
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,518
just one thing.

440
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,436
That you will

441
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,314
end it with me.

442
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,834
You should've shot me.

443
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,670
Then I would've

444
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,340
wanted to kill you.

445
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,261
The police will receive an anonymous tip.

446
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,055
You will be arrested red-handed next time.

447
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,392
KWON: Fifteen years should be enough.

448
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,853
By then, I might be able

449
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,189
to forget you.

450
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,237
Did you want to spare his life?

451
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:55,950
(sighs)

452
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,287
Even you figured that out.
I wonder why your father couldn't.

453
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,540
Rotting in prison for 15 years,

454
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,586
he probably got an urge to take revenge.

455
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,423
KWON: How could he steal the Adamas?

456
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,928
I tried to keep my promise
at that time as well.

457
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,597
By killing him only.

458
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,182
Instead,

459
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,393
Song Soonho ended up dying.

460
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,231
Your father gained a lot from this anyway.

461
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,150
For 22 years,

462
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,612
he deceived me completely.

463
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,240
Now you should

464
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,036
pay off that debt.

465
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
So you planned it all from the start.

466
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,214
You lured me into this house,

467
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,926
knowing that I'd try to steal the Adamas.

468
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,640
All to find the real Adamas.

469
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,062
-(chuckles)
-But just one thing.

470
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,816
Ms. Kwon's actions were unexpected.

471
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,404
It was 22 years ago.
At around 3 a.m. on May 5…

472
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,408
Jeez, that's a horrible nightmare.

473
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,829
It wasn't a dream. Hyunjo and I saw it.

474
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,997
Our father

475
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,336
killed someone with the Adamas.

476
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,507
What are you talking about?

477
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,426
Lee Changwoo. His name was Lee Changwoo.

478
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,427
Lee Changwoo.

479
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,850
You heard this?

480
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,851
(table clacks)

481
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,894
I clearly did.

482
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,147
At that time, I didn't understand.

483
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,693
ROBIN HOOD LEE CHANGWOO
KILLS A MAN IN HIS 40S

484
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,154
MS. KWON: <i>But the next day,
I saw the newspaper and realized</i>

485
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,157
that the Adamas
was the missing murder weapon.

486
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,285
That Chairman Kwon ordered
Lee Changwoo to kill that man.

487
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:06,080
Lee Changwoo
was his devoted right-hand man.

488
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,169
Don't tell me
you actually think Father killed him.

489
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,004
I think it's plausible enough.

490
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,797
What about you?

491
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,925
You're crossing the line here, fearlessly.

492
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,140
I've got nothing to fear.

493
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,267
A coward is

494
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,854
rather a word to describe you.

495
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,735
You've always been scared of your father.

496
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,364
I see.

497
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,369
That's why you're asking me
these leading questions.

498
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,080
You're even recording this conversation.

499
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,916
NEW RECORDING

500
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,125
Right?

501
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,380
(sighs)
Please, Hyesoo.

502
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,840
Please don't do this.

503
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,843
If you keep acting up,
Father will kill you for real.

504
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,430
(chuckles)

505
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,807
(scoffs)

506
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,895
(laughing)

507
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,230
Is this funny to you?

508
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,316
The chairman can't kill me.

509
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,780
Because I'm the only one
who reminds him of Minjo.

510
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,328
He had to kill

511
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,123
his most beloved son himself.

512
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,669
And I'm the woman that son loved.

513
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,007
I'm better than you,
the stupid and pathetic replacement.

514
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,551
No?

515
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,264
Right.

516
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,599
Minjo is the reason

517
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,268
you're still alive.

518
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,815
Hyesoo, who do you think
would suffer the most

519
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,609
if you're alive?

520
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,280
-What are you saying?
-Me.

521
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,533
What?

522
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,910
Do you still not get it?

523
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,121
You are my cross.

524
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,956
A cross I must bear.

525
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,336
As the price of killing Minjo.

526
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,884
I killed Minjo.

527
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,638
It wasn't Father. It was me, you idiot.

528
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,270
Oh, I guess you really didn't know.

529
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,649
Oh, it's a shame
others can't see this face.

530
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,451
Let go of me. Let go!

531
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,660
(grunts)

532
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,624
Why?

533
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,960
Why did you kill Minjo? Why?

534
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,962
Go blame Father.

535
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,424
He's the one who made me do it!

536
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,346
(groaning)

537
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,147
(Hyunjo grunts)

538
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,984
As a father, I cannot forgive you,

539
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,695
but good job eliminating your enemy

540
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,074
to survive.

541
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,744
HYUNJO: <i>That was</i>

542
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,997
the first time he ever complimented me.

543
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,083
If Minjo had taken over Haesong,

544
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,543
would he have kept me alive?

545
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,504
No.

546
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,674
He would've killed me first.

547
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,970
So take it out on him.

548
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,014
Ask him why

549
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,102
he made me kill Minjo.

550
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,611
What can Ms. Kwon do?

551
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,822
What did she witness?

552
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,076
Even without Ms. Kwon's testimony,
it will eventually be revealed that

553
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,662
the Adamas was used for the murder.

554
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,663
(laughs)

555
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,334
But can it specify that I'm the culprit?

556
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,004
It can't prove that I was there.

557
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
I guess you got my point.

558
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,097
I'll give you two days.

559
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,016
Find the real Adamas.

560
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,441
What if I refuse?

561
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,277
You will be safe.

562
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,697
Because your brother will replace you.

563
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,380
Are you crazy? How could you
meet the chairman in this situation?

564
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,966
It was the only way to come here
without being suspected.

565
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,384
I came here to meet you.

566
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,595
Me?

567
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,015
You have the video of Ms. Kwon
from the ceremony?

568
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,436
Did the SIH send you?

569
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,313
Yes, Suhyeon asked me.

570
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,482
I think he's planning something
with the SIH.

571
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,124
MR. LEE

572
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,627
See? He won't pick up.

573
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,754
You were the target.

574
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,380
I figured that out

575
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,300
and stopped you with my car.
That's how you survived.

576
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,968
That can't be true.

577
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,304
Why would Haesong…

578
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:58,098
I saw candidate number five
at the ceremony.

579
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,976
You didn't even get invited, did you?

580
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,606
That's because I had
important business to attend to…

581
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,942
Oh, come on.

582
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,653
You're a politician,
but you're so clueless about politics.

583
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,906
Anyone can see you've been tossed out.

584
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,159
Haesong obviously held
two cards in their hands. One in each.

585
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,580
You ran away alone
when you heard about the bomb, didn't you?

586
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,707
If that goes public,
your ratings will hit rock bottom.

587
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,045
So what do you say?
Should we have a go at it?

588
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,548
Are you threatening me?

589
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,592
No, I'm asking for your cooperation.

590
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,096
(grunts)

591
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:43,143
Jeez, you're being faithful
even in this situation.

592
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,521
You sure are manly.

593
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,316
Are you trying to mess with me?

594
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,235
No, Haesong is.

595
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,364
You could've died.

596
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,745
-Hold on…
-What?

597
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,958
I'm alive.

598
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,837
If their plan was to kill me,

599
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,797
I should be dead.

600
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,510
-That's because I managed to save--
-No.

601
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,805
Even if I had survived it,

602
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,391
I should be dead by now.

603
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,394
Is it hard to understand?

604
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,773
All right, let's say you did save me.

605
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,984
In return for your kindness,

606
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,612
I will give you a tip.

607
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,491
I was not the target.

608
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,287
-Sir.
-You heard me.

609
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:53,297
We'll never see each other again, will we?

610
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,675
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

611
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,149
Damn it.

612
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,155
I was wrong about the bomb.

613
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,407
SUHYEON: <i>We can't get Haesong with it.</i>

614
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,959
(phone thuds)

615
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,590
SEARCH RESULTS FOR "BOMB"
WITH "ARES," "ALL," "PARTS": NO MATCH

616
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,349
Sir, we got the trace results on the bomb.

617
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,520
The components didn't match
any of those from ARES.

618
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,438
Well,

619
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,817
the components
and the manufacturing method match ours.

620
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,279
(sighs)

621
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,161
REPORTER:
<i>The police have begun their investigation,</i>

622
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,205
<i>and they're expected
to resolve the question</i>

623
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,791
<i>about whether there is a mastermind
behind the culprit</i>

624
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,543
<i>as Candidate Hwang claims.</i>

625
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,795
<i>The Election Polling Committee
of the New Future Party</i>

626
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,256
<i>demanded a strict police investigation,
arguing that this was</i>

627
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,591
<i>a systematic attack
against the strong candidate.</i>

628
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,220
<i>But the police have decided to continue
with the unbiased investigation</i>

629
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,849
<i>since it's only a suspicion so far.</i>

630
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,144
We've arrived.

631
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,396
Okay.

632
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,148
Should I escort you?

633
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,858
No, wait here.

634
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,359
CHIEF JEONG: Yes, sir.

635
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,671
You're late again.

636
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,631
There was a lot of traffic.

637
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,341
What would you like to have?

638
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,970
Go ahead and stuff yourself.

639
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,308
But the steak is good.

640
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,269
What did the chairman say?

641
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,315
Well…

642
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,274
(chuckles)

643
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,611
Are you trying to save your breath,
or are you keeping something from me?

644
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,696
Either way, it's a waste of time.

645
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,866
Be careful.

646
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,410
You seem to have lost his favor.

647
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,828
Oh.

648
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,710
(Team Leader Lee sighs loudly)

649
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,546
So it's not horrible, right?

650
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,633
I told you to be careful.

651
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:44,802
What?

652
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,101
(chokes)

653
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,648
(coughs)

654
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:04,112
I already warned you before,
but you're just too careless.

655
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,864
You damn brat…

656
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,283
(grunts)

657
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,162
(grunting continues)

658
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,548
(groans)

659
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,135
TEAM LEADER LEE: Oh, goodness.

660
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,972
(gasping)

661
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,725
Jeez, damn it.

662
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,483
PRESIDENT KWON HYUNJO
GWANGJANG-DONG. AT 11 TOMORROW

663
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,609
(grunts)

664
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,036
That little…

665
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,913
(growls)

666
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,751
(groaning)
Damn it…

667
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,137
You son of a…

668
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,808
You…

669
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,185
(car beeping)

670
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,437
(Team Leader Lee grunting)

671
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,283
(car door closes)

672
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,933
My Children's Day gift from Dad.

673
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,517
Silly him.

674
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,603
Where is he?

675
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,606
I don't know.
I just found this on the floor.

676
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,111
-YOUNG SUHYEON: Did he go somewhere?
-YOUNG WOOSIN: I bet he went to work.

677
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,698
How else do you think
he got that expensive toy?

678
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,951
We're not well off.

679
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,230
Hey.

680
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,235
You're late.

681
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,530
Why are you alone?
Didn't the SIH get you anyone?

682
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,240
It'd only be a nuisance.

683
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,284
What about you? Is it okay to be alone?

684
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,870
Chairman Kwon said he wouldn't kill me.

685
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,331
Did he say he'd kill me then?

686
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,168
So he did.

687
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,380
Fine, let him kill me.

688
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,299
How is Ms. Kim doing?

689
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,093
She'll be taken
to the police station soon.

690
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,888
She might be safer there for now.

691
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,890
How did it go?

692
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,147
Here.

693
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,401
Okay.

694
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,404
(sighs)
The SIH is going to cook it up nicely.

695
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,198
By the way…

696
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,536
(clears throat)
…let me ask you something.

697
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,249
You were after the retrial from the start,
weren't you?

698
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,584
Not catching the real culprit.

699
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,673
Why?

700
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,219
Because Lee Changwoo is innocent.

701
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,971
So why?

702
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,265
His innocence has nothing to do with you.

703
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,643
Finding out who actually killed Father
should come first.

704
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,730
What was so important
about stealing the Adamas for the retrial?

705
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,859
And now the Adamas is destroyed,
so the murder weapon no longer exists.

706
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,319
How will you do the retrial?

707
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,864
What is it?

708
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,909
What is it that I don't know?

709
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,660
What are you keeping from me?

710
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,539
Hey.

711
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,500
Suhyeon.

712
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,001
What is it?

713
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,672
About our real father…

714
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,258
Our real father?

715
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,969
He is…

716
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,265
Darn it.

717
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,439
MR. HAN:
<i>Ms. Kwon, your statement isn't credible.</i>

718
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,859
<i>It's all just an assumption, not a fact.</i>

719
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,204
I will avenge you, son.

720
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,624
I will make sure to take revenge for you.

721
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,752
(clanks)

722
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,629
You have a visitor.

723
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,051
POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE

724
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:44,035
You're here to see me at this hour?
I wonder what you're trying to pull.

725
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,666
Speak.

726
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,211
-Kwon.
-Don't treat me like I'm your butler!

727
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,588
It gives me the creeps.

728
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,673
I'm not your servant anymore.

729
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,091
Are you going to end it like this?

730
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:03,638
After what you did at the ceremony,
are you just going to give up?

731
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,892
Kwon Jaekyu.

732
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,686
Think about what he did to your son.

733
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,733
Don't you dare speak of my son.
You know nothing!

734
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,109
He wasn't brain-dead.

735
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,322
Your son was alive.

736
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,369
He made it look like
he was brain-dead and took…

737
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,330
(scoffs)
Shut up.

738
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,165
He took a heart out of a man
who was still alive.

739
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,542
I said, shut up.

740
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,086
Shut up!

741
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,596
Help me.

742
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,141
You know everything about Chairman Kwon.

743
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,352
Tell me what I should do.

744
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,397
I will destroy

745
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,692
Chairman Kwon…

746
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,989
and Haesong.

747
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,504
My father hardly drinks,

748
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,798
but there was one time
when he got really drunk.

749
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,510
He was so delighted that
he had finally become one of your people.

750
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,973
At that time, he told me

751
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,142
that you offered him a gift
to mark the occasion.

752
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,647
And you needed a name

753
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,565
from him.

754
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,361
He shouldn't have told you that.

755
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,406
I have never called you Father.

756
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,741
But if I become one of your people,

757
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,744
I may be able to.

758
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,665
Really?

759
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,626
If that's what you say…

760
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,388
Do you mean this?

761
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,931
Yes.

762
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,685
Because he killed Minjo.

763
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,401
KWON HYUNJO

764
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,571
Will you accept it?

765
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,283
It's too late.

766
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,871
Hyunjo has already paid the price.

767
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,044
(clinks)

768
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,172
Did you have fun with Eun Hyesoo?

769
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,549
Pardon?

770
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,346
You've been her spy,

771
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,932
leaking company information
here and there.

772
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,810
Well, that's--

773
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,105
I must say, you're unexpectedly smart.

774
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,108
Right.

775
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,614
You're supposed to jump back and forth

776
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,287
and see whose bandwagon is better.

777
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,290
Right?

778
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,380
I saw Yoon Sun at Haesongwon.

779
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,093
Did she get an order
to finish off Mr. Lee?

780
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,804
Is she going to kill him?

781
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,184
Yes, he's already been taken care of.

782
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,818
KWON: <i>I gave him a punishment.</i>

783
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,112
To see you all his life

784
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,739
and remember Minjo.

785
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,743
What else could I have done?

786
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,454
He's the only heir of Haesong.

787
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,501
Tell me when you come to miss Minjo.

788
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,797
I'll send you to him myself.

789
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,262
Hyesoo.

790
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,937
That's not how you bargain with someone.

791
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,986
You want to be one of my people?

792
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,281
If you want something,

793
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,617
you need to offer what the other wants.
That's how you make a deal.

794
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,498
What do you want?

795
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,462
What can you offer?

796
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,142
I'll give you

797
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,979
what you want.

798
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,573
Following the all-night investigation,
a strict interrogation is ongoing.

799
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,450
REPORTER:
The identity of the female suspect

800
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,660
has yet to be released.

801
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,787
QUESTION: WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CANDIDATE HWANG?

802
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,123
(table pounding)

803
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,043
I told you already.

804
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,837
I have no hard feelings
against Hwang Byungchul.

805
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,216
Your past articles say otherwise.

806
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,510
They are full of hatred.

807
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,388
And Candidate Hwang sued you
once every quarter.

808
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,768
That's because he's just too filthy.

809
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,811
Look.

810
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,022
I was kidnapped.

811
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,983
-You were kidnapped?
-Yes.

812
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,194
They plotted this incident

813
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,323
to link me to Hwang Byungchul.

814
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,658
Mm…

815
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,159
I see.

816
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,661
What was the purpose then?

817
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,037
Lee Changwoo the notorious thief.

818
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,706
I witnessed

819
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,208
the only murder he committed.

820
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,710
I kept digging into that case,

821
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,754
and they did this to me.

822
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,339
To silence me.

823
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,258
(snorts)

824
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,303
How great are these people
that they plotted a bombing attack?

825
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,596
It makes no sense.

826
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,432
Haesong Group. Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

827
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,560
Does it make sense now?

828
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,356
Fine.

829
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,777
All right, but why did you go to the SIH?

830
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,493
Because those who kidnapped me
made me go there.

831
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,499
Kang Hyukpil.

832
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,253
Don't you know him?

833
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,090
I don't.

834
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,509
Don't you think this will take a while?

835
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,553
Let's eat first.

836
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,430
I'll have <i>galbitang.</i>

837
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,140
Jeez.

838
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,602
An extra-large, please.

839
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,187
HYUKPIL: <i>You were right, Prosecutor Song.</i>

840
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,648
They copied a core component of ours.

841
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,775
If this goes public,

842
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,028
it will get out of control.

843
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,738
We saw it coming.

844
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,450
What they want is an all-out war
with everything on the line.

845
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,662
I'm ready for it. What about you?

846
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,046
(phone clacks)

847
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,383
With everything on the line?

848
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,886
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

849
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,263
(clapping)
You're finally at work.

850
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:46,225
I thought you defected to North Korea
instead of being on sick leave.

851
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,229
Come on, sir. Must you welcome me back
in such a lame way?

852
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,148
Just get out and do your job, punk.

853
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,736
Prosecutor Han was demoted
to the Chuncheon district office,

854
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,197
so the Kangchun case
has lost its direction.

855
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,032
You should take over.

856
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,202
I'm not interested
in what was once someone else's.

857
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,453
What am I, a beggar?

858
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,996
What did you say?

859
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,248
Help me with this.

860
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,211
-Hey!
-The sooner, the better.

861
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,727
Should I serve our guest
a cup of coffee or something?

862
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,187
What would you like, ma'am?

863
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,773
Do you not want anything to drink?

864
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,448
(chuckles)
I'll be outside.

865
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,167
(door closes)

866
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,045
Haesong must be watching you.

867
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,505
It's too late to play it safe.

868
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,841
I'm not afraid of dying.

869
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,427
What do you want?

870
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,055
Chairman Kwon kept you alive
for a reason, didn't he?

871
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,682
What is the reason?

872
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,852
It has nothing to do with you, Ms. Eun.

873
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,645
It'll have something to do with me now.

874
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,899
Does he want you to find the real Adamas?

875
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,614
So he does.

876
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,033
Do you know why

877
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,328
Chairman Kwon is trying
to find the Adamas?

878
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,167
He thinks the owner of Haesong
should have it.

879
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,877
It's such an old-fashioned idea.

880
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,756
As if it's a crown or a royal seal…
Isn't that ridiculous?

881
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,215
What is your point?

882
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,425
The Adamas.

883
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,471
Bring it to me.

884
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,599
Chairman Kwon said that

885
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,602
if you want to bargain with someone,
you need to offer what they want.

886
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,192
So do you plan to give him the Adamas?

887
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,611
No.

888
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,197
Are you curious?

889
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,991
What do you say?

890
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,286
Are you interested?

891
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,041
I'll give you what you want.

892
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,755
-What I want?
-Lee Changwoo.

893
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,594
Don't you want to save him?

894
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,229
Bring it to me.

895
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,255
(Changwoo sighs)

896
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,260
What brings you here this time?

897
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,513
I told you never to come again.

898
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,725
How have you been?

899
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,979
Well, forget about catching up.

900
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,982
I'll just get to the point.

901
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,653
I know

902
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,155
who you are.

903
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,533
What do you

904
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,370
know about me?

905
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,663
You know Team A, don't you?

906
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,625
A secret organization
that deals with dirty work for Haesong.

907
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,588
You were once a member of its predecessor,
the Management Support Team.

908
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,132
An ace at that.

909
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:49,677
The organization discarded you

910
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,138
by having you get arrested
for nine charges of theft,

911
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,016
and you were stuck in jail for 15 years.

912
01:04:56,475 --> 01:05:00,521
It's not that I want to hear an epic tale
about the great notorious thief.

913
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,191
(sighs)
What I want to know is…

914
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,444
WOOSIN: <i>Suhyeon.</i>

915
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,238
About our real father…

916
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:10,948
Our real father?

917
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,159
Yes, we never talked about it,

918
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:17,288
but you knew our biological father
was someone else, didn't you?

919
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,376
Yes, I eventually figured it out
as I grew up.

920
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,088
I happened to overhear
our parents' conversation too.

921
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,841
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

922
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,762
Mom left a message before she died.

923
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,224
-What do you mean?
-Lee Changwoo was falsely charged.

924
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,521
He is…

925
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,149
That man is…

926
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:48,903
Darn it.

927
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,741
…our biological father.

928
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,585
Prosecutor Song.

929
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,716
What is it that you want to know?

930
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,426
What was that?

931
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:22,144
Less than a month

932
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,605
after you finished serving 15 years
in prison,

933
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,567
you murdered my father.

934
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,030
(Changwoo sighs)

935
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,909
I really don't see
why we're back on this topic.

936
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,244
It's all over.

937
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,870
Because you're not the real culprit.

938
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,083
-Prosecutor.
-Because I must catch the real culprit.

939
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,086
-Prosecutor Song.
-Because I'll defend you from now on.

940
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,924
He's crazy.

941
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,175
CHIEF PROSECUTOR YANG WOOKJIN

942
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,176
Darn him!

943
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:59,056
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

944
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,475
Mr. Lee.

945
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,439
I am your defense attorney.

946
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,325
(closing theme music)

947
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,217
SUHYEON: <i>I'm going to make sure
that everyone knows you're innocent.</i>

948
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,305
How about working directly under me now?

949
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,724
DETECTIVE:
<i>The mastermind behind the terror bombing.</i>

950
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,435
<i>Was it Prosecutor Song</i>

951
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,895
<i>or Mr. Kang?</i>

952
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,940
HYUNJO: <i>I heard the SIH was making
an important announcement, so I came.</i>

953
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,901
Do you have time for this?

954
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,321
MS. OH: <i>What will happen to Ms. Kwon?</i>

955
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,073
HYESOO: <i>Please…</i>

956
01:07:58,991 --> 01:07:59,909
die.
