2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,973
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,373
Hello, sir.

4
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,202
Congratulations on your release.

5
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,708
Right.

6
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm Lee Junkyung.

7
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,593
Sir?

8
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,336
My name is Lee Junkyung.

9
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,431
Leave.

10
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,431
Sorry?

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,551
KANGCHUN PENITENTIARY BUS STOP

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,468
Sir.

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,973
There's something I need to tell--

14
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,857
Go tell the chairman

15
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,816
that I'll stay dead quiet as promised.

16
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,531
I kept the promise for 15 years

17
00:01:56,324 --> 00:02:00,544
so it's his turn to do the same.

18
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,086
I'm not here because the chairman sent me.

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,841
I would like to save you.

20
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,729
WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE DIAMOND ARROW
SOON TO BE UNVEILED

21
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,204
Diamond arrow?

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,042
I'm sure the notorious Lee Changwoo
will be able to pull this off.

23
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,334
Let me help you.

24
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,434
All right. Now, tell me.

25
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,181
Where did you hide it?

26
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,431
The Adamas.

27
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,305
You took it.

28
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,898
What's wrong? Did you lose it?

29
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,359
Enough with this act, god damn it.

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,860
Where did you hide it?

31
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,065
The real Adamas.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,570
Not the fake one.

33
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,454
I thought I was still alive
because I'm the only one

34
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,743
who knows where it is.

35
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,578
And now you want me to tell you?

36
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,174
You'd better stop playing around
and come clean.

37
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,674
If you don't want to sacrifice
your other son too.

38
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,835
Go ahead and see how I'll react.

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,425
All right, show me.

40
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,474
Show me what you can do from here.

41
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,018
Junkyung.

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,983
Chairman Kwon…

43
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,146
What?

44
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,029
You shouldn't have come here
to meet me today.

45
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,235
What is this about?

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,575
What about the chairman?

47
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
Do you think Chairman Kwon

48
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,177
has forgotten about me?

49
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,937
So you killed Song Suhyeon?

50
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,849
Did you check the body?

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,530
Then you should've brought a photo.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,070
Not this mere sheet of paper.

53
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,924
Bastard.

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,267
Mr. Jeong.

55
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,523
I'm changing orders.

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,035
Ms. Lee.

57
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,957
Ms. Kim…

58
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,094
Move.

59
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,215
Ms. Kim.

60
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,395
-Damn it.

61
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,026
What on earth?

62
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,751
Let me use your car.

63
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,388
Why does he suddenly want her alive?
How annoying.

64
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,532
Hi.

65
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,570
You are…

66
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,624
I'm what?

67
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,537
Sun?

68
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,460
You know my name?

69
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,841
Where are you? Where?

70
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,132
Where are you?

71
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,678
Who told you?

72
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,176
Song Suhyeon's alive, isn't he?

73
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,561
Damn it.

74
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,647
I'm going to mess you up.

75
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,070
Ms. Kim.

76
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,168
Ms. Kim was kidnapped.

77
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,302
We must go rescue her immediately.

78
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,546
Go where?

79
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,176
Ares.

80
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,756
Come back for now.

81
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,184
<i>I won't do that!</i>

82
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,392
If we take longer,
we'll only find her body later.

83
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,399
<i>What's gotten into you people anyway?</i>

84
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,694
<i>Are you just going to watch everyone die?</i>

85
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,322
<i>When will you stop tolerating
these meaningless sacrifices?</i>

86
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,862
You must be attacking them.
Why can't you stick to the basics?

87
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,035
Sir.

88
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,659
Go on.

89
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,714
Yes, sir.

90
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,710
Wait there. I'm on my way now.

91
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,532
I'm sorry,

92
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,568
Lieutenant Lee Hyunjung.

93
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,881
We have a breach at the main gate!

94
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,467
We have a breach!

95
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,973
Stop those cars!

96
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,182
Security!

97
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,857
Don't let them through.

98
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,659
We're done cleaning up the place.

99
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,712
Even if Team A knows, they won't be
able to find any trace of us.

100
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,997
-Good job.
-No problem, sir.

101
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,470
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

102
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,046
It's a trap.

103
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,890
MR. KANG

104
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,012
Sir, we're breaking through at the moment.

105
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,637
This wasn't their target.
If they meant to raid us,

106
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,515
-they would've brought a whole squad.
-Pardon?

107
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,651
They brought us in on purpose.
Get out of there now!

108
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,110
Prosecutor Song, stop!

109
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,375
Did you sleep well?

110
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,939
Get up, will you?

111
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,660
Do you want to run away?

112
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,253
I let you see my face

113
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,958
because I was going to kill you.

114
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,256
Why do you think
I brought you here alive instead?

115
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,510
What do you want from me?

116
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,353
We want a way into the SIH.

117
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,758
The infiltration team.

118
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,638
Show us the way.

119
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,976
You're wasting your time.

120
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,267
I'll never do that.

121
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,065
Thank goodness.

122
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I was worried you might say okay.

123
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,624
I won't kill you,

124
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,702
even if you beg me

125
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,078
to kill you.

126
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,846
Here is the list of guests.
-Mm.

127
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:17,017
They are VIPs from the publishing,
broadcasting, and political circles.

128
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,476
I wonder what you'd think of it.

129
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,946
You've selected 80 people
to go with the 80th anniversary?

130
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,028
You always emphasize

131
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,034
that everything should be
limited in number.

132
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,237
Only then would it hold meaning.

133
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,747
Good job.

134
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,291
Those who get invited will be so proud

135
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,174
while those who are left out

136
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,051
will try their best
to be included next time.

137
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,969
IM JINCHUL, ATTORNEY GENERAL

138
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,298
Take the Attorney General out.

139
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,894
We don't need him
once the administration changes.

140
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,806
Invite Mr. Ha instead.

141
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,225
You mean the writer?

142
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,939
My memoir will be presented
during the ceremony.

143
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,895
I should treat him at least once.

144
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,276
By the way, the tree in the garden.

145
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,689
Yes, master.

146
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,147
Why did you suddenly cut it?

147
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,824
I kind of grew attached to it
since it was there for a long time.

148
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,912
You know Chungwoon, right?
The famous topography fortune teller.

149
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,913
-Yes,
-According to him,

150
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,127
that tree was standing
in the way of great fortune.

151
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,038
It wasn't doing any good for you, master.

152
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,420
So I…

153
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,423
Good job.

154
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,048
Anything with a bad energy
must be eliminated,

155
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,894
no matter how long it has kept your side

156
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,262
or how much you've cherished it.

157
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,734
Yes, of course.

158
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,692
This is incredible.

159
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,653
You were invited after all.

160
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,566
Right, it was worth
writing the memoir all night.

161
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,236
By the way,

162
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,410
stealing the Adamas is one thing,

163
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,254
but will we be able to run away
with it safely from this house?

164
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,628
Hmm… Run away?

165
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,585
If we get caught, we'll be doomed.

166
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,589
That is

167
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,296
up to the heavens.

168
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,621
Hello, this is Security.

169
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,247
Today?

170
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,295
I see.

171
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,009
Okay.

172
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,047
What is it?

173
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,471
The head office called.

174
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,268
Do you know where Mr. Choi is?

175
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,189
Well, he went downstairs a while ago.

176
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,435
What did the head office want?

177
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:14,033
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

178
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,158
Oh, Mr. Choi.

179
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,714
You can sit back down
and keep doing your work.

180
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,919
Is there anything particular?

181
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,329
No, nothing.

182
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,633
You look tired.

183
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,674
Go outside for a cigarette.

184
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,679
I'm okay, sir. It's working hours.

185
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,510
Smoking is best during working hours.

186
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,143
Step outside for a moment. I'll stay.

187
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,015
Okay, then.

188
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,858
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

189
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,078
Section Seven.

190
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,373
Nothing seemed off when I went there.

191
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,809
This is me.

192
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,692
It's someone who came afterward.

193
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,378
Mr. Choi?

194
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,129
What?

195
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,260
Oh, Mr. Lee isn't loafing around.

196
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,636
I let him step outside for a bit.

197
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,642
To smoke.

198
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,888
Don't keep him on a tight leash.

199
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,991
<i>Mr. Lee killed her.</i>

200
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,164
I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house.

201
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,451
Okay.

202
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,208
What do you think? Do you like it?

203
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,168
What?

204
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,167
Yes, it's nice.

205
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,918
Then will you choose this--

206
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,718
No, I prefer the one from the other day.

207
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,431
Oh, you rejected that one
so we showed it to someone else.

208
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,481
She's trying it on now.

209
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,772
Really? I guess it can't be helped then.

210
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,475
The truth is…

211
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,401
You look beautiful.

212
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,382
How pretty. It looks good on you.

213
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,340
But it's a little too long
for you, Ms. Yoon.

214
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,013
-Ms. Cho.
-Yes, ma'am?

215
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,299
Cut off about two hems' length.

216
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,720
Well… Sure thing.

217
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,853
Forget it. I should be
thanking you instead.

218
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,305
I'm so grateful
that my husband has you by his side.

219
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,565
You're not showing any reaction again.

220
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,323
Others might think
I'm looking down on you.

221
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,083
When it's actually the other way around.

222
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,827
You are getting a call.
I think it's urgent.

223
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,626
A person named Mr. Jeong
keeps calling you.

224
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,054
MR. JEONG

225
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,351
See you around.

226
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,947
MR. JEONG

227
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,485
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

228
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,825
Darn it.

229
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,834
Goodness.

230
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,707
This was taken
in the parking lot of the Ares building.

231
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,134
And this is the dashcam footage
near the atelier yesterday…

232
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,338
I apologize, sir.

233
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,846
Do a better job, Mr. Cha.

234
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,558
Do you hear me?

235
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,641
Yes, sir.

236
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,191
Stand by at your houses
for the time being.

237
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,725
And send in the elites. Now get out.

238
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,277
I'm not done analyzing--

239
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,029
I said get out. I'll take care of it.

240
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,324
Just wrap up Ms. Jang's incident smoothly.

241
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,906
Yes, sir.

242
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,103
Did you lose them or let them go?

243
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,767
Cut the crap.

244
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,357
Let me see.

245
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,278
Look. Song Suhyeon is limping.

246
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,610
Kim Seohee is barely supporting him
as they run away.

247
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,703
And you couldn't get them?

248
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,080
Jeez.

249
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,738
Where did they disappear to?

250
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,617
To the sky? Or underground?

251
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,042
Jeez.

252
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,003
I wouldn't have to go through this mess
if you'd taken care of him properly.

253
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,723
You're right about that.

254
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,639
That witch.

255
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,484
DELETE

256
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,901
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS FILE?

257
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,111
Things aren't looking good.

258
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,071
Shouldn't you let me know what's going on?

259
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,283
I already told you everything yesterday.
Do you need another explanation?

260
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,825
Someone suddenly jumped
in front of my car…

261
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,420
<i>and they seemed injured,
so I ended up giving them a ride.</i>

262
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,789
But they asked me
to let them off on the way so I did.

263
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,126
Report it to the higher-ups.

264
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,671
How can I report something like that?

265
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,965
I would have to explain why you were there

266
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,469
and who leaked the information.

267
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,601
I went to get jewelry done
and I needed Ms. Jang.

268
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,756
That's why you looked into it for me.

269
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,138
Is that so difficult?

270
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,602
It's a trivial matter

271
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,515
but I'm suggesting we cover it up
because you seem uncomfortable about it.

272
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,774
It's not as simple as it sounds.

273
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,527
<i>I may have been able
to take care of the footage,</i>

274
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,069
<i>but this isn't as simple as
asking me to find</i>

275
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,994
the person who suggested the ghostwriter.

276
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,908
Team A is deeply involved in this case.

277
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,288
That has nothing to do with me.

278
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,328
Since when were you doing me a favor?

279
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,875
It was all for your benefit.

280
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,048
<i>I'm telling you to cover this up
for your benefit as well. And…</i>

281
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,971
make this the last time you call me first.

282
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,295
I understand.

283
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,345
<i>I just can't wrap my head around it.</i>

284
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,848
Just what exactly is happening
that you're making all this fuss?

285
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,602
Ms. Hyesoo.

286
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,516
The helicopter is here.

287
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,607
I won't be needing it.

288
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,863
I'm staying here for the time being.

289
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,663
What?

290
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,536
The satellite phone disappeared?

291
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,871
It was Mr. Kim's doing.

292
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,504
-Mr. Kim?
-I'm sure of it.

293
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,043
He was suspicious from the start,

294
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,296
saying he was a fan
and trying to get friendly with you.

295
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,458
Are you sure? Why would he do that?

296
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,798
I checked the serial number.

297
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,473
The SIH sent me here undercover.

298
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,551
They can do exactly the same.

299
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,220
Calm down, Mr. Choi.

300
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,894
I'll try to talk to him.

301
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,181
What will you do?

302
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,847
Give him your autograph
and ask if he's undercover?

303
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,105
The briefcase is locked
with the infiltration team's PIN code,

304
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,531
so he won't know what's in it for now.

305
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,450
But he will find the satellite phone soon.

306
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,699
And he will figure out
whom I've been communicating with.

307
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,411
We have to be careful.

308
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,366
If it wasn't Mr. Kim,
the situation will worsen.

309
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,212
<i>Mr. Choi, someone
from the head office is here.</i>

310
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,789
<i>He's entering the parking lot.</i>

311
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,968
Why would someone suddenly come
from the head office?

312
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,678
Mr. Kim received a call earlier.

313
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,139
Did he not report it to you?

314
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,489
Okay.

315
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,874
You still don't think it's him?

316
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,079
How exactly do you want to be careful?

317
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
What will you do?

318
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,119
I'll risk bloodshed if I must.
There's no time to waste!

319
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,577
Mr. Choi.

320
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,416
Meet the visitor first.

321
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,507
I'll look for Mr. Kim.

322
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,430
We must stop the two
from meeting each other.

323
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,360
<i>Go to the west section.</i>

324
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,608
<i>He must be patrolling the area.</i>

325
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,503
HAESONG

326
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,539
VISITORS LOG

327
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,011
You must sign the log
before entering the building.

328
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,835
Mr. Choi, everything seems fine.

329
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,847
What exactly is broken?

330
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,473
Where is the briefcase?

331
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,770
Excuse me?

332
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,613
Section Seven.

333
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,398
Oh, the thing is…

334
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,707
Mr. Choi, why are you doing this?

335
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,079
Where is the briefcase?

336
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,966
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

337
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,218
Well…

338
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,850
I know you were there.

339
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,639
You took it!

340
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,183
-No, I--
-I checked it all, you bastard.

341
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,372
Where is the briefcase?

342
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,038
Say it, you punk.

343
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,242
Come clean if you want to spare yourself.

344
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,503
I…

345
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,705
I really didn't take it.

346
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,214
I just saw it there.

347
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,502
What?

348
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,922
I got curious
about why you went there often

349
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,835
and tried to check the place out.

350
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,255
But I left it there.

351
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,342
I didn't even touch it.

352
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,684
Wait a second.

353
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,273
If it wasn't you…

354
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,879
Mr. Choi!

355
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,255
Mr. Kim?

356
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,766
Don't make a fuss. He just passed out.

357
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,479
Did he admit it?

358
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,099
He wouldn't admit it this easily.

359
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,061
What if it wasn't him?

360
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,815
Then who did the guy from the head office
come to visit?

361
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,111
Okay. Please come this way.

362
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,737
JANG EUIDON

363
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,326
MEETING WITH MS. KWON

364
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,839
You came on time.

365
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,588
How have you been, Ms. Kwon?

366
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,304
I've been all right.

367
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,104
Is the work bearable?

368
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,724
Yes, thanks to you.

369
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,096
About the invitations for the ceremony,

370
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,726
I think they should be delivered
in person to meet the formality.

371
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,114
I called you in to help out.

372
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,032
Oh, did you do what I instructed?

373
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,821
Yes, I have it ready.

374
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,759
So you need to figure out
why that man is here.

375
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,053
Let me make this clear.

376
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,970
My team has put years of effort
into this operation.

377
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,926
I can't let it go to waste
because of this rat.

378
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,936
If your guess turns out to be right,

379
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
it will ruin
more than just the SIH's plan.

380
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,784
Hurry and meet the guy
from the head office first.

381
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,534
Mr. Kim?

382
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,539
Are you looking for this?

383
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,379
Mr. Park.

384
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,763
What are you doing here, Mr. Ha?

385
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,507
Are you in league with each other?

386
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,441
What is going on, Mr. Choi?

387
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,737
What about you?

388
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,858
Why do you have that briefcase?

389
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,698
Oh, I wondered whose this was.

390
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,794
Give it to me.

391
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,905
You need to tell me what's going on first.

392
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,246
-You little…
-Mr. Choi.

393
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,129
Opium.

394
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,537
Opium?

395
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,421
That's what's in it.

396
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,564
We're trying to sneak away
those poppies in the garden.

397
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,350
Do you want to join us?

398
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,399
In exchange for my silence?

399
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,439
It won't be a losing deal for you.

400
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,398
It's quite tempting, I must say.

401
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,492
So, you two are like business partners.

402
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,281
What about him though?
Why did you beat him up?

403
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,276
It was my mistake.

404
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,038
The briefcase had disappeared,

405
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,659
and I thought Mr. Kim took it
so he could have it all to himself.

406
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,710
I gave him a beating.

407
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,038
-I see.
-So, are you in?

408
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,705
This will get you a hefty sum.

409
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,720
Fine.

410
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,678
Now let's open it and check.

411
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,274
What's with this mood? I knew it.

412
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,516
Opium was a lie, wasn't it?

413
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,322
Just what is in this briefcase?

414
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,987
-Give it to me.
-Oh.

415
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,953
You might even kill me if I don't.

416
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,126
Mr. Choi.

417
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,842
Mr. Choi.

418
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,125
You people are

419
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,755
with the SIH, aren't you?

420
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,028
What a life he has.

421
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,003
Did you ask for me?

422
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,129
What happened to Ms. Jang.
Was it your doing?

423
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,757
Yes, sir.

424
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,559
It seemed she spread word
about the Adamas, so for security…

425
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,272
I see.

426
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,396
I understand,

427
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,899
but you should've at least
reported it to me afterward.

428
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,032
Did you have to make me summon you?

429
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,986
I apologize, sir. It's my mistake.

430
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,280
What else is there?

431
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,453
Pardon?

432
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,952
Is there anything else
you didn't let me know?

433
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,413
There's nothing else.

434
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,790
Junkyung.

435
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,123
Yes, sir.

436
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,593
We've known each other for a long time.

437
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,673
I wasn't always so fond of you.

438
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,884
At times, I thought of casting you away,

439
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,795
but when the Adamas was stolen,

440
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,965
you managed to retrieve it.

441
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,016
I've been easy on you for that.

442
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,641
But how long

443
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,364
do you think that'll last?

444
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,612
Sir, I'm not quite following you--

445
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,074
I know you met Lee Changwoo.

446
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,000
You shouldn't have come here
to meet me today.

447
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,288
<i>Do you think</i>

448
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,424
Chairman Kwon has forgotten about me?

449
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,588
Yes, I met him.

450
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,466
I wanted to figure out
how the SIH ended up getting involved

451
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,681
with Song Suhyeon.

452
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,765
I met him to check if the SIH

453
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,941
had made contact with him.

454
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,729
I didn't report it to you
because I didn't find any trace.

455
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,193
That's all, sir.

456
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,995
<i>If I dodge, I'll be dead.</i>

457
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,416
<i>This is bait.</i>

458
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,755
Mr. Choi.

459
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,590
Who are you? What's your identity?

460
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,296
The SIH.

461
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,095
What?

462
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,682
I'm with the SIH too!

463
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,965
I got some nice dried persimmons.
You can have a taste of them.

464
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,679
Thank you, sir.

465
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,024
Maybe I got the wrong fishing spot.

466
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,563
It's not going so well.

467
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,770
Nothing's biting here.

468
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,374
Don't try to pull a trick.

469
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,541
The infiltration teams
don't know each other.

470
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,159
Did you think you were undercover alone?

471
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,786
I also thought this was a solo mission.

472
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,424
Prove it then. Open this briefcase.

473
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,709
You'd know the PIN code
if you're on the infiltration team.

474
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,366
Nice job fooling me
all this time, you bastard.

475
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,043
You should've told me.
I almost killed you for real.

476
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,712
Whatever. Just tell me what you'll do now.

477
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,995
-What?
-Him.

478
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,673
What will you do about Mr. Kim?

479
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,513
You know the infiltration team's protocol
for when your cover is blown.

480
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,805
There's no need to kill him.

481
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,266
What are you saying?

482
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,099
He doesn't even know what's in here.

483
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,604
We'll just say

484
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,731
that it's opium.

485
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,983
What if he doesn't buy it?

486
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,529
Are you suggesting
we gamble with our lives? How generous.

487
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,861
If things go south, it won't be just us.

488
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,525
The organization itself
could be in danger!

489
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,283
Then what? Are you saying
we should kill him for real?

490
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,541
Of course. We must.

491
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,956
Are you really from the SIH?

492
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,424
You little…

493
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,577
Should I do it?

494
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,748
I'll do it.

495
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,465
Once he wakes up,
he won't remember anything.

496
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,011
There's no need to kill him.

497
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,224
Maybe the SIH kills off the innocent

498
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,056
as if it's no big deal,

499
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,810
but I'm not one of you.

500
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,436
I won't just sit back and watch it happen.

501
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,060
What is this now?

502
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,771
You're not from the SIH?

503
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,736
It's a long story.

504
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,863
He's cooperating with our operation.

505
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,907
Jeez, I can't get used to this.

506
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,202
A civilian is involved
in the SIH's operation,

507
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,286
and you people are all talk. What a mess!

508
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,709
Whatever. Leave this place, both of you.

509
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,292
I'll take care of the situation.

510
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,552
Mr. Ha.

511
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,132
What is going on?

512
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,869
-Move.
-I won't.

513
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,538
Move.

514
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,159
No.

515
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,233
What are you up to now?

516
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,236
You never stay at my house for no reason.

517
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,736
It's because of the chairman.

518
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,827
He's looking forward to a grandchild

519
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,750
so I have to at least
make him think that we're trying.

520
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,329
Put up with me just until the ceremony.

521
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,580
It's not like I like being here either.

522
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,339
As expected.

523
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,009
You really are the lady of the house.

524
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,802
The more I look at you,

525
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,807
the more you resemble my father.

526
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,650
You're both cold, cruel,
and impossible to read.

527
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,978
Right.

528
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,903
And you both dearly loved Minjo.

529
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,856
Dearly loved Minjo?

530
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,318
The chairman did?

531
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,236
Then I wonder why he did that.

532
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,950
What are you talking about?

533
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,246
The helicopter accident.

534
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,251
What about that?

535
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,719
I wonder why he spared

536
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,638
the people who were involved
in the accident.

537
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,596
When they were responsible
for the death of his dearly beloved son.

538
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,767
So?

539
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,319
What are you getting at?

540
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,518
What am I getting at?

541
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,861
What I'm saying is that…

542
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,196
the chairman…

543
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,167
never really loved Minjo.

544
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,627
You're right.

545
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,755
Gosh, I like what you're getting at.

546
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,319
<i>Thank you, Mr. Jeong.</i>

547
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,494
No problem. I can do this much
of an errand for you.

548
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,700
It took me quite a lot of effort

549
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,365
because there weren't many materials.

550
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,210
Haesong took control of the situation,

551
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,629
so a lot of people
still don't know about his death.

552
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,129
ARES HELICOPTER CRASH

553
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,801
APRIL 1, 2017

554
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,379
How did this happen?

555
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,930
Everyone related to the accident…

556
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,103
Yes, they were only briefly investigated

557
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,508
and there was no real punishment.

558
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,175
If it really was an accident,

559
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,443
he wouldn't have kept them alive.

560
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,988
Hello, this is Haesongwon.

561
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,920
7 P.M., APRIL 23, 2022
BANQUET HALL IN HAESONGWON

562
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,342
WE'RE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU
TO THE 80TH FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

563
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,047
SONG

564
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,506
Right, the writer's real surname is Song.

565
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,022
Ms. Kwon.

566
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,150
What's with that face?
Did someone die or something?

567
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,307
Did you know?

568
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,519
What are you talking about?

569
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,525
Mr. Kim

570
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,571
is dead.

571
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,493
What?

572
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,196
Unbelievable!

573
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,951
It was acute drug intoxication.

574
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,116
It seems he stole some poppies
from the garden.

575
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,253
Right before the ceremony? How dare he!

576
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,459
How do you want me to handle this?

577
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,844
Isn't it obvious? Cover it up!

578
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,141
DEATH CERTIFICATE

579
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:06,933
Thank you.

580
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,283
<i>As expected, Ms. Kwon wants it buried.</i>

581
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,692
<i>Since the poppies were
from the Haesongwon garden.</i>

582
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,083
<i>Mr. Choi.</i>

583
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,085
<i>What happened to Mr. Kim
will remain a secret between us.</i>

584
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,958
<i>Stop it, you crazy bastard.</i>

585
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,881
<i>Are you really going to kill
an innocent person?</i>

586
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,550
<i>Stop messing around. Let go of me.</i>

587
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,712
<i>I said let go of me, damn it!</i>

588
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
<i>Are you going to ignore protocol?</i>

589
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,178
<i>We have to kill him!</i>

590
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,697
The external cause of the accident
is the poor safety management of bombs.

591
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,660
But it's still under police investigation.

592
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,991
No evidence remains.

593
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,246
I ordered our men to analyze
the CCTV camera footage nearby,

594
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,709
but we got nothing from it.

595
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,541
Team A probably utilized
the clear-out team.

596
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,585
Close the underpass to the safe house,
and have the vigilance team stand by.

597
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,919
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,379
Do you think Ms. Kim is okay?

599
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,763
If they'd killed her,
they would've sent her body to us.

600
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,224
We've done all we can.

601
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,933
Right.

602
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,271
Now let's wait for their move.

603
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,411
The trial run was successful.

604
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,123
It will have enough power to kill
in actual warfare.

605
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,116
What do you think of it?

606
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,917
Now you're trying to interview me?

607
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,134
Hey, did you make me come over
just so I could watch some show?

608
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,880
Did the heat get to you?

609
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:33,971
Sir.

610
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,184
It better be something serious,
or I'll be pissed.

611
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,192
Song Suhyeon is alive.

612
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,232
What do you think you're doing?

613
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,896
I ordered you
to take care of Song Suhyeon,

614
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,857
and you said he was taken care of.

615
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,117
So he shouldn't be alive, should he?

616
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,489
No.

617
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,121
And?

618
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:03,334
Getting rid of Song Suhyeon
won't solve the situation.

619
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,287
We must stack the deck

620
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,127
and eliminate everyone including the SIH.

621
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,545
Please take a look at the scenario first.

622
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,306
"H-File?"

623
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,642
H-FILE

624
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,766
If it's not good,
I'll smash your head first.

625
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,239
A terrorist bombing?

626
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,407
D-day is that day.

627
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,001
Wow, you are a lunatic.

628
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,996
Will you be able to smooth it over?

629
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,717
After the upcoming presidential election,
Haesong will take full control anyway.

630
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,469
We'll manipulate the media a little

631
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,091
and investigate it after seizing power.

632
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,308
And to eliminate the opponents
at the same time,

633
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,193
you will accuse them
of pulling the strings?

634
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,689
A thorough housecleaning.

635
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,694
That's right. We'll say they are
a radical terrorist group

636
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,614
who is unhappy with the regime change
and plans to take over the new government.

637
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,158
That will create a scare.

638
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:20,327
If we take this mood
all the way to legalizing firearms…

639
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,535
That'd be a blockbuster.

640
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,089
Look at you.

641
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,547
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,131
You brought it to me
because my father wouldn't allow it, no?

643
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,640
-I apologize.
-You fool.

644
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,482
So who's going to take the bullet?

645
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,476
Kim Seohee.

646
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,683
Hey.

647
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,602
Hey!

648
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,435
Take it easy, or at least gag her.

649
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,323
Why? I like hearing it.

650
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,611
You crazy witch.

651
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,816
Hey, Jeong.

652
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,315
"Hey, Jeong"?

653
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,999
Show some respect,
or you'll be taught a lesson.

654
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:01,296
Mr. Lee went to meet Mr. Kwon.

655
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,759
With Mr. Cha.

656
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,888
Between me and you,

657
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,017
who will be taught a lesson first?

658
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,363
That trap of yours
will end up ruining your life.

659
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,363
I guarantee it.

660
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,554
Stop it.

661
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,347
I don't know anything about the SIH.

662
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,306
You don't?

663
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,933
No.

664
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,476
Listen carefully. This is important.

665
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,324
We're going to blow up the SIH with bombs.

666
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,277
You can do it, right?

667
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,991
What?

668
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,953
You're going to carry the bombs.

669
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,828
I won't do it.

670
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,126
Want to make a bet?

671
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,706
<i>Reporter Kim Seohee…</i>

672
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,180
They must've taken her alive for a reason.

673
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,719
They're up to something.

674
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,552
Should we set up a task force?

675
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,847
No, let's stick to our plan.

676
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,809
The ceremony is coming up soon.

677
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,388
Yes, sir.

678
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,532
Our objective is as follows.

679
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,325
Before the Adamas is moved
to the ceremony hall…

680
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,872
<i>You took three days
just to come to that conclusion?</i>

681
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,746
That you can't find Kim Seohee
unless they make a move?

682
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,964
Is that why
you're sitting back and waiting?

683
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,205
You should locate Mr. Lee.

684
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,959
You should've raided
Haesong's main office!

685
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,473
Our operation takes place today.
We must secure the Adamas.

686
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,894
Mr. Ha will be arrested red-handed.

687
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,931
While everyone's watching,
so that Chairman Kwon can't do anything.

688
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,440
The Adamas will become evidence.

689
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,349
Once we reveal that it was used
for the murder,

690
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,194
an arrest warrant will be issued.

691
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,652
Mr. Ha agreed to this.

692
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,193
What about Kim Seohee? Did she agree?

693
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,028
That you should catch Chairman Kwon
whether she ends up dying or not?

694
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,912
What about Ms. Lee? What about Mr. Baek?

695
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,214
Hey, Song.

696
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,580
I'm not asking for your approval here.

697
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:06,165
I'm warning you not to cause a mess
by meddling in our operation, you bastard.

698
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,215
The sense of justice you seek.

699
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,933
The sense of revenge.

700
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,635
That's not enough to catch Kwon Jaekyu.

701
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,721
Okay.

702
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,810
Fine.

703
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,349
Let's go our separate ways.

704
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,148
You don't care about saving people.

705
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,150
And I refuse to risk my life
for your ridiculous plan.

706
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,396
You have no more reason to keep me anyway.

707
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,293
Damn it.

708
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,328
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

709
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,632
Who?

710
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,089
Designer Patti Jang?

711
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,258
Her suicide case
and the other cases I mentioned just now.

712
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,764
Gather all the materials for me.

713
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,805
I'm on my way to work. Bye.

714
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,997
DEAR MR. SONG SUHYEON

715
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,133
WE'RE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU
TO THE 80TH FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

716
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,675
Thank you. You may enter.

717
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,366
Welcome, Candidate Noh.

718
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,334
Long time no see, Ms. Kwon.

719
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,253
You didn't come
to my presidential candidacy ceremony.

720
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,252
Right, it's been a while.

721
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,464
But I'm always acquainted with your news.

722
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,705
You've been receiving
the highest approvals rating.

723
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,967
Thanks to you.

724
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,677
But Candidate Hwang
is chasing right behind me.

725
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,263
That makes me feel bad.

726
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:23,894
I wonder if he's got
the chairman's support.

727
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,811
Of course not.

728
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,855
If that were the case,
Hwang would be here.

729
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,607
Don't worry, and please come inside.

730
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,153
Sure.

731
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,907
You even invited the press.

732
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,411
Is it going to be okay, ma'am?

733
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,663
Yes, we should spread the news
far and wide.

734
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,214
A happy occasion like this
won't come again.

735
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,382
Mr. Ha, did you see? Those from
broadcasting stations are here too.

736
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,139
What an honor.

737
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,929
The sight of me getting arrested
will be broadcast nationally.

738
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,806
And thanks to it, Haesong won't
have a reason to oppose

739
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,891
even if the Adamas gets taken as evidence.

740
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,981
You're right about that,
but is it really going to be okay?

741
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,515
Yes, I told you so.

742
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,398
I'm talking about myself.

743
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,284
Will I be able to pull it off?

744
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,657
Just be your normal self.

745
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,029
It may seem easy,
but tripping naturally isn't…

746
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,793
It's not easy. Jeez, it hurts.

747
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,252
Yet you pull it off every day.

748
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,713
I know you can do it.

749
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,920
Dongrim.

750
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,222
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

751
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:42,305
This is why I tell you all the time
that there's no pupil like me.

752
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,886
We're like salt and pepper.

753
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,527
Oh, congratulations.
Congratulations.

754
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,388
MY PATH

755
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,191
MY PATH

756
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,276
Excuse me.

757
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,989
<i>My Path.</i>

758
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,423
Isn't it old-fashioned?

759
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,253
To put it nicely, it's classic.

760
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,879
Are you the ghostwriter?

761
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,384
Yes, I'm Ha Woosin.

762
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,394
Who are you?

763
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,679
Do you not know me?

764
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,141
Are you someone I should know?

765
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,597
Well…

766
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,977
You two have met.

767
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:15,984
Let me introduce you.

768
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,106
-This is--
-I'm her husband.

769
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,737
Oh, you are President Kwon Hyunjo.

770
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,412
I've heard a lot about you.

771
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,533
Really?

772
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,905
I wonder what you have heard.

773
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,923
The facts.

774
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,127
He interviewed me for the memoir.

775
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,711
I see.

776
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,545
I know we've never met before,

777
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,585
but you look so familiar.

778
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,348
Really? I don't have
a typical face though.

779
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,425
Ah.

780
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,811
I didn't expect to see you here.

781
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,228
Gratefully enough,
the chairman invited me.

782
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,976
I see, my father invited you.

783
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,401
He went overboard. You must feel uneasy
to join an occasion like this.

784
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,778
Not at all. I was born
to enjoy this kind of occasion.

785
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,788
Really?

786
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,909
You don't look like the type
who'd snoop around a party.

787
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,957
Candidate Noh has been
looking for you outside the hall.

788
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,383
Excuse me then.

789
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,888
I guess he didn't think the chairman
would invite me, considering his reaction.

790
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,646
He must feel neglected.

791
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,897
Or maybe he feels jealous.

792
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,610
-Of me?
-Oh, right.

793
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,989
I found out

794
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,914
whom you're working with.

795
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,866
Pardon?

796
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,002
The Special Investigations Headquarters.

797
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,627
Get out. Now.

798
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,059
-Ms. Eun.
-Don't show me that face.

799
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,482
I may be

800
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,484
able to offer some help.

801
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,068
Don't change the subject,
and say what you want to say.

802
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,320
Kim Seohee.

803
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,704
You know

804
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,105
that reporter, right? The witness.

805
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,290
What on earth

806
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,791
is this about?

807
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,377
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

808
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:21,636
<i>Now, we will reveal the Adamas.</i>

809
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,980
<i>You're going to carry the bomb.</i>

810
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,943
