(theme music)

2
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,474
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:00,976
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,371
Hello, sir.

5
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,208
Congratulations on your release.

6
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:25,709
Right.

7
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,712
I'm Lee Junkyung.

8
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:32,591
Sir?

9
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,344
My name is Lee Junkyung.

10
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,429
Leave.

11
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:39,431
Sorry?

12
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,558
KANGCHUN PENITENTIARY BUS STOP

13
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:42,476
Sir.

14
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,978
There's something I need to tell--

15
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,730
(gasps, groans)

16
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,862
Go tell the chairman

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,825
that I'll stay dead quiet as promised.

18
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,536
I kept the promise for 15 years

19
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:05,541
so it's his turn to do the same.

20
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,047
(groans in pain)

21
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,257
(sighs)

22
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,094
I'm not here because the chairman sent me.

23
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,848
I would like to save you.

24
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,738
WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE DIAMOND ARROW
SOON TO BE UNVEILED

25
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,200
Diamond arrow?

26
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm sure the notorious Lee Changwoo
will be able to pull this off.

27
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,336
Let me help you.

28
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:02,431
All right. Now, tell me.

29
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,184
Where did you hide it?

30
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,436
The Adamas.

31
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,313
You took it.

32
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,900
What's wrong? Did you lose it?

33
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,360
Enough with this act, god damn it.

34
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:16,862
Where did you hide it?

35
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,072
The real Adamas.

36
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,575
Not the fake one.

37
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:25,454
I thought I was still alive
because I'm the only one

38
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,748
who knows where it is.

39
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,585
And now you want me to tell you?

40
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,172
You'd better stop playing around
and come clean.

41
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,675
If you don't want to sacrifice
your other son too.

42
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,845
Go ahead and see how I'll react.

43
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:42,804
(scoffs)

44
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,432
All right, show me.

45
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,476
Show me what you can do from here.

46
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:50,020
Junkyung.

47
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,981
Chairman Kwon…

48
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,151
What?

49
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,446
(sighs)

50
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,115
(smacks lips)

51
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:06,036
You shouldn't have come here
to meet me today.

52
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,246
What is this about?

53
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,583
What about the chairman?

54
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,258
Do you think Chairman Kwon

55
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,179
has forgotten about me?

56
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,940
So you killed Song Suhyeon?

57
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:36,858
Did you check the body?

58
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,530
Then you should've brought a photo.

59
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:48,078
Not this mere sheet of paper.

60
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,045
(door closes)

61
00:04:58,547 --> 00:04:59,548
(sighs)

62
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,927
Bastard.

63
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,018
(sighs)

64
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,270
Mr. Jeong.

65
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,522
I'm changing orders.

66
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,454
(Suhyeon gasps)

67
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,040
Ms. Lee.

68
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,959
Ms. Kim…

69
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,586
(clatters)

70
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,089
Move.

71
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,221
Ms. Kim.

72
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:52,809
(panting)

73
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,399
-(tires screech)
-Damn it.

74
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,035
What on earth?

75
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:15,749
Let me use your car.

76
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:28,637
(car revving)

77
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,162
(revving continues)

78
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:56,391
Why does he suddenly want her alive?
How annoying.

79
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:01,062
(whistles)

80
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,691
(whistling continues)

81
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,530
Hi.

82
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:13,575
You are…

83
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,623
I'm what?

84
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,542
Sun?

85
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,464
You know my name?

86
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,844
Where are you? Where?

87
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,137
Where are you?

88
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,681
Who told you?

89
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,185
Song Suhyeon's alive, isn't he?

90
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,188
(gasps, exclaims)

91
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:45,565
Damn it.

92
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,656
SUHYEON: I'm going to mess you up.

93
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,201
(pants)

94
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,296
(loud grunt)

95
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,674
(gasps)

96
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,474
(coughing)

97
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,231
(coughing continues)

98
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,238
(clears throat, panting)

99
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,073
Ms. Kim.

100
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,867
(panting continues)

101
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,461
(phone dialing)

102
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,173
Ms. Kim was kidnapped.

103
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,301
We must go rescue her immediately.

104
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,553
Go where?

105
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,179
Ares.

106
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,764
Come back for now.

107
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:01,182
SUHYEON: <i>I won't do that!</i>

108
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:05,395
If we take longer,
we'll only find her body later.

109
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:09,399
SUHYEON:
<i>What's gotten into you people anyway?</i>

110
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,693
<i>Are you just going to watch everyone die?</i>

111
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:15,322
<i>When will you stop tolerating
these meaningless sacrifices?</i>

112
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,867
You must be attacking them.
Why can't you stick to the basics?

113
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,040
Sir.

114
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,667
Go on.

115
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:29,711
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,714
Wait there. I'm on my way now.

117
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,970
(panting)

118
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,530
I'm sorry,

119
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:00,575
Lieutenant Lee Hyunjung.

120
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,888
MAN 1: We have a breach at the main gate!

121
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,473
We have a breach!

122
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:24,974
MAN 2: Stop those cars!

123
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:28,186
MAN 1: Security!

124
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,647
(tires screech)

125
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,860
MAN 3: Don't let them through.

126
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,666
We're done cleaning up the place.

127
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,711
Even if Team A knows, they won't be
able to find any trace of us.

128
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:55,004
-Good job.
-No problem, sir.

129
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,469
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

130
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,054
It's a trap.

131
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:04,681
(car beeping)

132
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:05,890
MR. KANG

133
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,017
Sir, we're breaking through at the moment.

134
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,645
This wasn't their target.
If they meant to raid us,

135
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,522
-they would've brought a whole squad.
-Pardon?

136
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,649
They brought us in on purpose.
Get out of there now!

137
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:19,863
(horn honking)

138
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:21,531
(tires screech)

139
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,116
MR. HAN: Prosecutor Song, stop!

140
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,535
(honking continues)

141
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,458
(panting)

142
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,625
(grunts)

143
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,051
(Sun humming)

144
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,388
Did you sleep well?

145
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:57,942
Get up, will you?

146
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:00,737
(gasps)

147
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:04,783
(breathing heavily)

148
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,663
Do you want to run away?

149
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,252
I let you see my face

150
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:18,963
because I was going to kill you.

151
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,260
Why do you think
I brought you here alive instead?

152
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,514
What do you want from me?

153
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,349
We want a way into the SIH.

154
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,768
The infiltration team.

155
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,647
Show us the way.

156
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,981
You're wasting your time.

157
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,275
I'll never do that.

158
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,070
(sighs)
Thank goodness.

159
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:47,367
I was worried you might say okay.

160
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,623
I won't kill you,

161
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,708
even if you beg me

162
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,085
to kill you.

163
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,855
-MS. KWON: Here is the list of guests.
-Mm.

164
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:22,026
They are VIPs from the publishing,
broadcasting, and political circles.

165
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,486
I wonder what you'd think of it.

166
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,949
You've selected 80 people
to go with the 80th anniversary?

167
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,034
You always emphasize

168
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:33,037
that everything should be
limited in number.

169
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,248
Only then would it hold meaning.

170
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:36,749
Good job.

171
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,295
Those who get invited will be so proud

172
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,171
while those who are left out

173
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:45,049
will try their best
to be included next time.

174
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:47,969
IM JINCHUL, ATTORNEY GENERAL

175
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,304
KWON: Take the Attorney General out.

176
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,890
We don't need him
once the administration changes.

177
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,809
Invite Mr. Ha instead.

178
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,229
You mean the writer?

179
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,940
My memoir will be presented
during the ceremony.

180
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,901
I should treat him at least once.

181
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,280
By the way, the tree in the garden.

182
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:08,698
Yes, master.

183
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,158
Why did you suddenly cut it?

184
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,828
I kind of grew attached to it
since it was there for a long time.

185
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,916
You know Chungwoon, right?
The famous topography fortune teller.

186
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,918
-Yes,
-According to him,

187
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,129
that tree was standing
in the way of great fortune.

188
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,048
It wasn't doing any good for you, master.

189
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,424
So I…

190
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,426
(smacks lips)
Good job.

191
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:32,055
Anything with a bad energy
must be eliminated,

192
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,890
no matter how long it has kept your side

193
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,267
or how much you've cherished it.

194
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,732
Yes, of course.

195
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:48,696
DONGRIM: This is incredible.

196
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,657
You were invited after all.

197
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,576
Right, it was worth
writing the memoir all night.

198
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,244
By the way,

199
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:58,414
stealing the Adamas is one thing,

200
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:02,251
but will we be able to run away
with it safely from this house?

201
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,629
Hmm… Run away?

202
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,589
If we get caught, we'll be doomed.

203
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,590
That is

204
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,301
up to the heavens.

205
00:16:20,436 --> 00:16:22,563
(rustling)

206
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,628
Hello, this is Security.

207
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,256
Today?

208
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,301
I see.

209
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,013
AGENT KIM: Okay.

210
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,057
What is it?

211
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,476
The head office called.

212
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,270
Do you know where Mr. Choi is?

213
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:05,189
Well, he went downstairs a while ago.

214
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,446
What did the head office want?

215
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:19,037
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

216
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,164
Oh, Mr. Choi.

217
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,709
You can sit back down
and keep doing your work.

218
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:26,919
Is there anything particular?

219
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,337
No, nothing.

220
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,633
You look tired.

221
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:34,677
Go outside for a cigarette.

222
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,679
I'm okay, sir. It's working hours.

223
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,516
Smoking is best during working hours.

224
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,144
Step outside for a moment. I'll stay.

225
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,022
Okay, then.

226
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,861
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

227
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,082
Section Seven.

228
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,376
Nothing seemed off when I went there.

229
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,812
This is me.

230
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,689
It's someone who came afterward.

231
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,783
(suspenseful music)

232
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:41,786
(heavy sigh)

233
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:58,386
Mr. Choi?

234
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,138
What?

235
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:04,267
Oh, Mr. Lee isn't loafing around.

236
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,643
I let him step outside for a bit.

237
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,645
To smoke.

238
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,897
Don't keep him on a tight leash.

239
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,995
SUHYEON: <i>Mr. Lee killed her.</i>

240
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,164
I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house.

241
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:27,456
Okay.

242
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,212
What do you think? Do you like it?

243
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,173
What?

244
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,177
Yes, it's nice.

245
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:40,928
Then will you choose this--

246
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,723
No, I prefer the one from the other day.

247
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:48,436
Oh, you rejected that one
so we showed it to someone else.

248
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,480
She's trying it on now.

249
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,775
Really? I guess it can't be helped then.

250
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,485
The truth is…

251
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,406
STAFF: You look beautiful.

252
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,379
How pretty. It looks good on you.

253
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:18,341
But it's a little too long
for you, Ms. Yoon.

254
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,010
-Ms. Cho.
-Yes, ma'am?

255
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,303
Cut off about two hems' length.

256
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,722
Well… Sure thing.

257
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:32,855
Forget it. I should be
thanking you instead.

258
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:36,317
I'm so grateful
that my husband has you by his side.

259
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,570
You're not showing any reaction again.

260
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,325
Others might think
I'm looking down on you.

261
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,081
When it's actually the other way around.

262
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,836
You are getting a call.
I think it's urgent.

263
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,630
A person named Mr. Jeong
keeps calling you.

264
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,052
MR. JEONG

265
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,351
See you around.

266
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:24,949
MR. JEONG

267
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,496
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

268
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:31,831
Darn it.

269
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,834
Goodness.

270
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,715
MR. CHA: This was taken
in the parking lot of the Ares building.

271
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,134
And this is the dashcam footage
near the atelier yesterday…

272
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:47,346
I apologize, sir.

273
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,851
Do a better job, Mr. Cha.

274
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:54,562
Do you hear me?

275
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,646
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:00,192
Stand by at your houses
for the time being.

277
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,737
And send in the elites. Now get out.

278
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm not done analyzing--

279
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,032
I said get out. I'll take care of it.

280
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:09,327
Just wrap up Ms. Jang's incident smoothly.

281
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,911
Yes, sir.

282
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,010
(Sun laughs)

283
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:34,101
Did you lose them or let them go?

284
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,771
Cut the crap.
(clicks tongue)

285
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:42,360
Let me see.

286
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:46,280
Look. Song Suhyeon is limping.

287
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,616
SUN: Kim Seohee is barely supporting him
as they run away.

288
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:50,701
And you couldn't get them?

289
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,079
Jeez.

290
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,748
Where did they disappear to?

291
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:57,625
To the sky? Or underground?

292
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,044
Jeez.

293
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:05,007
I wouldn't have to go through this mess
if you'd taken care of him properly.

294
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,720
You're right about that.

295
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,644
That witch.

296
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:21,482
DELETE

297
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,901
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS FILE?

298
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:26,112
Things aren't looking good.

299
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:29,073
Shouldn't you let me know what's going on?

300
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:33,285
I already told you everything yesterday.
Do you need another explanation?

301
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,830
Someone suddenly jumped
in front of my car…

302
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,420
<i>and they seemed injured,
so I ended up giving them a ride.</i>

303
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:44,797
But they asked me
to let them off on the way so I did.

304
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,132
Report it to the higher-ups.

305
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:48,676
How can I report something like that?

306
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,970
I would have to explain why you were there

307
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,471
and who leaked the information.

308
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,599
I went to get jewelry done
and I needed Ms. Jang.

309
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,768
That's why you looked into it for me.

310
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,145
Is that so difficult?

311
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:01,605
It's a trivial matter

312
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,525
but I'm suggesting we cover it up
because you seem uncomfortable about it.

313
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,777
It's not as simple as it sounds.

314
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:09,530
<i>I may have been able
to take care of the footage,</i>

315
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:12,074
<i>but this isn't as simple as
asking me to find</i>

316
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:13,993
the person who suggested the ghostwriter.

317
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,912
Team A is deeply involved in this case.

318
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:20,291
That has nothing to do with me.

319
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:23,335
Since when were you doing me a favor?

320
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:24,879
It was all for your benefit.

321
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:29,049
<i>I'm telling you to cover this up
for your benefit as well. And…</i>

322
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:31,969
make this the last time you call me first.

323
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,306
I understand.

324
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,349
<i>I just can't wrap my head around it.</i>

325
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:41,854
Just what exactly is happening
that you're making all this fuss?

326
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:43,606
Ms. Hyesoo.

327
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,524
The helicopter is here.

328
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:49,612
I won't be needing it.

329
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:52,865
I'm staying here for the time being.

330
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,664
What?

331
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,541
The satellite phone disappeared?

332
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,876
It was Mr. Kim's doing.

333
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:06,504
-Mr. Kim?
-I'm sure of it.

334
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:08,047
He was suspicious from the start,

335
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,299
saying he was a fan
and trying to get friendly with you.

336
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,468
Are you sure? Why would he do that?

337
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,803
I checked the serial number.

338
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,472
The SIH sent me here undercover.

339
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:18,557
(scoffs)
They can do exactly the same.

340
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,226
Calm down, Mr. Choi.

341
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,894
I'll try to talk to him.

342
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,188
What will you do?

343
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:26,857
Give him your autograph
and ask if he's undercover?

344
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,111
The briefcase is locked
with the infiltration team's PIN code,

345
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,531
so he won't know what's in it for now.

346
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,449
But he will find the satellite phone soon.

347
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,701
And he will figure out
whom I've been communicating with.

348
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:39,411
We have to be careful.

349
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,373
If it wasn't Mr. Kim,
the situation will worsen.

350
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,210
AGENT PARK: <i>Mr. Choi, someone
from the head office is here.</i>

351
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:47,795
<i>He's entering the parking lot.</i>

352
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:49,547
(Mr. Choi sighs)

353
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,969
Why would someone suddenly come
from the head office?

354
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:57,680
Mr. Kim received a call earlier.

355
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,139
Did he not report it to you?

356
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:18,492
Okay.

357
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,869
You still don't think it's him?

358
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,080
How exactly do you want to be careful?

359
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:24,665
What will you do?

360
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,127
I'll risk bloodshed if I must.
There's no time to waste!

361
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:29,587
Mr. Choi.

362
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,424
Meet the visitor first.

363
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,509
I'll look for Mr. Kim.

364
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:38,429
We must stop the two
from meeting each other.

365
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:41,140
(sighs)

366
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,770
(door opens, closes)

367
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:49,898
(sighs)

368
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,360
MR. CHOI: <i>Go to the west section.</i>

369
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,613
<i>He must be patrolling the area.</i>

370
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:36,862
(Mr. Choi grunts)

371
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:41,075
(breathing heavily)

372
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:54,505
HAESONG

373
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:55,547
VISITORS LOG

374
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,009
You must sign the log
before entering the building.

375
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,847
Mr. Choi, everything seems fine.

376
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:05,849
What exactly is broken?

377
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:07,476
Where is the briefcase?

378
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:09,770
Excuse me?

379
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:17,611
Section Seven.

380
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,408
Oh, the thing is…

381
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,868
(grunts)

382
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,710
Mr. Choi, why are you doing this?

383
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:34,086
Where is the briefcase?

384
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:40,551
(panting)

385
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,971
MR. CHOI: <i>Tell me the truth.</i>

386
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,223
Well…

387
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,850
I know you were there.

388
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,643
You took it!

389
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,188
-No, I--
-I checked it all, you bastard.

390
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,071
(choking)

391
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,369
Where is the briefcase?

392
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,039
Say it, you punk.

393
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,250
(choking, gasps)

394
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:20,674
(coughing)

395
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,511
(groans)

396
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:29,808
(panting)

397
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:48,452
(coughing, groans)

398
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,246
Come clean if you want to spare yourself.

399
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,499
I…

400
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:55,709
I really didn't take it.

401
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:59,213
I just saw it there.

402
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,506
What?

403
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,925
I got curious
about why you went there often

404
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:04,843
and tried to check the place out.

405
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,262
But I left it there.

406
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:09,348
I didn't even touch it.

407
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:11,475
(sighs)

408
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:15,687
Wait a second.

409
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,273
If it wasn't you…

410
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:45,884
Mr. Choi!

411
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,265
Mr. Kim?

412
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,769
Don't make a fuss. He just passed out.

413
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,479
Did he admit it?

414
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,106
He wouldn't admit it this easily.

415
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,066
What if it wasn't him?

416
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:03,819
Then who did the guy from the head office
come to visit?

417
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:09,116
Okay. Please come this way.

418
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:14,746
NAME: JANG EUIDON

419
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,332
PURPOSE OF VISIT: MEETING WITH MS. KWON

420
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,842
MS. KWON: You came on time.

421
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,596
How have you been, Ms. Kwon?

422
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,306
I've been all right.

423
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,099
Is the work bearable?

424
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:36,727
EUIDON: Yes, thanks to you.

425
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,107
About the invitations for the ceremony,

426
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,735
I think they should be delivered
in person to meet the formality.

427
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,112
I called you in to help out.

428
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:50,032
Oh, did you do what I instructed?

429
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,825
Yes, I have it ready.

430
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,764
So you need to figure out
why that man is here.

431
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:15,057
Let me make this clear.

432
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:17,976
My team has put years of effort
into this operation.

433
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,937
I can't let it go to waste
because of this rat.

434
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,939
If your guess turns out to be right,

435
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,066
it will ruin
more than just the SIH's plan.

436
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:28,779
Hurry and meet the guy
from the head office first.

437
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:34,534
Mr. Kim?

438
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:47,547
Are you looking for this?

439
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:50,384
Mr. Park.

440
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:53,762
What are you doing here, Mr. Ha?

441
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,516
Are you in league with each other?

442
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:05,816
(door slams, lock clicks)

443
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,447
What is going on, Mr. Choi?

444
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,740
What about you?

445
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:16,868
Why do you have that briefcase?

446
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:19,705
Oh, I wondered whose this was.

447
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:20,789
Give it to me.

448
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:22,916
You need to tell me what's going on first.

449
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,252
-You little…
-Mr. Choi.

450
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,129
Opium.

451
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,548
Opium?

452
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,425
That's what's in it.

453
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:34,803
(Woosin sighs)

454
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:41,560
We're trying to sneak away
those poppies in the garden.

455
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:45,355
Do you want to join us?

456
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,399
In exchange for my silence?

457
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:49,443
It won't be a losing deal for you.

458
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:51,403
It's quite tempting, I must say.

459
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:54,489
So, you two are like business partners.

460
00:33:57,325 --> 00:34:00,287
What about him though?
Why did you beat him up?

461
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,288
It was my mistake.

462
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,040
The briefcase had disappeared,

463
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:05,667
and I thought Mr. Kim took it
so he could have it all to himself.

464
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:07,711
I gave him a beating.

465
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:11,048
-I see.
-So, are you in?

466
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:13,717
This will get you a hefty sum.

467
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:17,721
Fine.

468
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:21,683
Now let's open it and check.

469
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,272
What's with this mood? I knew it.

470
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,525
Opium was a lie, wasn't it?

471
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:34,529
(briefcase clanks)

472
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:39,326
Just what is in this briefcase?

473
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:42,996
-Give it to me.
-Oh.

474
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:45,957
You might even kill me if I don't.

475
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,134
Mr. Choi.

476
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:58,845
Mr. Choi.

477
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,138
You people are

478
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,767
with the SIH, aren't you?

479
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:23,370
(heavy sigh)

480
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:25,038
What a life he has.

481
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,008
Did you ask for me?

482
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:41,138
What happened to Ms. Jang.
Was it your doing?

483
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:42,764
Yes, sir.

484
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:46,560
It seemed she spread word
about the Adamas, so for security…

485
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:49,271
I see.

486
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,399
I understand,

487
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:55,902
but you should've at least
reported it to me afterward.

488
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,029
Did you have to make me summon you?

489
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,991
I apologize, sir. It's my mistake.

490
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:02,284
What else is there?

491
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:04,452
Pardon?

492
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:06,955
Is there anything else
you didn't let me know?

493
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,416
There's nothing else.

494
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:11,793
Junkyung.

495
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:13,128
Yes, sir.

496
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:16,590
KWON:
We've known each other for a long time.

497
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:20,677
I wasn't always so fond of you.

498
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,888
At times, I thought of casting you away,

499
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:26,808
but when the Adamas was stolen,

500
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,977
you managed to retrieve it.

501
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,022
I've been easy on you for that.

502
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,648
But how long

503
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:36,359
do you think that'll last?

504
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,736
(nervous chuckle)

505
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:41,615
Sir, I'm not quite following you--

506
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,074
I know you met Lee Changwoo.

507
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:54,002
You shouldn't have come here
to meet me today.

508
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,298
CHANGWOO: <i>Do you think</i>

509
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,426
Chairman Kwon has forgotten about me?

510
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:05,597
Yes, I met him.

511
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,475
I wanted to figure out
how the SIH ended up getting involved

512
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:09,684
with Song Suhyeon.

513
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,772
I met him to check if the SIH

514
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:14,940
had made contact with him.

515
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,734
I didn't report it to you
because I didn't find any trace.

516
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,194
That's all, sir.

517
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,002
TEAM LEADER LEE: <i>If I dodge, I'll be dead.</i>

518
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,422
<i>This is bait.</i>

519
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:43,760
Mr. Choi.

520
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:46,596
Who are you? What's your identity?

521
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,306
The SIH.

522
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,100
What?

523
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:52,686
I'm with the SIH too!

524
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,437
(Agent Park panting)

525
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,403
(grunts, panting)

526
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:29,973
I got some nice dried persimmons.
You can have a taste of them.

527
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,684
Thank you, sir.

528
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:35,020
Maybe I got the wrong fishing spot.

529
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:37,564
It's not going so well.

530
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:43,778
Nothing's biting here.

531
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:47,907
(bird squawking)

532
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,371
Don't try to pull a trick.

533
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:55,540
The infiltration teams
don't know each other.

534
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:57,167
Did you think you were undercover alone?

535
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,794
I also thought this was a solo mission.

536
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:02,422
Prove it then. Open this briefcase.

537
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,717
You'd know the PIN code
if you're on the infiltration team.

538
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:11,056
(grunts, panting)

539
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:17,604
(Agent Park sighs)

540
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,113
(lock clicks)

541
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,032
(sighs)

542
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,372
Nice job fooling me
all this time, you bastard.

543
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:38,041
You should've told me.
I almost killed you for real.

544
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:40,710
Whatever. Just tell me what you'll do now.

545
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,004
-What?
-Him.

546
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,673
What will you do about Mr. Kim?

547
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:49,511
You know the infiltration team's protocol
for when your cover is blown.

548
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,809
There's no need to kill him.

549
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,269
AGENT PARK: What are you saying?

550
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:00,105
MR. CHOI:
He doesn't even know what's in here.

551
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:01,606
We'll just say

552
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:03,733
that it's opium.

553
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:04,984
What if he doesn't buy it?

554
00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:08,530
Are you suggesting
we gamble with our lives? How generous.

555
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,865
AGENT PARK:
If things go south, it won't be just us.

556
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,534
The organization itself
could be in danger!

557
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:15,286
Then what? Are you saying
we should kill him for real?

558
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:18,540
Of course. We must.

559
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,960
Are you really from the SIH?

560
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,420
You little…

561
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,588
Should I do it?

562
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,758
I'll do it.
(scoffs)

563
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,471
Once he wakes up,
he won't remember anything.

564
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:35,014
WOOSIN: There's no need to kill him.

565
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,225
Maybe the SIH kills off the innocent

566
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,060
as if it's no big deal,

567
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:40,812
but I'm not one of you.

568
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,441
I won't just sit back and watch it happen.

569
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:46,067
What is this now?

570
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:48,778
You're not from the SIH?

571
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,739
It's a long story.

572
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,867
He's cooperating with our operation.

573
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,826
(scoffs)

574
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:57,912
Jeez, I can't get used to this.

575
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:00,206
A civilian is involved
in the SIH's operation,

576
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,292
and you people are all talk. What a mess!

577
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:06,713
AGENT PARK:
Whatever. Leave this place, both of you.

578
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,298
I'll take care of the situation.

579
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,549
AGENT KIM: Mr. Ha.

580
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:15,138
What is going on?

581
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:29,777
(heavy sigh)

582
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:38,870
-Move.
-I won't.

583
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:42,540
Move.

584
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,168
No.

585
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:52,550
(groans)

586
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,236
What are you up to now?

587
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,241
You never stay at my house for no reason.

588
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,745
It's because of the chairman.

589
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,830
He's looking forward to a grandchild

590
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:25,750
so I have to at least
make him think that we're trying.

591
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,335
Put up with me just until the ceremony.

592
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:29,587
It's not like I like being here either.

593
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:34,342
As expected.

594
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:37,011
You really are the lady of the house.

595
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,807
The more I look at you,

596
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,810
the more you resemble my father.

597
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:49,649
You're both cold, cruel,
and impossible to read.

598
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:50,984
Right.

599
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,902
And you both dearly loved Minjo.

600
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,865
Dearly loved Minjo?

601
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,326
The chairman did?

602
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,247
Then I wonder why he did that.

603
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:05,957
What are you talking about?

604
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,250
The helicopter accident.

605
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,256
What about that?

606
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:18,720
I wonder why he spared

607
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,639
the people who were involved
in the accident.

608
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,603
When they were responsible
for the death of his dearly beloved son.

609
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:30,773
So?

610
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,319
What are you getting at?

611
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:35,528
What am I getting at?

612
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:41,868
What I'm saying is that…

613
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,206
the chairman…

614
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,173
never really loved Minjo.

615
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:01,638
You're right.

616
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:04,766
Gosh, I like what you're getting at.

617
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,325
HYESOO: <i>Thank you, Mr. Jeong.</i>

618
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:24,494
No problem. I can do this much
of an errand for you.

619
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:27,705
It took me quite a lot of effort

620
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:29,374
because there weren't many materials.

621
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:32,210
Haesong took control of the situation,

622
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:35,630
so a lot of people
still don't know about his death.

623
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:37,131
ARES HELICOPTER CRASH

624
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:38,800
DATE OF ACCIDENT: APRIL 1, 2017

625
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:40,385
How did this happen?

626
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,929
HYESOO: Everyone related to the accident…

627
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:46,099
Yes, they were only briefly investigated

628
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,518
and there was no real punishment.

629
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:51,187
If it really was an accident,

630
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:54,440
he wouldn't have kept them alive.

631
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,237
(phone ringing)

632
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,994
Hello, this is Haesongwon.

633
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:17,922
DATE: 7 P.M., APRIL 23, 2022
LOCATION: BANQUET HALL IN HAESONGWON

634
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:21,342
WE'RE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU
TO THE 80TH FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

635
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:27,056
SONG

636
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,518
Right, the writer's real surname is Song.

637
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:33,020
Ms. Kwon.

638
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:36,149
What's with that face?
Did someone die or something?

639
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:38,317
Did you know?

640
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:39,527
What are you talking about?

641
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,529
Mr. Kim

642
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:43,573
is dead.

643
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,491
What?

644
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,201
Unbelievable!

645
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:48,953
It was acute drug intoxication.

646
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,124
It seems he stole some poppies
from the garden.

647
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,252
Right before the ceremony? How dare he!

648
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:00,465
How do you want me to handle this?

649
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:02,842
Isn't it obvious? Cover it up!

650
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:09,140
DEATH CERTIFICATE

651
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:11,934
Thank you.

652
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,279
AGENT PARK:
<i>As expected, Ms. Kwon wants it buried.</i>

653
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:25,698
<i>Since the poppies were
from the Haesongwon garden.</i>

654
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:41,088
<i>Mr. Choi.</i>

655
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,092
<i>What happened to Mr. Kim
will remain a secret between us.</i>

656
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,739
(groans)

657
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:16,916
(grunting)

658
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:20,962
MR. CHOI: <i>Stop it, you crazy bastard.</i>

659
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:22,880
<i>Are you really going to kill
an innocent person?</i>

660
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:24,549
AGENT PARK:
<i>Stop messing around. Let go of me.</i>

661
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:26,717
<i>I said let go of me, damn it!</i>

662
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,469
<i>Are you going to ignore protocol?</i>

663
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:31,180
<i>We have to kill him!</i>

664
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:43,609
(rain pattering)

665
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:33,701
The external cause of the accident
is the poor safety management of bombs.

666
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:35,661
But it's still under police investigation.

667
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:37,997
No evidence remains.

668
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,249
I ordered our men to analyze
the CCTV camera footage nearby,

669
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,709
but we got nothing from it.

670
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:44,545
Team A probably utilized
the clear-out team.

671
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:47,590
Close the underpass to the safe house,
and have the vigilance team stand by.

672
00:48:47,673 --> 00:48:48,925
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:53,387
Do you think Ms. Kim is okay?

674
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:56,766
If they'd killed her,
they would've sent her body to us.

675
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,226
We've done all we can.

676
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:00,937
Right.

677
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:04,273
Now let's wait for their move.

678
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:19,413
The trial run was successful.

679
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:23,125
It will have enough power to kill
in actual warfare.

680
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,128
What do you think of it?

681
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,924
(scoffs)
Now you're trying to interview me?

682
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:34,136
Hey, did you make me come over
just so I could watch some show?

683
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:35,888
Did the heat get to you?

684
00:49:38,015 --> 00:49:38,975
Sir.

685
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,185
It better be something serious,
or I'll be pissed.

686
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:45,189
Song Suhyeon is alive.

687
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,237
What do you think you're doing?

688
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,907
I ordered you
to take care of Song Suhyeon,

689
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,867
and you said he was taken care of.

690
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:59,120
So he shouldn't be alive, should he?

691
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:01,497
No.

692
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,082
(sighs)

693
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:04,125
And?

694
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:08,337
Getting rid of Song Suhyeon
won't solve the situation.

695
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,297
We must stack the deck

696
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:12,133
and eliminate everyone including the SIH.

697
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:16,554
Please take a look at the scenario first.

698
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,311
"H-File?"

699
00:50:25,396 --> 00:50:27,648
H-FILE

700
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:28,816
(Hyunjo sighs)

701
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,777
If it's not good,
I'll smash your head first.

702
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:42,246
A terrorist bombing?

703
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:46,417
D-day is that day.

704
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:52,006
Wow, you are a lunatic.

705
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,008
Will you be able to smooth it over?

706
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:57,720
After the upcoming presidential election,
Haesong will take full control anyway.

707
00:50:57,803 --> 00:50:59,472
We'll manipulate the media a little

708
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,098
and investigate it after seizing power.

709
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:04,310
And to eliminate the opponents
at the same time,

710
00:51:04,477 --> 00:51:08,189
you will accuse them
of pulling the strings?

711
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:10,691
A thorough housecleaning.

712
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:13,694
That's right. We'll say they are
a radical terrorist group

713
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:17,615
who is unhappy with the regime change
and plans to take over the new government.

714
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:20,159
That will create a scare.

715
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:25,331
If we take this mood
all the way to legalizing firearms…

716
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:28,542
That'd be a blockbuster.

717
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,836
(book thuds)

718
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,091
Look at you.

719
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:37,551
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes, sir.

720
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:41,138
You brought it to me
because my father wouldn't allow it, no?

721
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,642
-I apologize.
-You fool.

722
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:50,481
So who's going to take the bullet?

723
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,485
Kim Seohee.

724
00:51:58,072 --> 00:51:59,990
(distant screaming)

725
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:29,687
CHIEF JEONG: Hey.

726
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:31,605
Hey!

727
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:36,443
Take it easy, or at least gag her.

728
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:38,320
Why? I like hearing it.

729
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,614
You crazy witch.

730
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,825
Hey, Jeong.

731
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,328
"Hey, Jeong"?

732
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:57,006
Show some respect,
or you'll be taught a lesson.

733
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,307
Mr. Lee went to meet Mr. Kwon.

734
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:08,767
With Mr. Cha.

735
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:13,898
Between me and you,

736
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:16,025
who will be taught a lesson first?

737
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:21,363
That trap of yours
will end up ruining your life.

738
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:24,366
I guarantee it.

739
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,622
(thumps, clatters)

740
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:41,592
-(clinks)
-(grunts)

741
00:53:42,343 --> 00:53:45,554
(groans, panting)

742
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:46,555
Stop it.

743
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,350
I don't know anything about the SIH.

744
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,311
You don't?

745
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:53,938
No.

746
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,483
Listen carefully. This is important.

747
00:53:58,108 --> 00:54:01,320
We're going to blow up the SIH with bombs.

748
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,282
You can do it, right?

749
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:07,993
What?

750
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,954
You're going to carry the bombs.

751
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:14,833
I won't do it.

752
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,585
(scoffs, chuckles)

753
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,129
Want to make a bet?

754
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,717
HYUKPIL: <i>Reporter Kim Seohee…</i>

755
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:27,179
They must've taken her alive for a reason.

756
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,722
They're up to something.

757
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:30,557
Should we set up a task force?

758
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:33,852
No, let's stick to our plan.

759
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:35,813
The ceremony is coming up soon.

760
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,398
Yes, sir.

761
00:54:49,326 --> 00:54:50,536
Our objective is as follows.

762
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:54,331
Before the Adamas is moved
to the ceremony hall…

763
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:18,874
SUHYEON: <i>You took three days
just to come to that conclusion?</i>

764
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,752
That you can't find Kim Seohee
unless they make a move?

765
00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:24,963
Is that why
you're sitting back and waiting?

766
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:27,216
You should locate Mr. Lee.

767
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,968
You should've raided
Haesong's main office!

768
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:33,472
Our operation takes place today.
We must secure the Adamas.

769
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:36,892
Mr. Ha will be arrested red-handed.

770
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:39,937
While everyone's watching,
so that Chairman Kwon can't do anything.

771
00:56:40,604 --> 00:56:42,439
The Adamas will become evidence.

772
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:44,358
Once we reveal that it was used
for the murder,

773
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:46,193
an arrest warrant will be issued.

774
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:48,654
Mr. Ha agreed to this.

775
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:51,198
What about Kim Seohee? Did she agree?

776
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:55,035
That you should catch Chairman Kwon
whether she ends up dying or not?

777
00:56:55,536 --> 00:56:57,913
What about Ms. Lee? What about Mr. Baek?

778
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,209
Hey, Song.

779
00:57:03,794 --> 00:57:06,588
I'm not asking for your approval here.

780
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:11,176
I'm warning you not to cause a mess
by meddling in our operation, you bastard.

781
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:14,221
The sense of justice you seek.

782
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:15,931
The sense of revenge.

783
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:18,642
That's not enough to catch Kwon Jaekyu.

784
00:57:18,725 --> 00:57:19,726
Okay.

785
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:21,812
Fine.

786
00:57:22,813 --> 00:57:24,356
Let's go our separate ways.

787
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:27,151
You don't care about saving people.

788
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:31,155
And I refuse to risk my life
for your ridiculous plan.

789
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,408
You have no more reason to keep me anyway.

790
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:35,742
(rubber squeaks)

791
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,294
Damn it.

792
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:48,338
WOMAN: <i>Hello, sir.</i>

793
00:57:49,506 --> 00:57:50,632
Who?

794
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:53,093
Designer Patti Jang?

795
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:58,265
Her suicide case
and the other cases I mentioned just now.

796
00:57:58,348 --> 00:57:59,766
Gather all the materials for me.

797
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,811
I'm on my way to work. Bye.

798
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:12,446
(Suhyeon grunts)

799
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:26,001
DEAR MR. SONG SUHYEON

800
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:31,131
WE'RE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU
TO THE 80TH FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

801
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:45,687
Thank you. You may enter.

802
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,373
Welcome, Candidate Noh.

803
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:06,333
Long time no see, Ms. Kwon.

804
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:09,253
You didn't come
to my presidential candidacy ceremony.

805
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:11,255
Right, it's been a while.

806
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:13,465
But I'm always acquainted with your news.

807
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:15,717
You've been receiving
the highest approvals rating.

808
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:18,971
Thanks to you.
(laughs)

809
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,683
But Candidate Hwang
is chasing right behind me.

810
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:24,268
That makes me feel bad.

811
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:28,897
I wonder if he's got
the chairman's support.

812
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:30,816
Of course not.

813
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:33,860
If that were the case,
Hwang would be here.

814
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:36,613
Don't worry, and please come inside.

815
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:38,156
MR. NOH: Sure.

816
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:42,911
You even invited the press.

817
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:45,414
Is it going to be okay, ma'am?

818
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:48,667
Yes, we should spread the news
far and wide.

819
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:51,211
A happy occasion like this
won't come again.

820
00:59:57,426 --> 01:00:00,387
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha, did you see? Those from
broadcasting stations are here too.

821
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:02,139
What an honor.

822
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:05,934
The sight of me getting arrested
will be broadcast nationally.

823
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,812
And thanks to it, Haesong won't
have a reason to oppose

824
01:00:08,895 --> 01:00:10,897
even if the Adamas gets taken as evidence.

825
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:14,985
You're right about that,
but is it really going to be okay?

826
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:16,528
Yes, I told you so.

827
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,405
I'm talking about myself.

828
01:00:18,488 --> 01:00:20,282
Will I be able to pull it off?

829
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:22,659
Just be your normal self.

830
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:26,038
It may seem easy,
but tripping naturally isn't…

831
01:00:27,497 --> 01:00:30,792
It's not easy. Jeez, it hurts.

832
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:33,253
Yet you pull it off every day.

833
01:00:33,337 --> 01:00:34,713
I know you can do it.

834
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:36,923
Dongrim.

835
01:00:39,426 --> 01:00:41,219
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

836
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:47,309
This is why I tell you all the time
that there's no pupil like me.

837
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,895
We're like salt and pepper.

838
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:55,400
(classical music)

839
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,534
-MAN: Oh, congratulations.
-WOMAN: Congratulations.

840
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:31,395
MY PATH

841
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,191
MY PATH

842
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:40,070
(paper rustles)

843
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,282
Excuse me.

844
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:50,997
<i>My Path.</i>

845
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,419
HYUNJO: Isn't it old-fashioned?

846
01:01:57,337 --> 01:02:00,257
To put it nicely, it's classic.

847
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:02,884
Are you the ghostwriter?

848
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:05,387
Yes, I'm Ha Woosin.

849
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,389
Who are you?

850
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:10,684
Do you not know me?

851
01:02:11,685 --> 01:02:13,145
Are you someone I should know?

852
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,606
Well…
(laughs)

853
01:02:17,441 --> 01:02:19,985
You two have met.

854
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:20,986
HYESOO: Let me introduce you.

855
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,114
-This is--
-I'm her husband.

856
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:27,743
Oh, you are President Kwon Hyunjo.

857
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:29,411
WOOSIN: I've heard a lot about you.

858
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:31,538
Really?

859
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:34,916
I wonder what you have heard.

860
01:02:37,377 --> 01:02:38,920
The facts.

861
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:41,131
He interviewed me for the memoir.

862
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:42,716
I see.

863
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:46,553
I know we've never met before,

864
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,597
but you look so familiar.

865
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:53,351
Really? I don't have
a typical face though.

866
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:55,437
Ah.

867
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:59,816
I didn't expect to see you here.

868
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:02,235
Gratefully enough,
the chairman invited me.

869
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,988
I see, my father invited you.

870
01:03:05,405 --> 01:03:08,408
He went overboard. You must feel uneasy
to join an occasion like this.

871
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:11,787
Not at all. I was born
to enjoy this kind of occasion.

872
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:14,790
Really?

873
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:17,918
You don't look like the type
who'd snoop around a party.

874
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:22,255
(Hyunjo chuckles)

875
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:25,967
Candidate Noh has been
looking for you outside the hall.

876
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:30,388
(sighs)
Excuse me then.

877
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:38,897
I guess he didn't think the chairman
would invite me, considering his reaction.

878
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,649
He must feel neglected.

879
01:03:41,441 --> 01:03:42,901
Or maybe he feels jealous.

880
01:03:42,984 --> 01:03:44,611
-Of me?
-Oh, right.

881
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:47,989
I found out

882
01:03:49,908 --> 01:03:51,910
whom you're working with.

883
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:54,871
Pardon?

884
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:03,004
The Special Investigations Headquarters.

885
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:43,837
(screaming)

886
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:48,633
Get out. Now.

887
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:59,060
-Ms. Eun.
-Don't show me that face.

888
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:02,480
I may be

889
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:05,483
able to offer some help.

890
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:09,070
Don't change the subject,
and say what you want to say.

891
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:10,322
Kim Seohee.

892
01:05:11,448 --> 01:05:12,699
You know

893
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:15,118
that reporter, right? The witness.

894
01:05:18,204 --> 01:05:19,289
What on earth

895
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:23,793
is this about?

896
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:35,388
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

897
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:04,417
(closing theme music)

898
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,648
MS. KWON: <i>Now, we will reveal the Adamas.</i>

899
01:06:28,274 --> 01:06:29,985
SUN: <i>You're going to carry the bomb.</i>

900
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:33,947
We have quite the history between us.

901
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,240
MR. HAN: <i>We found Ms. Kim.</i>

902
01:06:36,074 --> 01:06:37,701
<i>They made a move.</i>
