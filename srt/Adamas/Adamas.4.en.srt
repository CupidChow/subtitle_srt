1
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,015
(theme music)

2
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:51,345
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,975
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,895
HYESOO: I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.

5
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,945
But this is what my husband said.

6
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:05,155
"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo...

7
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,535
was the one who took the fall."

8
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,205
Is this enough?

9
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:14,035
Enough evidence that Chairman Kwon
is directly involved in this case?

10
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:19,705
Do you even want to get him?
Why are you hesitating?

11
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,015
So it isn't that you couldn't.
He got away with it

12
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,555
while you were hesitating.

13
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:36,685
Wait.

14
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,365
Do you think it's going to work?

15
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,745
-I'm quite lucky, you see.
-And you have a plan?

16
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,745
I wouldn't have started if I didn't.

17
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,205
-If you decide to join me...
-Then you'll tell me?

18
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:01,045
Are you going to
ask questions all night long?

19
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,545
Let me ask one last question.

20
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:05,965
How did you find out who I really am?

21
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,715
You'll get an answer to that
once everything is over.

22
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,765
Now is not the time.

23
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,185
(sighs)

24
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,985
All right, let's do this.

25
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,735
But this doesn't mean
we're on the same team,

26
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,825
so don't be mistaken.

27
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,455
Especially Eun Hyesoo.

28
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,955
I don't trust her.

29
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:39,125
She must never find out who I really am.

30
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,295
Do you understand?

31
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,555
What a long day it's been for you.

32
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,275
Threatening me and stopping the chairman
from going on his trip.

33
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,735
And you got what you wanted for both.
Congratulations.

34
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,365
I won't be apologetic.

35
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,575
Because your letter started this.

36
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,285
You're really annoying.

37
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,665
Don't you get that a lot?

38
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:21,745
Yes.

39
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,665
Anyway, I'm sorry
the situation turned out like this.

40
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:29,675
It really was unexpected.

41
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,755
To have you come to this house.

42
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:34,465
The Adamas is here, so I had to come.

43
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,475
I thought Song Suhyeon would make a move.

44
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,725
He seemed quite capable when I checked.

45
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:44,145
No, let's leave him out of this.

46
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,395
Don't tell me...

47
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,485
Your brother doesn't know
about Lee Changwoo?

48
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:53,445
SUHYEON: All right.

49
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,325
Let's get back to the subject.

50
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,415
Who is this?

51
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:03,795
Well...

52
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:06,505
I don't know.

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,925
Then I'll change the question.

54
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,635
Who took the murder weapon?

55
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,015
Why would you ask me that?

56
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,175
You don't know that either?

57
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,475
I don't. I really don't know.

58
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:24,815
Are you sure he didn't take it?

59
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,025
No, sir. I don't know him.

60
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:30,275
This case occurred 22 years ago,
and I already confessed to it.

61
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,275
It was a false confession.

62
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:34,735
Why would I...

63
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,615
do that?

64
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:43,285
Because you wanted
to protect this bastard!

65
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,915
Damn it!

66
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:49,505
Because he was an accomplice!

67
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:57,345
(growls)

68
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:03,725
Look forward to it.

69
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,815
I'll reveal everything
you're hiding one by one.

70
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,855
(breathing heavily)

71
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:21,405
(sighs loudly)

72
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,295
(annoyed grunt)

73
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:43,975
I'm disappointed in Prosecutor Song.

74
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,725
I thought he'd at least pretend
to investigate it, but he's clueless.

75
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,235
Let's stop talking about him.
I find it unpleasant.

76
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,605
All right.

77
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:56,905
Right.

78
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:00,445
What will happen if Lee Changwoo dies?

79
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,495
What do you mean?

80
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,955
Candidate Hwang of New Future Party
held a press conference.

81
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,165
Let me declare right here that my pledge

82
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:14,085
to reintroduce the death penalty

83
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,345
is not just a wild idea.

84
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:21,595
If I get elected, I will sign
an immediate death warrant

85
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:26,805
during the transition period!

86
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,145
You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.

87
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,605
Time's not on your side.

88
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:47,575
He...

89
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,375
He's innocent.

90
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,715
What do you mean?

91
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,835
He is...

92
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,675
He's your...

93
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,175
Your biological father.

94
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:09,435
Lee...

95
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,105
Changwoo.

96
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:19,235
HYESOO: You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.

97
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,985
Time's not on your side.

98
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,575
I'm sure it's here.

99
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:32,205
The Adamas.

100
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,205
REPORTER: Candidate Hwang Byungchul
of New Future Party

101
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,085
held an emergency press conference

102
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:39,335
and declared he'll reintroduce
the death penalty

103
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,175
during the transition period
once he wins the election.

104
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:46,175
The Prison Service is preparing
to be on emergency duty

105
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,725
in case it agitates
the long-term condemned inmates.

106
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:52,065
And the Ministry of Justice
is showing opinions

107
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:54,395
that they should be prepared
for the death penalty system.

108
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:58,275
ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER
UNDER RESPECT FOR HUMANS

109
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:06,445
(car beeps)

110
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,875
SEOHEE: If Lee Changwoo gets executed,

111
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:13,665
you'll never get to find the real culprit
behind your father's murder.

112
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,605
(knife clacking)

113
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,435
(sizzling)

114
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:44,655
(knife clacking)

115
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,175
In case you don't eat it.
You could get punished for leaving food.

116
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,345
I'm willing to get punished
if I can hit you just once.

117
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,595
You're getting cranky again.

118
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,175
You should thank me instead

119
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,475
for making a special order
for this fancy healthy dish.

120
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,265
Aren't you too young
to care about healthy food?

121
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,185
There's something you don't know.

122
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,185
What is it?

123
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,145
Actually, I...

124
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:29,035
"Don't forget.
I have the letter that you sent."

125
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:32,455
What letter?

126
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,915
Don't look at me. Ask Mr. Ha.

127
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:38,415
Huh? Mr. Ha?

128
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,505
Did you go through the trash bin
in the study?

129
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,875
I wonder who sent the letter.

130
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,175
And you put the ripped pieces together.

131
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,175
I wonder what was written in that letter.

132
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,965
(Woosin sighs)

133
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,845
I'm a writer, Ms. Kwon.

134
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,975
I take notes about things
that come to my mind.

135
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,815
If I don't like it,
I dump it in the trash.

136
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:02,775
Oh, dear. I guess I'm barking up
the wrong tree again.

137
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,615
If you don't like me,

138
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,865
take it out on that person
who recommended me.

139
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,755
(chuckles)
Excuse me.

140
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,925
Mr. Ha, wait for me.

141
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,895
She must be bothered by Mr. Ha.

142
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:39,895
What?

143
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:44,275
I mean, Ms. Kwon.
She looks at him like this.

144
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,855
She already has snake eyes.

145
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,115
Ms. Kwon doesn't like anyone

146
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:52,325
except for the chairman.

147
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,905
She hates mankind itself.

148
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,615
(Agent Park chuckles)

149
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,625
-(clears throat)
-Gosh, it's good. Mmm.

150
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:10,215
I wonder why Ms. Kwon hates you so much.

151
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,425
People usually hate you,
but this is too soon.

152
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,515
Tell me about it.

153
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:18,435
But what was that about taking notes?
You don't do such a thing.

154
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:19,645
It's none of your business.

155
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:21,645
Where are you going?

156
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,145
To interview the chairman.

157
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:24,645
Ah.

158
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,065
I'll be in the study!

159
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:30,615
Is she jealous?

160
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:33,445
Because the chairman
seems to be fond of Mr. Ha?

161
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:40,835
Did I not tell him
that the interview was postponed?

162
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:52,045
A raised floor could mean
that something is underneath.

163
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,315
(somber music)

164
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:15,325
Is the chairman in his bedroom?

165
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,865
I'm supposed to interview him.

166
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:29,335
HE WENT TO THE HEAD OFFICE

167
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:33,135
Oh, I forgot. Okay.

168
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:45,315
Would you happen to know
when he will return?

169
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:50,735
Four o'clock?

170
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,325
Seeing how he left without her,
he went to meet Mr. Hyunjo.

171
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:04,915
(sighs)
Still, he should've had her company.

172
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,795
How did the thing go?

173
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,375
I see.

174
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,085
Then I'll have to wait.

175
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,965
Will he take the bait?

176
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:20,765
Who might you be?

177
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,515
I HAVE THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT

178
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,475
Really?

179
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,235
Good work.

180
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,965
It's the posthumous work
of the artist, Baek Dongsun.

181
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:57,595
I guess it's expensive.

182
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,885
More than what you'll earn
in your lifetime.

183
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:05,515
I tried to find out who recommended you,
but the info was locked.

184
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:07,725
-That means...
-It's classified.

185
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,735
Oh, that's a bad sign.

186
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:12,855
That means there's an ulterior motive.

187
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,855
I'll think of a way
to find out who it was.

188
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,065
Since you don't have much time.

189
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,655
Are you worried about me?

190
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,285
That's absurd.

191
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,125
How beautiful.

192
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,425
This house is like...

193
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,725
a large museum.

194
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,275
It's one of the early works of Roman.

195
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,735
WOOSIN: I bet its price is much higher.

196
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:55,565
You want to know how much it is?

197
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,115
I want to know something else.

198
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,285
The secret room on the third floor.

199
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:08,495
Why is it locked? What's in there?

200
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,295
HYUNJO: The information leaked?

201
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,095
We're in a tricky situation.

202
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,515
The writer I hired for my memoir.

203
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,635
His pupil knows sign language.

204
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,845
Should I call Mr. Lee over?

205
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,105
If word of the legalization
of firearms gets out,

206
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,525
it can't be covered up easily.

207
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,355
Hyunjo.

208
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,485
Don't rely on Mr. Lee too much.

209
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:40,235
Good medicine can be poisonous
if you overdose on it.

210
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:43,155
They won't be going anywhere
until the election is over.

211
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,245
Things will be okay.

212
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,575
-But--
-Don't say but.

213
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,325
I don't need your permission.

214
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:53,625
I apologize, Father.

215
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,255
It's not your concern.

216
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,095
I guess you're very fond of that writer,

217
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,515
seeing how you're taking extra measures.

218
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,395
That has nothing to do with it.

219
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:16,105
Anyway, I came to talk to you
about something else.

220
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,945
The 80th-anniversary event.

221
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:22,525
Don't worry about that.
It's being prepared without a hitch.

222
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,485
No, I'm thinking of changing the plan.

223
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,785
How?

224
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,785
I'm quite concerned
about my health these days.

225
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:34,495
I'm not sure
how long I'll be able to work.

226
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,045
So...

227
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,335
I plan to retire.

228
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,465
Pardon?

229
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,555
It will be your time now.

230
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:49,635
(ominous music)

231
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:00,315
PRESIDENT ROOM

232
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:15,785
(grunts)

233
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:35,935
KWON: It will be your time now.

234
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:37,935
MINJO: That's not what I want.

235
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,145
It's not what you want?

236
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:41,315
No.

237
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:43,605
Why not?

238
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:47,115
I don't want to live like you, Father.

239
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,995
What does that mean?

240
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,495
I'm aware of it all.

241
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:54,575
Of what?

242
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:57,705
Everything.

243
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:04,505
When I was younger,
I was proud of Haesong.

244
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,045
But now,

245
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,675
I'm ashamed of it.

246
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,555
-Minjo.
-It's a crime to amass a fortune

247
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,265
through bloodshed.

248
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,605
Do you want to make me a criminal too?

249
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,025
It's such a shame,

250
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:28,905
the more I think about it.

251
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:45,675
Kwon Minjo's room?

252
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,465
Yes.

253
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:55,095
Nothing in this room has changed
since the accident.

254
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,235
The Adamas isn't here.

255
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:09,195
As I expected.

256
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:11,735
You did?

257
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:14,405
You lock a room for security reasons.

258
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:18,035
But I doubted
they would make it this obvious.

259
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:22,045
I thought it'd be something precious,
if not something expensive.

260
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,045
Precious enough for Chairman Kwon
to keep it near his bedroom.

261
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,305
This is the most I can do to help.

262
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:33,175
I don't know where the Adamas is either.

263
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:37,635
Don't worry. I won't bother you anymore.

264
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,065
But why do you seem like
you have a lot to say?

265
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,185
Ms. Eun.

266
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,145
Please keep this...

267
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,945
a secret from Suhyeon.

268
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,615
I can't promise you that.

269
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,545
You must've forgotten
that you threatened me.

270
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,295
-That's--
-Mr. Ha.

271
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,095
I don't know when you'll betray me.

272
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:15,345
I need a card up my sleeve too,
don't you think?

273
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:24,395
But I wonder why it has to be
a secret from your brother.

274
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,105
Is there a reason why he shouldn't know?

275
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:40,035
(door opens, closes)

276
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,285
I'm curious

277
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,085
about that story.

278
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:03,685
YOUNG SUHYEON: Wow.

279
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,905
TOY WORLD

280
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,915
Do you want it?

281
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,495
Dad.

282
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,795
Want me to buy it for you?

283
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,585
Yes.

284
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,295
I mean, no.

285
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:38,135
What's with that answer?
Should I buy it for you or not?

286
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,425
You have no money.

287
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,605
So you noticed.

288
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:48,895
But son, I have some money stashed away.

289
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,235
And it's Children's Day soon.

290
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,985
How about that figurine as a gift?

291
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:58,195
Forget it. I'm not even a kid anymore.

292
00:21:58,785 --> 00:21:59,865
Hey, you brat.

293
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:04,115
You're always a kid to me.
Because you're my son.

294
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:07,285
(somber music)

295
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,815
MR. GONG

296
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,315
CHIEF GONG: Hello?

297
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,905
I'll send you a number.
Get me the personal info of its owner.

298
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,535
-Sir, you need to come into work--
-It's urgent. Today, please.

299
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,535
CHIEF GONG: Yes, sir.

300
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:09,765
I promise.

301
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,815
I'll catch the culprit no matter what.

302
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:22,365
SUHYEON: Are you certain?

303
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:25,075
That man in the composite sketch
is the real culprit?

304
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:28,245
-Yes.
-No, he's an accomplice.

305
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,125
I disagree with you.

306
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:31,745
Lee Changwoo denied it too.

307
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:34,965
You'll take his word for it?
Believe in what I say instead.

308
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:36,425
You have no evidence
to prove he's an accomplice.

309
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:38,005
I mean, it's unreasonable.

310
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,005
Someone took the weapon,
so why did he confess?

311
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,845
And why does he keep insisting
that he did it alone

312
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,725
when there's a prime suspect?

313
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,805
-That's--
-It's typical behavior

314
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,435
of him trying to protect his accomplice.

315
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:54,985
Maybe he can't talk
about his situation, like me.

316
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,275
Just like how my father testified
in my place.

317
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:58,985
Does saying that make you feel better?

318
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:02,655
Your father perjured himself
for his family.

319
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,995
But Lee Changwoo is an orphan, unmarried.
He's all alone.

320
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,075
There is no reason for him
to make a false confession.

321
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:07,995
I don't get it.

322
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,205
Because of me,

323
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:12,665
my parents died.

324
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,335
Because I believed
that Lee Changwoo was innocent.

325
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,295
But if it turns out
that he isn't innocent,

326
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:24,635
just what have I done?

327
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:34,515
(Suhyeon sighs)

328
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:37,815
Ms. Kim.

329
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:40,655
Don't feel guilty.

330
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,695
Why should victims suffer in pain

331
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,285
when those guilty are doing just fine?

332
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,995
A sense of guilt
is only for the guilty ones.

333
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:51,165
You are innocent.

334
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,335
Even after such a tragic incident,
you still have to live in pain.

335
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,915
You're a survivor.

336
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,595
DONGRIM: Mom, what about Dad?

337
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,845
Don't just say he's gotten worse.
Give me the details.

338
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,225
Well, since last night...

339
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,515
(groaning)

340
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:16,605
(in sign language)
He's going to worry.

341
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:23,525
Don't tell him. I'm all right.

342
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:26,825
(in Korean)
Don't worry too much.

343
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:29,745
They'll have to run some tests
to know the details.

344
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,575
Tests? Is it serious?

345
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:36,245
He's now in a VIP room?
Who got him the room?

346
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:40,795
Who again?

347
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,095
It's the same.

348
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:52,635
Only a fire detector
on the third floor too.

349
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,045
(grunts)

350
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:34,555
(line ringing)

351
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:38,015
I know why he's trying
to steal the Adamas.

352
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,855
MR. CHOI: The only murder committed
by Lee Changwoo was 22 years ago.

353
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:44,275
The victim was Ha Woosin's father.

354
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,565
The murder weapon disappeared
from the crime scene.

355
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,155
And it turns out to be the Adamas.

356
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,405
Chairman Kwon has it?

357
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,745
MR. CHOI:
Ha Woosin is suspecting Chairman Kwon.

358
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:54,365
This could be a good sign for us.

359
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:58,335
We lost Kwon each time because he wasn't
directly involved in any criminal act.

360
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,835
But if he really is the culprit,
it's a different story.

361
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:02,955
HYUKPIL: Is it credible?

362
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:06,335
I believe so. He also has
the informant's voice recording.

363
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:08,925
Who is it?

364
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,925
Eun Hyesoo, the daughter-in-law
of the Haesong Group family.

365
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:14,885
This sure is a good sign.

366
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:20,935
Why don't we have Ha Woosin join our team?

367
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:22,395
To work together?

368
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,275
He knew about Haesong
and Hwang's relationship

369
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:25,775
and even about
the legalization of firearms.

370
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:31,785
(sighs)
This is an emergency.

371
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:36,825
Shouldn't we just get rid of him?

372
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:39,125
If he joins us,
we'll have to care for him.

373
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:43,585
Come on, I'm not saying
we should join hands with him for real.

374
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,875
MR. CHOI: If we can make good use of him,

375
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,385
our project could be successful.

376
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:54,555
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

377
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:06,645
Mr. Ha.

378
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:08,655
Hello.

379
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,985
Yes, hello. Have you been well?

380
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:12,575
Yes, thanks to you.

381
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:15,495
Where's Mr. Choi?

382
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:17,245
He went hunting.

383
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,955
He often does that during his shift.
Isn't it a fireable offense?

384
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:24,955
Please tell me what you came for.
I'll deliver the message to Mr. Choi.

385
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,625
Well...

386
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,215
MR. CHOI: What's going on?

387
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:36,345
Mr. Choi, Mr. Ha is here to meet you.

388
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:39,805
Me? Why?

389
00:28:40,395 --> 00:28:42,725
I'd like to interview you
for the chairman's memoir.

390
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,145
Sure.

391
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,985
I could use that as an excuse
to slack off.

392
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,195
Have a good day.

393
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,695
You too. Goodbye.

394
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,115
Was it an interview last night too?

395
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:06,125
Move naturally.
Ms. Kwon might be watching.

396
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,955
Ms. Kwon?

397
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,295
I'll feign ignorance if you get caught.
You'd better hurry up and steal it.

398
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,545
Before that,
I need to get rid of risk factors.

399
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:15,715
What risk factors?

400
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,805
What's the fire extinguishing system here?

401
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:20,845
The house only has fire detectors
and no sprinklers.

402
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:24,855
You look like you already know why.

403
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:28,065
There are a lot of expensive artworks
and antiques.

404
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,445
Sprinkling water on them
could cause damage.

405
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,405
We have
a halogen fire extinguishing system.

406
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:36,735
MR. CHOI:
Once heat is detected along with smoke,

407
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:40,285
an alarm goes off immediately
and an announcement begins.

408
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,115
OPERATOR: A fire has broken out.

409
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,625
Please evacuate within three minutes.

410
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,625
Three minutes?

411
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:50,505
Yes, everyone must evacuate
within that time.

412
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:53,005
MR. CHOI: Because firewalls will come down
on each floor.

413
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:54,425
And...

414
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:58,555
Halogen gas is released.

415
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,515
The system blocks oxygen
to extinguish the fire.

416
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:03,595
One could suffocate to death inside.

417
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:04,515
Of course.

418
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,685
If a person with a leg condition
is on the third floor,

419
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,395
they may not be able to evacuate
within three minutes.

420
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,735
-MR. CHOI: That's plausible.
-WOOSIN: Mm.

421
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,945
MR. CHOI: By the way,

422
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:16,865
what is this for?
Why are you asking me this?

423
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:20,195
I'm going to start a fire today.

424
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,495
A fire?

425
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,585
Now, what am I seeing?

426
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:36,965
Excuse me.

427
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:39,595
Ms. Kwon.

428
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,265
I have something to tell you.

429
00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:48,645
So...

430
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,355
you want to thank me?

431
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,735
Yes, I heard you got my dad a VIP room.

432
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:57,275
Oh, that.

433
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,985
I happened to learn about your situation
and it made me feel bad.

434
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:02,445
So I used a bit of my influence.

435
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:05,415
Thank you.

436
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:06,575
Words are not enough.

437
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,915
Nothing in this world is for free.

438
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,835
Okay, how much would you like me
to pay you?

439
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,545
You don't have much money anyway.

440
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,805
But there's something I want you to do.

441
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,805
What is it?

442
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:28,095
Your father needs
to go through a big operation.

443
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:30,975
I could make things convenient for him.

444
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:33,185
I have that much influence.

445
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,855
Should I move up the operation?

446
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:42,365
What is it that you want me to do?

447
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:46,495
No, I can't do that. It's too risky.

448
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:48,995
You're supposed to make
discreet moves, but a fire?

449
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,335
Hear me out first.

450
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:52,335
No, let's make this clear.

451
00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:54,625
I could help you with your plan.

452
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,625
But it doesn't mean
I'm willing to take every risk.

453
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,545
-Mr. Choi.
-You're on your own.

454
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,215
Mr. Choi.

455
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:02,555
I won't do it.

456
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:09,765
Nothing's smooth sailing,
and I'm running out of time.

457
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:12,355
(sighs)

458
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:15,315
(knocking on door)

459
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,985
-It's been a while, Mr. Cho.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,915
You didn't forget
my mother's 70th birthday

461
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,575
and helped my younger sibling get a job.

462
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,455
Thank you, sir.

463
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:35,205
Don't mention it.

464
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,915
You may have been dispatched,
but you're still family.

465
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,085
It's the least I could do.

466
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,715
Here.

467
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,385
Thank you.

468
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:46,425
-Help yourself.
-Yes, sir.

469
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:48,805
Isn't it hard working offsite?

470
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,555
No, sir.

471
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:52,145
Hang in there a little longer.

472
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,185
You should come back to Team A soon.

473
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,565
Yes, sir.

474
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,105
So...

475
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,315
Song Suhyeon came to visit Lee Changwoo?

476
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:05,025
Yes, in the middle of the night.

477
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:06,485
What did he say?

478
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,535
He lashed out at him,
saying stuff about false testimony.

479
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:14,375
That bastard's trying hard.

480
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,705
Lee Changwoo denied the whole thing,

481
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,875
but he asked if it was
to protect an accomplice--

482
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:20,965
Wait.

483
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:27,425
Accomplice?

484
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:31,515
The thing is...

485
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,805
Who is this?

486
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,475
I don't know.

487
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:43,775
A composite sketch?

488
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,865
(phone buzzing)

489
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,745
BROTHER

490
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:54,915
Hi, Mr. Lee.

491
00:33:57,455 --> 00:33:58,625
What?

492
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,175
What does that mean?

493
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,855
A composite sketch artist?

494
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:22,525
This man.

495
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,485
The guy wearing glasses
whom Song called to the funeral.

496
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:28,695
I checked his identity,
and he works for the prosecution.

497
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:31,535
Let's see.

498
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:34,995
The witness is already dead,

499
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,335
but he contacted a composite expert?

500
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:41,045
He visited Lee Changwoo
with the composite sketch

501
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,335
and lashed out at him about an accomplice.

502
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,175
Mr. Jeong.

503
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:48,635
What do you think this means?

504
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:51,135
Kim Wonjoong fooled us.

505
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:56,095
It was the daughter.

506
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:03,775
CHANGWOO: Who did you say

507
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,985
you were?

508
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:11,615
I'm the witness.

509
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,665
My father gave false testimony
in my place.

510
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:20,585
To protect me.

511
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:23,835
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,755
There's no need to apologize.

513
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,595
Nor to come visit me
after all these years.

514
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,265
I am

515
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,265
the culprit anyway.

516
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:36,885
No, I saw it.

517
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,815
The man from that night wasn't you.

518
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,695
SEOHEE: I remember clearly.

519
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,665
Are you sure about what you remember?

520
00:35:58,165 --> 00:35:59,455
Yes.

521
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,535
How old were you at the time?

522
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,335
I was seven.

523
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,095
What a pity.

524
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,515
The memory of a 7-year-old
from 22 years ago.

525
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,725
No one's going to believe it.

526
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:20,855
-But--
-Go back.

527
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:24,065
Go back,

528
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,355
and leave everything behind.

529
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,815
My dad committed suicide
after killing my mom.

530
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,785
The same night
Song Soonho's son came to visit.

531
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,165
You know Prosecutor Song?

532
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:42,165
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

533
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,625
And I need to find out who did it.

534
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:48,875
What on earth

535
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,675
have you two been doing?

536
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:55,005
I thought you were framed.

537
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,725
So I went to meet Mr. Song myself.

538
00:36:58,555 --> 00:36:59,515
(hand thumps)

539
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:05,015
Stop with your crazy imagination
and come to your senses.

540
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:06,855
It's all in the past, so why?

541
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,855
-We must make it right.
-Enough!

542
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,905
I said I'm the culprit.

543
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,365
I did it.

544
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:26,335
We're done talking.

545
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:30,125
You're why I started this,
but I can't back down.

546
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:31,965
I'm going to see this through.

547
00:37:45,935 --> 00:37:47,395
You aren't the culprit.

548
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,745
(sighs)

549
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:07,705
No.

550
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,425
(foreboding music)

551
00:38:25,855 --> 00:38:26,895
What is it?

552
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:30,855
What do you mean?

553
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,775
You've been glancing at me.

554
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:38,825
Well, it's just that I'm curious

555
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:41,115
about why Ms. Kwon hates you.

556
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:45,035
I'm not sure. You don't need
a reason to hate someone.

557
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,375
Maybe you did something
to cause a misunderstanding.

558
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:50,165
I don't know. Why don't you find out?

559
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,965
I'm going to go call my mom.

560
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,555
My dad's test results should be out.

561
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:02,175
His condition has worsened a little.

562
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:08,555
(door opens, closes)

563
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:11,355
That's why he's in a bad mood.

564
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,275
He's in critical condition.

565
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,695
He was fine up until this morning.

566
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:25,455
He might need surgery right away.

567
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,455
DONGRIM: Right away?

568
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,875
But why? This is too sudden!

569
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:35,925
Dongrim.

570
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:40,095
What? What did you say, Mom?

571
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,345
He got worse after moving to the VIP room?

572
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:47,345
Or should I move up the operation?

573
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:51,815
It can't be...

574
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,615
Why is he going there?

575
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,845
This is what you meant?

576
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,765
-Did you really--
-What?

577
00:40:27,765 --> 00:40:29,145
This is your doing.

578
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:31,355
-What are you talking about?
-I know it all.

579
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:33,895
My dad's condition worsened
after he was moved to the VIP room.

580
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:36,355
You did that on purpose
to make use of me--

581
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,485
If you know,
what do you think you should do?

582
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,945
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

583
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,695
I can't betray Mr. Ha.

584
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:47,955
How will you know until you've tried?
It's not that hard.

585
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,705
When the chairman comes, I'll tell him.

586
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,995
That you blackmailed me.

587
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,545
Enough.
You need to think about your family.

588
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,835
Is loyalty more important to you
than your father's life?

589
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,925
No, I won't do it.

590
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:08,845
Goodness. What...

591
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,145
Oh, my. That must hurt a lot.

592
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:14,895
Are you okay?

593
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:17,145
Stop spacing out and come in.

594
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:19,855
Okay.

595
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,695
This is driving me crazy.

596
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:32,575
He has no clue what's happening to me.
Where did he go this time?

597
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,335
(sighs)

598
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:44,885
I need to start at four o'clock.

599
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,435
MS. KWON: Why can't you tell me?

600
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:57,685
I asked why you're often
with the writer lately.

601
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,645
I told you before
that I'd follow up on him.

602
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,905
He wanted to interview me,
so I thought I'd use that.

603
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:10,405
Really? Did you find anything suspicious?

604
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:12,785
Not really.

605
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,245
Look, Mr. Choi.

606
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,625
You're too competent
to settle for working here.

607
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:26,845
You deserve more than this.

608
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:30,595
What do you mean?

609
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:34,435
You used to be an ace in the police force.

610
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,055
You'd better stick to your expertise.

611
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:37,225
(awkward chuckle)

612
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:40,065
Well, I'd love to.

613
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:41,985
Your predecessor became a manager

614
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:45,195
at someplace nice thanks to my influence.

615
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:50,945
Continue to keep
a close eye on the writer.

616
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,825
Yes, ma'am.

617
00:42:54,915 --> 00:42:57,375
But why do you mind him this much?

618
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,705
He's going to leave
once he's done with the memoir.

619
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,835
He's got an ulterior motive.

620
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:07,635
Apparently, he's here
to get some info for his next piece.

621
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:12,175
I wondered
what kind of information he was after.

622
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,055
It's just drawing my attention.

623
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,645
Even more because I look like him.

624
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,525
I'm sure he's digging into
Mr. Minjo's helicopter case.

625
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,785
That woman's completely mistaken.

626
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:36,325
She thinks you're planning to write
about the accident in your next piece.

627
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:39,705
That's good.

628
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,335
What, was this your angle?

629
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:43,585
You said Ms. Kwon was suspicious of me.

630
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,125
So I gave her something different
from my original purpose.

631
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:48,425
Why?

632
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:50,095
I thought she'd take the bait.

633
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:53,845
She'd do anything
to protect Chairman Kwon.

634
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:56,435
Why would you bring him up here?

635
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:58,515
Kwon Minjo.

636
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:01,315
The chairman adored him
more than his firstborn.

637
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:04,275
Everyone believed
that he'd be the heir of Haesong.

638
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:06,815
But he died in a helicopter accident.

639
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,905
And there's a heliport in this house.

640
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:11,865
Don't you find it strange?

641
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:14,495
The father still uses helicopters
even when his son died because of one.

642
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,455
Are you suggesting
the chairman killed him?

643
00:44:17,205 --> 00:44:20,575
You don't know how much
he adored Kwon Minjo. You're wrong.

644
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:21,835
Then how about this?

645
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:26,795
Ms. Kwon said, "I'm sure he's digging into
Mr. Minjo's helicopter case," right?

646
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,295
What about it? I just don't...

647
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:33,805
The helicopter case.

648
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,515
Not an accident,

649
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:38,635
but a case.

650
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:41,975
When I showed interest in Kwon Minjo,

651
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,065
Ms. Kwon reacted offensively.

652
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:45,775
That means she knows something.

653
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:54,075
Don't worry.
It will just be a minor incident.

654
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:56,245
I'll say I heard
about the helicopter accident

655
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:59,115
during the interview with Ms. Eun.
And that's true.

656
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:01,245
No, that was a foolish move.

657
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:05,295
The Ms. Kwon I know would've reported it
to the chairman right away.

658
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,255
And you would've been kicked out.

659
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,375
Nevertheless, she's holding her tongue

660
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,135
because she's looking for a spy.

661
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,715
He has an informant in this house.

662
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:19,095
You said yourself that in the woods,

663
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,265
the writer was looking for someone.

664
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,555
That's all in the past.

665
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:26,475
No, look at this note.

666
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:32,985
What, take notes on good ideas?

667
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,695
As if I'd fall for that lie.

668
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:40,705
Whoever it is,
I'm going to find them no matter what.

669
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:44,995
You wouldn't know how persistent she is.

670
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:47,375
She might discover everything
at this rate.

671
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:50,625
Then I'd better hurry.
It'll be four o'clock soon.

672
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:53,005
What... Are you really going to do it?

673
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:54,505
You'll help me, right?

674
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,435
Four o'clock?

675
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,055
That's when the chairman returns.

676
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:06,315
Ms. Kwon will go out to the heliport
to greet him.

677
00:46:06,895 --> 00:46:08,935
So you don't want her to get hurt?

678
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:11,025
She may not be able to evacuate
within three minutes.

679
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,565
What a humanist.

680
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:15,065
Today, I'm just going to check

681
00:46:15,155 --> 00:46:17,325
if the Adamas is there
while the others are evacuating.

682
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,285
No one should be harmed.

683
00:46:19,365 --> 00:46:20,535
You said you'd cause a fire.

684
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:21,825
A fake one.

685
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:26,165
The heat and smoke detectors must be
activated together for an alarm to go off.

686
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,745
But if one of the detectors is down

687
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:29,585
and a fire signal is manually turned on,

688
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,505
everyone will think of it
as a malfunction.

689
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:34,675
-CHEF 1: It's so heavy.
-CHEF 2: Watch your head.

690
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:37,965
Goodness, you're big enough
to handle this much.

691
00:46:38,055 --> 00:46:40,385
-It's heavy.
-Thanks, chef.

692
00:46:41,095 --> 00:46:43,975
-You have my respect.
-Be careful. Let's go.

693
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:45,685
(grunts)

694
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,115
(suspenseful music)

695
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:18,595
(grunts)

696
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,055
There.

697
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,605
No, leave it. We'll take care of it, sir.

698
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:32,065
It's fine. Take your time smoking.

699
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:33,735
Thank you, chef.

700
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:36,945
(Mr. Choi grunts)

701
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:42,655
(suspenseful music continues)

702
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:10,435
What? Why is this locked?

703
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:14,185
Darn it.

704
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:17,905
(panting)

705
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:22,155
(grunts)

706
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:25,865
Chef.

707
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,865
What... Oh, Mr. Ha.

708
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:36,125
Could I ask you to make a special dish?

709
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:37,465
A special dish?

710
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:41,005
Yes, stir-fried seafood.

711
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,805
CHEF: Come on, that's not a special dish.

712
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:46,885
How did you know
that my expertise is Chinese cuisine?

713
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:48,015
(chef laughs)

714
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,595
-Would you like it for dinner?
-No, for a snack. I'm a bit hungry.

715
00:48:51,355 --> 00:48:53,315
Sure thing. I'll have it ready for you.

716
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:55,685
At around four o'clock.

717
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:57,605
Four?

718
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:00,195
Yes, at four. Will it be possible?

719
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:03,825
Well, sure.
I'll make it delicious for you.

720
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:05,905
CHEF: Full of smoky flavor.

721
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:07,325
WOOSIN: Thank you.

722
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:13,625
-It's done.
-Thanks.

723
00:49:19,215 --> 00:49:21,385
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

724
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,885
I inquired about the number you mentioned.

725
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,675
-Is it a burner phone?
-Yes.

726
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:28,845
I thought so.

727
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:31,225
CHIEF GONG: What is this case about?

728
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:33,645
(sighs)
Mr. Gong.

729
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,395
If I don't know what to do,

730
00:49:36,565 --> 00:49:38,485
I'd better just go for it, right?

731
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:41,855
Right, go straight without turning back.
That's your motto.

732
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:43,525
REPORTER KIM SEOHEE

733
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:47,035
-Oh, is it perhaps about your love life?
-Jeez.

734
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:50,245
Make a bet. All-in.

735
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:52,785
-(scoffs)
-(phone buzzing)

736
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,375
Hello?

737
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:59,665
Make time for me.
I have something to tell you.

738
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,715
Yes, I'll be waiting.

739
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:14,265
(sighs)

740
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:18,355
How did I end up exposing my face?

741
00:50:18,855 --> 00:50:20,145
Damn it.

742
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,275
-(scoffs)
-(knocking on door)

743
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:28,785
Sir, Kim Seohee visited
Lee Changwoo as well.

744
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,495
-What?
-Here's the recording.

745
00:50:33,455 --> 00:50:34,325
(scoffs)

746
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:36,915
What do they take us for?

747
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,585
Why are they so damn annoying?

748
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:42,125
(growls)

749
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:45,835
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir.

750
00:50:45,925 --> 00:50:47,545
-Let's clean them up.
-All three of them?

751
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:48,715
Not Lee Changwoo.

752
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:51,345
Let's kill them all.
To prevent future problems.

753
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,935
He's under our control, so why?

754
00:50:57,395 --> 00:50:59,225
Let's just take care of the two bastards.

755
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,565
Yes, sir.

756
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:05,485
(tense music)

757
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,025
(deep sigh)

758
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:22,335
-CHIEF JEONG: And...
-Mr. Jeong.

759
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:26,885
Look, Mr. Jeong.

760
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:29,675
I'd like to work in the field this time.

761
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,555
It's an exclusive operation.

762
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,345
Oh, come on.

763
00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:39,435
I want to make my brother proud too.

764
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:42,565
Given my experience, I don't want
my juniors to look down on me.

765
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:46,025
Please?

766
00:51:47,155 --> 00:51:49,695
Is that so? All right then.

767
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,695
Really? Are you sure?
Don't go back on your word.

768
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:55,075
Don't...

769
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:57,825
Mr. Jeong.

770
00:51:57,915 --> 00:52:00,625
I know. This will be a chance
for him to realize his place.

771
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:04,375
He'll mess up for sure.
When he does, cover up for him.

772
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,625
But if the team leader finds out...

773
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:09,425
He needs to know
that his little brother's a loser.

774
00:52:30,865 --> 00:52:34,075
SEOHEE: Why aren't you saying anything?
I told you I went to meet Lee Changwoo.

775
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:37,495
(clicks tongue)

776
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:42,585
So you become speechless
when you're angry.

777
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:44,835
And you make jokes when you feel guilty?

778
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,045
(chuckles)

779
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:47,915
Is this funny to you?

780
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:50,835
What if that man takes notice?

781
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,425
You're much more reckless
than I thought you'd be.

782
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,965
Who is that man?

783
00:52:56,055 --> 00:52:58,305
Are you going to fear him
without knowing who he really is?

784
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,595
We needed to set up a trap.

785
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:03,315
A trap? Are you saying
you visited Lee Changwoo on purpose?

786
00:53:03,395 --> 00:53:06,105
I should go into the tiger's den
if I want to catch it.

787
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:10,735
Ms. Kim, you need to be careful.
Or you could get in real trouble.

788
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:13,405
You also visited Lee Changwoo on purpose,

789
00:53:13,615 --> 00:53:14,735
knowing he'd be watching.

790
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:15,945
Because I--

791
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:19,035
Wait and see. He will approach us somehow.

792
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:21,995
(sighs)

793
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:29,835
What's with that face?

794
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,255
He already did.

795
00:53:40,055 --> 00:53:42,975
"At 11 tonight under the southern pier
of Dangsan Railway Bridge."

796
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:46,435
I tracked the number,
and it was a burner phone.

797
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,605
-Will you go?
-I should.

798
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,365
It could really be dangerous.

799
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:55,365
If he wanted to kill me,
I'd be gone already.

800
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:57,655
He probably has something to tell me
in person.

801
00:53:58,245 --> 00:53:59,195
I should hear him out.

802
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,285
(solemn music)

803
00:54:13,385 --> 00:54:14,215
I'll do it.

804
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:32,775
I have to save Dad first.

805
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:34,985
I have no choice.

806
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:39,655
I can explain this to Mr. Ha later.
He will understand.

807
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:44,915
(sizzling)

808
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:47,875
Take it easy.
You're going to start a fire.

809
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:50,875
Ms. Oh, when it comes to Chinese food,

810
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,215
fire is the key.

811
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:59,845
(sizzling continues)

812
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,015

00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,105
What?

818
00:55:50,185 --> 00:55:52,065
I don't know. Maybe it's malfunctioning.

819
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:54,485
I told you to take it easy.

820
00:55:54,565 --> 00:55:57,405
Don't blame me. I didn't do anything much.

821
00:55:57,985 --> 00:55:59,815
Anyway, we must get out of here

822
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:01,695
before the firewalls come down.

823
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:03,905
-Okay.
-Everyone, get out. Now!

-What's going on?
-Let's hurry outside first.

828
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,755
A fire?

829
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,885
OPERATOR: A fire has broken out.

830
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,555

00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:07,225
What's going on?

835
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,725
A fire alarm went off
in the main building.

836
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:09,805
What?

837
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,985
(panting)

838
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,315
It's not here. This isn't the place.

839
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:24,865
OPERATOR: The fire alert system
has been activated. A fire has broken out.

Please evacuate within three minutes.

841
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,745
The heat detector has reacted,
but the smoke detector is off.

842
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:33,245
It could be a malfunction then.
Should I deactivate the system?

843
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:37,165
No, it could also be a real fire.
Go grasp the situation.

844
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:38,165
Yes, sir.

848

-MAID 5: Yes.

850
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:03,195
What happened? A fire?

851
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:06,785
I think it's a false alarm.

852
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:08,535
There was no fire. I'm sure of it.

853
00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:10,075
A false alarm?

854
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:12,825
That's a relief.

855
00:58:13,165 --> 00:58:14,075
Is everyone here?

856
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:17,295
All the staff members are here,
but we can't find Mr. Ha.

857
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:21,675
Where is he?

858
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:24,135
Oh, over there.

859
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,675
Didn't you hear the announcement?
What took you so--

860
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:32,225
Well, Dongrim.

861
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:34,265
Gosh, he's here. I was looking for him.

862
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,765
Hey, Dongrim.

863
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:37,765
Mr. Ha!

864

Thank goodness you're safe.
I was looking for you.

865
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,945
I can't find Ms. Yoon.

866
00:58:45,195 --> 00:58:46,735
She can't hear.

867
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:50,865
Where's her room?

868
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:53,325
You're going to go inside?

869
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:55,825
It's dangerous.
The firewalls will come down soon.

870
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:58,795
Where is her room? Tell me!

871
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:00,125
MS. KWON: The third floor.

872
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,425
Go to the master's bedroom.
She should be there.

873
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:05,135
I told her to do something there.

874
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:07,965
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

875

(closing theme music)

900
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:34,945
I can involve anyone
in order to catch the real culprit.

901
01:03:35,025 --> 01:03:35,985
Kang Hyukpil of the SIH.

MS. LEE: I'm certain.

903
01:03:37,195 --> 01:03:39,025
The man in the composite
and Chairman Kang are related.

WOOSIN: We have 16 days.

909
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:54,375
If the Adamas was the murder weapon,
I can have Chairman Kwon stand trial.

910
01:03:54,465 --> 01:03:55,675
I've decided on the D-day.

911
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:57,465
I'm going to steal it tonight.
