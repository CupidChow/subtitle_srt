1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,006
(theme music)

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,337
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,887
HYESOO: <i>I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.</i>

5
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,931
<i>But this is what my husband said.</i>

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo...</i>

7
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>was the one who took the fall."</i>

8
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,191
Is this enough?

9
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,027
Enough evidence that Chairman Kwon
is directly involved in this case?

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,699
Do you even want to get him?
Why are you hesitating?

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,000
So it isn't that you couldn't.
He got away with it

12
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,543
while you were hesitating.

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
Wait.

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,355
Do you think it's going to work?

15
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,734
-I'm quite lucky, you see.
-And you have a plan?

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,736
I wouldn't have started if I didn't.

17
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,197
-If you decide to join me...
-Then you'll tell me?

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,032
Are you going to
ask questions all night long?

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,534
Let me ask one last question.

20
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,954
How did you find out who I really am?

21
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,707
You'll get an answer to that
once everything is over.

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,751
Now is not the time.

23
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,176
(sighs)

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,976
All right, let's do this.

25
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,728
But this doesn't mean
we're on the same team,

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,813
so don't be mistaken.

27
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,440
Especially Eun Hyesoo.

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,943
I don't trust her.

29
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,112
She must never find out who I really am.

30
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,281
Do you understand?

31
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,549
What a long day it's been for you.

32
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,261
Threatening me and stopping the chairman
from going on his trip.

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,723
And you got what you wanted for both.
Congratulations.

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,349
I won't be apologetic.

35
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,561
Because your letter started this.

36
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,276
You're really annoying.

37
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,653
Don't you get that a lot?

38
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,738
Yes.

39
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,658
Anyway, I'm sorry
the situation turned out like this.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,662
It really was unexpected.

41
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,748
To have you come to this house.

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,459
The Adamas is here, so I had to come.

43
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,462
I thought Song Suhyeon would make a move.

44
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,714
He seemed quite capable when I checked.

45
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,135
No, let's leave him out of this.

46
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,387
Don't tell me...

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,475
Your brother doesn't know
about Lee Changwoo?

48
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,436
SUHYEON: <i>All right.</i>

49
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,314
Let's get back to the subject.

50
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,399
Who is this?

51
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,780
Well...

52
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,491
I don't know.

53
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,911
Then I'll change the question.

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,623
Who took the murder weapon?

55
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,000
Why would you ask me that?

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,168
You don't know that either?

57
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,465
I don't. I really don't know.

58
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,801
Are you sure he didn't take it?

59
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,011
No, sir. I don't know him.

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,265
This case occurred 22 years ago,
and I already confessed to it.

61
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
It was a false confession.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,727
Why would I...

63
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,607
do that?

64
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,278
Because you wanted
to protect this bastard!

65
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,904
Damn it!

66
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,492
Because he was an accomplice!

67
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,333
(growls)

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,715
Look forward to it.

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,804
I'll reveal everything
you're hiding one by one.

70
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,849
(breathing heavily)

71
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,399
(sighs loudly)

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,283
(annoyed grunt)

73
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,963
I'm disappointed in Prosecutor Song.

74
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,718
I thought he'd at least pretend
to investigate it, but he's clueless.

75
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,221
Let's stop talking about him.
I find it unpleasant.

76
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,599
All right.

77
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
Right.

78
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,438
What will happen if Lee Changwoo dies?

79
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,483
What do you mean?

80
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,943
Candidate Hwang of New Future Party
held a press conference.

81
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,157
Let me declare right here that my pledge

82
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,077
to reintroduce the death penalty

83
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,330
is not just a wild idea.

84
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,584
If I get elected, I will sign
an immediate death warrant

85
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:21,798
during the transition period!

86
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,135
You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.

87
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,596
Time's not on your side.

88
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,568
He...

89
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,363
He's innocent.

90
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,699
What do you mean?

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,827
He is...

92
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,664
He's your...

93
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,167
Your biological father.

94
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,424
Lee...

95
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,094
Changwoo.

96
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,225
HYESOO: <i>You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.</i>

97
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,978
<i>Time's not on your side.</i>

98
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,569
I'm sure it's here.

99
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,196
The Adamas.

100
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,199
REPORTER: <i>Candidate Hwang Byungchul
of New Future Party</i>

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,076
<i>held an emergency press conference</i>

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,328
<i>and declared he'll reintroduce
the death penalty</i>

103
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,165
<i>during the transition period

104
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,169
<i>The Prison Service is preparing
to be on emergency duty</i>

105
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>in case it agitates
the long-term condemned inmates.</i>

106
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,049
<i>And the Ministry of Justice
is showing opinions</i>

107
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,385
<i>that they should be prepared
for the death penalty system.</i>

108
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,264
ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER
UNDER RESPECT FOR HUMANS

109
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,439
(car beeps)

110
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,860
SEOHEE: <i>If Lee Changwoo gets executed,</i>

111
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,654
<i>you'll never get to find the real culprit
behind your father's murder.</i>

112
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,590
(knife clacking)

113
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,429
(sizzling)

114
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,644
(knife clacking)

115
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,160
In case you don't eat it.
You could get punished for leaving food.

116
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,330
I'm willing to get punished
if I can hit you just once.

117
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,581
You're getting cranky again.

118
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,166
You should thank me instead

119
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,460
for making a special order
for this fancy healthy dish.

120
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,254
Aren't you too young
to care about healthy food?

121
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,173
There's something you don't know.

122
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,175
What is it?

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,136
Actually, I...

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,021
"Don't forget.
I have the letter that you sent."

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,441
What letter?

126
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,903
Don't look at me. Ask Mr. Ha.

127
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,406
Huh? Mr. Ha?

128
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,491
Did you go through the trash bin
in the study?

129
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
I wonder who sent the letter.

130
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,162
And you put the ripped pieces together.

131
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,164
I wonder what was written in that letter.

132
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,958
(Woosin sighs)

133
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,837
I'm a writer, Ms. Kwon.

134
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,966
I take notes about things
that come to my mind.

135
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,802
If I don't like it,
I dump it in the trash.

136
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,763
Oh, dear. I guess I'm barking up
the wrong tree again.

137
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,605
If you don't like me,

138
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,858
take it out on that person
who recommended me.

139
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,744
(chuckles)
Excuse me.

140
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,912
Mr. Ha, wait for me.

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,882
She must be bothered by Mr. Ha.

142
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,884
What?

143
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,263
I mean, Ms. Kwon.
She looks at him like this.

144
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,849
She already has snake eyes.

145
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,102
Ms. Kwon doesn't like anyone

146
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,313
except for the chairman.

147
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,899
She hates mankind itself.

148
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,609
(Agent Park chuckles)

149
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,613
-(clears throat)
-Gosh, it's good. Mmm.

150
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,206
I wonder why Ms. Kwon hates you so much.

151
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,417
People usually hate you,
but this is too soon.

152
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,503
Tell me about it.

153
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,422
But what was that about taking notes?
You don't do such a thing.

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,632
It's none of your business.

155
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,634
Where are you going?

156
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,135
To interview the chairman.

157
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
Ah.

158
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,056
I'll be in the study!

159
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,601
Is she jealous?

160
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,437
Because the chairman
seems to be fond of Mr. Ha?

161
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,820
Did I not tell him
that the interview was postponed?

162
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,039
A raised floor could mean
that something is underneath.

163
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,305
(somber music)

164
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,312
Is the chairman in his bedroom?

165
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,858
I'm supposed to interview him.

166
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,326
HE WENT TO THE HEAD OFFICE

167
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,122
Oh, I forgot. Okay.

168
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,301
Would you happen to know
when he will return?

169
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,723
Four o'clock?

170
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,317
Seeing how he left without her,
he went to meet Mr. Hyunjo.

171
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,904
(sighs)
Still, he should've had her company.

172
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,781
How did the thing go?

173
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,367
I see.

174
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,078
Then I'll have to wait.

175
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,956
Will he take the bait?

176
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,753
Who might you be?

177
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,505
I HAVE THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT

178
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,468
Really?

179
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,221
Good work.

180
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,954
It's the posthumous work
of the artist, Baek Dongsun.

181
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,581
I guess it's expensive.

182
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,876
More than what you'll earn
in your lifetime.

183
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,506
I tried to find out who recommended you,
but the info was locked.

184
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,716
-That means...
-It's classified.

185
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,719
Oh, that's a bad sign.

186
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,847
That means there's an ulterior motive.

187
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,849
I'll think of a way
to find out who it was.

188
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,059
Since you don't have much time.

189
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,646
Are you worried about me?

190
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,273
That's absurd.

191
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,110
How beautiful.

192
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,414
This house is like...

193
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,710
a large museum.

194
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,260
It's one of the early works of Roman.

195
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,721
WOOSIN: I bet its price is much higher.

196
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,556
You want to know how much it is?

197
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,100
I want to know something else.

198
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,270
The secret room on the third floor.

199
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,485
Why is it locked? What's in there?

200
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,286
HYUNJO: <i>The information leaked?</i>

201
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,080
We're in a tricky situation.

202
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,500
The writer I hired for my memoir.

203
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,628
His pupil knows sign language.

204
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,838
Should I call Mr. Lee over?

205
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,090
If word of the legalization
of firearms gets out,

206
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,509
it can't be covered up easily.

207
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
Hyunjo.

208
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,473
Don't rely on Mr. Lee too much.

209
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,225
Good medicine can be poisonous
if you overdose on it.

210
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,145
They won't be going anywhere
until the election is over.

211
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,230
Things will be okay.

212
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,566
-But--
-Don't say but.

213
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,319
I don't need your permission.

214
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,614
I apologize, Father.

215
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,241
It's not your concern.

216
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,081
I guess you're very fond of that writer,

217
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,502
seeing how you're taking extra measures.

218
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,382
That has nothing to do with it.

219
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,095
Anyway, I came to talk to you
about something else.

220
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,931
The 80th-anniversary event.

221
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,518
Don't worry about that.
It's being prepared without a hitch.

222
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,478
No, I'm thinking of changing the plan.

223
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,772
How?

224
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,775
I'm quite concerned
about my health these days.

225
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,488
I'm not sure
how long I'll be able to work.

226
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,032
So...

227
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,326
I plan to retire.

228
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,455
Pardon?

229
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,542
It will be your time now.

230
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,628
(ominous music)

231
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,305
PRESIDENT ROOM

232
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,779
(grunts)

233
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,924
KWON: <i>It will be your time now.</i>

234
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,926
MINJO: <i>That's not what I want.</i>

235
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,137
It's not what you want?

236
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,305
No.

237
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,599
Why not?

238
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,102
I don't want to live like you, Father.

239
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,980
What does that mean?

240
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,482
I'm aware of it all.

241
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,568
Of what?

242
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,696
Everything.

243
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,495
When I was younger,
I was proud of Haesong.

244
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,038
But now,

245
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm ashamed of it.

246
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,544
-Minjo.
-It's a crime to amass a fortune

247
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,254
through bloodshed.

248
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,593
Do you want to make me a criminal too?

249
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,016
It's such a shame,

250
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,894
the more I think about it.

251
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,661
Kwon Minjo's room?

252
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
Yes.

253
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,087
Nothing in this room has changed
since the accident.

254
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,223
The Adamas isn't here.

255
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,184
As I expected.

256
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,728
You did?

257
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,398
You lock a room for security reasons.

258
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,026
But I doubted
they would make it this obvious.

259
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,030
I thought it'd be something precious,
if not something expensive.

260
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,033
Precious enough for Chairman Kwon
to keep it near his bedroom.

261
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,290
This is the most I can do to help.

262
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,167
I don't know where the Adamas is either.

263
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,629
Don't worry. I won't bother you anymore.

264
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,049
But why do you seem like
you have a lot to say?

265
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,176
Ms. Eun.

266
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,136
Please keep this...

267
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,934
a secret from Suhyeon.

268
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,605
I can't promise you that.

269
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,533
You must've forgotten
that you threatened me.

270
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
-That's--
-Mr. Ha.

271
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,080
I don't know when you'll betray me.

272
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,334
I need a card up my sleeve too,
don't you think?

273
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,384
But I wonder why it has to be
a secret from your brother.

274
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,096
Is there a reason why he shouldn't know?

275
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,025
(door opens, closes)

276
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,276
I'm curious

277
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,071
about that story.

278
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
YOUNG SUHYEON: Wow.

279
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,894
TOY WORLD

280
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,904
Do you want it?

281
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,489
Dad.

282
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,784
Want me to buy it for you?

283
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,577
Yes.

284
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,288
I mean, no.

285
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,125
What's with that answer?
Should I buy it for you or not?

286
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,419
You have no money.

287
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,589
So you noticed.

288
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,885
But son, I have some money stashed away.

289
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,221
And it's Children's Day soon.

290
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,973
How about that figurine as a gift?

291
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,186
Forget it. I'm not even a kid anymore.

292
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,855
Hey, you brat.

293
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:59,109
You're always a kid to me.
Because you're my son.

294
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,279
(somber music)

295
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,807
MR. GONG

296
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,309
CHIEF GONG: <i>Hello?</i>

297
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,895
I'll send you a number.
Get me the personal info of its owner.

298
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,523
<i>-Sir, you need to come into work--</i>
-It's urgent. Today, please.

299
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,525
CHIEF GONG: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

300
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,758
I promise.

301
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,803
I'll catch the culprit no matter what.

302
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,354
SUHYEON: Are you certain?

303
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,065
That man in the composite sketch
is the real culprit?

304
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,235
-Yes.
-No, he's an accomplice.

305
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,112
I disagree with you.

306
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,738
Lee Changwoo denied it too.

307
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,950
You'll take his word for it?
Believe in what I say instead.

308
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,410
You have no evidence
to prove he's an accomplice.

309
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,994
I mean, it's unreasonable.

310
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,997
Someone took the weapon,
so why did he confess?

311
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,835
And why does he keep insisting
that he did it alone

312
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,712
when there's a prime suspect?

313
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,798
-That's--
-It's typical behavior

314
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,425
of him trying to protect his accomplice.

315
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,970
Maybe he can't talk
about his situation, like me.

316
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,264
Just like how my father testified
in my place.

317
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,974
Does saying that make you feel better?

318
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,644
Your father perjured himself
for his family.

319
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,980
But Lee Changwoo is an orphan, unmarried.
He's all alone.

320
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,065
There is no reason for him
to make a false confession.

321
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,983
I don't get it.

322
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,192
Because of me,

323
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,654
my parents died.

324
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,323
Because I believed
that Lee Changwoo was innocent.

325
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,288
But if it turns out
that he isn't innocent,

326
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,624
just what have I done?

327
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,509
(Suhyeon sighs)

328
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,804
Ms. Kim.

329
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,640
Don't feel guilty.

330
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,685
Why should victims suffer in pain

331
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,270
when those guilty are doing just fine?

332
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,981
A sense of guilt
is only for the guilty ones.

333
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,151
You are innocent.

334
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,322
Even after such a tragic incident,
you still have to live in pain.

335
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,909
You're a survivor.

336
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,582
DONGRIM: <i>Mom, what about Dad?</i>

337
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,835
Don't just say he's gotten worse.
Give me the details.

338
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,214
Well, since last night...

339
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,507
(groaning)

340
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,593
(in sign language)
He's going to worry.

341
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:18,517
Don't tell him. I'm all right.

342
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,811
(in Korean)
Don't worry too much.

343
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,731
They'll have to run some tests
to know the details.

344
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,567
Tests? Is it serious?

345
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,238
He's now in a VIP room?
Who got him the room?

346
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,784
Who again?

347
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,085
It's the same.

348
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,629
Only a fire detector
on the third floor too.

349
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,034
(grunts)

350
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,546
(line ringing)

351
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,008
I know why he's trying
to steal the Adamas.

352
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,845
MR. CHOI: <i>The only murder committed
by Lee Changwoo was 22 years ago.</i>

353
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,264
<i>The victim was Ha Woosin's father.</i>

354
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,558
<i>The murder weapon disappeared
from the crime scene.</i>

355
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,143
<i>And it turns out to be the Adamas.</i>

356
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,395
Chairman Kwon has it?

357
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,731
MR. CHOI:
<i>Ha Woosin is suspecting Chairman Kwon.</i>

358
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
This could be a good sign for us.

359
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,320
We lost Kwon each time because he wasn't
directly involved in any criminal act.

360
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,823
But if he really is the culprit,
it's a different story.

361
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,949
HYUKPIL: <i>Is it credible?</i>

362
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,328
I believe so. He also has
the informant's voice recording.

363
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,913
Who is it?

364
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,916
Eun Hyesoo, the daughter-in-law
of the Haesong Group family.

365
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,878
This sure is a good sign.

366
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,925
Why don't we have Ha Woosin join our team?

367
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,385
To work together?

368
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,262
He knew about Haesong
and Hwang's relationship

369
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,764
and even about
the legalization of firearms.

370
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,770
(sighs)
This is an emergency.

371
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,816
Shouldn't we just get rid of him?

372
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,110
If he joins us,
we'll have to care for him.

373
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,573
Come on, I'm not saying
we should join hands with him for real.

374
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,867
MR. CHOI: <i>If we can make good use of him,</i>

375
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,371
our project could be successful.

376
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,542
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

377
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,638
Mr. Ha.

378
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,640
Hello.

379
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,975
Yes, hello. Have you been well?

380
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
Yes, thanks to you.

381
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,480
Where's Mr. Choi?

382
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,232
He went hunting.

383
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,944
He often does that during his shift.
Isn't it a fireable offense?

384
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,948
Please tell me what you came for.
I'll deliver the message to Mr. Choi.

385
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,616
Well...

386
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,205
MR. CHOI: What's going on?

387
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,334
Mr. Choi, Mr. Ha is here to meet you.

388
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,796
Me? Why?

389
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,716
I'd like to interview you
for the chairman's memoir.

390
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,135
Sure.

391
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,971
I could use that as an excuse
to slack off.

392
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,183
Have a good day.

393
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,685
You too. Goodbye.

394
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,108
Was it an interview last night too?

395
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,114
Move naturally.
Ms. Kwon might be watching.

396
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,949
Ms. Kwon?

397
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,286
I'll feign ignorance if you get caught.
You'd better hurry up and steal it.

398
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,539
Before that,
I need to get rid of risk factors.

399
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,707
What risk factors?

400
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,792
What's the fire extinguishing system here?

401
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,837
The house only has fire detectors
and no sprinklers.

402
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,841
You look like you already know why.

403
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,052
There are a lot of expensive artworks
and antiques.

404
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,430
Sprinkling water on them
could cause damage.

405
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,392
We have
a halogen fire extinguishing system.

406
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,728
MR. CHOI:
<i>Once heat is detected along with smoke,</i>

407
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,273
<i>an alarm goes off immediately
and an announcement begins.</i>

408
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,108
OPERATOR: <i>A fire has broken out.</i>

409
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,611
<i>Please evacuate within three minutes.</i>

410
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,613
Three minutes?

411
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,492
Yes, everyone must evacuate
within that time.

412
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,994
MR. CHOI: <i>Because firewalls will come down
on each floor.</i>

413
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,412
<i>And...</i>

414
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
<i>Halogen gas is released.</i>

415
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,503
<i>The system blocks oxygen
to extinguish the fire.</i>

416
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,588
One could suffocate to death inside.

417
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,506
Of course.

418
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,674
If a person with a leg condition
is on the third floor,

419
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,385
they may not be able to evacuate
within three minutes.

420
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,721
-MR. CHOI: That's plausible.
-WOOSIN: Mm.

421
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,931
MR. CHOI: By the way,

422
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,851
what is this for?
Why are you asking me this?

423
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,188
I'm going to start a fire today.

424
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,482
A fire?

425
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,575
Now, what am I seeing?

426
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,955
Excuse me.

427
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,582
Ms. Kwon.

428
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,253
I have something to tell you.

429
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,633
So...

430
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,344
you want to thank me?

431
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,723
Yes, I heard you got my dad a VIP room.

432
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,267
Oh, that.

433
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,979
I happened to learn about your situation
and it made me feel bad.

434
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,438
So I used a bit of my influence.

435
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,400
Thank you.

436
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,568
Words are not enough.

437
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,904
Nothing in this world is for free.

438
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,824
Okay, how much would you like me
to pay you?

439
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,536
You don't have much money anyway.

440
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,790
But there's something I want you to do.

441
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,792
What is it?

442
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,089
Your father needs
to go through a big operation.

443
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,967
I could make things convenient for him.

444
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,177
I have that much influence.

445
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,848
Should I move up the operation?

446
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,353
What is it that you want me to do?

447
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,482
No, I can't do that. It's too risky.

448
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,985
You're supposed to make
discreet moves, but a fire?

449
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,320
Hear me out first.

450
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,322
No, let's make this clear.

451
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,616
I could help you with your plan.

452
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,619
But it doesn't mean
I'm willing to take every risk.

453
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,537
-Mr. Choi.
-You're on your own.

454
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,205
Mr. Choi.

455
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,540
I won't do it.

456
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,756
Nothing's smooth sailing,
and I'm running out of time.

457
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,342
(sighs)

458
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,303
(knocking on door)

459
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,978
-It's been a while, Mr. Cho.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,901
You didn't forget
my mother's 70th birthday

461
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,569
and helped my younger sibling get a job.

462
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,446
Thank you, sir.

463
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,198
Don't mention it.

464
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,909
You may have been dispatched,
but you're still family.

465
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,077
It's the least I could do.

466
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,704
Here.

467
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,374
Thank you.

468
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,417
-Help yourself.
-Yes, sir.

469
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,795
Isn't it hard working offsite?

470
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,546
No, sir.

471
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,131
Hang in there a little longer.

472
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,176
You should come back to Team A soon.

473
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,554
Yes, sir.

474
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,098
So...

475
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,309
Song Suhyeon came to visit Lee Changwoo?

476
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,019
Yes, in the middle of the night.

477
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,479
What did he say?

478
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,524
He lashed out at him,
saying stuff about false testimony.

479
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,362
That bastard's trying hard.

480
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,698
Lee Changwoo denied the whole thing,

481
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,867
but he asked if it was
to protect an accomplice--

482
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,952
Wait.

483
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,417
Accomplice?

484
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,504
The thing is...

485
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,799
Who is this?

486
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,469
I don't know.

487
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,766
A composite sketch?

488
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,854
(phone buzzing)

489
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,731
BROTHER

490
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,902
Hi, Mr. Lee.

491
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,614
What?

492
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,160
What does that mean?

493
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,845
A composite sketch artist?

494
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,513
This man.

495
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,475
The guy wearing glasses
whom Song called to the funeral.

496
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,686
I checked his identity,
and he works for the prosecution.

497
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,522
Let's see.

498
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,984
The witness is already dead,

499
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,320
but he contacted a composite expert?

500
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,032
He visited Lee Changwoo
with the composite sketch

501
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,326
and lashed out at him about an accomplice.

502
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,162
Mr. Jeong.

503
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,623
What do you think this means?

504
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,125
Kim Wonjoong fooled us.

505
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,089
It was the daughter.

506
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,763
CHANGWOO: <i>Who did you say</i>

507
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,973
you were?

508
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,604
I'm the witness.

509
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,652
My father gave false testimony
in my place.

510
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,571
To protect me.

511
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,825
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,744
There's no need to apologize.

513
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,581
Nor to come visit me
after all these years.

514
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,250
I am

515
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,252
the culprit anyway.

516
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,879
No, I saw it.

517
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,801
The man from that night wasn't you.

518
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,688
SEOHEE: <i>I remember clearly.</i>

519
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,650
Are you sure about what you remember?

520
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,443
Yes.

521
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,529
How old were you at the time?

522
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,324
I was seven.

523
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,081
What a pity.

524
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,501
The memory of a 7-year-old
from 22 years ago.

525
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,712
No one's going to believe it.

526
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,840
-But--
-Go back.

527
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,051
Go back,

528
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,346
and leave everything behind.

529
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,809
My dad committed suicide
after killing my mom.

530
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,771
The same night
Song Soonho's son came to visit.

531
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,150
You know Prosecutor Song?

532
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,153
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

533
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,614
And I need to find out who did it.

534
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,868
What on earth

535
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,663
have you two been doing?

536
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,999
I thought you were framed.

537
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,710
So I went to meet Mr. Song myself.

538
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,503
(hand thumps)

539
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,009
Stop with your crazy imagination
and come to your senses.

540
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,844
It's all in the past, so why?

541
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,847
-We must make it right.
-Enough!

542
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,895
I said I'm the culprit.

543
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,356
I did it.

544
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,322
We're done talking.

545
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,117
You're why I started this,
but I can't back down.

546
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,953
I'm going to see this through.

547
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,385
You aren't the culprit.

548
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,735
(sighs)

549
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,697
No.

550
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,412
(foreboding music)

551
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,882
What is it?

552
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,845
What do you mean?

553
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,763
You've been glancing at me.

554
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,811
Well, it's just that I'm curious

555
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,105
about why Ms. Kwon hates you.

556
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,026
I'm not sure. You don't need
a reason to hate someone.

557
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,361
Maybe you did something
to cause a misunderstanding.

558
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,156
I don't know. Why don't you find out?

559
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,954
I'm going to go call my mom.

560
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,540
My dad's test results should be out.

561
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,168
His condition has worsened a little.

562
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,549
(door opens, closes)

563
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,344
That's why he's in a bad mood.

564
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,264
He's in critical condition.

565
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,684
He was fine up until this morning.

566
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,441
He might need surgery right away.

567
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,443
DONGRIM: <i>Right away?</i>

568
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,862
But why? This is too sudden!

569
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,910
Dongrim.

570
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,081
What? What did you say, Mom?

571
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,334
He got worse after moving to the VIP room?

572
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,338
Or should I move up the operation?

573
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,801
It can't be...

574
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,609
Why is he going there?

575
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,834
This is what you meant?

576
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,752
-Did you really--
-What?

577
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,130
This is your doing.

578
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,340
-What are you talking about?
-I know it all.

579
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,884
My dad's condition worsened
after he was moved to the VIP room.

580
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,345
You did that on purpose
to make use of me--

581
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,472
If you know,
what do you think you should do?

582
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,935
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

583
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,687
I can't betray Mr. Ha.

584
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,940
How will you know until you've tried?
It's not that hard.

585
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,692
When the chairman comes, I'll tell him.

586
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,986
That you blackmailed me.

587
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,530
Enough.
You need to think about your family.

588
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,826
Is loyalty more important to you
than your father's life?

589
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,914
No, I won't do it.

590
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,836
Goodness. What...

591
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,132
Oh, my. That must hurt a lot.

592
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,884
Are you okay?

593
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,136
Stop spacing out and come in.

594
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,847
Okay.

595
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,689
This is driving me crazy.

596
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,568
He has no clue what's happening to me.
Where did he go this time?

597
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,328
(sighs)

598
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,872
I need to start at four o'clock.

599
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,423
MS. KWON: <i>Why can't you tell me?</i>

600
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,676
I asked why you're often
with the writer lately.

601
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,639
I told you before
that I'd follow up on him.

602
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,892
He wanted to interview me,
so I thought I'd use that.

603
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,397
Really? Did you find anything suspicious?

604
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,775
Not really.

605
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,239
Look, Mr. Choi.

606
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,619
You're too competent
to settle for working here.

607
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,830
You deserve more than this.

608
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,584
What do you mean?

609
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,421
You used to be an ace in the police force.

610
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,048
You'd better stick to your expertise.

611
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,216
(awkward chuckle)

612
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,052
Well, I'd love to.

613
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,971
Your predecessor became a manager

614
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,182
at someplace nice thanks to my influence.

615
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,938
Continue to keep
a close eye on the writer.

616
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,817
Yes, ma'am.

617
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,361
But why do you mind him this much?

618
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,697
He's going to leave
once he's done with the memoir.

619
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,825
He's got an ulterior motive.

620
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,621
Apparently, he's here
to get some info for his next piece.

621
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,167
I wondered
what kind of information he was after.

622
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,044
It's just drawing my attention.

623
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,630
Even more because I look like him.

624
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,511
I'm sure he's digging into
Mr. Minjo's helicopter case.

625
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,770
That woman's completely mistaken.

626
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,317
She thinks you're planning to write
about the accident in your next piece.

627
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,695
That's good.

628
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,322
What, was this your angle?

629
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,574
You said Ms. Kwon was suspicious of me.

630
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,119
So I gave her something different
from my original purpose.

631
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,412
Why?

632
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,080
I thought she'd take the bait.

633
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,834
She'd do anything
to protect Chairman Kwon.

634
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,420
Why would you bring him up here?

635
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,505
Kwon Minjo.

636
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,300
The chairman adored him
more than his firstborn.

637
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,261
Everyone believed
that he'd be the heir of Haesong.

638
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,805
But he died in a helicopter accident.

639
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,891
And there's a heliport in this house.

640
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,852
Don't you find it strange?

641
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,480
The father still uses helicopters
even when his son died because of one.

642
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,440
Are you suggesting
the chairman killed him?

643
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,569
You don't know how much
he adored Kwon Minjo. You're wrong.

644
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,820
Then how about this?

645
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,784
Ms. Kwon said, "I'm sure he's digging into
Mr. Minjo's helicopter case," right?

646
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,286
What about it? I just don't...

647
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,791
The helicopter case.

648
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,502
Not an accident,

649
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,629
but a case.

650
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,965
When I showed interest in Kwon Minjo,

651
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,051
Ms. Kwon reacted offensively.

652
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,761
That means she knows something.

653
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,061
Don't worry.
It will just be a minor incident.

654
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,230
I'll say I heard
about the helicopter accident

655
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,108
during the interview with Ms. Eun.
And that's true.

656
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,235
No, that was a foolish move.

657
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,280
The Ms. Kwon I know would've reported it
to the chairman right away.

658
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,241
And you would've been kicked out.

659
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,369
Nevertheless, she's holding her tongue

660
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,123
because she's looking for a spy.

661
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,709
He has an informant in this house.

662
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,086
You said yourself that in the woods,

663
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,255
the writer was looking for someone.

664
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,549
That's all in the past.

665
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,468
No, look at this note.

666
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,975
What, take notes on good ideas?

667
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,686
As if I'd fall for that lie.

668
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,691
Whoever it is,
I'm going to find them no matter what.

669
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,987
You wouldn't know how persistent she is.

670
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,364
She might discover everything
at this rate.

671
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,617
Then I'd better hurry.
It'll be four o'clock soon.

672
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,995
What... Are you really going to do it?

673
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,496
You'll help me, right?

674
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,420
Four o'clock?

675
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,047
That's when the chairman returns.

676
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,300
Ms. Kwon will go out to the heliport
to greet him.

677
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,927
So you don't want her to get hurt?

678
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,013
She may not be able to evacuate
within three minutes.

679
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,556
What a humanist.

680
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,058
Today, I'm just going to check

681
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,311
if the Adamas is there
while the others are evacuating.

682
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,271
No one should be harmed.

683
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,522
You said you'd cause a fire.

684
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,815
A fake one.

685
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:21,153
The heat and smoke detectors must be
activated together for an alarm to go off.

686
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,738
But if one of the detectors is down

687
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,573
and a fire signal is manually turned on,

688
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,492
everyone will think of it
as a malfunction.

689
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,661
-CHEF 1: <i>It's so heavy.</i>
-CHEF 2: <i>Watch your head.</i>

690
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,956
Goodness, you're big enough
to handle this much.

691
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,375
-It's heavy.
-Thanks, chef.

692
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,962
-You have my respect.
-Be careful. Let's go.

693
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,672
(grunts)

694
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,102
(suspenseful music)

695
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,580
(grunts)

696
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,045
There.

697
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,590
No, leave it. We'll take care of it, sir.

698
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,052
It's fine. Take your time smoking.

699
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,720
Thank you, chef.

700
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,932
(Mr. Choi grunts)

701
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,646
(suspenseful music continues)

702
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,424
What? Why is this locked?

703
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,177
Darn it.

704
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,890
(panting)

705
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,144
(grunts)

706
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,856
Chef.

707
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,858
What... Oh, Mr. Ha.

708
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,116
Could I ask you to make a special dish?

709
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,451
A special dish?

710
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,996
Yes, stir-fried seafood.

711
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,790
CHEF: Come on, that's not a special dish.

712
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,877
How did you know
that my expertise is Chinese cuisine?

713
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,003
(chef laughs)

714
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,589
-Would you like it for dinner?
-No, for a snack. I'm a bit hungry.

715
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,300
Sure thing. I'll have it ready for you.

716
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,677
At around four o'clock.

717
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,596
Four?

718
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,182
Yes, at four. Will it be possible?

719
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,810
Well, sure.
I'll make it delicious for you.

720
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,896
CHEF: Full of smoky flavor.

721
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,314
WOOSIN: Thank you.

722
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,612
-It's done.
-Thanks.

723
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,370
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

724
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,873
I inquired about the number you mentioned.

725
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,667
-Is it a burner phone?
-Yes.

726
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,835
I thought so.

727
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,213
CHIEF GONG: What is this case about?

728
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,632
(sighs)
Mr. Gong.

729
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,385
If I don't know what to do,

730
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,470
I'd better just go for it, right?

731
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,848
Right, go straight without turning back.
That's your motto.

732
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,517
REPORTER KIM SEOHEE

733
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,020
-Oh, is it perhaps about your love life?
-Jeez.

734
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,232
Make a bet. All-in.

735
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,776
-(scoffs)
-(phone buzzing)

736
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,363
Hello?

737
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,658
Make time for me.
I have something to tell you.

738
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,704
Yes, I'll be waiting.

739
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,256
(sighs)

740
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,343
How did I end up exposing my face?

741
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,137
Damn it.

742
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,265
-(scoffs)
-(knocking on door)

743
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,770
Sir, Kim Seohee visited
Lee Changwoo as well.

744
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,481
-What?
-Here's the recording.

745
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,317
(scoffs)

746
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,903
What do they take us for?

747
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,573
Why are they so damn annoying?

748
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,117
(growls)

749
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,829
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir.

750
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,539
-Let's clean them up.
-All three of them?

751
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,707
Not Lee Changwoo.

752
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,334
Let's kill them all.
To prevent future problems.

753
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,921
He's under our control, so why?

754
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,217
Let's just take care of the two bastards.

755
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,553
Yes, sir.

756
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,474
(tense music)

757
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,018
(deep sigh)

758
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,324
-CHIEF JEONG: And...
-Mr. Jeong.

759
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,870
Look, Mr. Jeong.

760
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,664
I'd like to work in the field this time.

761
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,541
It's an exclusive operation.

762
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,336
Oh, come on.

763
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,424
I want to make my brother proud too.

764
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,552
Given my experience, I don't want
my juniors to look down on me.

765
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,014
Please?

766
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,684
Is that so? All right then.

767
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,688
Really? Are you sure?
Don't go back on your word.

768
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,065
Don't...

769
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,818
Mr. Jeong.

770
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,612
I know. This will be a chance
for him to realize his place.

771
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,366
He'll mess up for sure.
When he does, cover up for him.

772
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,617
But if the team leader finds out...

773
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,412
He needs to know
that his little brother's a loser.

774
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,062
SEOHEE: Why aren't you saying anything?
I told you I went to meet Lee Changwoo.

775
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,482
(clicks tongue)

776
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,571
So you become speechless
when you're angry.

777
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,823
And you make jokes when you feel guilty?

778
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,032
(chuckles)

779
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,909
Is this funny to you?

780
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,829
What if that man takes notice?

781
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,416
You're much more reckless
than I thought you'd be.

782
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,959
Who is that man?

783
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,295
Are you going to fear him
without knowing who he really is?

784
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,588
We needed to set up a trap.

785
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,300
A trap? Are you saying
you visited Lee Changwoo on purpose?

786
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,094
I should go into the tiger's den
if I want to catch it.

787
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,724
Ms. Kim, you need to be careful.
Or you could get in real trouble.

788
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,393
You also visited Lee Changwoo on purpose,

789
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,728
knowing he'd be watching.

790
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,937
Because I--

791
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,024
Wait and see. He will approach us somehow.

792
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,985
(sighs)

793
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,826
What's with that face?

794
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,245
He already did.

795
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,964
"At 11 tonight under the southern pier
of Dangsan Railway Bridge."

796
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,426
I tracked the number,
and it was a burner phone.

797
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,598
-Will you go?
-I should.

798
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,350
It could really be dangerous.

799
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,352
If he wanted to kill me,
I'd be gone already.

800
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,646
He probably has something to tell me
in person.

801
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,189
I should hear him out.

802
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,274
(solemn music)

803
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,204
I'll do it.

804
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,764
I have to save Dad first.

805
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,975
I have no choice.

806
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,646
I can explain this to Mr. Ha later.
He will understand.

807
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,901
(sizzling)

808
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,862
Take it easy.
You're going to start a fire.

809
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,865
Ms. Oh, when it comes to Chinese food,

810
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,201
fire is the key.

811

I don't know. Maybe it's malfunctioning.

819
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,471
I told you to take it easy.

820
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,390
Don't blame me. I didn't do anything much.

821
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,809
Anyway, we must get out of here

822
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,686
before the firewalls come down.

823
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,897

-Let's hurry outside first.

828
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,746

A fire alarm went off

What?

837
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,970
(panting)

838
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,305

The heat detector has reacted,
but the smoke detector is off.

842
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,236
It could be a malfunction then.
Should I deactivate the system?

843
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,157
No, it could also be a real fire.
Go grasp the situation.

844
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,158
Yes, sir.

-MAID 4: Yes, we're all here.
-MAID 5: Yes.

850

What happened? A fire?

851
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,769
I think it's a false alarm.

852
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,521
There was no fire. I'm sure of it.

853
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,064
A false alarm?

854
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,817
That's a relief.

855
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,068
Is everyone here?

Oh, over there.

859
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,668
Didn't you hear the announcement?
What took you so--

860
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,212
Well, Dongrim.

861
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,255
Gosh, he's here. I was looking for him.

862
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,757
Hey, Dongrim.

863
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,759
Mr. Ha!

864
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,888
Thank goodness you're safe.
I was looking for you.

865
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,932
I can't find Ms. Yoon.

866
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,726
She can't hear.

867
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,855
Where's her room?

868
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,316
You're going to go inside?

869
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,818
It's dangerous.
The firewalls will come down soon.

870
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,780
Where is her room? Tell me!

871
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,114
MS. KWON: The third floor.

872
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,409
Go to the master's bedroom.
She should be there.

873
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,119
I told her to do something there.
