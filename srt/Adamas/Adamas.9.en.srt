1
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:53,449
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,077
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:58,872
WOOSIN: There is something
I don't understand

4
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:01,666
no matter how much I think about it.

5
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,963
The reason why
they're keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

6
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:10,258
This is what I'm more curious about.

7
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:16,014
What are you trying to insinuate
if your purpose is a retrial?

8
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,521
It's because of Lee Changwoo, right?

9
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,400
You want to save him.

10
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,156
But why?

11
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,868
What is your relationship to him?

12
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,332
(sighs)

13
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:11,361
MR. JEONG

14
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,988
HERE'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
875-3 YEONGIN-RO SUSEONG-GU.

15
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:25,208
-Here you go.
-(thuds)

16
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,672
Come on. You shouldn't be focused
on writing that memoir right now.

17
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,465
What do you mean?

18
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,842
The Adamas.
You said you were going to steal it.

19
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:35,969
DONGRIM: We need a plan--

20
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,929
The 80th-anniversary ceremony.

21
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,058
(whirs)

22
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,018
That's D-day.

23
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:46,479
D-day?

24
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:48,398
They'll bring it out once again.

25
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,358
That's when…
(whoops)

26
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:55,321
But Ms. Kwon is in charge
of the entire ceremony.

27
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,948
Will she invite you?

28
00:02:58,866 --> 00:02:59,742
Probably not.

29
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,246
Then everything will have been in vain.

30
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,664
We should do something.

31
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,126
(slurps)

32
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,502
(Woosin exhales)

33
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,880
I am.

34
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,465
(keyboard clacking)

35
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:33,109
I heard you're going out, ma'am.

36
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,402
And?

37
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,572
What is it about, ma'am?

38
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:44,245
I'm sorry, Ms. Hyesoo.

39
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,207
A dress fitting for the ceremony.

40
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,176
MS. KWON: A dress?

41
00:03:58,718 --> 00:03:59,677
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:00,720
(Ms. Kwon scoffs)

43
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:03,389
She should just pick any dress.

44
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,850
Does she think the ceremony is about her?

45
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:27,663
Master, I have something to tell you.

46
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,873
Okay.

47
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,879
Mr. Ha has an ulterior motive
for coming here.

48
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:37,215
Is that so?

49
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:39,342
It's for his next piece.

50
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:42,720
To write a story about Haesongwon.
He's here for research.

51
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:45,390
Mm.

52
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,392
Cut to the chase.

53
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,770
What about our family?

54
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,939
Well…

55
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,858
Ms. Kwon.

56
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,533
It's about Mr. Minjo.

57
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:07,620
He thinks someone may have
intentionally harmed him.

58
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:11,207
So I did my utmost
to prevent him from writing about that.

59
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,792
I was protecting you.

60
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,962
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,715
People would gossip
if they got wind of this.

62
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,842
KWON: Protect me?

63
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,136
What for?

64
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,848
Because that helicopter incident was…

65
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:30,518
Ms. Kwon.

66
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,062
I just--

67
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,398
Are you insinuating that I killed my son?

68
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,692
I…

69
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,402
It wasn't me.

70
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,529
-Pardon?
-It wasn't me.

71
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:46,576
I killed Minjo?

72
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:53,249
Is that what you thought of me all along?

73
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,836
That I killed my son?

74
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,005
That I killed…

75
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:03,968
Goodness. I'm sorry, sir!

76
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,137
Blood may have gotten on my hands

77
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:10,057
but never his!

78
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:13,144
Even if everyone else thought
I had killed him,

79
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,189
you of all people
shouldn't have thought so.

80
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:20,109
How dare you?

81
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,529
I must've been out of my mind!

82
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,323
I'm sorry, master!

83
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:28,284
Get out! Before I break your other leg.

84
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,953
(sobbing)
Master, please forgive me!

85
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,330
Leave this instant!

86
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,957
Do you want to crawl
for the rest of your life?

87
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,126
Please forgive me!

88
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:41,589
I knew you were fond of Mr. Ha.

89
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:46,260
It broke my heart to think
that it was all because of Mr. Minjo.

90
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:50,014
I was worried that he was just using

91
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,059
your love and affection to his advantage.

92
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:59,649
(sobbing continues)

93
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:00,691
(sighs)

94
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:03,569
If you want to be treated well,

95
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,696
watch what you say!

96
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:09,325
(wailing)

97
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:17,500
"I'd like to announce that I'll be
the next chairman of Haesong Group.

98
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:21,712
I have grown alongside Haesong
for a very long time.

99
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:25,258
And now, I'd like to lead us
into a new beginning…"

100
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,012
(sighs)

101
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:36,727
PRESIDENT KWON HYUNJO

102
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:37,770
(scoffs)

103
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,647
(clanks)

104
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,526
Minjo.

105
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:45,611
Are you watching me?

106
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,990
Haesong is mine now.

107
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:56,163
Father wants to give me the company.

108
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,126
Really?

109
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:03,421
I declined.

110
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:08,593
I see. Why?

111
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,220
I met with Mr. Lee Changwoo.

112
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,478
(sighs)
Hey, what are you trying to do?

113
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,480
I wanted him to know
that I know he's not guilty.

114
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:24,317
And that I know who the real killer is.

115
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:29,822
Minjo…

116
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,408
You know everything too.
You heard it all that night.

117
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,330
Then what about Haesong?
What do you think will happen?

118
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:42,835
Hold on. Are you saying
you'll betray our father?

119
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,880
You value the company
more than Father, don't you?

120
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:49,425
Not me.
I couldn't care less about Haesong.

121
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,262
Jeez, look at how snobbish you are.

122
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:55,848
Hyunjo.

123
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,729
No matter what others say,
he was a wonderful father to us.

124
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:02,730
(scoffs)

125
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,899
Maybe to you.

126
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:07,985
You're right.

127
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,863
He was an angel to me.

128
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,573
That's why I can't give up on him.

129
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:16,369
He needs a chance to repent.
It's only right.

130
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:19,413
Don't do it.

131
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:22,917
I've already made up my mind.

132
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,044
Kwon Minjo.

133
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,479
I beg of you.

134
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,399
Let's sweep this under the rug. Please?

135
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,402
You turn a blind eye, and this goes away.

136
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:54,990
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,994
Father will never forgive you!

138
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,001
He could never harm me.

139
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,463
You know that.

140
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:17,304
(door opens, closes)

141
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:19,598
He may never lay a finger on you.

142
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,601
But I can.

143
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:25,896
You know that.

144
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,240
We looked into everyone who entered
and exited that building,

145
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,783
and Kim Seohee wasn't one of them.

146
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,827
She squirmed her way out.

147
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,787
No, we kept a close eye on the building.

148
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,749
We watched all the entrances
and even the underground parking lot.

149
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,125
She's still in there.

150
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,962
She's terrified after learning
of Song Suhyeon's death.

151
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,381
She's not in there.

152
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:55,468
Then what?

153
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,220
Did she exit through a manhole
or a drain like in the movies?

154
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,972
(laughs)

155
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,307
Is that funny to you?

156
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,476
I'm sorry, ma'am.

157
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,395
Get me the floor plan of the basement.

158
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:10,149
Let me see how she squirmed her way out.

159
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,944
At one o'clock sharp,

160
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:16,697
an e-mail is scheduled to be sent
to each media outlet.

161
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,574
SEOHEE: It's a scoop.

162
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,619
With keywords Lee Changwoo,
Haesong, and SIH.

163
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,580
It'll turn this country upside down.

164
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:28,042
If you let me out, I won't send it.

165
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,670
Is this because of Prosecutor Song?

166
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,923
I need to see for myself
that he's alive and well.

167
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,217
You have seven minutes.

168
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,929
Bring him here so I can see for myself.

169
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:43,766
Or be prepared to explain
who you are to the world.

170
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:47,144
Six minutes.

171
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,397
Both of you are so stubborn.

172
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,650
Take her to the basement.

173
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:04,829
-This is…
-An air-raid shelter built in the 1970s.

174
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:08,040
Prosecutor Song is here?

175
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,503
Yes. We just declared him dead
to keep him safe.

176
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,588
We knew Team A would look into it.

177
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,466
But how did he survive?

178
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,177
I heard Mr. Baek died on the scene.

179
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,137
That's because...

180
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,390
(grunts)

181
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,392
...he acted as a human shield.

182
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,520
Don't be sorry.

183
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,064
We've lost countless colleagues until now.

184
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:36,652
Had we grieved every time we lost someone,
we would've gone crazy by now.

185
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:41,574
That's why both Mr. Kang and I
are trying to remain strong. To survive.

186
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,702
If not,
we wouldn't be able to do this job.

187
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,831
This will take us to the safe house above.
That's where he is.

188
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:15,274
(Suhyeon grunts)

189
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:16,442
SUHYEON: <i>Who… Who are you?</i>

190
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,444
Who are you?

191
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:22,823
Sun.

192
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,283
(gasps)

193
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:27,870
Sun.

194
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:45,596
He's in the--

195
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,016
(sighs)

196
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,151
-Prosecutor Song.
-SUHYEON: Stop.

197
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:02,988
Hold on.

198
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,747
You were going to hug me, weren't you?

199
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,708
What?

200
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,336
Hold yourself back.

201
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,589
I have a rib fracture.

202
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,425
I could really die.

203
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:29,473
Seeing how you're cracking jokes,
you must be doing all right.

204
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:30,849
(chuckles)

205
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:34,228
You're right.

206
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,898
I can't believe I'm joking around
in this situation.

207
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,907
Mr. Gong died.

208
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,954
And Mr. Baek…

209
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:56,917
-Prosecutor Song.
-It was all because of me.

210
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:02,715
They died because of me.

211
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:12,641
Song Suhyeon.

212
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:20,024
It's not over yet.

213
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,527
We should give it another try.

214
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,572
For their sakes too.

215
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:35,414
That jewelry designer
hasn't been spotted for the past two days.

216
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,834
The CCTV camera recorded her
entering her house.

217
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,502
But I think she avoided the CCTV cameras

218
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,380
to move elsewhere afterward.

219
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,758
They don't want to reveal where she is.

220
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:50,429
How about we follow Mr. Ha's suggestion

221
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,514
so they'll make a move first?

222
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:57,227
Spread a rumor about Ms. Jang
being in possession of the Adamas?

223
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:00,898
(Sun sighs)

224
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:04,651
SUN: The hot water and gas pipes run
through the east, west, and south sides.

225
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,070
Then there's the north side.

226
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,739
Had they drilled into the north side,

227
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:11,241
it would've been easier
to connect it with the other pipes.

228
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,202
But they went around it.

229
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:14,912
SUN: Why?

230
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:17,748
Because there's a secret tunnel there.

231
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:21,418
Look at that. How fancy.

232
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,923
The entrance must be somewhere there.

233
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:29,468
MS. LEE: You were given a name?

234
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:32,763
Sun.

235
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:34,765
Do you recognize that name?

236
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:36,100
No.

237
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:39,353
So you're saying
that's who killed Baek, right?

238
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,272
I heard a female voice.

239
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:44,399
Are you sure?

240
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,694
Why are you so surprised? It was a woman.

241
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:49,905
Team A could have female members too.

242
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:53,408
Does anyone come to mind?

243
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,453
Yes. She's their only female killer.

244
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,455
MS. LEE: She's known to be a psycho.

245
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,458
I heard she enjoys
torturing her targets to death.

246
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,961
What a ridiculous character.

247
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:05,921
(Suhyeon clears throat)

248
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,509
Yes, Mr. Kang.

249
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,349
(Suhyeon groans)

250
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,602
I need to go somewhere. Stay here.

251
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,313
Prosecutor Song.

252
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,357
(door opens)

253
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:28,902
Prosecutor Song.

254
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,321
I told you to stay here.

255
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:32,364
I'm coming too.

256
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:35,951
Two people died because of me.
I can't just sit still.

257
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,370
Go back inside.

258
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,165
I'm coming with you.

259
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:43,709
Didn't you hear her? She's dangerous.

260
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:49,006
(metal clacking)

261
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:53,135
Don't worry. The fortune teller said
I'd live an extremely long life.

262
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,180
Ms. Kim.

263
00:17:58,724 --> 00:17:59,683
Ms. Kim…

264
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:03,854
What are you…

265
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:09,276
Are you crazy?

266
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,402
(mouthing)
Hurry!

267
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,445
(loud sigh)

268
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:15,949
This is a bit high.

269
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,118
Darn it.

270
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:20,871
(gasps)

271
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,668
-(grunts)
-(groans)

272
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:27,711
Are you okay?

273
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:31,048
(panting)

274
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,424
So what's the plan?

275
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:35,052
(sighs)
We enter the tiger's den.

276
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:37,137
Where?

277
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,514
Let's talk on our way there.
Are you all right?

278
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,322
Mr. Kang said you shouldn't leave…

279
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,618
Damn it.

280
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,374
(sobbing)

281
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:10,379
-I'm sorry, master!
-Get out!

282
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,673
Before I break your other leg.

283
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:16,718
-Master, please forgive me!
-Leave this instant!

284
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:19,137
Do you want to crawl
for the rest of your life?

285
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,974
MS. KWON: Please forgive me!

286
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,142
(breathes shakily)

287
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,162
MEMOIR (WORKING TITLE)

288
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,664
WOOSIN: This is the rough draft.

289
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,458
So soon?

290
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,753
I rushed a bit so I could get it done
before the ceremony.

291
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:54,840
What do you mean?

292
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:58,844
I heard it was also
your retirement ceremony.

293
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,889
I thought it'd be more meaningful
if you published it that day.

294
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,516
Mm.

295
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,102
You should retire in style

296
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,937
for everything to pan out well.

297
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:16,945
I do see a resemblance.

298
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:21,366
-Pardon?
-I feel like this could be fate. Or not.

299
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:23,535
That's how I feel.

300
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,370
I'm hoping it's the former.

301
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,998
What about you?

302
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,835
Am I just being greedy?

303
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,718
I like your idea.
I should reveal my memoir

304
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,845
that day.

305
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:45,724
Does this mean
you'll be attending the ceremony as well?

306
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:47,768
Well…

307
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,021
(chuckles)

308
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,483
It would be my honor.

309
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,485
(laughs)

310
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,286
So I got an invite.

311
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,185
What brings you here?

312
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:32,771
I'll do the interview right now.

313
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:37,109
But I submitted the draft
to the chairman just now.

314
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,404
I just want to talk.

315
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:43,782
Okay. Sure.

316
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:55,127
Are you simply just lucky
or actually talented?

317
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,839
I'm tired of always asking what you mean.

318
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,759
Why do I always lose to you?

319
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,928
What did I beat you in?

320
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:06,721
I'm totally lost.

321
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,434
Fine. Let me ask you one thing.

322
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,353
It feels like I'm the interviewee.

323
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:15,981
I'm listening.

324
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:19,443
Who told you about my son?

325
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:22,279
There's a spy in this house, isn't there?

326
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:24,406
Is it Mr. Choi
whom you've been awfully close with?

327
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:27,659
No?

328
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:29,911
Then Ms. Hyesoo?

329
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,206
Or Mr. Kim, your fan?

330
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,419
Right. There's also
that money-grubber Ms. Oh.

331
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,046
Answer me.

332
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:43,967
Who was it? Tell me.

333
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:49,222
Kwon Minjo.

334
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,978
We ran into each other
while I was volunteering.

335
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:56,813
Liar.

336
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,440
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

337
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:02,319
But that's when I heard
about the chairman's heart transplant.

338
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:05,363
He also told me
that your son was the donor.

339
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:08,742
That's all.

340
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:11,745
Like I said,
the rest was from my imagination.

341
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:14,956
I have a question for you too.

342
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,084
Why didn't you tell the chairman?

343
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:21,296
It seems like
he doesn't know about that novel.

344
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:25,759
I only kept my mouth shut
because I knew he'd be heartbroken.

345
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,220
He doted on my son more than anyone else.

346
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,558
So don't you dare
talk about my dear Hoon ever again.

347
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,810
Or I'll chop off your tongue.

348
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:38,688
The interview is over.

349
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,198
(door opens)

350
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,329
Jeez. Mr. Ha.

351
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:56,998
What's wrong with you? Why would you
willingly get on her bad side?

352
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:58,833
Don't provoke her anymore.

353
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,002
It's already nerve-racking as is.

354
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:04,130
I'm only making her come to her senses.

355
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,760
She must realize the love
she had for her son

356
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:11,930
so that her animosity
against Chairman Kwon can grow.

357
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,268
I think I saw hope.

358
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,896
What? What are you on about?

359
00:24:20,522 --> 00:24:23,733
She said his name for the first time.
Hoon.

360
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,362
Her son's name.

361
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,080
Lee Changwoo, the notorious thief.
Do you know why he got that nickname?

362
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,666
That's because he mainly robbed
influential individuals.

363
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,961
Not just cash and jewelry, but…

364
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,215
their safes.

365
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:48,925
(fingers snap)
That's it.

366
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,177
What if he hadn't been after the money?

367
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,475
MS. KWON: Mr. Choi!

368
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,065
Bring me a power saw.

369
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:10,739
A power saw?

370
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:12,657
This instant!

371
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,668
Your car is waiting
at the front gate, ma'am.

372
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:27,464
(power saw whirring)

373
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,473
(whirring continues)

374
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:51,154
MS. OH: Has she finally gone mad?

375
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,365
My goodness.

376
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,450
(creaking)

377
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,618
(crashing)

378
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,841
(sighs)

379
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,822
Mr. Lee, I have something to report.

380
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:35,865
Took you long enough.

381
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,868
I heard Mr. Kwon summoned you
instead of me.

382
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:42,455
I'm sorry, sir. He said it was urgent.

383
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,959
I don't want to hear it.
What is the urgency?

384
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,670
He wants us to beef up security
on Ms. Jang, a jewelry designer.

385
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:51,589
-She's a pretty famous designer.
-Just cut to the chase.

386
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,427
Why does Team A have to escort her?

387
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:58,346
The Adamas is with her.

388
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,099
They're revealing it
at the 80th-anniversary ceremony,

389
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:03,101
and she'll recraft it by then.

390
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:04,686
(scoffs)

391
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:06,938
What is it, sir?

392
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:11,109
Never mind.

393
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,988
What about that?

394
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,656
There's a problem, sir.

395
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,576
Rumor has it that
Ms. Jang knows where the Adamas is.

396
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,870
Word is spreading in the thief community.

397
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:24,038
The Intelligence Team just told me so.

398
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:25,582
There's been a security breach.

399
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:28,585
Who spread the rumor first?

400
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,837
It occurred simultaneously.

401
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,921
Ah.

402
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,175
It'll be difficult to find out who it was.

403
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,760
What should we do?

404
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:39,804
We should take care of it
before things get complicated.

405
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:43,600
Where is she right now?

406
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:47,020
A LAWFUL COUNTRY!
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

407
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:51,691
ARES.

408
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:54,819
SUHYEON: <i>I need to find out
how it's related to Team A.</i>

409
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,571
<i>I need your help, Ms. Kim.</i>

410
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,034
That was tasty.

411
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,870
SUHYEON:
<i>I know someone who just loves money.</i>

412
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:05,371
<i>I need you to throw him some bait.</i>

413
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:07,624
Prosecutor Han Minsoo?

414
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,210
Who are you?

415
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:13,171
I see that you had <i>cheonggukjang.</i>

416
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:14,756
I'm Kim Seohee,
a local news reporter from TNC.

417
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,300
Whatever. I don't know
what this is about, so just leave.

418
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,180
I heard you're in charge
of the Kangchun case's special hearing.

419
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:24,098
I heard Haesong is involved.

420
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,142
I wonder what you're talking about.

421
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:28,645
Did you not know that?
Was it a false report?

422
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:32,232
Look, Ms. Kim.
Stop beating around the bush.

423
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,776
I received a call.

424
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:37,987
The caller said this case was related
to ARES, an affiliate of Haesong.

425
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:41,574
We already knew about this
through the tabloids. Were you not aware?

426
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:43,117
Do you know Team Leader Lee?

427
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,830
What do you expect the prosecution to do
with that information?

428
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:50,083
It was an anonymous caller,

429
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,293
so I was wondering
if you knew anything about it.

430
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:54,879
Let me ask you for a favor.

431
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,092
If something comes up, let me know.

432
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,094
(chuckles)

433
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:04,848
You should know better
than to nonchalantly ask me

434
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,766
for information on an ongoing case.

435
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:09,644
I don't know what you're talking about,
so please leave.

436
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:15,817
SUHYEON: <i>He'll make a move once he hears
that Haesong is involved.</i>

437
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:19,320
<i>He'll inform Haesong
so he can get on their good side.</i>

438
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:20,864
<i>He won't miss this opportunity.</i>

439
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,408
How may I help you?

440
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,369
I'm from Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

441
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:39,507
Mr. Lee, a prosecutor
from the Seoul Central District is here.

442
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,050
He's looking for you.

443
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,474
SUHYEON: <i>Once he enters ARES,</i>

444
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,477
<i>I'll follow him too.</i>

445
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:54,856
Isn't my superior already here?

446
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,316
I'm a bit late.

447
00:29:57,984 --> 00:30:00,111
There he is. Hey…

448
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,905
Thank you.

449
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:19,756
<i>Wait nearby.</i>

450
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:23,968
<i>If I don't come out within 30 minutes,
inform the SIH.</i>

451
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:00,254
EMPLOYEE: Come in, Team Leader Lee.

452
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,548
This is nice.

453
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:04,217
WOMAN: I heard you were looking for me.

454
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:08,221
What? You're female.

455
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,556
I'm Team Leader Lee Miyoung.

456
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,851
I'm the only team leader here
whose surname is Lee.

457
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:15,478
How may I help you?

458
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:18,439
Oh, it's nothing much.

459
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:21,150
You're familiar with
the Kangchun Penitentiary massacre, right?

460
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:25,196
A death-row inmate
slaughtered many individuals.

461
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:30,451
Right. We're aware of that.
But what does that have to do with her?

462
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,452
Mm.

463
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:36,791
I'm the prosecutor
who's in charge of the trial.

464
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,168
I received a tip-off.

465
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,836
(clattering)

466
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,007
(clattering stops)

467
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:06,339
MAN: Stop there!

468
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,343
Who are you?

469
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:14,013
I'm a prosecutor.
Didn't you hear that we were coming?

470
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:18,976
This is a restricted area. Please leave.

471
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,521
I'm just doing my job.

472
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:22,980
It needs to look like I'm working.

473
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:26,317
SUHYEON: Jeez, those vehicles look nice.

474
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,069
They're huge.

475
00:33:29,862 --> 00:33:31,572
You don't have a warrant.

476
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:32,990
This is a restricted area.

477
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:36,035
A warrant to check out the parking lot?
I need permission to enter?

478
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,287
Employees only.

479
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:42,125
Oh, I see.

480
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,336
Fine. Loosen up.

481
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:51,425
MAN: Stop there.

482
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,264
The exit is over there.

483
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,893
Fine.

484
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:12,196
Come on. Of course I know.

485
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,867
How could Haesong have anything
to do with that heinous crime?

486
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,952
That's just ludicrous.

487
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:22,248
But still, I thought I'd come here
to let you guys know.

488
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:25,209
Here. I brought my business card.

489
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,670
Here you go.

490
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:34,886
Please put in a good word for me
with the chairman.

491
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:37,722
PROSECUTOR HAN: Okay?

492
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,897
TEAM LEADER LEE: And the prosecutor?

493
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,733
CHA: I don't think you need to worry.
I'll look into it and report back.

494
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:50,067
TEAM LEADER LEE: All right.

495
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,536
(tires screeching)

496
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:14,467
(suspenseful music)

497
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:21,474
That car. That one was in the basement.

498
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:22,975
-Let's go.
-Okay.

499
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:30,274
All of their other vehicles
were in the ground-floor parking lot.

500
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,068
It must have a different purpose.

501
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:35,238
You're right. I do find it suspicious,
Prosecutor Song.

502
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:36,822
Are you a prosecutor?

503
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:41,744
Sir, don't lose sight of that car.
Get close.

504
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:42,995
Yes, sir.

505
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:45,790
(thuds)

506
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:47,541
(thuds)

507
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:49,752
(thuds)

508
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:51,379
(exhales heavily)

509
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,803
(metal clanking)

510
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:03,099
(panting)

511
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,350
(thuds)

512
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:08,187
(beeping)

513
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:09,397
OPEN

514
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:26,289
That's a big problem.
I wonder who spread that information.

515
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,001
JANG: What'll happen now?

516
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,795
I'm adding
the finishing touches to the design.

517
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:34,797
Haesong will contact you later.

518
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:36,924
Ah.

519
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:41,178
Excuse me.

520
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,891
May I speak with the chairman?

521
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,895
I need to speak with him urgently.

522
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,106
I'll tell his secretary.

523
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:55,776
Oh, that's okay.

524
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:00,614
What is it, ma'am?

525
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,159
Well…

526
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:05,911
You see…

527
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:09,540
Uh…

528
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,167
Ms. Jang.

529
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,004
The Adamas.

530
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:23,596
I rarely get to work
on a gemstone this big.

531
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:28,017
At first, I just couldn't believe it.

532
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,853
But I thought he should know.

533
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:35,232
I don't know how to put this, but--

534
00:37:35,316 --> 00:37:38,110
I'm sorry for cutting you off,
but may I use your bathroom?

535
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,323
Sure. It's over there.

536
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:46,160
(clatters)

537
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:53,751
(door closes)

538
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,379
(sighs)

539
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,255
Hey, Mr. Cho.

540
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:02,343
What? Why are you telling me this now?

541
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:05,388
MAN: <i>I'm sorry, sir.
I wanted to take care of it myself.</i>

542
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,598
It's okay. I'll go.

543
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:14,563
(ominous music)

544
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:31,872
SUHYEON: It doesn't look like
an ordinary residence.

545
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,874
But I doubt it's Team A's headquarters.

546
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,669
SEOHEE: Judging by the tight security,
there's definitely something inside.

547
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,212
It doesn't look that high, right?

548
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,090
Are you going to climb it?

549
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,512
Wait here.

550
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:48,013
What'll you do?

551
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:49,890
We can't leave like this.

552
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,559
Let's just tell SIH the location.

553
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,727
We're already here.
That's a waste of time.

554
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,063
SEOHEE: Prosecutor Song.

555
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,643
(dramatic music)

556
00:39:58,501 --> 00:39:59,793
(clatters)

557
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,504

00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:14,767
Darn it.

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,102
(tense music)

561
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:54,056
-Wrap it up.
-Don't worry, sir.

Hey.

Hey.

566
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:18,599
Hey.

567
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,185
-(shatters)
-(Suhyeon groans)

568
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:24,063
Go upstairs!

569

(gasps)

570
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:30,235
Damn it!

00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,155
(Suhyeon grunts)

572
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,202
Hey.

573
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:41,538
Hey.

574
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,249
(sighs)

575
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,481
Call the police and report it as suicide.

576
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:08,607
Yes, sir.

577

579
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,688
Who are you?

580
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,566
Damn it.

581
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,485

Damn it.

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,389
(groans)

590
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,559
Prosecutor Song.

(both grunt)

592
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,107
Run.

(grunts, panting)

594
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:49,351
You didn't see him?

595
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:52,145
-No, sir.
-Damn it!

596
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:54,815
What are you doing? Go get him!

597
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:55,983
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:58,986
Damn it.

599
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:02,990
There he is!

600
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:07,494
Run.

601
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,164
(men screaming)

602
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:12,583
(groans)

603
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,169
Keep running.

604
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:23,176
(groaning continues)

You bastards!

Get all the CCTV and dashcam footage!

612

HYESOO:
I didn't expect to meet you like this.

615
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:16,521
I'm Eun Hyesoo.

616
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:18,482
Yes, I know who you are.

617
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:20,359
I didn't expect to meet you
like this either.

618
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:23,695
I must've come in the nick of time.

619
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:26,490
I think you were being chased.

620
00:47:26,573 --> 00:47:28,992
Yes. As you can see.

621
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,203
What brings you here?

622
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:33,830
First, who are you?

623
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:37,334
I'm Kim Seohee, a reporter.

624
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,710
I see.

625
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,131
What were you two doing here?

626
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,385
We were looking into a case.

627
00:47:46,468 --> 00:47:47,844
Lee Changwoo's case?

628
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,935
Did Mr. Ha not mention me to you?

629
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:57,396
I was the one who sent him that letter.

630
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,690
Yes, I heard.

631
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:02,401
We're not friends,
but we're not enemies either.

632
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:04,111
Let down your guard,

633
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:06,279
Ms. Kim.

634
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:09,324
You didn't answer my question.

635
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:11,201
What brings you here?

636
00:48:11,994 --> 00:48:13,829
You're the wary type.

637
00:48:14,997 --> 00:48:16,081
And fearless too.

638
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:19,960
Mr. Ha asked me

639
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,379
to see if the Adamas was safe.

640
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:26,258
Is that where the Adamas is?

641
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:30,554
Yes. Did you not know that?

642
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:33,306
Then why were you guys there?

643
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:36,018
That's why security was so tight.

644
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:38,270
They wouldn't have exposed it like that

645
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,897
if the site was to be operated in secret.

646
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:43,525
They?

647
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:46,486
(sighs)

648
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,155
Then was that woman…

649
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:49,781
Did you see Ms. Jang?

650
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:51,783
I heard that's where she went.

651
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:53,660
Isn't Ms. Jang…

652
00:48:57,622 --> 00:48:59,124
Where in the world are you?

653
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:01,001
Ms. Jang is dead.

654
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:03,712
What did you say?

655
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:05,464
Ms. Jang is dead.

656
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:08,050
The jewelry designer is dead.

657
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:09,843
I saw it with my own eyes.

658
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:11,636
She was hanging from the handrail.

659
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,808
No. It was murder.

660
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,560
It was him.

661
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:25,734
Mr. Lee killed her.

662
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:28,737
SUHYEON: Let's talk in person.

663
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:32,616
I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house. Okay.

664
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:36,912
Things have gotten pretty dangerous.

665
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:40,791
Is Woosin really safe?

666
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:43,835
SUHYEON: Ms. Eun.

667
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:46,838
-(horn honking)
-SEOHEE: Hey.

668
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:05,565
Hold on.

669
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:09,236
CHIEF JEONG: That license plate number.

670
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:20,288
Should I drop you off here?

671
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:21,581
Sure.

672
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:22,833
Is there anything…

673
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,836
you'd like to say to Mr. Ha?

674
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:32,467
Tell him to be safe and--

675
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:34,594
Let's go. We have no time to waste.

676
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,019
(car door closes)

677
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:51,820
Is something wrong?

678
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:53,738
No, it's just that…

679
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:56,950
Do you think she's trustworthy?

680
00:50:57,033 --> 00:51:00,287
Seeing how she came here,
Woosin must be making a move too.

681
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:02,205
Let's go.

682
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:09,004
(scoffs)

683
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:12,090
SUHYEON: <i>I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house.</i>

684
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:15,218
You should've at least told me.

685
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:17,804
How dare you lie?

686
00:51:18,763 --> 00:51:21,016
Is there someone else
helping you other than me?

687
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:22,767
No.

688
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:25,729
In this house or outside?

689
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:27,606
There's no one else.

690
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:29,316
(sighs)

691
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,318
(horn honks)

692
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:32,652
In this case,

693
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:35,989
it's a different story.

694
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,700
(ringing)

695
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:41,828
MR. JEONG
ACCEPT REJECT

696
00:51:42,537 --> 00:51:44,206
MS. LEE: <i>You caused trouble again.</i>

697
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:45,707
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,752
What if they find out about our safe house
thanks to your recklessness?

699
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:49,920
Do you think you'll be safe?

700
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:52,297
We'll all go down!

701
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,507
I noticed that the roads leading here

702
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:56,927
are in CCTV blind spots.

703
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,137
I thought you had already taken measures.

704
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:02,933
Seriously.

705
00:52:03,016 --> 00:52:06,311
Quit treating me like a kid
and answer me this.

706
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:08,772
Why did Mr. Kang want to talk
with Prosecutor Song in private?

707
00:52:20,158 --> 00:52:21,243
Suicide?

708
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,746
That's what the police said.

709
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,581
No, it was murder.

710
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:30,460
SUHYEON: <i>Why would she kill herself
after finishing the new design?</i>

711
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:38,134
Let's raid Ares immediately.

712
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:40,470
(scoffs)
As if a warrant would be issued.

713
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:43,431
Let's arrest them without a warrant first.
We'll get it later.

714
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:47,644
I definitely saw Mr. Lee there.

715
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,313
-Murder?
-Yes!

716
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:56,695
Who do you think is responsible
for Ms. Jang's death?

717
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,114
-What?
-It's Mr. Ha.

718
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:01,658
He's the one
who wanted to spread the rumor

719
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:03,493
about her having the Adamas.

720
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:06,371
He assumed that Team A

721
00:53:06,454 --> 00:53:09,124
would take the Adamas back to the mansion
for security purposes.

722
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:12,794
She was killed by Team A as punishment.

723
00:53:12,877 --> 00:53:15,171
They must've thought
she was the one who breached security.

724
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:20,427
If it wasn't for Mr. Ha,
she'd still be alive.

725
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:22,220
Let's not complicate things.

726
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:30,395
Jeez, I almost fell for it.

727
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:34,607
You're wrong.

728
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:38,611
If Team A had killed her
because they fell for Woosin's scheme,

729
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:40,280
they would've put her on display.

730
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:42,407
"Mess with Haesong,
and you'll end up dead."

731
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,659
They would've let others know.

732
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,202
But they're remaining quiet.

733
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:51,374
So it was Team A's doing,
but we've yet to know the motive.

734
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:54,836
Yet if you're claiming
that Woosin is responsible for her death,

735
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:57,756
I would be offended to hear that.

736
00:53:58,381 --> 00:54:01,217
(sighs)
The ceremony is around the corner.

737
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,553
If we get the Adamas before then,
then it's all over.

738
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:06,556
-So let's stop.
-Don't make me laugh.

739
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:08,558
If the fighter doesn't compete,
then who will?

740
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,769
The ring is out there.

741
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,817
If we back out of this,
what about Ms. Kim's safety?

742
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:20,820
(groans)

743
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:24,407
Do you think she'll still be alive
even without our protection?

744
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:27,285
That's a cheap move.

745
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:30,955
Prosecutor Song, who do you think
will be responsible for Ms. Kim's death?

746
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:50,934
(tires screech)

747
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,018
(crashing)

748
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:59,859
SUN: The SIH will turn on
their emergency generator.

749
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,238
Then the buildings around them
will also get electricity.

750
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:06,991
DEPUTY PARK: <i>But we won't see any light
if they're underground.</i>

751
00:55:07,242 --> 00:55:08,535
It doesn't matter.

752
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:12,330
Just look for electromagnetic waves
above a certain level.

753
00:55:18,503 --> 00:55:21,131
(beeping)

754
00:55:30,473 --> 00:55:32,142
(beeping continues)

755
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:38,231
I'll be keeping an eye from now on.

756
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:40,442
-SUHYEON: No, thank you.
-I mean Ms. Kim.

757
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:45,363
(scoffs)

758
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,451
Why are you suddenly so overprotective?

759
00:55:49,742 --> 00:55:51,202
You guys weren't like this.

760
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,913
-It's just that--
-Tell me.

761
00:55:55,498 --> 00:55:56,958
What do you guys have up your sleeve?

762
00:55:58,793 --> 00:55:59,794
SEOHEE: A blackout?

763
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:03,214
The entire neighborhood must be out.

764
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:06,468
I'll take a look.

765
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:10,013
Stay right here.

766
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,482
You startled me.

767
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:25,111
Who are you?

768
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:27,489
Hi.

769
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:35,955
Me?

770
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:42,212
(screeching)

771
00:56:45,465 --> 00:56:46,424

(Ms. Lee groans)

00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:46,568
(screams in pain)

783
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:51,197
Should I let you live or not?

784
00:57:53,157 --> 00:57:55,034
(gasping)

785
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:03,543

00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,343
(breathing heavily)

789
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:17,307
Why can't you answer me?
Are you guys scheming something?

790
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,766
-No, sir.
-(phone buzzing)

791
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:21,436
And I'm just obeying commands.

792
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:23,771
I'm on my way.

793
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:26,274
(Seohee panting)

794
00:58:26,357 --> 00:58:27,442
Ms. Kim?

795
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,152
It's Ms. Lee.

796
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:37,368
SEOHEE: Help me.

797
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:46,210
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

798
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:49,881
Ms. Kim.

799
00:58:53,593 --> 00:58:55,595
(tense music)

800
00:59:17,408 --> 00:59:18,409
(tense music stops)

801
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:27,502
MAN: Lee Changwoo?

802
00:59:27,585 --> 00:59:29,003
MR. CHOI: He mainly robbed those
who were influential.

803
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:32,965
He took their money, gems, and gold bars.
And something even more priceless.

804
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:35,551
Proof of their corruption.

805
00:59:36,135 --> 00:59:38,638
That's why they called him
the notorious thief.

806
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:39,722
Right.

807
00:59:39,806 --> 00:59:43,267
Anyone he robbed
was thought to be corrupt.

808
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:45,645
They'd be branded
and judged by the public.

809
00:59:46,312 --> 00:59:48,856
Look into those
whose lives were ruined because of him.

810
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:51,943
-Pardon?
-See if they're connected with Haesong

811
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:53,361
and how.

812
00:59:53,945 --> 00:59:57,323
What do you mean?
You're onto something, aren't you?

813
00:59:57,907 --> 00:59:59,534
Don't report to headquarters just yet.

814
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:02,662
Taesung.

815
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,544
Lee Changwoo and Team A?

816
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:12,839
RECEPTION ROOM

817
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:15,967
COMPANIONSHIP, ORDER, ESTABLISHMENT

818
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:31,065
Why are you holding your tongue
when you're the one who asked to see me?

819
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:33,401
I see.

820
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:35,361
Do I need to greet you first?

821
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:38,156
It's been a long time.

822
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,744
You don't look like you used to.
You've aged.

823
01:00:42,827 --> 01:00:43,995
You're the one who put me

824
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:46,873
in the punishment room, aren't you?

825
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:48,541
Ooh.

826
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,335
You sound like your old self.

827
01:00:51,419 --> 01:00:52,628
What are you trying to pull?

828
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:57,383
(sighs)
Where should I begin?

829
01:00:58,676 --> 01:01:01,262
Okay. I'll cut to the chase.

830
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,055
Simply put…

831
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,604
It all started because of him.

832
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:11,522
Song Suhyeon.

833
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:16,194
TEAM LEADER LEE: Congratulations.
You've found your long-lost son.

834
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,695
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY 99.99997%

835
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:19,655
Cut this nonsense.

836
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:22,700
Hey. You're not surprised.

837
01:01:22,784 --> 01:01:23,743
Shut up.

838
01:01:25,244 --> 01:01:27,830
I will no longer fall for your lies.

839
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:33,461
Song Suhyeon

840
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,797
is dead.

841
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:38,257
I killed him.

842
01:01:39,383 --> 01:01:41,219
Because he killed my brother.

843
01:01:42,678 --> 01:01:44,472
Don't be too sad.

844
01:01:44,555 --> 01:01:46,015
I kept one of them alive.

845
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:49,977
How great is it that they're twins?

846
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:51,562
(laughs)

847
01:02:03,032 --> 01:02:04,492
What does this mean?

848
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:09,121
Why did she suddenly chop down the tree?

849
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:13,000
WOOSIN: She got rid of her guilt.

850
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:15,378
In layman's terms, will you?

851
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:18,130
Her son hanged himself from this tree.

852
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,634
What do you think she felt
looking at it every day?

853
01:02:21,717 --> 01:02:22,760
(sighs)

854
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,638
-Agony?
-That's right.

855
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:28,975
But she's free from it now.

856
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:30,935
She's no longer in agony.

857
01:02:31,978 --> 01:02:33,312
How heartless.

858
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:36,524
She's willing to forget
about her late son.

859
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,569
(Mr. Choi chuckles)
She might as well celebrate it.

860
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:43,614
By the way, Haesong's vehicle
is on its way here.

861
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:46,284
The Security Team was given notice.

862
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,871
We succeeded. Everything went as planned.

863
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,833
I looked up the license plate number.
It's a bulletproof transport vehicle.

864
01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:58,546
MR. CHOI: <i>It's been used for transporting
expensive artworks or antiques until now.</i>

865
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:00,256
<i>What do you think it is this time?</i>

866
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:02,216
WOOSIN: <i>The Adamas.</i>

867
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,510
We just need to steal it on D-day, right?

868
01:03:05,636 --> 01:03:07,054
You make it sound so simple.

869
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:09,432
They'll strengthen security.

870
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,058
It won't be a cakewalk.

871
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,644
So what? I'm bound to fail anyway.

872
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:16,105
What do you mean?

873
01:03:16,355 --> 01:03:18,941
Don't play dumb. The SIH's plan B.

874
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:23,321
Did you think I wouldn't know

875
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:25,406
the true reason why you colluded with me?

876
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,076
(scoffs)

877
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:30,745
(Mr. Choi sighs)

878
01:03:32,538 --> 01:03:35,082
So you've known all along
yet you went along with it?

879
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:39,003
Because that's the only way
I'll get my hands on the Adamas.

880
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:44,550
WOOSIN: <i>I'll put on a show that day
and pretend to steal it.</i>

881
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:45,801
(door clatters)

882
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:48,054
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

883
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:50,848
Put your hands up!

884
01:03:51,432 --> 01:03:54,393
WOOSIN:
<i>The police will arrive and arrest me.</i>

885
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:55,811
Mission complete.

886
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:58,981
You'll get the Adamas
as proof of the theft.

887
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:01,400
Of course, you'd be the one
who reported it.

888
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:04,236
You'll get into Team A by reporting me.

889
01:04:09,158 --> 01:04:12,578
You know I can't request
a retrial with the stolen object.

890
01:04:12,995 --> 01:04:16,082
Haesong's attorneys will ask me
how I got it.

891
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:18,417
They'll state that it was taken illegally.

892
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,628
And accuse Prosecutor Song
as the mastermind.

893
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:23,422
The SIH had a good reason to do this.

894
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:26,884
There was no way to get a warrant.
But if you're caught in the act…

895
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:30,221
They can search the mansion
under the pretense of catching the thief.

896
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:33,391
And maybe even find something
that could be fatal to Haesong.

897
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:39,522
Was this your plan all along?

898
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:41,983
Don't be sorry.

899
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:46,988
Everything was my plan

900
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:49,073
and choice.

901
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:52,702
Don't you want to save Song Woosin?

902
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:57,206
Lay a finger on him, and I'll--

903
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:00,668
Come on.
This isn't the time to threaten me.

904
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:02,962
You should beg.

905
01:05:03,045 --> 01:05:04,714
(shouts)
Lee Junkyung!

906
01:05:12,096 --> 01:05:13,639
Don't raise your voice.

907
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:17,977
That won't change anything.

908
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:22,690
All right. Now, tell me.

909
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:25,192
Where did you hide it?

910
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:27,737
The Adamas.

911
01:05:32,283 --> 01:05:33,826
You took it.

912
01:05:34,994 --> 01:05:35,995
What's wrong?

913
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:38,998
Did you lose it?

914
01:05:39,081 --> 01:05:41,083
Enough with this act, god damn it.

915
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:43,335
Where did you hide it?

916
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:46,172
The real Adamas.

917
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:49,133
Not the fake one.

918
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:09,320
WOOSIN: <i>The Adamas has returned.
It'll be revealed again at the ceremony.</i>

919
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:18,370
MY PATH

920
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,124
We're back to square one.

921
01:06:23,959 --> 01:06:25,294
Reset.

922
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:28,547
MY PATH

923
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:30,883
(tense music)

924
01:06:54,532 --> 01:06:55,658
(grunts)

925
01:07:21,267 --> 01:07:23,561
(gentle music)

926
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:34,697
MS. KWON: <i>Here is the list of guests.</i>

927
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,282
DONGRIM: <i>You were invited after all.</i>

928
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:38,159
WOOSIN: <i>The satellite phone disappeared?</i>

929
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:40,828
MAN: <i>Do you think Ms. Kim is okay?</i>

930
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:44,248
CHANGWOO:
<i>I wonder if Chairman Kwon forgot about me.</i>

931
01:07:44,832 --> 01:07:45,958
HYUKPIL: <i>It's a trap.</i>

932
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,251
SUHYEON: <i>You should locate Mr. Lee.</i>

933
01:07:47,918 --> 01:07:50,379
<i>You should've raided
Haesong's main office!</i>

934
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:53,924
Did you lose him or let him go?

935
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:55,801
HYESOO: <i>I found out</i>

936
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,387
<i>whom you're working with.</i>

937
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:00,806
TEAM LEADER LEE: <i>That's D-day.</i>
