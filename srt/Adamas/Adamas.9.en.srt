1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,344
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,972
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,767
WOOSIN: There is something
I don't understand

4
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,561
no matter how much I think about it.

5
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,858
The reason why
they're keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,153
This is what I'm more curious about.

7
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,909
What are you trying to insinuate
if your purpose is a retrial?

8
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,416
It's because of Lee Changwoo, right?

9
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,295
You want to save him.

10
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,051
But why?

11
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,763
What is your relationship to him?

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,227
(sighs)

13
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,256
MR. JEONG

14
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,883
HERE'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
875-3 YEONGIN-RO SUSEONG-GU.

15
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,103
-Here you go.
-(thuds)

16
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,567
Come on. You shouldn't be focused
on writing that memoir right now.

17
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,360
What do you mean?

18
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,737
The Adamas.
You said you were going to steal it.

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,864
DONGRIM: We need a plan--

20
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,824
The 80th-anniversary ceremony.

21
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,953
(whirs)

22
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,913
That's D-day.

23
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,374
D-day?

24
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,293
They'll bring it out once again.

25
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,253
That's when…
(whoops)

26
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,216
But Ms. Kwon is in charge
of the entire ceremony.

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,843
Will she invite you?

28
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,637
Probably not.

29
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,141
Then everything will have been in vain.

30
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,559
We should do something.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,021
(slurps)

32
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,397
(Woosin exhales)

33
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,775
I am.

34
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,360
(keyboard clacking)

35
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,004
I heard you're going out, ma'am.

36
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,297
And?

37
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
What is it about, ma'am?

38
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm sorry, Ms. Hyesoo.

39
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,102
A dress fitting for the ceremony.

40
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,071
MS. KWON: A dress?

41
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,572
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,615
(Ms. Kwon scoffs)

43
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,284
She should just pick any dress.

44
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,745
Does she think the ceremony is about her?

45
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,558
Master, I have something to tell you.

46
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
Okay.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,774
Mr. Ha has an ulterior motive
for coming here.

48
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,110
Is that so?

49
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,237
It's for his next piece.

50
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,615
To write a story about Haesongwon.
He's here for research.

51
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,285
Mm.

52
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
Cut to the chase.

53
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,665
What about our family?

54
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,834
Well…

55
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,753
Ms. Kwon.

56
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,428
It's about Mr. Minjo.

57
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,515
He thinks someone may have
intentionally harmed him.

58
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,102
So I did my utmost
to prevent him from writing about that.

59
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,687
I was protecting you.

60
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,857
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,610
People would gossip
if they got wind of this.

62
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,737
KWON: Protect me?

63
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,031
What for?

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,743
Because that helicopter incident was…

65
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,413
Ms. Kwon.

66
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,957
I just--

67
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,293
Are you insinuating that I killed my son?

68
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,587
I…

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,297
It wasn't me.

70
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,424
-Pardon?
-It wasn't me.

71
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,471
I killed Minjo?

72
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,144
Is that what you thought of me all along?

73
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,731
That I killed my son?

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,900
That I killed…

75
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,863
Goodness. I'm sorry, sir!

76
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,032
Blood may have gotten on my hands

77
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,952
but never his!

78
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,039
Even if everyone else thought
I had killed him,

79
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,084
you of all people
shouldn't have thought so.

80
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,004
How dare you?

81
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,424
I must've been out of my mind!

82
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,218
I'm sorry, master!

83
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,179
Get out! Before I break your other leg.

84
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,848
(sobbing)
Master, please forgive me!

85
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,225
Leave this instant!

86
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,852
Do you want to crawl
for the rest of your life?

87
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,021
Please forgive me!

88
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,484
I knew you were fond of Mr. Ha.

89
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,155
It broke my heart to think
that it was all because of Mr. Minjo.

90
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,909
I was worried that he was just using

91
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,954
your love and affection to his advantage.

92
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:59,544
(sobbing continues)

93
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,586
(sighs)

94
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,464
If you want to be treated well,

95
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,591
watch what you say!

96
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,220
(wailing)

97
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,395
"I'd like to announce that I'll be
the next chairman of Haesong Group.

98
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,607
I have grown alongside Haesong
for a very long time.

99
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,153
And now, I'd like to lead us
into a new beginning…"

100
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,907
(sighs)

101
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,622
PRESIDENT KWON HYUNJO

102
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,665
(scoffs)

103
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,542
(clanks)

104
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,421
Minjo.

105
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,506
Are you watching me?

106
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,885
Haesong is mine now.

107
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,058
Father wants to give me the company.

108
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,021
Really?

109
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,316
I declined.

110
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,488
I see. Why?

111
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,115
I met with Mr. Lee Changwoo.

112
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:19,373
(sighs)
Hey, what are you trying to do?

113
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,375
I wanted him to know
that I know he's not guilty.

114
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,212
And that I know who the real killer is.

115
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,717
Minjo…

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,303
You know everything too.
You heard it all that night.

117
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,225
Then what about Haesong?
What do you think will happen?

118
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,730
Hold on. Are you saying
you'll betray our father?

119
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,775
You value the company
more than Father, don't you?

120
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,320
Not me.
I couldn't care less about Haesong.

121
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,157
Jeez, look at how snobbish you are.

122
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,743
Hyunjo.

123
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,624
No matter what others say,
he was a wonderful father to us.

124
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,625
(scoffs)

125
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,794
Maybe to you.

126
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,880
You're right.

127
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,758
He was an angel to me.

128
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,468
That's why I can't give up on him.

129
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,264
He needs a chance to repent.
It's only right.

130
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,308
Don't do it.

131
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,812
I've already made up my mind.

132
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,939
Kwon Minjo.

133
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,374
I beg of you.

134
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,294
Let's sweep this under the rug. Please?

135
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,297
You turn a blind eye, and this goes away.

136
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,885
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,889
Father will never forgive you!

138
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,896
He could never harm me.

139
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,358
You know that.

140
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,199
(door opens, closes)

141
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,493
He may never lay a finger on you.

142
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,496
But I can.

143
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,791
You know that.

144
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,135
We looked into everyone who entered
and exited that building,

145
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,678
and Kim Seohee wasn't one of them.

146
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,722
She squirmed her way out.

147
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,682
No, we kept a close eye on the building.

148
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,644
We watched all the entrances
and even the underground parking lot.

149
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,020
She's still in there.

150
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,857
She's terrified after learning
of Song Suhyeon's death.

151
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,276
She's not in there.

152
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,363
Then what?

153
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,115
Did she exit through a manhole
or a drain like in the movies?

154
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,867
(laughs)

155
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,202
Is that funny to you?

156
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,371
I'm sorry, ma'am.

157
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,290
Get me the floor plan of the basement.

158
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,044
Let me see how she squirmed her way out.

159
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,839
At one o'clock sharp,

160
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,592
an e-mail is scheduled to be sent
to each media outlet.

161
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,469
SEOHEE: It's a scoop.

162
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,514
With keywords Lee Changwoo,
Haesong, and SIH.

163
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,475
It'll turn this country upside down.

164
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,937
If you let me out, I won't send it.

165
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,565
Is this because of Prosecutor Song?

166
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,818
I need to see for myself
that he's alive and well.

167
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,112
You have seven minutes.

168
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,824
Bring him here so I can see for myself.

169
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,661
Or be prepared to explain
who you are to the world.

170
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,039
Six minutes.

171
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,292
Both of you are so stubborn.

172
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
Take her to the basement.

173
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,724
-This is…
-An air-raid shelter built in the 1970s.

174
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,935
Prosecutor Song is here?

175
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,398
Yes. We just declared him dead
to keep him safe.

176
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,483
We knew Team A would look into it.

177
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,361
But how did he survive?

178
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,072
I heard Mr. Baek died on the scene.

179
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,032
That's because...

180
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,285
(grunts)

181
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,287
...he acted as a human shield.

182
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,415
Don't be sorry.

183
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,959
We've lost countless colleagues until now.

184
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,547
Had we grieved every time we lost someone,
we would've gone crazy by now.

185
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,469
That's why both Mr. Kang and I
are trying to remain strong. To survive.

186
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,597
If not,
we wouldn't be able to do this job.

187
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,726
This will take us to the safe house above.
That's where he is.

188
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,169
(Suhyeon grunts)

189
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,337
SUHYEON: <i>Who… Who are you?</i>

190
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,339
Who are you?

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,718
Sun.

192
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,178
(gasps)

193
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,765
Sun.

194
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,491
He's in the--

195
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,911
(sighs)

196
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,046
-Prosecutor Song.
-SUHYEON: Stop.

197
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,883
Hold on.

198
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,642
You were going to hug me, weren't you?

199
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,603
What?

200
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,231
Hold yourself back.

201
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,484
I have a rib fracture.

202
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,320
I could really die.

203
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,368
Seeing how you're cracking jokes,
you must be doing all right.

204
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,744
(chuckles)

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,123
You're right.

206
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,793
I can't believe I'm joking around
in this situation.

207
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,802
Mr. Gong died.

208
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,849
And Mr. Baek…

209
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,812
-Prosecutor Song.
-It was all because of me.

210
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,610
They died because of me.

211
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,536
Song Suhyeon.

212
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,919
It's not over yet.

213
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,422
We should give it another try.

214
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,467
For their sakes too.

215
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,309
That jewelry designer
hasn't been spotted for the past two days.

216
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,729
The CCTV camera recorded her
entering her house.

217
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,397
But I think she avoided the CCTV cameras

218
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,275
to move elsewhere afterward.

219
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,653
They don't want to reveal where she is.

220
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,324
How about we follow Mr. Ha's suggestion

221
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,409
so they'll make a move first?

222
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,122
Spread a rumor about Ms. Jang
being in possession of the Adamas?

223
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,793
(Sun sighs)

224
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,546
SUN: The hot water and gas pipes run
through the east, west, and south sides.

225
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,965
Then there's the north side.

226
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,634
Had they drilled into the north side,

227
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,136
it would've been easier
to connect it with the other pipes.

228
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,097
But they went around it.

229
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,807
SUN: Why?

230
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,643
Because there's a secret tunnel there.

231
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,313
Look at that. How fancy.

232
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,818
The entrance must be somewhere there.

233
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,363
MS. LEE: You were given a name?

234
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,658
Sun.

235
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,660
Do you recognize that name?

236
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,995
No.

237
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,248
So you're saying
that's who killed Baek, right?

238
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,167
I heard a female voice.

239
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,294
Are you sure?

240
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,589
Why are you so surprised? It was a woman.

241
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Team A could have female members too.

242
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,303
Does anyone come to mind?

243
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,348
Yes. She's their only female killer.

244
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,350
MS. LEE: She's known to be a psycho.

245
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,353
I heard she enjoys
torturing her targets to death.

246
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,856
What a ridiculous character.

247
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,816
(Suhyeon clears throat)

248
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,404
Yes, Mr. Kang.

249
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,244
(Suhyeon groans)

250
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,497
I need to go somewhere. Stay here.

251
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,208
Prosecutor Song.

252
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,252
(door opens)

253
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,797
Prosecutor Song.

254
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,216
I told you to stay here.

255
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,259
I'm coming too.

256
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,846
Two people died because of me.
I can't just sit still.

257
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,265
Go back inside.

258
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm coming with you.

259
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,604
Didn't you hear her? She's dangerous.

260
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,901
(metal clacking)

261
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,030
Don't worry. The fortune teller said
I'd live an extremely long life.

262
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,075
Ms. Kim.

263
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,578
Ms. Kim…

264
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,749
What are you…

265
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,171
Are you crazy?

266
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,297
(mouthing)
Hurry!

267
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,340
(loud sigh)

268
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,844
This is a bit high.

269
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,013
Darn it.

270
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,766
(gasps)

271
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,563
-(grunts)
-(groans)

272
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,606
Are you okay?

273
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,943
(panting)

274
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,319
So what's the plan?

275
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,947
(sighs)
We enter the tiger's den.

276
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,032
Where?

277
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,409
Let's talk on our way there.
Are you all right?

278
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,217
Mr. Kang said you shouldn't leave…

279
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,513
Damn it.

280
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,269
(sobbing)

281
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,274
-I'm sorry, master!
-Get out!

282
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,568
Before I break your other leg.

283
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,613
-Master, please forgive me!
-Leave this instant!

284
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,032
Do you want to crawl
for the rest of your life?

285
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,869
MS. KWON: Please forgive me!

286
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,037
(breathes shakily)

287
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,057
MEMOIR (WORKING TITLE)

288
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,559
WOOSIN: This is the rough draft.

289
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,353
So soon?

290
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,648
I rushed a bit so I could get it done
before the ceremony.

291
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,735
What do you mean?

292
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,739
I heard it was also
your retirement ceremony.

293
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,784
I thought it'd be more meaningful
if you published it that day.

294
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,411
Mm.

295
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,997
You should retire in style

296
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,832
for everything to pan out well.

297
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,840
I do see a resemblance.

298
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,261
-Pardon?
-I feel like this could be fate. Or not.

299
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,430
That's how I feel.

300
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,265
I'm hoping it's the former.

301
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,893
What about you?

302
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,730
Am I just being greedy?

303
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,613
I like your idea.
I should reveal my memoir

304
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,740
that day.

305
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,619
Does this mean
you'll be attending the ceremony as well?

306
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,663
Well…

307
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,916
(chuckles)

308
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,378
It would be my honor.

309
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,380
(laughs)

310
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,181
So I got an invite.

311
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,080
What brings you here?

312
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,666
I'll do the interview right now.

313
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,004
But I submitted the draft
to the chairman just now.

314
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,299
I just want to talk.

315
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,677
Okay. Sure.

316
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,022
Are you simply just lucky
or actually talented?

317
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,734
I'm tired of always asking what you mean.

318
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,654
Why do I always lose to you?

319
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,823
What did I beat you in?

320
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,616
I'm totally lost.

321
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,329
Fine. Let me ask you one thing.

322
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,248
It feels like I'm the interviewee.

323
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,876
I'm listening.

324
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,338
Who told you about my son?

325
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,174
There's a spy in this house, isn't there?

326
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,301
Is it Mr. Choi
whom you've been awfully close with?

327
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,554
No?

328
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,806
Then Ms. Hyesoo?

329
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,101
Or Mr. Kim, your fan?

330
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,314
Right. There's also
that money-grubber Ms. Oh.

331
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,941
Answer me.

332
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,862
Who was it? Tell me.

333
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,117
Kwon Minjo.

334
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,873
We ran into each other
while I was volunteering.

335
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,708
Liar.

336
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,335
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

337
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,214
But that's when I heard
about the chairman's heart transplant.

338
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,258
He also told me
that your son was the donor.

339
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,637
That's all.

340
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,640
Like I said,
the rest was from my imagination.

341
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,851
I have a question for you too.

342
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,979
Why didn't you tell the chairman?

343
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,191
It seems like
he doesn't know about that novel.

344
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,654
I only kept my mouth shut
because I knew he'd be heartbroken.

345
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,115
He doted on my son more than anyone else.

346
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:33,453
So don't you dare
talk about my dear Hoon ever again.

347
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,705
Or I'll chop off your tongue.

348
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,583
The interview is over.

349
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,093
(door opens)

350
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,224
Jeez. Mr. Ha.

351
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,893
What's wrong with you? Why would you
willingly get on her bad side?

352
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,728
Don't provoke her anymore.

353
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,897
It's already nerve-racking as is.

354
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,025
I'm only making her come to her senses.

355
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,655
She must realize the love
she had for her son

356
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,825
so that her animosity
against Chairman Kwon can grow.

357
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,163
I think I saw hope.

358
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,791
What? What are you on about?

359
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,628
She said his name for the first time.
Hoon.

360
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,257
Her son's name.

361
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,975
Lee Changwoo, the notorious thief.
Do you know why he got that nickname?

362
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,561
That's because he mainly robbed
influential individuals.

363
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,856
Not just cash and jewelry, but…

364
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,110
their safes.

365
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
(fingers snap)
That's it.

366
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,072
What if he hadn't been after the money?

367
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,370
MS. KWON: Mr. Choi!

368
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,960
Bring me a power saw.

369
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,634
A power saw?

370
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,552
This instant!

371
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,563
Your car is waiting
at the front gate, ma'am.

372
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,359
(power saw whirring)

373
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,368
(whirring continues)

374
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,049
MS. OH: Has she finally gone mad?

375
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,260
My goodness.

376
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,345
(creaking)

377
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,513
(crashing)

378
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,736
(sighs)

379
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,717
Mr. Lee, I have something to report.

380
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,760
Took you long enough.

381
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,763
I heard Mr. Kwon summoned you
instead of me.

382
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,350
I'm sorry, sir. He said it was urgent.

383
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,854
I don't want to hear it.
What is the urgency?

384
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,565
He wants us to beef up security
on Ms. Jang, a jewelry designer.

385
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,484
-She's a pretty famous designer.
-Just cut to the chase.

386
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,322
Why does Team A have to escort her?

387
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,241
The Adamas is with her.

388
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,994
They're revealing it
at the 80th-anniversary ceremony,

389
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
and she'll recraft it by then.

390
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,581
(scoffs)

391
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,833
What is it, sir?

392
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,004
Never mind.

393
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,883
What about that?

394
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,551
There's a problem, sir.

395
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,471
Rumor has it that
Ms. Jang knows where the Adamas is.

396
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,765
Word is spreading in the thief community.

397
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,933
The Intelligence Team just told me so.

398
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,477
There's been a security breach.

399
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,480
Who spread the rumor first?

400
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,732
It occurred simultaneously.

401
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,816
Ah.

402
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,070
It'll be difficult to find out who it was.

403
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,655
What should we do?

404
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,699
We should take care of it
before things get complicated.

405
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,495
Where is she right now?

406
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,915
A LAWFUL COUNTRY!
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

407
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,586
ARES.

408
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,714
SUHYEON: <i>I need to find out
how it's related to Team A.</i>

409
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,466
<i>I need your help, Ms. Kim.</i>

410
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,929
That was tasty.

411
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,765
SUHYEON:
<i>I know someone who just loves money.</i>

412
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,266
<i>I need you to throw him some bait.</i>

413
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,519
Prosecutor Han Minsoo?

414
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,105
Who are you?

415
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,066
I see that you had <i>cheonggukjang.</i>

416
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,651
I'm Kim Seohee,
a local news reporter from TNC.

417
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,195
Whatever. I don't know
what this is about, so just leave.

418
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,075
I heard you're in charge
of the Kangchun case's special hearing.

419
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,993
I heard Haesong is involved.

420
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,037
I wonder what you're talking about.

421
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,540
Did you not know that?
Was it a false report?

422
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,127
Look, Ms. Kim.
Stop beating around the bush.

423
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,671
I received a call.

424
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,882
The caller said this case was related
to ARES, an affiliate of Haesong.

425
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,469
We already knew about this
through the tabloids. Were you not aware?

426
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,012
Do you know Team Leader Lee?

427
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,725
What do you expect the prosecution to do
with that information?

428
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,978
It was an anonymous caller,

429
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,188
so I was wondering
if you knew anything about it.

430
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,774
Let me ask you for a favor.

431
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,987
If something comes up, let me know.

432
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,989
(chuckles)

433
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,743
You should know better
than to nonchalantly ask me

434
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,661
for information on an ongoing case.

435
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,539
I don't know what you're talking about,
so please leave.

436
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,712
SUHYEON: <i>He'll make a move once he hears
that Haesong is involved.</i>

437
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,215
<i>He'll inform Haesong
so he can get on their good side.</i>

438
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,759
<i>He won't miss this opportunity.</i>

439
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,303
How may I help you?

440
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,264
I'm from Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

441
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,402
Mr. Lee, a prosecutor
from the Seoul Central District is here.

442
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,945
He's looking for you.

443
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,369
SUHYEON: <i>Once he enters ARES,</i>

444
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,372
<i>I'll follow him too.</i>

445
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,751
Isn't my superior already here?

446
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,211
I'm a bit late.

447
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,006
There he is. Hey…

448
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,800
Thank you.

449
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,651
<i>Wait nearby.</i>

450
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,863
<i>If I don't come out within 30 minutes,
inform the SIH.</i>

451
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,149
EMPLOYEE: Come in, Team Leader Lee.

452
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,443
This is nice.

453
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,112
WOMAN: I heard you were looking for me.

454
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,116
What? You're female.

455
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,451
I'm Team Leader Lee Miyoung.

456
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,746
I'm the only team leader here
whose surname is Lee.

457
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,373
How may I help you?

458
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,334
Oh, it's nothing much.

459
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,045
You're familiar with
the Kangchun Penitentiary massacre, right?

460
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,091
A death-row inmate
slaughtered many individuals.

461
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,346
Right. We're aware of that.
But what does that have to do with her?

462
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,347
Mm.

463
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,686
I'm the prosecutor
who's in charge of the trial.

464
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,063
I received a tip-off.

465
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,731
(clattering)

466
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,902
(clattering stops)

467
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,234
MAN: Stop there!

468
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,238
Who are you?

469
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,908
I'm a prosecutor.
Didn't you hear that we were coming?

470
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,871
This is a restricted area. Please leave.

471
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,416
I'm just doing my job.

472
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,875
It needs to look like I'm working.

473
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,212
SUHYEON: Jeez, those vehicles look nice.

474
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,964
They're huge.

475
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,467
You don't have a warrant.

476
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,885
This is a restricted area.

477
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,930
A warrant to check out the parking lot?
I need permission to enter?

478
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,182
Employees only.

479
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,020
Oh, I see.

480
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,231
Fine. Loosen up.

481
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,320
MAN: Stop there.

482
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,159
The exit is over there.

483
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,788
Fine.

484
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,091
Come on. Of course I know.

485
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,762
How could Haesong have anything
to do with that heinous crime?

486
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,847
That's just ludicrous.

487
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,143
But still, I thought I'd come here
to let you guys know.

488
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,104
Here. I brought my business card.

489
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,565
Here you go.

490
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,781
Please put in a good word for me
with the chairman.

491
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,617
PROSECUTOR HAN: Okay?

492
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,792
TEAM LEADER LEE: And the prosecutor?

493
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,628
CHA: I don't think you need to worry.
I'll look into it and report back.

494
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,962
TEAM LEADER LEE: All right.

495
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,431
(tires screeching)

496
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,362
(suspenseful music)

497
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,369
That car. That one was in the basement.

498
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,870
-Let's go.
-Okay.

499
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,169
All of their other vehicles
were in the ground-floor parking lot.

500
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,963
It must have a different purpose.

501
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,133
You're right. I do find it suspicious,
Prosecutor Song.

502
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,717
Are you a prosecutor?

503
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,639
Sir, don't lose sight of that car.
Get close.

504
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,890
Yes, sir.

505
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,685
(thuds)

506
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,436
(thuds)

507
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,647
(thuds)

508
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,274
(exhales heavily)

509
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,698
(metal clanking)

510
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,994
(panting)

511
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,245
(thuds)

512
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,082
(beeping)

513
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
OPEN

514
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,184
That's a big problem.
I wonder who spread that information.

515
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,896
JANG: What'll happen now?

516
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,690
I'm adding
the finishing touches to the design.

517
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,692
Haesong will contact you later.

518
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,819
Ah.

519
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,073
Excuse me.

520
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,786
May I speak with the chairman?

521
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,790
I need to speak with him urgently.

522
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,001
I'll tell his secretary.

523
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,671
Oh, that's okay.

524
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
What is it, ma'am?

525
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,054
Well…

526
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,806
You see…

527
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,435
Uh…

528
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,062
Ms. Jang.

529
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,899
The Adamas.

530
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:23,491
I rarely get to work
on a gemstone this big.

531
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,912
At first, I just couldn't believe it.

532
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,748
But I thought he should know.

533
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,127
I don't know how to put this, but--

534
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,005
I'm sorry for cutting you off,
but may I use your bathroom?

535
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,218
Sure. It's over there.

536
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,055
(clatters)

537
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,646
(door closes)

538
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,274
(sighs)

539
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,150
Hey, Mr. Cho.

540
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,238
What? Why are you telling me this now?

541
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,283
MAN: <i>I'm sorry, sir.
I wanted to take care of it myself.</i>

542
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,493
It's okay. I'll go.

543
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,458
(ominous music)

544
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,767
SUHYEON: It doesn't look like
an ordinary residence.

545
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
But I doubt it's Team A's headquarters.

546
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,564
SEOHEE: Judging by the tight security,
there's definitely something inside.

547
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,107
It doesn't look that high, right?

548
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,985
Are you going to climb it?

549
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,407
Wait here.

550
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:47,908
What'll you do?

551
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,785
We can't leave like this.

552
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,454
Let's just tell SIH the location.

553
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,622
We're already here.
That's a waste of time.

554
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,958
SEOHEE: Prosecutor Song.

555
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,538
(dramatic music)

556
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,688
(clatters)

557
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
(door creaks)

558
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,368
(thuds)

559
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,662
Darn it.

560
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,997
(tense music)

561
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,951
-Wrap it up.
-Don't worry, sir.

562
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,922
875-3 YEONGIN-RO

563
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,610
(eerie music)

564
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,823
Hey.

565
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,992
Hey.

566
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,494
Hey.

567
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,080
-(shatters)
-(Suhyeon groans)

568
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,958
Go upstairs!

569
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,503
(gasps)

570
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,130
Damn it!

571
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,050
(Suhyeon grunts)

572
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,097
Hey.

573
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,433
Hey.

574
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,144
(sighs)

575
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,376
Call the police and report it as suicide.

576
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,502
Yes, sir.

577
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,592
(glass clanks)

578
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,163
(door slams)

579
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,583
Who are you?

580
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,461
Damn it.

581
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,380
(both grunt)

582
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,930
(grunting continues)

583
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,188
(man groans)

584
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,113
(grunts)

585
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,381
(panting)

586
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,717
(grunting)

587
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,763
Damn it.

588
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,194
Damn it.

589
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,284
(groans)

590
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,454
Prosecutor Song.

591
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,085
(both grunt)

592
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,002
Run.

593
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,352
(grunts, panting)

594
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,246
You didn't see him?

595
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,040
-No, sir.
-Damn it!

596
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,710
What are you doing? Go get him!

597
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,878
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,881
Damn it.

599
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,885
There he is!

600
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,389
Run.

601
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,059
(men screaming)

602
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,478
(groans)

603
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,064
Keep running.

604
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,071
(groaning continues)

605
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,993
(gasps)

606
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,496
-(grunts)
-Are you okay?

607
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,083
(groans, coughs)

608
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,294
(panting)

609
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,509
(grunts)

610
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,322
You bastards!

611
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,449
Get all the CCTV and dashcam footage!

612
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,450
MAN: Yes, sir.

613
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,161
(panting)

614
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,456
HYESOO:
I didn't expect to meet you like this.

615
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,416
I'm Eun Hyesoo.

616
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,377
Yes, I know who you are.

617
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,254
I didn't expect to meet you
like this either.

618
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,590
I must've come in the nick of time.

619
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,385
I think you were being chased.

620
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,887
Yes. As you can see.

621
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,098
What brings you here?

622
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,725
First, who are you?

623
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,229
I'm Kim Seohee, a reporter.

624
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,605
I see.

625
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,026
What were you two doing here?

626
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,280
We were looking into a case.

627
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,739
Lee Changwoo's case?

628
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,830
Did Mr. Ha not mention me to you?

629
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,291
I was the one who sent him that letter.

630
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,585
Yes, I heard.

631
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,296
We're not friends,
but we're not enemies either.

632
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,006
Let down your guard,

633
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,174
Ms. Kim.

634
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,219
You didn't answer my question.

635
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
What brings you here?

636
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,724
You're the wary type.

637
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,976
And fearless too.

638
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,855
Mr. Ha asked me

639
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,274
to see if the Adamas was safe.

640
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,153
Is that where the Adamas is?

641
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,449
Yes. Did you not know that?

642
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,201
Then why were you guys there?

643
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,913
That's why security was so tight.

644
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,165
They wouldn't have exposed it like that

645
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,792
if the site was to be operated in secret.

646
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,420
They?

647
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,381
(sighs)

648
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,050
Then was that woman…

649
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,676
Did you see Ms. Jang?

650
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,678
I heard that's where she went.

651
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,555
Isn't Ms. Jang…

652
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,019
Where in the world are you?

653
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,896
Ms. Jang is dead.

654
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,607
What did you say?

655
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,359
Ms. Jang is dead.

656
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,945
The jewelry designer is dead.

657
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,738
I saw it with my own eyes.

658
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,531
She was hanging from the handrail.

659
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,703
No. It was murder.

660
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,455
It was him.

661
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,629
Mr. Lee killed her.

662
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,632
SUHYEON: Let's talk in person.

663
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,511
I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house. Okay.

664
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,807
Things have gotten pretty dangerous.

665
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,686
Is Woosin really safe?

666
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,730
SUHYEON: Ms. Eun.

667
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,733
-(horn honking)
-SEOHEE: Hey.

668
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,460
Hold on.

669
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,131
CHIEF JEONG: That license plate number.

670
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,183
Should I drop you off here?

671
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,476
Sure.

672
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,728
Is there anything…

673
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,731
you'd like to say to Mr. Ha?

674
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,362
Tell him to be safe and--

675
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,489
Let's go. We have no time to waste.

676
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,914
(car door closes)

677
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,715
Is something wrong?

678
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,633
No, it's just that…

679
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,845
Do you think she's trustworthy?

680
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,182
Seeing how she came here,
Woosin must be making a move too.

681
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,100
Let's go.

682
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:08,899
(scoffs)

683
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,985
SUHYEON: <i>I'll go to headquarters.
No, the safe house.</i>

684
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,113
You should've at least told me.

685
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,699
How dare you lie?

686
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,911
Is there someone else
helping you other than me?

687
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,662
No.

688
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,624
In this house or outside?

689
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,501
There's no one else.

690
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,211
(sighs)

691
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,213
(horn honks)

692
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,547
In this case,

693
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,884
it's a different story.

694
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,595
(ringing)

695
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,723
MR. JEONG
ACCEPT REJECT

696
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,101
MS. LEE: <i>You caused trouble again.</i>

697
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,602
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,647
What if they find out about our safe house
thanks to your recklessness?

699
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,815
Do you think you'll be safe?

700
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,192
We'll all go down!

701
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,402
I noticed that the roads leading here

702
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,822
are in CCTV blind spots.

703
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,032
I thought you had already taken measures.

704
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:02,828
Seriously.

705
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,206
Quit treating me like a kid
and answer me this.

706
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,667
Why did Mr. Kang want to talk
with Prosecutor Song in private?

707
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,138
Suicide?

708
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,641
That's what the police said.

709
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,476
No, it was murder.

710
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,355
SUHYEON: <i>Why would she kill herself
after finishing the new design?</i>

711
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,029
Let's raid Ares immediately.

712
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,365
(scoffs)
As if a warrant would be issued.

713
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,326
Let's arrest them without a warrant first.
We'll get it later.

714
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,539
I definitely saw Mr. Lee there.

715
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,208
-Murder?
-Yes!

716
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,590
Who do you think is responsible
for Ms. Jang's death?

717
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,009
-What?
-It's Mr. Ha.

718
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,553
He's the one
who wanted to spread the rumor

719
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,388
about her having the Adamas.

720
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,266
He assumed that Team A

721
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,019
would take the Adamas back to the mansion
for security purposes.

722
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,689
She was killed by Team A as punishment.

723
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,066
They must've thought
she was the one who breached security.

724
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,322
If it wasn't for Mr. Ha,
she'd still be alive.

725
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,115
Let's not complicate things.

726
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,290
Jeez, I almost fell for it.

727
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,502
You're wrong.

728
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:38,506
If Team A had killed her
because they fell for Woosin's scheme,

729
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,175
they would've put her on display.

730
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,302
"Mess with Haesong,
and you'll end up dead."

731
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,554
They would've let others know.

732
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
But they're remaining quiet.

733
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,269
So it was Team A's doing,
but we've yet to know the motive.

734
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,731
Yet if you're claiming
that Woosin is responsible for her death,

735
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,651
I would be offended to hear that.

736
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,112
(sighs)
The ceremony is around the corner.

737
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,448
If we get the Adamas before then,
then it's all over.

738
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,451
-So let's stop.
-Don't make me laugh.

739
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,453
If the fighter doesn't compete,
then who will?

740
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,664
The ring is out there.

741
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,712
If we back out of this,
what about Ms. Kim's safety?

742
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,715
(groans)

743
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,302
Do you think she'll still be alive
even without our protection?

744
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,180
That's a cheap move.

745
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,850
Prosecutor Song, who do you think
will be responsible for Ms. Kim's death?

746
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,829
(tires screech)

747
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,913
(crashing)

748
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,754
SUN: The SIH will turn on
their emergency generator.

749
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,133
Then the buildings around them
will also get electricity.

750
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,886
DEPUTY PARK: <i>But we won't see any light
if they're underground.</i>

751
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,430
It doesn't matter.

752
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,225
Just look for electromagnetic waves
above a certain level.

753
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,026
(beeping)

754
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,037
(beeping continues)

755
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,126
I'll be keeping an eye from now on.

756
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,337
-SUHYEON: No, thank you.
-I mean Ms. Kim.

757
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,258
(scoffs)

758
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,346
Why are you suddenly so overprotective?

759
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,097
You guys weren't like this.

760
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,808
-It's just that--
-Tell me.

761
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,853
What do you guys have up your sleeve?

762
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,689
SEOHEE: A blackout?

763
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,109
The entire neighborhood must be out.

764
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,363
I'll take a look.

765
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,908
Stay right here.

766
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,377
You startled me.

767
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,006
Who are you?

768
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,384
Hi.

769
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,850
Me?

770
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,107
(screeching)

771
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,319
(Ms. Lee grunts)

772
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,740
(groans)

773
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,618
(grunts)

774
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,038
(screams)

775
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,835
(Ms. Lee grunts)

776
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,004
(grunting continues)

777
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,260
(groans)

778
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,766
(shrieking)

779
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,936
(grunts, panting)

780
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,147
(grunts)

781
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,111
(Ms. Lee groans)

782
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,463
(screams in pain)

783
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,092
Should I let you live or not?

784
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,929
(gasping)

785
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,438
(gasping)

786
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,689
(blood squelching)

787
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,399
(spits, exhales)

788
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,238
(breathing heavily)

789
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,202
Why can't you answer me?
Are you guys scheming something?

790
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,661
-No, sir.
-(phone buzzing)

791
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,331
And I'm just obeying commands.

792
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,666
I'm on my way.

793
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,169
(Seohee panting)

794
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,337
Ms. Kim?

795
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,047
It's Ms. Lee.

796
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,263
SEOHEE: Help me.

797
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,105
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

798
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,776
Ms. Kim.

799
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,490
(tense music)

800
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,304
(tense music stops)

801
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,397
MAN: Lee Changwoo?

802
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,898
MR. CHOI: He mainly robbed those
who were influential.

803
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,860
He took their money, gems, and gold bars.
And something even more priceless.

804
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,446
Proof of their corruption.

805
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,533
That's why they called him
the notorious thief.

806
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,617
Right.

807
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,162
Anyone he robbed
was thought to be corrupt.

808
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,540
They'd be branded
and judged by the public.

809
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,751
Look into those
whose lives were ruined because of him.

810
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,838
-Pardon?
-See if they're connected with Haesong

811
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,256
and how.

812
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,218
What do you mean?
You're onto something, aren't you?

813
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,429
Don't report to headquarters just yet.

814
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,557
Taesung.

815
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,439
Lee Changwoo and Team A?

816
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,734
RECEPTION ROOM

817
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,862
COMPANIONSHIP, ORDER, ESTABLISHMENT

818
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,960
Why are you holding your tongue
when you're the one who asked to see me?

819
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,296
I see.

820
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,256
Do I need to greet you first?

821
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,051
It's been a long time.

822
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,639
You don't look like you used to.
You've aged.

823
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,890
You're the one who put me

824
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,768
in the punishment room, aren't you?

825
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,436
Ooh.

826
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,230
You sound like your old self.

827
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,523
What are you trying to pull?

828
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:57,278
(sighs)
Where should I begin?

829
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,157
Okay. I'll cut to the chase.

830
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:02,950
Simply put…

831
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,499
It all started because of him.

832
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,417
Song Suhyeon.

833
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,089
TEAM LEADER LEE: Congratulations.
You've found your long-lost son.

834
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,590
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY 99.99997%

835
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,550
Cut this nonsense.

836
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,595
Hey. You're not surprised.

837
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,638
Shut up.

838
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,725
I will no longer fall for your lies.

839
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,356
Song Suhyeon

840
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,692
is dead.

841
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,152
I killed him.

842
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,114
Because he killed my brother.

843
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,367
Don't be too sad.

844
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,910
I kept one of them alive.

845
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,872
How great is it that they're twins?

846
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,457
(laughs)

847
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,387
What does this mean?

848
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,016
Why did she suddenly chop down the tree?

849
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,895
WOOSIN: She got rid of her guilt.

850
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,273
In layman's terms, will you?

851
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,025
Her son hanged himself from this tree.

852
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,529
What do you think she felt
looking at it every day?

853
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,655
(sighs)

854
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,533
-Agony?
-That's right.

855
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,870
But she's free from it now.

856
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,830
She's no longer in agony.

857
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,207
How heartless.

858
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,419
She's willing to forget
about her late son.

859
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,464
(Mr. Choi chuckles)
She might as well celebrate it.

860
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:43,509
By the way, Haesong's vehicle
is on its way here.

861
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,179
The Security Team was given notice.

862
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,766
We succeeded. Everything went as planned.

863
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:53,728
I looked up the license plate number.
It's a bulletproof transport vehicle.

864
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,441
MR. CHOI: <i>It's been used for transporting
expensive artworks or antiques until now.</i>

865
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,151
<i>What do you think it is this time?</i>

866
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,111
WOOSIN: <i>The Adamas.</i>

867
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,405
We just need to steal it on D-day, right?

868
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,949
You make it sound so simple.

869
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,327
They'll strengthen security.

870
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,953
It won't be a cakewalk.

871
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,539
So what? I'm bound to fail anyway.

872
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:16,000
What do you mean?

873
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,836
Don't play dumb. The SIH's plan B.

874
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,216
Did you think I wouldn't know

875
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,301
the true reason why you colluded with me?

876
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:28,971
(scoffs)

877
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,640
(Mr. Choi sighs)

878
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,977
So you've known all along
yet you went along with it?

879
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,898
Because that's the only way
I'll get my hands on the Adamas.

880
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,445
WOOSIN: <i>I'll put on a show that day
and pretend to steal it.</i>

881
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,696
(door clatters)

882
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,949
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

883
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,743
Put your hands up!

884
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,288
WOOSIN:
<i>The police will arrive and arrest me.</i>

885
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,706
Mission complete.

886
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,876
You'll get the Adamas
as proof of the theft.

887
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,295
Of course, you'd be the one
who reported it.

888
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,131
You'll get into Team A by reporting me.

889
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:12,473
You know I can't request
a retrial with the stolen object.

890
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,977
Haesong's attorneys will ask me
how I got it.

891
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,312
They'll state that it was taken illegally.

892
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,523
And accuse Prosecutor Song
as the mastermind.

893
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,317
The SIH had a good reason to do this.

894
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,779
There was no way to get a warrant.
But if you're caught in the act…

895
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,116
They can search the mansion
under the pretense of catching the thief.

896
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,286
And maybe even find something
that could be fatal to Haesong.

897
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,417
Was this your plan all along?

898
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,878
Don't be sorry.

899
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,883
Everything was my plan

900
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,968
and choice.

901
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,597
Don't you want to save Song Woosin?

902
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,101
Lay a finger on him, and I'll--

903
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:00,563
Come on.
This isn't the time to threaten me.

904
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:02,857
You should beg.

905
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,609
(shouts)
Lee Junkyung!

906
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,534
Don't raise your voice.

907
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,872
That won't change anything.

908
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,585
All right. Now, tell me.

909
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,087
Where did you hide it?

910
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,632
The Adamas.

911
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,721
You took it.

912
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,890
What's wrong?

913
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,893
Did you lose it?

914
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,978
Enough with this act, god damn it.

915
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,230
Where did you hide it?

916
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,067
The real Adamas.

917
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,028
Not the fake one.

918
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,215
WOOSIN: <i>The Adamas has returned.
It'll be revealed again at the ceremony.</i>

919
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:18,265
MY PATH

920
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,019
We're back to square one.

921
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,189
Reset.

922
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,442
MY PATH

923
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,778
(tense music)

924
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,553
(grunts)

925
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,456
(gentle music)

926
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,592
MS. KWON: <i>Here is the list of guests.</i>

927
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,177
DONGRIM: <i>You were invited after all.</i>

928
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,054
WOOSIN: <i>The satellite phone disappeared?</i>

929
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,723
MAN: <i>Do you think Ms. Kim is okay?</i>

930
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:44,143
CHANGWOO:
<i>I wonder if Chairman Kwon forgot about me.</i>

931
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,853
HYUKPIL: <i>It's a trap.</i>

932
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,146
SUHYEON: <i>You should locate Mr. Lee.</i>

933
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,274
<i>You should've raided
Haesong's main office!</i>

934
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,819
Did you lose him or let him go?

935
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,696
HYESOO: <i>I found out</i>

936
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,282
<i>whom you're working with.</i>

937
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,701
TEAM LEADER LEE: <i>That's D-day.</i>
