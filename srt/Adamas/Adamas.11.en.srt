00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,386
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,972
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,228
HYESOO: Kim Seohee.

5
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,524
You know that reporter, right?
The witness.

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,612
What on earth...

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,908
is this about?

8
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,037
Why don't we use her?

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,874
-Use?
-She could claim

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,043
to have seen the chairman
at the crime scene

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,128
22 years ago.

12
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,422
You want her to bear false witness?

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,673
Correct.

14
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,550
That's absurd.

15
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,718
Excuse me.

16
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,678
Thank you.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,767
Do you think we can catch him

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,436
without any solid evidence?

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,775
At least they'll start
investigating that case.

20
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,610
I can't do that.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,279
Maybe not you.

22
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,533
But the SIH might.

23
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,334
If you fail this time,

24
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,839
I won't wait around
for your method anymore.

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,562
MY PATH

26
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,176
Testing.

27
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,220
Everyone.

28
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,767
Please welcome
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu of Haesong Group.

29
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,520
-(crowd applauding)
-(lively music playing)

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,869
Hello, I'm Kwon Jaekyu.

31
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:27,373
If you don't know me,
please remain standing.

32
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,709
(crowd laughing)

33
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,255
I'd like to sincerely thank you all

34
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,343
for attending
our 80th-anniversary ceremony.

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,180
KWON: Please continue to watch us grow

36
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,309
and stay with us throughout this journey.

37
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,937
I should keep it short, right?

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,689
-(crowd chuckling)
-KWON: All right. I'll do that.

39
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,653
I've decided to step down.

40
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,114
This event is also my retirement ceremony.

41
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,076
Right. I have something to give you
before you all leave.

42
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,702
I'm embarrassed to say this.

43
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,915
But I have published my own memoir.

44
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,294
I will gift it to you all,
so please take one.

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,213
Of course, it'll be free of charge.

46
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,674
(crowd chuckling)

47
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,676
I have no regrets.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,011
I did my best.

49
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,598
I hope the new leader of Haesong

50
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,602
won't have any regrets either
when he retires in the future.

51
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,897
Let me introduce my son.

52
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,524
President Kwon.

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,116
(crowd applauding)

54
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,888
Hello, I'm Kwon Hyunjo.

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,142
Today marks the beginning

56
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,060
for me.

57
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,691
(door opens)

58
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,235
Sir, we've got trouble.

59
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,155
(man panting)

60
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,991
MAN (on radio):
<i>Emergency at the first-floor lobby.</i>

61
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,453
<i>I repeat,
emergency at the first-floor lobby.</i>

62
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,288
<i>Security is currently
restricting the area.</i>

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,664
<i>Requesting immediate action.</i>

64
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,709

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

66
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,604
Evacuate all workers
and control the media.

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,189
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,527
-(alarm blaring)
-(indistinct shouting)

69
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
(clamoring)

70
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,750
(alarm continues blaring)

71
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,338
We need to close up the building.

72
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,350
(door closes)

73
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,694
SEOHEE: It's a detonator.

74
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,489
I already pressed the button.
It'll explode once I let go.

75
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,914
They were going to send someone else
if I didn't go.

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,750
They could be watching us.

77
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,921
Hang in there.
We'll get this sorted out soon.

78
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,049
-Call the EOD.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,387
(tense music)

80
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,113

82
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>Possible suicide bomber.</i>

83
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,460
You risked your life to be righteous.

84
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,254
How tiring.

85
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,755
Jeez.

86
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,012
SUN: <i>You're going to carry the bomb.</i>

87
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,889
SEOHEE: I won't do it.

88
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,609
(clatters)

89
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,029
Then pick one.

90
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,282
Uh...

91
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,575
PERSONNEL CARD

92
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,285
SUN: I like this woman.

93
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,122
Her son and daughter-in-law
died in a car accident,

94
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,833
so she's taking care
of her young granddaughter.

95
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,045
She's lived a long life already.

96
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
I don't care.

97
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,929
They're not the ones
who'll carry the bombs.

98
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,765
The ones who'll do that...

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,809
(Sun giggles)

100
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,728
...are them.

101
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,189
(giggling continues)

102
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,907
-(clanking)
-(Sun grunting)

103
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,367
Why isn't it working?

104
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,328
(panting)

105
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,956
What do you say?

106
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,833
Did you have a change of heart?

107
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,170
(footsteps approaching)

108
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,880
Kim Seohee.

109
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,595
Fancy seeing you again.

110
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,849
(sighs)

111
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,147
We have such a long history
between us, don't you agree?

112
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,318
It all started 22 years ago.

113
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,153
(chuckles)

114
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
It's like a movie.

115
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,409
Why are you doing this to me?

116
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,912
Me? To you?

117
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,164
(chuckles)
What did I do?

118
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,793
That's a misunderstanding. How unfair.

119
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,087
This is all your doing.

120
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,799
You're the one who saw me 22 years ago.

121
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,261
You're the one who claimed
to be a witness to a case,

122
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,222
which I bashed in your mom's head
to keep buried.

123
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,350
You're the one

124
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,020
who killed her.

125
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,189
And you're the one

126
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,984
who killed...

127
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,029
your dad as well.

128
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,702
If you wanted to bomb the SIH,

129
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,079
then you could've just done so.

130
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,539
Ooh.

131
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,000
So why did you have to

132
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,377
pick me of all people?

133
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,380
You should atone for your sins

134
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,551
by wearing an explosive belt
and sacrificing yourself.

135
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,637
Who knows?

136
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,930
Maybe if you disarm it,

137
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,892
you'll kill everyone else but yourself

138
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,310
once again.

139
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,398
It'd be good for us if that happened.

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,365
The EOD will arrive soon.

141
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,951
Don't be scared. You must remain calm.

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,832
Team A didn't send me
simply to take revenge.

143
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,669
I have the detonator.

144
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,129
If this explodes,
I'll be taking the blame.

145
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,422
(gun cocks)

146
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,978
HAESONG GROUP
80TH-ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

147
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,938
(classical music playing)

148
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,026
KWON: Hey.

149
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,159
Your son looks elated.

150
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,618
He's probably on cloud nine.

151
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,165
It was his dream to lead Haesong
ever since he could talk.

152
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,337
They've all surrounded the new sun.

153
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,256
Don't you feel hurt?

154
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,340
(chuckles)

155
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,343
That's life.

156
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,180
There's sunset and sunrise.

157
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,101
Mr. Ha.

158
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,522
Do you know why
I used a diamond to create the Adamas?

159
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,525
No, but I'm curious.

160
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,486
Is there a special reason for that?

161
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,364
I wanted to become someone
who'd never break

162
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,575
or be conquered.

163
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,579
Only fools challenge me.

164
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,956
And they end up getting crushed.

165
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,004
I'm sure.

166
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,005
Mm.

167
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,259
Ah. When will you reveal the Adamas--

168
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,385
-Wait--
-(loud pop)

169
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,138
(tense music)

170
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,735
WOOSIN:
<i>The revealing time wasn't announced.</i>

171
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,362
We need to come up with a sign.

172
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,781
Let's make a move
when the fireworks are lit.

173
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,199
(gun cocks)

174
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,536
WOOSIN: <i>We must neutralize
the surveillance system.</i>

175
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,287
(gunshot)

176
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,373
(drone crackling)

177
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,254
(sighs)

178
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,468
It has begun.

179
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,472
(fireworks crackle)

180
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,892
KWON: Let's be patient.

181
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,103
Ms. Kwon said she prepared a surprise.

182
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,624
The system is down?

183
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,710
I don't know what's going on, sir.

184
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,503
Damn it. We have guests here.

185
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,302
God damn it. Our security system is down.

186
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,846
-What should we do?
-MR. CHOI: Call the police.

187
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,266
Let them do their money's worth.

188
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,060
We can't call a repairman at this hour.

189
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,187
Those are all VIP guests.

190
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,939
If something happens to them,

191
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,942
we'll all get sacked.

192
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,615
What are you doing? Call them
and say we'll pay them handsomely!

193
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,408
Yes, sir.

194
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,164
(suspenseful music)

195
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,174
That's our cue. Let's go.

196
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,425
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,136
(clinks)

198
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,075
We'll remove the bomb from the suspect
and disarm it somewhere safe.

199
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,143
We can't remove it.

200
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,730
POLICE: We need an oxygen
cutting machine, but it may create sparks.

201
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,817
We'll disarm it here.

202
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,488
Set up a situation room.
We'll evacuate 60m from here.

203
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,823
Yes, sir.

204
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,033
HYUKPIL: Evacuate 60m from here.

205
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,119
(crowd clamoring)

206
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,913
(tense music)

207
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,962
(clanks)

208
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,755
(indistinct chatter)

209
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,023
Given the size,
the explosive power will be immense.

210
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,568
The fragments will fly
and injure everyone.

211
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,736
They're probably...

212
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,990
get the snipers ready.

213
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,410
-Snipers?
-For the worst-case scenario.

214
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,245
They can't trust the suspect.

215
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,707
That's what they need to do
to prevent the worst.

216
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,001
By suspect, do you mean...

217
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,671
Ms. Kim. She has her hand
on the detonator.

218
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,924
In their eyes, she's a suicide bomber.

219
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,260
Is that why you duct taped her?

220
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,638
So she'd still be pressing it
even if she got shot?

221
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,156
We will take over from here.

222
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,742
She isn't a suicide bomber.
There's someone else.

223
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,412
That's a bigger problem then.

224
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,956
That means someone could control
the explosive remotely.

225
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,708
Anyone within a three-kilometer radius

226
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,877
is capable of doing that.

227
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,547
You should just hope
that she's a suicide bomber.

228
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,883
That means we'll be safe
as long as she's pressing it.

229
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,803
We will control this crime scene.

230
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,248
POLICE 1: <i>Team Level Two has arrived.</i>

231
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,209
<i>Current location,
the SIH's first-floor lobby.</i>

232
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,418
<i>Keep an eye on the target.</i>

233
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,047
<i>If she acts suspiciously,
move onto level two immediately.</i>

234
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,550
POLICE 2: Target on.

235
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
Be on standby. Shoot on command.

236
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,902
CHIEF: We don't know which cable
is connected to the detonator.

237
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,779
One explosion is all that's needed.

238
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,449
It's best to do it one by one
though it'll take some time.

239
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,467
We've disarmed one.

240
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,553
(Sun screams)

241
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,806
They got one.

242
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,398
(sirens wailing)

243
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,784
(clears throat)

244
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,455
SUHYEON: Where is Mr. Choi?

245
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,957
He's away due to a security issue.

246
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,083
I see.

247
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,211
Oh, well.

248
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,379
One minute.

249
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,969
Mr. Ha, should I escort you to him?

250
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,555
Sure. Thank you.

251
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,933
This way. The cart is ready.

252
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,023
WOOSIN: <i>Draw attention</i>

253
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,567
<i>so they won't know that I'm gone.</i>

254
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,361
I can do this.

255
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,368
I can.

256
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,420
(pensive music)

257
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,398
Congratulations.

258
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,817
Thank you, Father.

259
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,903
Do your best no matter the outcome.

260
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,864
I still lack in many ways.
I need your help.

261
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,702
Don't be ridiculous.
I won't get involved whatsoever.

262
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,162
Once I finish...

263
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,124
my last task.

264
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,085
Pardon?

265
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,680
(sneaky music)

266
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,578
(whispering)
What are you doing? Leave.

267
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,873
I just wanted to take a look.

268
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,375
(clatters)

269
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,793
DONGRIM: Gosh, that hurts.

270
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,796
That hurts.

271
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,257
(whispers)
Have you gone insane? Get up!

272
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,717
Okay.

273
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,594
Oh, God.

274
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,970
-DONGRIM: My knee.
-Get up!

275
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,515
Are you drunk? Get up!

276
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,683
DONGRIM: Okay.

277
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,226
What do I do?

278
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,228
MS. OH: Just leave. Don't touch anything.

279
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,148
The chairman is quite photogenic.

280
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,233
-DONGRIM: Okay.
-MS. OH: Don't touch anything.

281
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,735
Leave that there.

282
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,236
Just leave!

283
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,448
(Dongrim chuckles nervously)

284
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,222
Ms. Yoon.

285
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,724
Give me a glass of champagne.

286
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,311
HYESOO: Right now.

287
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,989
(door closes)

288
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,545
I'll take your phones.
You may not bring them inside.

289
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,630
(clatters)

290
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,014
AGENT PARK:
Let me tell you which areas you'll patrol.

291
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,268
-DONGRIM: Okay.
-MS. OH: Don't touch anything.

292
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,561
Leave that there.

293
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,770
-He's very photogenic.
-Just leave!

294
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,441
-Please leave.
-I think I should help you clean up.

295
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,359
(Dongrim grunts)

296
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,861
(chuckles)
I'll leave now.

297
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,739
Don't worry about me.
Please enjoy your time.

298
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,504
That was nerve-racking.

299
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,924
I did what he told me to,
so I probably did well, right?

300
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,135
I saw him leave.

301
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,472
He has a knack for worrying me.

302
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,600
My God! Mr. Ha.

303
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,393
What?

304
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,895
Long time no see.

305
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,897
Where's Woosin?

306
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,651
Prosecutor Song, wait!

307
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,196
(faint whistling)

308
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,949
(faint whistling)

309
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,917
(cheeky music)

310
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,139
(tense music)

311
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,182
(music stops)

312
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,397
Hey.

313
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,651
I suddenly craved cognac more.

314
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,696
Why are you here
when the event is still ongoing?

315
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,949
You sure weren't looking for me.

316
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,161
What are you doing there?

317
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,158
Are you sure that the light
only flicked once?

318
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,411
Yes, sir. He was supposed
to give us two flicks.

319
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,594
DONGRIM: Prosecutor Song.

320
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,309
Chairman Kwon?

321
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,811
SUHYEON: Hello.

322
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,232
Who is this?

323
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,904
I don't think you're Mr. Ha.

324
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,405
Sir, you see-

325
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,450
No, I'm not. I'm Song Suhyeon.

326
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,995
Song Suhyeon?

327
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,082
-What are you?
-You little...

328
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,878
Can't you see? We're twins.

329
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,189
(whirring)

330
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,224
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

331
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,821
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

332
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,201
(sighs)

333
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,162
HYUNJO: <i>Don't tell me...</i>

334
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,290
Do you know me?

335
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,879
(chuckles)
So you do.

336
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,255
-You little--
-KWON: Hyunjo.

337
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,759
Father, I'll take care of this outside
since there are guests here.

338
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,093
That's okay.

339
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,473
So you're Mr. Ha's twin brother?

340
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,478
What brings you here?

341
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,522
I received a tip-off.

342
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,193
-A tip-off.
-I heard you're revealing the Adamas,

343
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,320
and someone's out to steal it.

344
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,199
I came all the way here
to prevent that from happening.

345
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,827
Someone is going to steal the Adamas?

346
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,789
Who?

347
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,346
MY PATH

348
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,395
SUHYEON:
Don't worry. I can call the police.

349
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,524
Will you just stand still?
Drag him out of here.

350
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
SUHYEON: Don't worry.

351
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,320
We'll search the entire premises
once the police arrive.

352
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,697
You bastard. Enough with this nonsense!

353
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,953
Damn it. You're really pushing my buttons.

354
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,580
SUHYEON (whispers): People are watching.

355
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,628
I received the tip-off
from a credible source.

356
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,674
This invite.

357
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,388
My source

358
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,809
sent me this invite.

359

HAESONG GROUP
80TH-ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

360
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,816
(microphone clacks)

361
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,193
Testing.

362
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,615
MS. KWON:
May I have your attention, please?

363
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,328
(camera shutters clicking)

364
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,558
This is the most important part
of this ceremony,

365
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,852
so please be quiet.

366
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,527
Finally, everyone is here.

367
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,921
Now,

368
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,217
we will reveal the Adamas.

369
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,435
(suspenseful music)

370
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,243
Everyone.

371
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,288
The Adamas

372
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,416
is a murder weapon.

373
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,044
(tense music)

374
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,302
Lee Changwoo, the heinous thief,
committed murder 22 years ago.

375
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,100
But he wasn't the killer.

376
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,935
That lunatic.

377
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,188
The real killer

378
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,233
is in this room with us.

379
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,859
(crowd gasping)

380
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,785
What's going on?

381
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,412
I don't know. Be quiet.

382
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,082
The killer is...

383
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,348
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu!

384
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,198
You murderer.

385
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,870
Have you gone insane? That's absurd!

386
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,788
You were aware of it as well.

387
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,248
From the very beginning!

388
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,836
MS. KWON: What do you say, master?

389
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,548
Do you like my little surprise?

390
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,345
I'm going to reveal everything.

391
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,638
Everything!

392
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,351
I'll expose your true, demonic face.

393
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,688
I will name

394
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,941
every single person you've killed!

395
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,403
Call the police!

396
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,250
Mr. Choi.

397
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,295
Yes, sir.

398
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,676
Call the police.

399
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,765
Tell them that we caught the thief...

400
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,352
who stole the Adamas.

401
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,741
(sighs)

402
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,630
(beeps)

403
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,008
What was that?

404
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,552
I'm not sure.

405
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,178
The sound came from somewhere.

406
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,888
SEOHEE: I think it's the front side.

407
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,659
A timer?

408
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,179
-Did you hand in everything?
-I did.

409
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,772
(Mr. Choi sighs)

410
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,818
Carry out a simple interrogation
and return this.

411
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,112
Theft isn't anything serious.

412
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,324
Right. It's only a formality.

413
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,921
TERRORIST BOMBING SUSPECTED
IN THE SIH BUILDING (KIM SEOHEE)

414
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,947
We need to get out of here too.

415
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,704
Ms. Kwon must know something
about our father's case.

416
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,416
You idiot. Why did you
barge in here recklessly?

417
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,544
I received this invite.

418
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,381
I naturally thought
Team A had sent it to me.

419
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,424
They were probably trying to lure me.

420
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,261
Or they must've known
that the SIH was coming.

421
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,180
Elaborate. Why would Team A
send you that invite?

422
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,559
Ms. Kim Seohee was kidnapped.

423
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,940
In front of my eyes.

424
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,696
It was Team A's doing,
and it happened three days ago.

425
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,449
I thought I'd find a clue here.

426
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,703
You see,

427
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,498
she lost her parents
while trying to reveal the truth

428
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,917
about our father's case.

429
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,216
I can't let her die.

430
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,096
OFFICER: Prosecutor Song.

431
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,019
You stepped over the line today.

432
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,895
Don't meddle in our affairs ever again.

433
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,858
SUHYEON: I couldn't care less.

434
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,610
I won't let the SIH fool me ever again.

435
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,865
OFFICER: We found Ms. Kim.

436
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,202
They made a move.

437
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,666
Where is she?

438
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,680
POLICE: We've removed it.

439
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,099
There was a timer hidden inside.

440
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,351
It was a time bomb.

441
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,103
CHIEF: What do you mean?
What about that detonator?

442
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,939
POLICE:
<i>It's either fake or a dual controller.</i>

443
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,192
<i>If it's neither of them,</i>

444
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,319
<i>then maybe...</i>

445
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,989
It may not even be connected to this bomb.

446
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,851
We're still not completely safe,
but we deactivated the timer.

447
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,728
-We just need to remove the remaining--
-Mr. Kang.

448
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,650
If this is a time bomb,
then what's in my hand?

449
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,902
Probably a dual controller.

450
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,279
Our enemies want the snipers

451
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,365
to kill you for being a suicide bomber.

452
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,409
All this fuss just to kill me?

453
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,160
That can't be.

454
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,834
(tense music fades)

455
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,508
Hey!

456
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,052
Do you think this is a joke?

457
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,931
Couldn't have kept
your mouth shut, could you?

458
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,224
I'm sorry.

459
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,059
Give me the remote control.

460
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,311
I don't have it.

461
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,231
You don't?

462
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,191
You don't?

463
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,862
-You crazy, little--
-Sir!

464
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,866
Let me go.

465
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,742
-Let go.
-Sir.

466
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,162
Let him go. Let's see what he'll do.

467
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,044
00:48:19.02

468
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,007
You little bastard.
You're her dog, aren't you?

469
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,800
Damn it.

470
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,345
(clinks)

471
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,639
SUN: Mr. Jeong.

472
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,102
Seohee is holding the remote control.

473
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,653
What are you doing?

474
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,947
Team A sent a bomb to the SIH.

475
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,657
A group that worked under the radar

476
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,201
wouldn't go this far just to kill me.

477
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,161
There are snipers out there.
You'll get killed.

478
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,329
This is a trap.

479
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,626
The target is removing the duct tape.

480
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,169
Kill her.

481
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,091
(tape crackles)

482
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,346
Block the view.

483
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,323
SNIPER: I can't see the target.

484
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,742
Send them into the building.
We're going in.

485
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,339
Ms. Kim! Stop that!

486
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,091
-Step back.
-Stop!

487
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,343
-Step back!
-Are you going to kill everyone here?

488
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,096
Give me a minute.
If this isn't a detonator then--

489
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,014
-We'll fire.
-Put down your weapons!

490
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,728
Look. Look at this!

491
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,231
Ms. Kim.

492
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,774
I'll slowly open my hand.

493
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,912
(breathing heavily)

494
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,797
It's a remote control.

495
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,092
This means there's a bomb elsewhere.

496
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,144
The moment she thinks
it's been disarmed and lets go...

497
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,523
Boom.

498
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,403
(scoffs)

499
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,781
What a lunatic.

500
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,118
Search the building.

501
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,202
-Go.
-POLICE: Yes, sir.

502
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,718
The police confiscated
the Adamas as evidence of theft.

503
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,636
(scoffs)

504
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,429
And you just watched?

505
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,181
I'm sorry, sir.

506
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,725
MR. CHOI: The police were
officially dispatched here.

507
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,811
Are you serious, you bastard?

508
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,191
He's reporting

509
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,360
to me.

510
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,321
I'm sorry.

511
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,742
MR. CHOI: Sir, you don't need to worry.

512
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,994
Since it was related to theft

513
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,829
and not what Ms. Kwon had mentioned,

514
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,790
they'll return it soon.

515
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,668
I'll go to the station
and see what's going on.

516
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,671
Okay. You may go.

517
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,767
-(door closes)
-Father, we must hurry.

518
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,936
HYUNJO:
Song Suhyeon and that writer were a team.

519
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,646
They're Song Soonho's sons.

520
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,106
Hyesoo.

521
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,691
Yes, sir.

522
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,734
Give me a cup of tea.

523
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,153
Sure.

524
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,342
MS. KWON: <i>Lee Changwoo, the heinous thief,
committed murder 22 years ago.</i>

525
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,302
The killer is...

526
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,890
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu!

527
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,028
HYUNJO: What'll you do?

528
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,073
Those bastards
must've won Ms. Kwon over too.

529
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,578
Father, there's a reason why
that writer came to our house.

530
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,704
KWON: Probably.

531
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,457
He's Song Soonho's son, after all.

532
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,294
He must be aware of Lee Changwoo's case.

533
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,379
He's looking for his father's murderer.

534
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,505
Damn it!

535
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,550
Things went awry
since there were people watching.

536
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,179
It's going to be impossible
to keep this on the down-low.

537
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,890
Once they start talking about you--

538
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,810
What do the rumors say about me?

539
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,981
-Pardon?
-Do you also think I committed murder?

540
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,233
No, of course not.

541
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,193
If that's the case,

542
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,530
why did Ms. Kwon say such a thing?

543
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,868
She said you had known all along.

544
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,538
That was because...

545
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,666
YOUNG MINJO: Do I have to go in there?

546
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,002
YOUNG HYUNJO: It's hide-and-seek.

547
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,922
You win if you stay there
until tomorrow morning.

548
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,840
But I'm scared.

549
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,968
Are you a coward?
I said I'd grant you your wish if you won.

550
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,847
Really? So I'll be able
to treat you like a brother if I win?

551
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,309
Sure.

552
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,437
Okay, I'll do it.

553
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,794
KWON:
Well done. You're pretty good at your job.

554
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,474
I was in a pickle since we'd be
revealing it tomorrow afternoon.

555
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,727
Sir, here's the Adamas.

556
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,230
I got it back.

557
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,617
You got rid of him, right?

558
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,829
-Lee Changwoo.
-(gasps)

559
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,626
KWON: Minjo told me that he saw it
when he was young.

560
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,713
But he never mentioned you.

561
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,716
He left out the part
where you bullied him.

562
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,096
Don't get yourself involved.

563
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,890
-But Father--
-Don't.

564
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,559
Don't do anything.

565
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,162
EOD

566
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,251
We're searching for the second time.

567
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,045
We couldn't find anything
on our first try.

568
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,888
Prosecutor Song.

569
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,098
What's going on? An explosive?

570
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,767
How's the situation?

571
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,895
We've removed the detonator,
but we're looking for another explosive.

572
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,271
Another one?

573
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,983
Ms. Kim was pressing on a remote control,
not a detonator.

574
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,361
We're still searching the building.

575
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,407
-Where is she?
-HYUKPIL: <i>Hold on.</i>

576
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,873
I've disarmed them all.

577
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,958
Thank you.

578
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,377
POLICE: I just need to remove the vest--

579
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,795
TEAM LEADER LEE: <i>Who knows?</i>

580
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,338
Maybe if you disarm it,

581
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,091
you'll kill everyone else but yourself

582
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,759
once again.

583
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,931
Ms. Kim.

584
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,976
Ms. Kim.

585
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,437
Ms. Kim.

586
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:43,981
It's Prosecutor Song.

587
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,775
Prosecutor Song?

588
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,735
It's me.

589
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,616
I'm sorry that I lost you.

590
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,743
SUHYEON: <i>I really am.</i>

591
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,287
I'm okay.

592
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,498
How are you?

593
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,042
I'm okay too.

594
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,796
(sighs)
I'm truly relieved.

595
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,049
Mr. Kang just briefed me.

596
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,594
Don't worry. I'm on my way.
Hang in there a bit longer.

597
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,930
That's not a problem.

598
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,641
But we need to locate the bomb.

599
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,644
I can't allow any more casualties.

600
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,860
Maybe if you disarm it,
"you'll kill everyone else

601
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,863
but yourself once again."

602
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,199
-What do you mean?
-That's what he said.

603
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,326
He said I'd live if I disarmed this.

604
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,078
-Who said that?
-Mr. Lee of Team A.

605
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,874
If that means I won't die

606
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,751
even if I let go of this...

607
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,422
You'll be unscathed from the explosion?

608
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,800
This isn't it.

609
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,053
The SIH isn't their target.

610
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,478
If that's what it means,
this is more serious than we thought.

611
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,896
The search needs to be wider.

612
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,440
The maximum range for remote control
is five kilometers. It's too wide.

613
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,902
SEOHEE:
<i>But why? There must be a motive for this.</i>

614
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,362
Motive.

615
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,866
Bombings are usually done
to terrorize the public.

616
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,035
They'd want to maximize
the propaganda effect.

617
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,912
Then it should be at a public--

618
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,582
A massacre.

619
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,502
It's almost 11 p.m. Search downtown.

620
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,004
Search within a five-kilometer radius.

621
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,839
CHIEF:
List up all potentially crowded places.

622
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,049
POLICE: Yes, sir.

623
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,929
Ms. Kim. I'm almost there, so wait for me.

624
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,347
SEOHEE: <i>No, don't come.</i>

625
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,975
I'm really fine, so don't come near here
until they find the bomb.

626
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,727
Are you seriously worried about me?

627
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,479
(loud sigh)

628
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,444
Prosecutor Song.

629
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,203
CANDIDATE HWANG FOCUSES
HIS LAST CAMPAIGN IN SEOUL

630
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,883
He told me not to do anything.

631
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,635
Nothing?

632
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,141
After Minjo died,
I have always been the heir.

633
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,436
And today, I officially became chairman.

634
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,231
But he still doesn't have trust in me.

635
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,111
He doesn't want to let go of what he has.

636
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,996
That just means

637
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,500
that you don't need to do anything.

638
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:55,505
You know how he is.

639
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,551
I know.

640
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,763
I have something to tell you.

641
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:11,396
I think your wife has been in touch

642
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,816
with Mr. Jeong.

643
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,528
Hyesoo?

644
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,077
Here's your tea.

645
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,247
Good night.

646
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,959
Hyesoo.

647
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,006
Yes, sir?

648
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,383
Why aren't you asking about today?

649
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,886
As if you already knew.

650
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,350
Well, all I do is plant flowers

651
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,060
and paint.

652
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,397
I have no say in such matters.

653
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,735
Should I spare or kill her?

654
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,405
-Pardon?
-Ms. Kwon.

655
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,283
What would you do?

656
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,790
You should silence her.

657
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,084
Forever.

658
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,463
However,

659
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,217
I think you should keep her alive for now.

660
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:23,760
Why?

661
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,762
If I were you, I'd be curious.

662
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,682
About why she did that.

663
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,059
Getting stabbed in the back
like a sitting duck

664
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,812
is too humiliating.

665
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,157
I will never forgive you. Ever.

666
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,205
DONGRIM: We need to leave this instant.

667
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,337
What's taking him so long?

668
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:11,474
INTERROGATION ROOM

669
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,728
That room.

670
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,609
(door closes)

671
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,948
Here to watch?

672
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,409
Laugh all you want.

673
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,871
Ms. Kwon.

674
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,540
I have a question.

675
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:39,210
What? Are you curious since I know
everything about your father's case?

676
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,712
You want me to tell you, don't you?

677
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,214
Are you here to implore?

678
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,841
-No.
-No?

679
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,719
Then why did you come running here?

680
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,180
Since when did you know

681
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,182
that I was stealing the Adamas?

682
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,226
What do you mean?

683
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,936
The news article.

684
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,065
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

685
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,525
Ms. Kwon.

686
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,207
KWON: <i>So you'd spare Ms. Kwon.</i>

687
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,001
Next?

688
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,253
-Next?
-Mr. Ha.

689
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,840
Should I kill him?

690
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,761
-I would--
-Kill him?

691
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,060
INTERROGATION ROOM

692
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,187
It wasn't her.

693
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,067

695
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,736
You actually came here.

696
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,656
Who...

697
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,618
are you?

698
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,128
(chuckles)

699
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,340
But you won't kill him.

700
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:35,094
-I won't?
-The fact that he left this mansion means

701
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,347
that you allowed it.

702
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,810
There must be a reason why you let him go.

703
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,564
I'm sure you have a plan.

704
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,740
EVIDENCE TRANSFER RECORD

705
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:07,001
This is the reason why
Chairman Kwon hasn't killed you.

706
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,047
Go bring the real Adamas.

707
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,971
Your father knows where it is. Got that?

708
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,575
I'm going to hand over my company
to my son soon.

709
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,327
I'll give him the Adamas as well.

710
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,164
So I'd like you to recraft it
into a new design.

711
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,209
Sir.

712
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,254
Please forgive me for saying this.

713
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,424
But this is fake.

714
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,603
You're wrong. When it was first crafted,

715
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,606
I wanted it to have a crude design.

716
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,735
So I didn't add any detailed cuts.
That's why it looks dull.

717
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,407
No, sir.
I can bet my entire career on this.

718
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,576
You were fooled.

719
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,708
Fooled.

720
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,879
Yes, this is definitely fake.

721
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,842
