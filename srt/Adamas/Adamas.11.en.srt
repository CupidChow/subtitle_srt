ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,970
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,231
Kim Seohee.

4
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,524
You know that reporter, right?
The witness.

5
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,609
What on earth...

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,913
is this about?

7
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,042
Why don't we use her?

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,870
-Use?
-She could claim

9
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,037
to have seen the chairman
at the crime scene

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,130
22 years ago.

11
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,422
You want her to bear false witness?

12
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,666
Correct.

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,549
That's absurd.

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,724
Excuse me.

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,676
Thank you.

16
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,767
Do you think we can catch him

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,441
without any solid evidence?

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,775
At least they'll start
investigating that case.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,609
I can't do that.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,280
Maybe not you.

21
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,531
But the SIH might.

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,333
If you fail this time,

23
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,842
I won't wait around
for your method anymore.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,560
MY PATH

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,179
Testing.

26
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,221
Everyone.

27
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,774
Please welcome
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu of Haesong Group.

28
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,872
Hello, I'm Kwon Jaekyu.

29
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:27,372
If you don't know me,
please remain standing.

30
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,262
I'd like to sincerely thank you all

31
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,339
for attending
our 80th-anniversary ceremony.

32
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,177
Please continue to watch us grow

33
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,305
and stay with us throughout this journey.

34
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,944
I should keep it short, right?

35
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,690
All right. I'll do that.

36
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,649
I've decided to step down.

37
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,106
This event is also my retirement ceremony.

38
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,078
Right. I have something to give you
before you all leave.

39
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,699
I'm embarrassed to say this.

40
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,919
But I have published my own memoir.

41
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,294
I will gift it to you all,
so please take one.

42
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,208
Of course, it'll be free of charge.

43
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,677
I have no regrets.

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,010
I did my best.

45
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,599
I hope the new leader of Haesong

46
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,602
won't have any regrets either
when he retires in the future.

47
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,903
Let me introduce my son.

48
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,523
President Kwon.

49
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,889
Hello, I'm Kwon Hyunjo.

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,140
Today marks the beginning

51
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,062
for me.

52
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,235
Sir, we've got trouble.

53
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,994
<i>Emergency at the first-floor lobby.</i>

54
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,454
<i>I repeat,
emergency at the first-floor lobby.</i>

55
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,286
<i>Security is currently
restricting the area.</i>

56
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,663
<i>Requesting immediate action.</i>

57
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,301
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

58
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,598
Evacuate all workers
and control the media.

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,191
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,335
We need to close up the building.

61
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,693
It's a detonator.

62
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,488
I already pressed the button.
It'll explode once I let go.

63
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,907
They were going to send someone else
if I didn't go.

64
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,751
They could be watching us.

65
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,915
Hang in there.
We'll get this sorted out soon.

66
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,050
-Call the EOD.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,106
<i>Target located
at the first-floor lobby of SIH.</i>

68
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,616
<i>Unable to identify whether
the target is a suspect or a victim.</i>

69
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,409
<i>Possible suicide bomber.</i>

70
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,464
You risked your life to be righteous.

71
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,249
How tiring.

72
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,758
Jeez.

73
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,011
<i>You're going to carry the bomb.</i>

74
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,894
I won't do it.

75
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,027
Then pick one.

76
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,284
Uh...

77
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,575
PERSONNEL CARD

78
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,288
I like this woman.

79
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,121
Her son and daughter-in-law
died in a car accident,

80
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,826
so she's taking care
of her young granddaughter.

81
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,050
She's lived a long life already.

82
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,261
I don't care.

83
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,927
They're not the ones
who'll carry the bombs.

84
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,771
The ones who'll do that...

85
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,725
...are them.

86
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,370
Why isn't it working?

87
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,958
What do you say?

88
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,829
Did you have a change of heart?

89
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,884
Kim Seohee.

90
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,597
Fancy seeing you again.

91
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,149
We have such a long history
between us, don't you agree?

92
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,319
It all started 22 years ago.

93
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,279
It's like a movie.

94
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,407
Why are you doing this to me?

95
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,908
Me? To you?

96
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,156
What did I do?

97
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,785
That's a misunderstanding. How unfair.

98
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,094
This is all your doing.

99
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,803
You're the one who saw me 22 years ago.

100
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,256
You're the one who claimed
to be a witness to a case,

101
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,224
which I bashed in your mom's head
to keep buried.

102
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,346
You're the one

103
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,016
who killed her.

104
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,188
And you're the one

105
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,976
who killed...

106
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,034
your dad as well.

107
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,700
If you wanted to bomb the SIH,

108
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,080
then you could've just done so.

109
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,543
Ooh.

110
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,000
So why did you have to

111
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,377
pick me of all people?

112
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,377
You should atone for your sins

113
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,546
by wearing an explosive belt
and sacrificing yourself.

114
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,642
Who knows?

115
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,934
Maybe if you disarm it,

116
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,886
you'll kill everyone else but yourself

117
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,305
once again.

118
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,397
It'd be good for us if that happened.

119
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,366
The EOD will arrive soon.

120
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,947
Don't be scared. You must remain calm.

121
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,830
Team A didn't send me
simply to take revenge.

122
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,673
I have the detonator.

123
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,132
If this explodes,
I'll be taking the blame.

124
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,983
HAESONG GROUP
80TH-ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

125
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,027
Hey.

126
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,163
Your son looks elated.

127
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,619
He's probably on cloud nine.

128
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,173
It was his dream to lead Haesong
ever since he could talk.

129
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,339
They've all surrounded the new sun.

130
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,263
Don't you feel hurt?

131
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,343
That's life.

132
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,182
There's sunset and sunrise.

133
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,102
Mr. Ha.

134
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,515
Do you know why
I used a diamond to create the Adamas?

135
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,525
No, but I'm curious.

136
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,489
Is there a special reason for that?

137
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,359
I wanted to become someone
who'd never break

138
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,579
or be conquered.

139
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,581
Only fools challenge me.

140
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,955
And they end up getting crushed.

141
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,998
I'm sure.

142
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,007
Mm.

143
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,255
Ah. When will you reveal the Adamas--

144
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,393
-Wait--

145
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,735
<i>The revealing time wasn't announced.</i>

146
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,359
We need to come up with a sign.

147
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,775
Let's make a move
when the fireworks are lit.

148
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,542
<i>We must neutralize
the surveillance system.</i>

149
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,469
It has begun.

150
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,892
Let's be patient.

151
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,096
Ms. Kwon said she prepared a surprise.

152
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,616
The system is down?

153
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,708
I don't know what's going on, sir.

154
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,503
Damn it. We have guests here.

155
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,303
God damn it. Our security system is down.

156
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,852
-What should we do?
Call the police.

157
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,271
Let them do their money's worth.

158
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,063
We can't call a repairman at this hour.

159
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,194
Those are all VIP guests.

160
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,941
If something happens to them,

161
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,936
we'll all get sacked.

162
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,620
What are you doing? Call them
and say we'll pay them handsomely!

163
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,408
Yes, sir.

164
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,174
That's our cue. Let's go.

165
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,427
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

166
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,080
We'll remove the bomb from the suspect
and disarm it somewhere safe.

167
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,137
We can't remove it.

168
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,727
We need an oxygen
cutting machine, but it may create sparks.

169
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,820
We'll disarm it here.

170
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,487
Set up a situation room.
We'll evacuate 60m from here.

171
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,821
Yes, sir.

172
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,026
Evacuate 60m from here.

173
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,017
Given the size,
the explosive power will be immense.

174
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,566
The fragments will fly
and injure everyone.

175
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,738
They're probably...

176
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,986
get the snipers ready.

177
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,414
-Snipers?
-For the worst-case scenario.

178
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,254
They can't trust the suspect.

179
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,706
That's what they need to do
to prevent the worst.

180
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,000
By suspect, do you mean...

181
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,672
Ms. Kim. She has her hand
on the detonator.

182
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,924
In their eyes, she's a suicide bomber.

183
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,258
Is that why you duct taped her?

184
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,643
So she'd still be pressing it
even if she got shot?

185
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,164
We will take over from here.

186
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,743
She isn't a suicide bomber.
There's someone else.

187
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,408
That's a bigger problem then.

188
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,964
That means someone could control
the explosive remotely.

189
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,710
Anyone within a three-kilometer radius

190
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,882
is capable of doing that.

191
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,545
You should just hope
that she's a suicide bomber.

192
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,882
That means we'll be safe
as long as she's pressing it.

193
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,801
We will control this crime scene.

194
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,252
<i>Team Level Two has arrived.</i>

195
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,205
<i>Current location,
the SIH's first-floor lobby.</i>

196
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,422
<i>Keep an eye on the target.</i>

197
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,054
<i>If she acts suspiciously,
move onto level two immediately.</i>

198
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,548
Target on.

199
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,144
Be on standby. Shoot on command.

200
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,903
We don't know which cable
is connected to the detonator.

201
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,781
One explosion is all that's needed.

202
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,453
It's best to do it one by one
though it'll take some time.

203
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,469
We've disarmed one.

204
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,808
They got one.

205
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,455
Where is Mr. Choi?

206
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,958
He's away due to a security issue.

207
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,081
I see.

208
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,206
Oh, well.

209
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,377
One minute.

210
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,967
Mr. Ha, should I escort you to him?

211
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,555
Sure. Thank you.

212
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,927
This way. The cart is ready.

213
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,018
<i>Draw attention</i>

214
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,574
<i>so they won't know that I'm gone.</i>

215
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,355
I can do this.

216
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,370
I can.

217
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,398
Congratulations.

218
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,822
Thank you, Father.

219
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,904
Do your best no matter the outcome.

220
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,857
I still lack in many ways.
I need your help.

221
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,698
Don't be ridiculous.
I won't get involved whatsoever.

222
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,158
Once I finish...

223
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,124
my last task.

224
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,089
Pardon?

225
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,583
What are you doing? Leave.

226
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,872
I just wanted to take a look.

227
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,789
Gosh, that hurts.

228
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,802
That hurts.

229
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,260
Have you gone insane? Get up!

230
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,721
Okay.

231
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,590
Oh, God.

232
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,967
My knee.
-Get up!

233
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,517
Are you drunk? Get up!

234
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,679
Okay.

235
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,227
What do I do?

236
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,230
Just leave. Don't touch anything.

237
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,152
The chairman is quite photogenic.

238
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,231
Okay.
Don't touch anything.

239
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,737
Leave that there.

240
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,238
Just leave!

241
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,222
Ms. Yoon.

242
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,721
Give me a glass of champagne.

243
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,307
Right now.

244
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,545
I'll take your phones.
You may not bring them inside.

245
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,009
Let me tell you which areas you'll patrol.

246
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,271
Okay.
Don't touch anything.

247
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,561
Leave that there.

248
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,774
-He's very photogenic.
-Just leave!

249
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,435
-Please leave.
-I think I should help you clean up.

250
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,863
I'll leave now.

251
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,744
Don't worry about me.
Please enjoy your time.

252
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,500
That was nerve-racking.

253
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,918
I did what he told me to,
so I probably did well, right?

254
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,138
I saw him leave.

255
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,466
He has a knack for worrying me.

256
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,604
My God! Mr. Ha.

257
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,392
What?

258
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,897
Long time no see.

259
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,902
Where's Woosin?

260
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,645
Prosecutor Song, wait!

261
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
Hey.

262
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,653
I suddenly craved cognac more.

263
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,699
Why are you here
when the event is still ongoing?

264
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,950
You sure weren't looking for me.

265
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,158
What are you doing there?

266
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,155
Are you sure that the light
only flicked once?

267
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,405
Yes, sir. He was supposed
to give us two flicks.

268
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,588
Prosecutor Song.

269
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,312
Chairman Kwon?

270
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,809
Hello.

271
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,229
Who is this?

272
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,904
I don't think you're Mr. Ha.

273
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,407
Sir, you see-

274
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,449
No, I'm not. I'm Song Suhyeon.

275
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,999
Song Suhyeon?

276
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,082
-What are you?
-You little...

277
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,875
Can't you see? We're twins.

278
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,216
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

279
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,821
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

280
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,162
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

281
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,288
Do you know me?

282
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,875
So you do.

283
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,262
-You little--
Hyunjo.

284
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,762
Father, I'll take care of this outside
since there are guests here.

285
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,092
That's okay.

286
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,467
So you're Mr. Ha's twin brother?

287
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,478
What brings you here?

288
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,518
I received a tip-off.

289
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,190
-A tip-off.
-I heard you're revealing the Adamas,

290
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,318
and someone's out to steal it.

291
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,195
I came all the way here
to prevent that from happening.

292
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,830
Someone is going to steal the Adamas?

293
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,788
Who?

294
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,354
MY PATH

295
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,403
Don't worry. I can call the police.

296
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,524
Will you just stand still?
Drag him out of here.

297
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
Don't worry.

298
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,320
We'll search the entire premises
once the police arrive.

299
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,703
You bastard. Enough with this nonsense!

300
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,954
Damn it. You're really pushing my buttons.

301
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,584
People are watching.

302
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,626
I received the tip-off
from a credible source.

303
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,671
This invite.

304
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,388
My source

305
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,814
sent me this invite.

306
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,306
HAESONG GROUP
80TH-ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY

307
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,189
Testing.

308
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,623
May I have your attention, please?

309
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,558
This is the most important part
of this ceremony,

310
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,851
so please be quiet.

311
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,534
Finally, everyone is here.

312
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,923
Now,

313
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,218
we will reveal the Adamas.

314
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,239
Everyone.

315
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,290
The Adamas

316
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,423
is a murder weapon.

317
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,300
Lee Changwoo, the heinous thief,
committed murder 22 years ago.

318
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,102
But he wasn't the killer.

319
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,944
That lunatic.

320
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,185
The real killer

321
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,228
is in this room with us.

322
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,791
What's going on?

323
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,408
I don't know. Be quiet.

324
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,082
The killer is...

325
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,347
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu!

326
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,202
You murderer.

327
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,873
Have you gone insane? That's absurd!

328
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,793
You were aware of it as well.

329
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,252
From the very beginning!

330
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,843
What do you say, master?

331
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,546
Do you like my little surprise?

332
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,348
I'm going to reveal everything.

333
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,639
Everything!

334
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,346
I'll expose your true, demonic face.

335
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,687
I will name

336
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,942
every single person you've killed!

337
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,398
Call the police!

338
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,253
Mr. Choi.

339
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,299
Yes, sir.

340
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,675
Call the police.

341
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,770
Tell them that we caught the thief...

342
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,349
who stole the Adamas.

343
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,012
What was that?

344
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,552
I'm not sure.

345
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,175
The sound came from somewhere.

346
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,892
I think it's the front side.

347
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,656
A timer?

348
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,175
-Did you hand in everything?
-I did.

349
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,816
Carry out a simple interrogation
and return this.

350
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,112
Theft isn't anything serious.

351
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,316
Right. It's only a formality.

352
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,918
TERRORIST BOMBING SUSPECTED
IN THE SIH BUILDING

353
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,948
We need to get out of here too.

354
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,701
Ms. Kwon must know something
about our father's case.

355
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,423
You idiot. Why did you
barge in here recklessly?

356
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,544
I received this invite.

357
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,378
I naturally thought
Team A had sent it to me.

358
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,424
They were probably trying to lure me.

359
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,260
Or they must've known
that the SIH was coming.

360
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,184
Elaborate. Why would Team A
send you that invite?

361
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,558
Ms. Kim Seohee was kidnapped.

362
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,937
In front of my eyes.

363
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,698
It was Team A's doing,
and it happened three days ago.

364
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,453
I thought I'd find a clue here.

365
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,698
You see,

366
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,502
she lost her parents
while trying to reveal the truth

367
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,922
about our father's case.

368
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,218
I can't let her die.

369
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,095
Prosecutor Song.

370
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,023
You stepped over the line today.

371
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,904
Don't meddle in our affairs ever again.

372
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,856
I couldn't care less.

373
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,608
I won't let the SIH fool me ever again.

374
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,865
We found Ms. Kim.

375
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,196
They made a move.

376
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,672
Where is she?

377
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,682
We've removed it.

378
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,104
There was a timer hidden inside.

379
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,353
It was a time bomb.

380
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,098
What do you mean?
What about that detonator?

381
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,937
<i>It's either fake or a dual controller.</i>

382
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,185
<i>If it's neither of them,</i>

383
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,318
<i>then maybe...</i>

384
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,987
It may not even be connected to this bomb.

385
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,852
We're still not completely safe,
but we deactivated the timer.

386
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,725
-We just need to remove the remaining--
-Mr. Kang.

387
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,652
If this is a time bomb,
then what's in my hand?

388
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,898
Probably a dual controller.

389
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,284
Our enemies want the snipers

390
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,373
to kill you for being a suicide bomber.

391
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,405
All this fuss just to kill me?

392
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,159
That can't be.

393
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,514
Hey!

394
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,052
Do you think this is a joke?

395
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,928
Couldn't have kept
your mouth shut, could you?

396
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,223
I'm sorry.

397
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,063
Give me the remote control.

398
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,314
I don't have it.

399
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,227
You don't?

400
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,189
You don't?

401
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,855
-You crazy, little--
-Sir!

402
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,865
Let me go.

403
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,740
-Let go.
-Sir.

404
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,156
Let him go. Let's see what he'll do.

405
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,039
00:48:19.02

406
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,013
You little bastard.
You're her dog, aren't you?

407
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,801
Damn it.

408
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,638
Mr. Jeong.

409
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,103
Seohee is holding the remote control.

410
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,649
What are you doing?

411
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,947
Team A sent a bomb to the SIH.

412
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,661
A group that worked under the radar

413
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,201
wouldn't go this far just to kill me.

414
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,164
There are snipers out there.
You'll get killed.

415
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,334
This is a trap.

416
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,632
The target is removing the duct tape.

417
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,170
Kill her.

418
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,348
Block the view.

419
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,323
I can't see the target.

420
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,736
Send them into the building.
We're going in.

421
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,342
Ms. Kim! Stop that!

422
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,094
-Step back.
-Stop!

423
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,344
-Step back!
-Are you going to kill everyone here?

424
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,096
Give me a minute.
If this isn't a detonator then--

425
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,009
-We'll fire.
-Put down your weapons!

426
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,729
Look. Look at this!

427
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,225
Ms. Kim.

428
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,774
I'll slowly open my hand.

429
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,796
It's a remote control.

430
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,089
This means there's a bomb elsewhere.

431
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,142
The moment she thinks
it's been disarmed and lets go...

432
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,516
Boom.

433
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,784
What a lunatic.

434
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,120
Search the building.

435
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,201
-Go.
Yes, sir.

436
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,716
The police confiscated
the Adamas as evidence of theft.

437
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,428
And you just watched?

438
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,183
I'm sorry, sir.

439
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,734
The police were
officially dispatched here.

440
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,806
Are you serious, you bastard?

441
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,192
He's reporting

442
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,360
to me.

443
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,316
I'm sorry.

444
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,737
Sir, you don't need to worry.

445
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,987
Since it was related to theft

446
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,828
and not what Ms. Kwon had mentioned,

447
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,793
they'll return it soon.

448
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,673
I'll go to the station
and see what's going on.

449
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,671
Okay. You may go.

450
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,773
-Father, we must hurry.

451
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,941
Song Suhyeon and that writer were a team.

452
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,649
They're Song Soonho's sons.

453
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,105
Hyesoo.

454
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,690
Yes, sir.

455
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,730
Give me a cup of tea.

456
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,151
Sure.

457
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,338
<i>Lee Changwoo, the heinous thief,
committed murder 22 years ago.</i>

458
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,295
The killer is...

459
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,894
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu!

460
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,027
What'll you do?

461
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,072
Those bastards
must've won Ms. Kwon over too.

462
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,577
Father, there's a reason why
that writer came to our house.

463
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,701
Probably.

464
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,457
He's Song Soonho's son, after all.

465
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,288
He must be aware of Lee Changwoo's case.

466
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,377
He's looking for his father's murderer.

467
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,513
Damn it!

468
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,548
Things went awry
since there were people watching.

469
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,184
It's going to be impossible
to keep this on the down-low.

470
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,892
Once they start talking about you--

471
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,813
What do the rumors say about me?

472
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,983
-Pardon?
-Do you also think I committed murder?

473
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,230
No, of course not.

474
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,187
If that's the case,

475
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,534
why did Ms. Kwon say such a thing?

476
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,870
She said you had known all along.

477
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,537
That was because...

478
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,665
Do I have to go in there?

479
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,999
It's hide-and-seek.

480
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,916
You win if you stay there
until tomorrow morning.

481
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,837
But I'm scared.

482
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,974
Are you a coward?
I said I'd grant you your wish if you won.

483
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,847
Really? So I'll be able
to treat you like a brother if I win?

484
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,308
Sure.

485
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,436
Okay, I'll do it.

486
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,786
Well done. You're pretty good at your job.

487
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,473
I was in a pickle since we'd be
revealing it tomorrow afternoon.

488
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,733
Sir, here's the Adamas.

489
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,225
I got it back.

490
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,624
You got rid of him, right?

491
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,827
-Lee Changwoo.

492
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,634
Minjo told me that he saw it
when he was young.

493
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,710
But he never mentioned you.

494
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,716
He left out the part
where you bullied him.

495
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,100
Don't get yourself involved.

496
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,889
-But Father--
-Don't.

497
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,563
Don't do anything.

498
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,162
EOD

499
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,251
We're searching for the second time.

500
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,045
We couldn't find anything
on our first try.

501
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,890
Prosecutor Song.

502
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,101
What's going on? An explosive?

503
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,772
How's the situation?

504
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,900
We've removed the detonator,
but we're looking for another explosive.

505
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,268
Another one?

506
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,975
Ms. Kim was pressing on a remote control,
not a detonator.

507
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,357
We're still searching the building.

508
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,414
-Where is she?
<i>Hold on.</i>

509
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,872
I've disarmed them all.

510
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,957
Thank you.

511
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,381
I just need to remove the vest--

512
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,801
<i>Who knows?</i>

513
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,342
Maybe if you disarm it,

514
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,094
you'll kill everyone else but yourself

515
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,764
once again.

516
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,926
Ms. Kim.

517
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,978
Ms. Kim.

518
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,435
Ms. Kim.

519
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:43,975
It's Prosecutor Song.

520
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,784
Prosecutor Song?

521
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,741
It's me.

522
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,624
I'm sorry that I lost you.

523
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,742
<i>I really am.</i>

524
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,288
I'm okay.

525
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,500
How are you?

526
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,039
I'm okay too.

527
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,801
I'm truly relieved.

528
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,047
Mr. Kang just briefed me.

529
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,593
Don't worry. I'm on my way.
Hang in there a bit longer.

530
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,928
That's not a problem.

531
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,638
But we need to locate the bomb.

532
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,644
I can't allow any more casualties.

533
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,864
Maybe if you disarm it,
"you'll kill everyone else

534
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,863
but yourself once again."

535
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,199
-What do you mean?
-That's what he said.

536
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,333
He said I'd live if I disarmed this.

537
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,080
-Who said that?
-Mr. Lee of Team A.

538
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,866
If that means I won't die

539
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,747
even if I let go of this...

540
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,415
You'll be unscathed from the explosion?

541
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,802
This isn't it.

542
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,051
The SIH isn't their target.

543
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,475
If that's what it means,
this is more serious than we thought.

544
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,901
The search needs to be wider.

545
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,439
The maximum range for remote control
is five kilometers. It's too wide.

546
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,903
<i>But why? There must be a motive for this.</i>

547
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,355
Motive.

548
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,873
Bombings are usually done
to terrorize the public.

549
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,039
They'd want to maximize
the propaganda effect.

550
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,908
Then it should be at a public--

551
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,577
A massacre.

552
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,495
It's almost 11 p.m. Search downtown.

553
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,995
Search within a five-kilometer radius.

554
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,838
List up all potentially crowded places.

555
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,053
Yes, sir.

556
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,926
Ms. Kim. I'm almost there, so wait for me.

557
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,352
<i>No, don't come.</i>

558
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,980
I'm really fine, so don't come near here
until they find the bomb.

559
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,729
Are you seriously worried about me?

560
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,440
Prosecutor Song.

561
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,196
CANDIDATE HWANG FOCUSES
HIS LAST CAMPAIGN IN SEOUL

562
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,875
He told me not to do anything.

563
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,637
Nothing?

564
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,142
After Minjo died,
I have always been the heir.

565
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,441
And today, I officially became chairman.

566
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,226
But he still doesn't have trust in me.

567
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,106
He doesn't want to let go of what he has.

568
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,996
That just means

569
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,497
that you don't need to do anything.

570
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:55,514
You know how he is.

571
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,545
I know.

572
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,760
I have something to tell you.

573
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:11,401
I think your wife has been in touch

574
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,819
with Mr. Jeong.

575
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,532
Hyesoo?

576
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,075
Here's your tea.

577
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,253
Good night.

578
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,958
Hyesoo.

579
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,010
Yes, sir?

580
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,380
Why aren't you asking about today?

581
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,891
As if you already knew.

582
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,351
Well, all I do is plant flowers

583
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,063
and paint.

584
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,403
I have no say in such matters.

585
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,740
Should I spare or kill her?

586
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,414
-Pardon?
-Ms. Kwon.

587
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,280
What would you do?

588
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,790
You should silence her.

589
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,079
Forever.

590
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,462
However,

591
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,216
I think you should keep her alive for now.

592
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:23,762
Why?

593
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,763
If I were you, I'd be curious.

594
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,683
About why she did that.

595
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,055
Getting stabbed in the back
like a sitting duck

596
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,807
is too humiliating.

597
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,157
I will never forgive you. Ever.

598
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,210
We need to leave this instant.

599
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,337
What's taking him so long?

600
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:11,467
INTERROGATION ROOM

601
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,733
That room.

602
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,949
Here to watch?

603
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,409
Laugh all you want.

604
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,868
Ms. Kwon.

605
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,536
I have a question.

606
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:39,213
What? Are you curious since I know
everything about your father's case?

607
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,714
You want me to tell you, don't you?

608
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,205
Are you here to implore?

609
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,840
-No.
-No?

610
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,723
Then why did you come running here?

611
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,180
Since when did you know

612
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,184
that I was stealing the Adamas?

613
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,225
What do you mean?

614
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,940
The news article.

615
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,069
LEE CHANGWOO CONFESSES.
WHERE IS THE MISSING MURDER WEAPON?

616
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,528
Ms. Kwon.

617
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,206
<i>So you'd spare Ms. Kwon.</i>

618
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,000
Next?

619
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,250
-Next?
-Mr. Ha.

620
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,836
Should I kill him?

621
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,761
-I would--
-Kill him?

622
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,061
INTERROGATION ROOM

623
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,189
It wasn't her.

624
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,069
EVIDENCE ROOM

625
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,878
EVIDENCE NUMBER A-2204
HANSOL PLAYGROUND

626
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,743
You actually came here.

627
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,664
Who...

628
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,617
are you?

629
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,343
But you won't kill him.

630
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:35,089
-I won't?
-The fact that he left this mansion means

631
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,348
that you allowed it.

632
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,805
There must be a reason why you let him go.

633
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,556
I'm sure you have a plan.

634
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,738
EVIDENCE TRANSFER RECORD

635
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:06,997
This is the reason why
Chairman Kwon hasn't killed you.

636
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,047
Go bring the real Adamas.

637
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,974
Your father knows where it is. Got that?

638
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,575
I'm going to hand over my company
to my son soon.

639
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,328
I'll give him the Adamas as well.

640
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,161
So I'd like you to recraft it
into a new design.

641
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,213
Sir.

642
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,253
Please forgive me for saying this.

643
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,424
But this is fake.

644
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,597
You're wrong. When it was first crafted,

645
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,606
I wanted it to have a crude design.

646
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,737
So I didn't add any detailed cuts.
That's why it looks dull.

647
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,405
No, sir.
I can bet my entire career on this.

648
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,576
You were fooled.

649
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,714
Fooled.

650
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,879
Yes, this is definitely fake.

651
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,841
I was fooled?

652
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:42,013
Who in the world did something like this?

653
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,543
<i>The Adamas</i>

654
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,167
<i>is already broken.</i>

655
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,842
<i>The murder weapon doesn't exist anymore.</i>

656
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,878
<i>He managed to silence</i>

657
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,387
<i>all those people.</i>

658
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,969
<i>Mr. Ha is here.</i>

659
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,928
<i>Are you crazy? How could you
meet the chairman in this situation?</i>

660
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,394
<i>Shouldn't you be busy right now?</i>

661
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,226
Ms. Kwon seemed to know something.

662
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,112
Ask me anything. I'll tell you everything.

663
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,650
<i>So you planned it all
from the start.</i>

664
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,903
<i>All to find the real Adamas.</i>
