1
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,015
(theme music)

2
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:51,385
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,975
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,855
WOOSIN: <i>The symbol of Haesong Group.</i>

5
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,695
<i>The arrow with a diamond tip.</i>

6
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,985
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

7
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,535
You're insane. How?

8
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,035
What if there's someone helping me?

9
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,785
WOOSIN: <i>Somebody…</i>

10
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,545
<i>invited me to this mansion.</i>

11
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,085
Who do you think recommended
that I ghostwrite Chairman Kwon's memoir?

12
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:28,965
Does that person know about me?

13
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,425
Probably not.

14
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,055
We haven't met each other yet.

15
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:37,765
Then I guess I'll be safe
if I keep your mouth shut.

16
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:44,695
I couldn't stick to being good
in order to gain their trust.

17
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,735
I had to dirty my hands.

18
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,365
You're going to shoot me?

19
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:51,865
If needed.

20
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,205
Accidents are common when hunting.

21
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:55,955
What will you do about the witness?

22
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,585
What are you two doing there?

23
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,385
Oh, hello.

24
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,805
This is a little flustering, right?

25
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,345
Yes, very much.

26
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,065
{\an8}I think this needs to be reported.

27
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,065
{\an8}MS. KWON: <i>Mr. Choi?</i>

28
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,825
{\an8}He was pointing a gun at Mr. Ha?

29
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:37,955
{\an8}Why?

30
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,375
{\an8}MR. CHOI:
<i>I came across suspicious behavior.</i>

31
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,715
{\an8}I sensed the presence of someone
while hunting,

32
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,635
{\an8}and some stranger was looking around
when I checked.

33
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:53,635
{\an8}As if…

34
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,555
{\an8}he was looking for someone.

35
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:59,515
So I pointed my gun at him
to identify him.

36
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:02,105
And it turned out to be Mr. Ha.

37
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:06,855
Ms. Eun saw us
and got the wrong idea, I presume.

38
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,565
It seemed like he was looking for someone?

39
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,485
In my eyes, yes.

40
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,535
What do you think, Hyesoo?

41
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,955
You must've seen something.

42
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,415
I'm not sure.

43
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,535
What I saw was

44
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,915
him pointing his gun at Mr. Ha.

45
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,005
Not what happened before and after.

46
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:30,215
But Mr. Choi,

47
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,845
he didn't seem suspicious at all to me.

48
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,845
HYESOO: What could he have been doing?

49
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:41,555
In that open space in broad daylight.

50
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,525
-That's--
-KWON: What should we do?

51
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,855
Two people are giving different stories

52
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,405
about the same situation.

53
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:54,785
So one of you must be lying.

54
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,535
It seems to me that Mr. Choi was mistaken.

55
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,705
(door opens)

56
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:02,455
MS. KWON: Mistaken?

57
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:05,085
Mr. Choi isn't the kind of person
to point his gun at someone

58
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,505
because of a misunderstanding.

59
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,715
I apologize for the rushed interruption.

60
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,435
No, it's fine.
Let me hear your side of the story.

61
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,225
Then I will tell you.

62
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,645
I'd like to know why
they were in the woods.

63
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,395
Mr. Choi went to hunt.
What about you, Ms. Hyesoo?

64
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,105
I went to get some
golden-rayed lilies for the garden.

65
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,155
These.

66
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,825
What about you, Mr. Ha?

67
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,905
If you weren't looking for someone
like Mr. Choi thought, why?

68
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,745
Why aren't you saying anything?

69
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,675
KWON: Mr. Ha.

70
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,715
You're making Mr. Choi's story
more plausible.

71
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,515
Sir, you shouldn't
let this slide so easily.

72
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,185
We need to get to the bottom of this--

73
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,095
I will tell you.

74
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:12,275
Sir, may I speak with you
in private first?

75
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,365
One of us here might find
what I say uncomfortable.

76
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,365
(tense music)

77
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:25,705
(sighs)

78
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,545
Ms. Hyesoo.

79
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,135
Don't get close to the writer.

80
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:40,805
I have a leery feeling about him,
and I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,565
You're worried about me?

82
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,725
That's very unusual.

83
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,695
Maybe it's time you leave this world.

84
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:59,285
That rude witch…

85
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,495
What happened?

86
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,205
It's just as I told the chairman.
I spotted someone suspicious,

87
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:11,875
-and he…
-So what about him was suspicious?

88
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,795
Why can't you read between the lines?

89
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:17,295
(grunts)
He was glancing about, and I wondered

90
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:19,345
if he was looking for someone.

91
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,095
Looking for someone? Who?

92
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,685
Ms. Kwon, I could've
jumped to conclusions.

93
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,315
You can't change your words now!

94
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,775
Anyway, he did seem suspicious.

95
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:38,155
His eyes gave me a strange feeling
from the beginning.

96
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,075
Why on earth did he come to Haesong?

97
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:46,535
You know why. To ghostwrite…

98
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,035
No, that's not it.

99
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:52,005
Money can't move the likes of him.

100
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:54,715
I know very well about those lowlifes
who do anything for money.

101
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,175
It doesn't feel right.

102
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,885
You must have good reason
to have such an idea,

103
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,345
but the chairman wouldn't let
just anyone into Haesong.

104
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,935
And if there was a problem with him,

105
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,765
the chairman wouldn't be that fond of him.

106
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:12,355
Fond?
(scoffs)

107
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:16,195
If he wanted money
or anything else from the master,

108
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:17,855
he would've tried to win me over first.

109
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:19,405
Because I'm the gate to the master!

110
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,575
Everyone did so. Even assemblymen
and the Public Prosecutor General.

111
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:25,615
But that weasel skipped me.

112
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,705
Ma'am, don't worry.

113
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:30,535
I'll keep an eye on him.

114
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,295
I know he has an ulterior motive.

115
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,975
Now that everyone else is gone,
you can speak to me.

116
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,605
I believe it's the difference
in how you interpret it.

117
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,185
The difference in how you interpret it?

118
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,065
Yes, Mr. Choi had a misjudgment.

119
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,445
He has doubts about everything
because it's his job.

120
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,485
And that probably affected
his interpretation.

121
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,905
Depending on your occupation,
you have a different way

122
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,705
of expressing your memory.

123
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,705
Thus, instead of the facts,

124
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,245
he interpreted his emotion of that time
as a memory.

125
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,045
Let's say he did.

126
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,925
Then why did you go into the woods?

127
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:25,385
MS. KWON: <i>A walk?</i>

128
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,555
(scoffs)

129
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:30,475
He went there alone for a walk?
And you believe him?

130
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,225
What's not to believe?

131
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,565
I do that too, from time to time.

132
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,395
But, master. Mr. Choi--

133
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,365
WOOSIN: <i>Mr. Choi.</i>

134
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,495
Make this your last test.

135
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,005
-What test?
-Whether I expose your identity.

136
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,925
You made a big deal out of it
to check that.

137
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,795
You're pretty quick-witted.

138
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,755
I guess you survived.

139
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,385
Don't go too far though.
I won't take it next time.

140
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,515
Think about my situation.

141
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:15,185
I couldn't trust you enough
to go easy on you.

142
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,515
I kept my promise.

143
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,565
Exclude me
from the security system right now.

144
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,935
I never gave you my word.

145
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,695
And excluding you isn't a simple matter.

146
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,405
Instead, I'll give you a tip.

147
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,785
-A tip?
-Beware of Ms. Kwon.

148
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,535
She's like a guard dog.

149
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,035
She easily gets suspicious.

150
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:35,535
On top of that, she has a nasty hobby.

151
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:39,295
MR. CHOI: <i>You know that one of the maids
was taken to the hospital unconscious.</i>

152
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,335
<i>Flocoumafen was found in her body.</i>

153
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,545
That's rat poison.

154
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,545
It was the third time.

155
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,425
Good luck.

156
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:55,225
Will you be okay if your cover gets blown?

157
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:03,065
Then what? Do you think
I'll just sit back and watch it happen?

158
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,195
I could expose that
some thief is after the Adamas.

159
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,405
And that he has an accomplice.

160
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:11,995
You have my weakness?

161
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,745
I have your weakness too.

162
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,245
You know what?

163
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,915
Hands and feet are tricky
to control subconsciously.

164
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:26,335
But in this adverse situation,
your hands are in your pockets.

165
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,175
That means you're feeling anxious.

166
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,055
(sighs)

167
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:42,565
Are you certain that
the Adamas is in this house?

168
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,625
It's here.

169
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,665
Because its owner is here.

170
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,725
(grunting)

171
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,815
I don't know
how he sweet-talked the master,

172
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,825
but he can't fool me.

173
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:35,535
DONGRIM: Will you keep this up?
I already know everything.

174
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:36,655
WOOSIN: About what?

175
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,955
DONGRIM: About why you chose to come here.

176
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:41,625
I know what your true intentions are.

177
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,495
What do you mean?

178
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:46,045
DONGRIM:
You'd be insane to ghostwrite for someone.

179
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:47,875
WOOSIN: What are you getting at?

180
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,925
DONGRIM: You're preparing for your
next book, and it's about conglomerates.

181
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,635
You're here for research purposes.
We're in the same boat.

182
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,435
That darn rat.

183
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,895
DIRECTOR: <i>Revise it.</i>

184
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,855
Excuse me?

185
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:08,565
Revise the article.

186
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:10,155
Why?

187
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:14,655
It's like a perfect piece of art
that follows 5W1H.

188
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,865
I put all my skills
into writing this article.

189
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,285
Hey, I can't tell Newscaster Cha
to criticize Candidate Hwang.

190
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,955
Why not?

191
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,455
It's not like I'm asking him
to literally attack him.

192
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,715
He better quit being a newscaster
if he's bothered to say a few words.

193
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,755
-He will quit.
-What?

194
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,885
He's been nominated to be a spokesman.

195
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:33,675
Don't get in your senior's way.

196
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,345
Are you kidding me?

197
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,345
You guys are just ridiculous.

198
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,725
Darn them.

199
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,315
What a load of crap.

200
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,985
(phone buzzing)

201
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,745
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

202
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,045
Hello?

203
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,965
GOVERNOR HWANG'S CONTROVERSIAL HANDLING
OF MOUNT GYEONGWON LANDSLIDE

204
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:16,635
REPORTER KIM SEOHEE

205
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:19,765
What is this?

206
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:22,975
To understand someone,
you must look into their past first.

207
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,105
SUHYEON: These are your past articles.

208
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:28,475
You targeted Candidate Hwang quite often.

209
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:32,695
Just be direct.

210
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:35,065
It's pathetic to beat around the bush.

211
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:40,365
Is it your passionate sense of justice
that's making you cover my father's case?

212
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,575
(scoffs)

213
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,245
No, I'm just awfully nosy.

214
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,495
Or you're anti-campaigning
against Candidate Hwang.

215
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,165
You want to stop his approval ratings
from hiking.

216
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:50,755
Lee Changwoo has to be innocent

217
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:53,545
so Candidate Hwang loses trust
for supporting the death penalty system.

218
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,215
You're using the death-row inmate
to draw attention

219
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,885
and make Candidate Hwang hit rock bottom.

220
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:02,595
So you're sure about
the missing weapon now?

221
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:09,685
I admit it. But then, it's strange.

222
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,775
Just who took the murder weapon?

223
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,695
You may think
the real culprit is someone else.

224
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,735
But the crucial evidence proves it wrong.

225
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,655
The witness. Oh, dear.

226
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,285
He even testified in court.

227
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:27,165
I saw the two of them
enter the house that night.

228
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,295
The victim was angry.

229
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,875
He demanded Lee pay off his debt.

230
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:36,965
PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, the victim visited
Lee Changwoo at his house

231
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:40,765
to claim his rightful payment.

232
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,425
Then after an argument, he was murdered.

233
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,765
And you still think
Lee Changwoo was framed?

234
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,895
What if the witness committed perjury?

235
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:48,975
On what grounds?

236
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,815
The witness even described
Lee Changwoo's attire.

237
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,645
PROSECUTOR:
You've seen this jacket before, correct?

238
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,405
Yes.

239
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,615
Lee Changwoo was wearing it.

240
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,945
PROSECUTOR:
The accused was wearing this jacket

241
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,535
when he got arrested at the crime scene.

242
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,865
I will submit it as evidence.

243
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,955
SEOHEE: <i>That witness
has a red-green color deficiency.</i>

244
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,715
Don't say he could differentiate
red and green at night.

245
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,465
It should've been considered
during the investigation.

246
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,055
He had a driver's license.

247
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:27,015
That means he's not colorblind,
so they may not have known.

248
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,725
How did you find out?

249
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:36,275
I met him.

250
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:38,235
Let's go.

251
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:40,825
Where is he?

252
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,785
(solemn music)

253
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,645
A room that no one enters or leaves.

254
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,895
Should I get the wrong idea
about what you just did?

255
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,615
I was admiring the unique interior design.

256
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,745
I only meant to peep but you caught me.

257
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:10,995
Let me apologize. Excuse me.

258
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:12,825
Just like what happened with Mr. Choi,

259
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,125
you're causing yourself
to be misunderstood.

260
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,755
I'll be careful from now on.

261
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:20,625
(device beeps)

262
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,715
That's strange. I thought I turned it off.

263
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,725
HYESOO: It's a portable metal detector.

264
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,435
WOOSIN: Oh, it's the metal pin.

265
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,275
I got surgery on my finger
when I was little.

266
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,315
I see.

267
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,395
You're carrying something quite unusual.

268
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:44,735
I keep losing my ring
when I tend the garden.

269
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:46,985
HYESOO: It was the seventh time today.

270
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,945
WOOSIN: I see.
That ring must mean a lot to you.

271
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,035
It doesn't seem so special,

272
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,955
but you look for it
every time you lose it.

273
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,245
Did I just cross a line?

274
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,205
Yes, I feel offended.

275
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:00,755
Oh. Let me apologize again.

276
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,175
Please think of it
as an occupational habit.

277
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:08,305
It's just that psychologists
find people so interesting--

278
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:09,465
You're flustered.

279
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:11,635
Pardon?

280
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:16,435
There's no need to explain.
I'll accept your apology.

281
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:25,815
Right, I was flustered and rambled on.

282
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:29,235
(suspenseful music)

283
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,585
(door closes)

284
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,805
WOOSIN: It was the only locked room.

285
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,555
What could be inside?

286
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:01,815
(alarm beeping)

287
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,105
-What's that?
-An alarm.

288
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:09,655
It's time to take my pills.
I set an alarm to remind myself.

289
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:12,655
What pills? Nutritional supplements?

290
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,865
I'm very attentive
to maintaining my health these days.

291
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,955
Do you even know what they're for?

292
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,335
Of course.

293
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,005
Omega-3. Milk thistle.

294
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,125
DONGRIM: And vitamin K.

295
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:34,975
If you share your pills with someone,
they won't be as effective.

296
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:36,515
I won't take them.

297
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:39,475
It's not like
I don't want to share them with you.

298
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,685
You're healthy enough already,

299
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,395
and taking these could make you
live unnecessarily long.

300
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:51,525
Come to think of it,
our boss is never wrong.

301
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,735
Ms. Yeo? What did she say?

302
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,785
That your words call for a beating.

303
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,625
Well, I'm kind of like that.

304
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,255
-Guess what?
-Whatever.

305
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,175
There's a treasure in this mansion.

306
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,265
Adamas.

307
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:27,185
You knew that, old man?

308
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:30,235
I guess we took the same taxi.
He told me the same thing.

309
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,195
-Could it be real?
-What if it is?

310
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,865
It should belong to the one who finds it.

311
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,535
I was good at treasure hunting
ever since I was little.

312
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:39,915
My know-how is to see the forest,
not the trees.

313
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:42,375
DONGRIM: Looking from afar…

314
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,875
I spotted a beauty right away.

315
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:54,345
Where are you going?
The study is this way.

316
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,055
Is he playing hooky again?

317
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,025
"See the forest, not the trees,"
says Lee Dongrim.

318
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:11,445
The house itself is too high
for a three-story building.

319
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,565
Besides,

320
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,195
it was extended.

321
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,115
Except for that place.

322
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,125
(birds chirping)

323
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:02,865
(eerie music)

324
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:26,015
(beeping)

325
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,355
MAN: His real name is Song Woosin.

326
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,525
His pen name is Ha Woosin
with his mother's surname.

327
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:38,115
So he blackmailed you?

328
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:39,735
MR. CHOI: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

329
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,155
He seems normal

330
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:43,655
and has a decent job,
yet he enjoys danger.

331
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:45,115
What does he want?

332
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,955
He wants to steal the Adamas.

333
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,705
MR. CHOI: <i>The diamond arrow.</i>

334
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:51,205
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS
HAESONG ADAMAS

335
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,465
THE MOST EXPENSIVE DIAMOND ARROW
IN THE WORLD, ADAMAS

336
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:57,795
MAN:
He's even gutsy. That thing is priceless.

337
00:22:58,635 --> 00:22:59,635
Then again,

338
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:03,555
he blackmailed a police officer
so he could steal it.

339
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,765
He's more than just ordinary.

340
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:08,265
Taesung, this is tricky.

341
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,015
<i>If we try to do something about him,</i>

342
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,605
your identity could be exposed.

343
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,985
Sir, this isn't the time to calculate.

344
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:18,615
MR. CHOI: <i>That writer's reckless behavior</i>

345
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,485
could take us all down.

346
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:24,785
Are you going to risk our project
over this one thief?

347
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,955
Of course not.

348
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:35,005
Ha Woosin or whatever his name is.
Do whatever it takes to get rid of him.

349
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:38,215
MAN: <i>That way, we can get him
to confess to how he got your info.</i>

350
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,595
SONG WOOSIN

351
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:44,515
How dare this punk
try to pull a trick on our turf?

352
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,345
(doorbell rings)

353
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,515
Anyone home?

354
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:56,695
WONJOONG: Who are you?

355
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:04,995
My name is Song Suhyeon.

356
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:07,495
And?

357
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,245
I'm Song Soonho's son.

358
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,665
So you remember.

359
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:33,685
(water pouring)

360
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:43,195
I apologize for coming unannounced.

361
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,485
You must be quite surprised.

362
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,995
I won't deny it.

363
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:51,165
But what brings you here?

364
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:54,875
You see,

365
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,045
I'm a prosecutor.

366
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,165
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

367
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:01,965
I looked into my father's case again
and I had some questions.

368
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:07,805
What questions?
The ruling has already been made.

369
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,425
Let me ask you one thing.

370
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:14,765
You testified that you saw Lee Changwoo
and my father that night.

371
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,775
You described Lee Changwoo too.

372
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:20,985
Yes, I did.

373
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,235
Why did you lie?

374
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:27,035
I lied? What are you talking about?

375
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,285
I have evidence.

376
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,245
It's a copy of the investigation record.

377
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,495
SUHYEON: Read the parts underlined in red.

378
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:47,925
"The witness testified
that the victim visited

379
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,885
-the accused's house--"
-No.

380
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:52,975
The parts underlined in red.

381
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,435
This one's in green.

382
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,645
INVESTIGATION PROGRESS

383
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:03,405
EVIDENCE REGARDING MAJOR SUSPICIONS

384
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,775
SUHYEON: This one's in red.

385
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,905
EVIDENCE 3 IS THE JACKET
THE ACCUSED WORE WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED

386
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:13,075
Well, you said the underlined--

387
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,285
I know you're blind to red and green.

388
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:21,255
Yet you saw the green jacket
with red patterns

389
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,835
that Lee Changwoo was wearing?

390
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,345
-That's…
-Look.

391
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:32,385
Sir.

392
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:35,975
Tell me the truth.

393
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,275
I'll stay until you give me an answer.

394
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,405
(sighs)

395
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:52,655
I did wrong.

396
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:56,205
The detectives showed me the picture
and said Lee Changwoo wore that jacket.

397
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:58,035
They asked me if I saw it.

398
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,415
I just ended up saying that I did.

399
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,665
It's true that I'm colorblind,

400
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,255
but I did see them.

401
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:09,385
WONJOONG: <i>I clearly saw them
enter the house together.</i>

402
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:13,225
<i>I parked my car across the road</i>

403
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,385
<i>and was waiting for my wife.</i>

404
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,305
To support our family,

405
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:22,185
she used to work at a sewing factory
until late at night.

406
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,775
A family in those circumstances

407
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:27,985
happened to move into this apartment
after that testimony.

408
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:31,825
What do you mean by that?

409
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:36,205
We got this house with the compensation
from my wife's accident.

410
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,455
Compensation?

411
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:42,205
My gosh!
Let's say I lied about the whole thing.

412
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,955
What about Lee Changwoo?

413
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:47,375
He confessed that he murdered your father!

414
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:56,935
What can be done
about a case from 22 years ago?

415
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:59,595
You're a prosecutor,
so you should know better.

416
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:06,395
Don't come here ever again.
I have nothing more to say.

417
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,045
Did you know
that his wife got into an accident?

418
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:28,375
A car accident
five days before the testimony.

419
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:32,255
They were compensated
with an enormous amount of money.

420
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,715
They were threatened and compensated
at the same time?

421
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,595
SUHYEON: So he had no choice
but to accept the deal.

422
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:44,855
<i>In order to protect his family.</i>

423
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,445
Typical of a soap opera.

424
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,365
Ms. Kim.

425
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:58,615
This case happened 22 years ago,
and it's statute-barred.

426
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,995
Even if the real culprit gets caught,
they won't stand trial.

427
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:05,875
Nevertheless, this is meaningful to me
because I'm the victim's son.

428
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:10,545
But why are you so obsessed
with this case?

429
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,925
I can't let Lee Changwoo die in prison.

430
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,425
So why?

431
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:23,095
I know that he's innocent.

432
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:29,945
MS. KWON: <i>What? He sneaked around where?</i>

433
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,525
Mr. Minjo's room?

434
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:36,905
Yes, but Ms. Hyesoo
showed up at that time.

435
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:38,655
And?

436
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,495
He just said
he was looking around the house.

437
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,035
And she believed him?

438
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,505
She didn't say much.

439
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,255
(growls)

440
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,715
So annoying.

441
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,425
I'm getting this ominous feeling.

442
00:29:57,635 --> 00:30:00,765
Leave it up to me.
I'll always have my eye on him.

443
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:05,855
MS. KWON: Put one down.

444
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,475
You got me a bunch of empty intel.

445
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,355
Now have some conscience.

446
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:13,905
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:22,705
Oh, I wonder if this could be useful.

448
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:24,365
Go ahead and tell me.

449
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:28,335
Ms. Hyesoo often loses her ring
while she tends the garden.

450
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:31,875
So she got herself
a portable metal detector.

451
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:38,885
MS. OH:
<i>And it detected metal in his left hand.</i>

452
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,635
WOOSIN: Oh, it's the metal pin.

453
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:43,635
He has a metal pin in his finger.

454
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,015
What about it?

455
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:49,765
When a new hire joins the house,
they have their medical records checked

456
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:52,065
in case they'd cause harm to the chairman.

457
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:55,905
But I didn't hear anything
about his surgery.

458
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,445
Hmm.

459
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:00,365
If he'd had surgery, I'd be aware of it.

460
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:03,615
Every medical record is reported to me.

461
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:05,665
Exactly.

462
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:09,245
Because it's directly connected
to the chairman's well-being.

463
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,545
(door closes)

464
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:20,755
Look at this guy.

465
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:30,225
WOOSIN: <i>A modern and sophisticated
building structure.</i>

466
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,525
It should be similar to the first floor.

467
00:31:42,655 --> 00:31:44,115
The third floor remains.

468
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,085
Why did they leave this place as is?

469
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,255
The locked room on the third floor.

470
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:06,675
This drawing room.

471
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:10,435
And…

472
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:30,995
(cunning music)

473
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:42,175
WOOSIN: <i>If there's a hidden space in here…</i>

474
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,325
This raised floor…

475
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:15,205
There could be something
underneath the carpet.

476
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:33,895
(knocking on door)

477
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:43,445
What are you doing here?

478
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,575
I asked, what are you doing here?

479
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,465
We have an interview to do.

480
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:02,755
An interview?

481
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:07,215
Yesterday, you suggested an interview
around this time today.

482
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,015
Oh, right. I did.

483
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,855
Old age makes me forgetful.

484
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,405
(beeps)

485
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:30,285
KWON: The beginning of Haesong…

486
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,285
I can't leave out this person.

487
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,955
You mean your grandfather, the founder?

488
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,875
He was a born businessman.

489
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,715
He founded a munitions factory in Japan
when he wasn't even 30.

490
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,965
The arrowhead logo that we use today

491
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,595
was used since the beginning.

492
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,175
I see.

493
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,845
Was Haesong faced with any crises?

494
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,805
It's the 80th anniversary this year.

495
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:01,145
KWON (chuckles):
Of course, it wasn't smooth sailing.

496
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,935
So many people criticized the group

497
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,985
for being pro-Japanese.

498
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:08,655
Oh, I briefly remember the boycott.

499
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:12,785
It was certainly tough even for Haesong.

500
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:14,825
So…

501
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:17,575
I came up with a game changer.

502
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:21,045
Inspired by the logo,

503
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,755
I made the Adamas

504
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:28,675
and declared it the symbol of Haesong.

505
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,095
What a move.

506
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:37,095
DISCLOSURE CEREMONY OF ADAMAS,
THE SYMBOL OF HAESONG

507
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,765
(people applauding)

508
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:41,265
KWON: Adamas.

509
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,315
I got the name from a Greek word

510
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,895
that's cognate with diamond.

511
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,945
It means "unable to conquer."

512
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:54,615
This diamond arrow…

513
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:02,455
will be the symbol of Haesong.

514
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,045
(people applauding, cheering)

515
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,915
WOOSIN:
<i>The most expensive arrow in the world</i>

516
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,715
<i>quickly became the center of attention.</i>

517
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,675
It turned the tables.

518
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:16,595
The boycott was no longer their interest.

519
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:21,305
The arrowhead itself is a 300-carat
diamond worth tens of billions of won.

520
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,395
It naturally caught attention.

521
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,485
I didn't know there was
such a story behind Adamas.

522
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:32,155
You haven't shown it ever since.
When are you planning to do it?

523
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,115
When my time is over…

524
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:39,245
The day I retire,
I will hand it over to my son.

525
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:41,415
Like a crown?

526
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:43,495
He has to inherit the symbol of Haesong

527
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:45,955
for him to be its rightful owner.

528
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:48,925
Oh, I see.

529
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:55,595
I wanted to see it for the memoir writing.

530
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:01,055
Do you want to see it?

531
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:03,605
Pardon?

532
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:21,955
KWON: What do you think?

533
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:26,165
Isn't it splendid yet graceful?

534
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:28,755
Right.

535
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:33,545
I can't wait to see it in the flesh.
Just the picture is already imposing.

536
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:37,465
(chuckles)

537
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,685
Well, we will see.

538
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:43,225
Maybe there will be a chance next time.

539
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:50,315
Next time?
That's an indirect way to say no.

540
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,745
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

541
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,245
I noticed something strange.

542
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:08,585
What do you mean?

543
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,165
I looked around the mansion today.

544
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:16,005
The sculpture on the third floor,
it seemed quite extraordinary.

545
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:20,845
You know the Italian sculptor, Casas?

546
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,305
It's his artwork.

547
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:24,475
Oh, that's why.

548
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,355
The office room there
hasn't been extended, unlike the others.

549
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,395
Because it's worth
being preserved as it is.

550
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:33,945
The building was extended around the place

551
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:36,865
as it was maintained unaffected.

552
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,575
It's a piece of artwork.

553
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:42,205
And the chairman cherishes it.

554
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:43,655
I see.

555
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:45,285
Excuse me then.

556
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:47,285
By the way…

557
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,875
Is there another strange matter?

558
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:50,835
Yes.

559
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:53,505
You've been following me.

560
00:38:56,335 --> 00:39:00,135
Me? I think you're mistaken.

561
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,635
Can you say the same to the chairman?

562
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:09,145
Is Ms. Kwon behind it?

563
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,065
(Ms. Kwon clicks tongue)

564
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,695
I apologize.

565
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:16,985
MS. KWON: Do you remember, Ms. Oh?

566
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:20,195
That clumsy fool
who couldn't even do her job.

567
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:27,875
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

568
00:39:32,255 --> 00:39:35,335
MR. CHOI: <i>Flocoumafen was found
in her body. That's rat poison.</i>

569
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:46,185
Is there something you want to say?

570
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:48,975
-I don't understand.
-MS. KWON: What don't you understand?

571
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,725
Why you're watching me.

572
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:53,895
I'm just doing my job. If you have nothing
to hide, what's the problem with it?

573
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,355
-Ms. Kwon.
-Earlier, Mr. Choi said

574
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:00,025
that you behaved suspiciously
in the woods.

575
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,785
I couldn't stay still.

576
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,995
I've talked to the chairman about it.

577
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,825
Oh, no.

578
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:11,585
You may have softened him up,
but you can't do the same with me.

579
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:13,795
I like to test the waters, you see.

580
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:17,295
Ms. Kwon.

581
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,255
You see,

582
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:24,515
I want to be on great terms with you.

583
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:25,465
(clears throat)

584
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,475
-WOOSIN: But…
-But?

585
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:32,395
If you make me uncomfortable,
I can be just as aggressive.

586
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,475
Is that a threat?

587
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,315
Of course not. I'm asking you for a favor.

588
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,355
Your interest in me

589
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,065
is quite a nuisance.

590
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:49,995
That arrogant jerk.

591
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,245
Ms. Kwon, I--

592
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:54,295
Bring Ms. Yoon over.

593
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:55,875
Yes, ma'am.

594
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:09,885
Are you going somewhere?

595
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:20,985
She's going out alone
without the chairman.

596
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:24,485
It must be Ms. Kwon's order.

597
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:37,545
CHIEF JEONG:
<i>A group rally is to take place</i>

598
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,955
<i>in favor of the death penalty
this weekend.</i>

599
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:41,925
The bereaved have been recruited
and TV cameras will be there.

600
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:45,045
Okay, that's going to be one nice story.

601
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,255
Have Candidate Hwang give a speech.

602
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:48,845
His thigh hasn't fully--

603
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:49,765
Hey.

604
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:52,345
He should fight through it.

605
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,605
He can't be President for free.

606
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:57,145
Understood, sir.

607
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,315
-(door opens)
-MANAGER LEE: Sir.

608
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,565
Be careful not to trip. What is it?

609
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:04,945
-We got a call from outside.
-A call?

610
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,155
A call from outside
can only mean one thing.

611
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:09,945
What's the case number?

612
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:12,865
WONJOONG: You told me before.

613
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,665
That if something happened in the future,

614
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,415
I should dial
my resident registration number here.

615
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,965
That I'd be able to reach you anytime.

616
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:23,545
WOMAN: Tell me what kind of help you need.

617
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:26,965
WONJOONG:
<i>The victim's son visited me today.</i>

618
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:31,055
I feigned ignorance
and he left without saying much, but…

619
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:34,395
WOMAN: <i>Your request has been submitted.
Please go home and wait.</i>

620
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:36,685
Wait, I didn't do anything wrong.

621
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,185
I had no idea he'd come
after all this time.

622
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:44,405
Please… Please don't harass me
or my family again.

623
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:47,025
-(dial tone)
-Hello?

624
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:49,025
Hello?

625
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,495
Please…

626
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,585
Don't harass my family…

627
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:02,715
TEAM LEADER LEE:
<i>Witnesses are always a problem.</i>

628
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,255
Kim Wonjoong, the witness
in Lee Changwoo's case.

629
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:10,255
(sighs)
His wife was so pretty.

630
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:12,675
Should we come up with a scenario?

631
00:43:13,595 --> 00:43:15,305
We must respond by the book.

632
00:43:16,725 --> 00:43:18,475
-Okay.
-Joonho.

633
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:20,605
-Yes?
-Let me borrow your tie.

634
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:21,975
Oh.

635
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:27,565
The victim's son came to see him.

636
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:30,945
What a devoted son.

637
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:34,575
Hustling around to see
what's behind his father's death.

638
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,455
But that could lead him
to die young just like his father.

639
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:39,245
Right?

640
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:47,425
My gosh!
Let's say I lied about the whole thing.

641
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:49,215
What about Lee Changwoo?

642
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,555
He confessed that he murdered your father!

643
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,015
It's a mess the more I dig into it.

644
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:01,315
If he was framed, why did he confess?

645
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:03,975
Why?

646
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,775
-Hey.
-Oh, my goodness.

647
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:12,155
If it isn't the alpha dog,
Mr. Song Suhyeon.

648
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:15,365
You've done enough, so stop teasing me.

649
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,995
I'm just grateful.

650
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:18,245
For what?

651
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,835
Thanks. I was given the case
because you turned it down.

652
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:23,375
The Kangchun case.

653
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:25,545
Wow, congrats.

654
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,215
I get to jump on a bandwagon
thanks to you.

655
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:31,295
Will I get a box full of cash
this coming Chuseok holiday?

656
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:32,715
From Candidate Hwang?

657
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,765
Come on, the money comes
from the financier.

658
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,305
The financier?

659
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,805
You know who's backing him.

660
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:41,395
-Haesong?
-Yes.

661
00:44:42,395 --> 00:44:46,025
Gosh, you are so proud
talking about something so filthy.

662
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,075
That rude punk.

663
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:11,085
HAESONG GROUP
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEES AWARD CEREMONY

664
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:19,725
(audience applauding)

665
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:23,895
HAESONG GROUP
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEES AWARD CEREMONY

666
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,115
Everyone,

667
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,455
have you heard of the phrase,
company livestock?

668
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:46,295
Domestic animals are called livestock.

669
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:49,295
And office workers are called
company livestock

670
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,215
for they are raised in a company.

671
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,545
I do not agree with this phrase.

672
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:59,215
You are never company livestock.

673
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:03,145
Then what is your identity?

674
00:46:03,685 --> 00:46:06,065
You are guests.

675
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:10,895
Guests who deserve hospitable treatment.

676
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:15,615
Let me take this chance
to make one thing clear.

677
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:17,525
Those who force you to be loyal

678
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:20,785
and to have a sense of ownership.
They are all frauds.

679
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:23,865
You don't own the company,
so how could you?

680
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:27,585
Throw away all those remarks in the trash.

681
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:36,425
You just have to work your salary's worth.

682
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:41,385
This means, you have to get paid
as much as you work,

683
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,385
and if it doesn't satisfy you,

684
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:46,605
you can throw the company out.

685
00:46:46,685 --> 00:46:47,515
(laughter)

686
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:52,315
You work for Haesong,

687
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:54,485
and the executives' duty

688
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,235
is to make sure

689
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,365
you can work conveniently.

690
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:04,155
Please stay with Haesong for a long time.

691
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:09,665
I will serve you as the rightful guests.

692
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:16,045
(audience applauding)

693
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:30,355
(cackling)

694
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,275
Wow.

695
00:47:34,525 --> 00:47:38,405
Digging into his father's murder case
from 22 years ago!

696
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:45,655
Even a TV show would be criticized
for having such a story.

697
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:47,115
It's too much.

698
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,325
Tell me about it.

699
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:53,335
So the son came to visit the witness?

700
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,625
-(sighs)
-Why are they so pathetic?

701
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:01,255
Obsessed with the past,
they can't move on.

702
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,805
That's why their lives are miserable.

703
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:07,095
The Heukseok-dong shaman
told me to be careful.

704
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:08,765
This was it.

705
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:12,225
(sighs)
You have a scenario?

706
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,815
It's ready.

707
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:19,695
KIM WONJOONG, IM JISOOK
DISAPPEARANCE SCENARIO

708
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,365
HYUNJO: What a pathetic father.

709
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:26,455
He just had to pass down
something like this.

710
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:29,825
Not bad.

711
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:32,835
Then should we proceed accordingly?

712
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:37,085
Oh, please.

713
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,255
If I say okay here,

714
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:43,965
I'd be abetting murder.

715
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:51,605
Take care of it

716
00:48:52,185 --> 00:48:54,145
solely based on your decision.

717
00:48:57,355 --> 00:48:58,445
Yes, sir.

718
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:11,205
(line ringing)

719
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:13,785
Stand by, Mr. Jung.
We're making a move tonight.

720
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,795
Gather up. We have an order to carry out.

721
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:28,805
CHIEF JEONG: <i>What's the target's routine?</i>

722
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:30,975
They take a walk at 3 p.m. every day.

723
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:33,765
CHIEF JEONG:
Wouldn't that be in broad daylight?

724
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:35,935
There's a secluded place along the route.

725
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,645
It's a blind spot with no CCTV cameras.

726
00:49:37,815 --> 00:49:39,395
CHIEF JEONG: I see, here at 3:40 p.m.

727
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:41,315
EMPLOYEE 1:
From there to the nearby mountain.

728
00:49:41,405 --> 00:49:43,025
Mr. Kang is checking the area right now.

729
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:44,065
CHIEF JEONG: And the clear-out team?

730
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,025
EMPLOYEE 2:
They will be standing by on time.

731
00:49:46,325 --> 00:49:48,365
CHIEF JEONG: Okay. Let's get it right.

732
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:49,705
MEN: Yes, sir.

733
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:55,585
(helicopter whirring)

734
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:09,385
WOOSIN: <i>Why aren't they showing up
after sending me the letter?</i>

735
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,765
DONGRIM: I saw a beautiful woman earlier
during the day.

736
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:15,475
I hear she's the chairman's secretary.
She's totally my type.

737
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:16,975
She's Osan style.

738
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:20,855
You see, my mom's my ideal woman
and she's from Osan.

739
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:25,905
What are you doing?

740
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:30,825
Mr. Ha, what are you doing?

741
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:33,535
An assignment.

742
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:35,705
I see.

743
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,505
Then I'll go work on an assignment too.

744
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,675
(sighs)
Who on earth could it be?

745
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:51,015
(helicopter whirring)

746
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:07,195
Good evening.

747
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:13,455
Oh, that woman.

748
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:15,995
The Osan-style lady.

749
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:29,595
(panting)

750
00:51:29,675 --> 00:51:31,595
She walks so fast.

751
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,475
Excuse me.

752
00:51:34,935 --> 00:51:36,895
Did I startle you? I'm sorry.

753
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:38,975
I didn't mean to scare you.

754
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,975
I kept calling you, but you didn't answer.

755
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:45,355
I'm Lee Dongrim.

756
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:47,485
The memoir writer's pupil.

757
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,785
I'll be writing my book soon too.

758
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:55,575
I hope we get along.

759
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:02,335
(Dongrim gasps)

760
00:52:03,335 --> 00:52:06,045
She's an Ice Queen. How cool.

761
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:13,555
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER

762
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:16,265
Thank you. I asked you to do this
because I could trust you.

763
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:18,765
My suspicion will be resolved now.

764
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,515
If he had surgery,
I should be aware of it.

765
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,025
And if he lied, for what reason…

766
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,235
-(knocking on door)
-(door opens)

767
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:33,325
-Ms. Kwon.
-Talk to me later.

768
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:37,285
NAME: SONG WOOSIN

769
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:39,325
OPEN FRACTURE IN LEFT HAND

770
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:46,295
What…

771
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:48,965
The chairman wants to see you.

772
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,965
-The master?
-Yes, right now.

773
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,135
Right now? Why?

774
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:54,885
I'm not sure.

775
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:00,975
If you make me uncomfortable,
I can be just as aggressive.

776
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,565
That little…

777
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:13,115
How could you?

778
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:16,035
You suggested an amicable relationship
just to stab me in the back!

779
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:19,615
-Stab you in the back?
-You told on me to the master!

780
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:24,245
I don't know what this is about,
and I'm not even interested. It's not me.

781
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:26,335
Stop suspecting me for nothing.

782
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,005
If I don't stop, what will you do?

783
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:31,885
I was being patient out of courtesy,
but don't expect more.

784
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:33,135
Don't be patient.

785
00:53:33,215 --> 00:53:35,965
Let's fight and see
how long you can take my beating.

786
00:53:36,055 --> 00:53:37,805
I could be the one beating you.

787
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,975
(growls)

788
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,015
You're no match for me.

789
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:47,815
Are you proud
because the master likes you?

790
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:50,275
He likes me? I didn't know that.

791
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:51,605
Don't delude yourself.

792
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,315
It's not because he adores you.

793
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:55,865
He's just reminded of Mr. Minjo!

794
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:01,075
Mr. Minjo?

795
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:03,915
That's none of your business.

796
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:05,995
The one who died in a helicopter accident.

797
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,465
Do I have a resemblance to him?

798
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:17,965
That smile.

799
00:54:18,595 --> 00:54:23,055
That disgusting smile.
It's as if you see through me.

800
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:27,395
Seeing how you hate me,
I guess you didn't--

801
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:30,395
Don't smirk. You know nothing!

802
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:33,985
It's just drawing my attention.

803
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:36,315
Even more because I look like him.

804
00:54:37,615 --> 00:54:40,865
(breathing heavily)

805
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:49,335
WOOSIN: <i>It's just drawing my attention.</i>

806
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,375
<i>Even more because I look like him.</i>

807
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,215
More?

808
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:14,735
WOOSIN: "Eunkook Medical Center"?

809
00:55:24,365 --> 00:55:25,705
Was it you?

810
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,965
Ms. Kwon checked my surgery records.

811
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,555
I actually never got surgery.

812
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:47,435
Someone fabricated the record.

813
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:50,355
Director Eun Kyunggu
of Eunkook Medical Center.

814
00:55:50,435 --> 00:55:51,815
You're his only daughter, Ms. Eun.

815
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:54,605
I can assume why.

816
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:58,525
If they found out that I lied, they'd
figure out what I have in my left hand.

817
00:55:58,615 --> 00:56:00,695
Then they'd question
my actual purpose for coming here.

818
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,655
That could also put you in danger.

819
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:11,165
Because you're the one
who sent me the letter.

820
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:17,795
If not, why would you help me?

821
00:56:20,675 --> 00:56:22,635
You're right. It was me.

822
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:25,805
(thunder rumbles)

823
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:28,475
(rain pattering)

824
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:36,565
My assignment is finally complete.

825
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:43,985
You had Ms. Yoon
run an errand for you earlier today.

826
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:47,745
KWON: Don't look at her.

827
00:56:48,035 --> 00:56:50,625
Of course I noticed
my secretary's absence.

828
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:54,665
I apologize.
I had an urgent matter to tend to.

829
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,125
Your guess turned out to be wrong.

830
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,215
Leave Mr. Ha be.

831
00:57:00,135 --> 00:57:02,385
Sir, you shouldn't let him fool you.

832
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,345
You think I can be fooled?

833
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:07,975
That's not what I mean.

834
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:12,265
Mr. Choi said that the writer
seemed to be looking for someone.

835
00:57:12,355 --> 00:57:13,725
I only tried to figure out who--

836
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:14,975
KWON: Mr. Ha…

837
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,355
works for me.

838
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:21,315
Then why did you go into the woods?

839
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,485
I followed your daughter-in-law.

840
00:57:25,735 --> 00:57:26,695
Hyesoo?

841
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:30,415
I thought I'd use a coincidental encounter
to become acquainted with her.

842
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,495
What do you mean by that?

843
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,755
I'll accept your suggestion.

844
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,425
Yesterday, you said you wanted
to know what's on her mind

845
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,465
and asked me to tell you
everything she says.

846
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,215
That's what happened, so stay out of it.

847
00:57:49,305 --> 00:57:50,475
Master.

848
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,765
I said stop.

849
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:55,815
You and your suspicions are at it again!

850
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:56,855
That's not it.

851
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:03,275
I know you're being
overly generous to him.

852
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:06,985
I can assume why you chose him
to write your memoir.

853
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:10,035
His smile looks just like Mr. Minjo…

854
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:13,285
(groans)

855
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:16,415
I apologize.

856
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:20,045
I didn't mean to talk about him.

857
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,215
You've gotten old.

858
00:58:21,925 --> 00:58:23,295
Have you forgotten already?

859
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,425
The more you talk,

860
00:58:26,255 --> 00:58:27,595
the shorter you live.

861
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,475
(sobbing)

862
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,565
Ha Woosin…

863
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:46,195
WOOSIN: Now let me ask.

864
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,575
What you wrote in the letter.
How did you know?

865
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:57,085
(thunderclaps)

866
00:58:57,165 --> 00:58:58,915
HYESOO:
<i>Lee Changwoo is not the real culprit.</i>

867
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,465
<i>The missing murder weapon
is the symbol of Haesong.</i>

868
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:04,875
<i>The diamond arrow,</i>

869
00:59:05,715 --> 00:59:07,095
<i>Adamas.</i>

870
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:11,725
-(thunder rumbles)
-WOOSIN: <i>Ms. Eun?</i>

871
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:16,345
I heard about it.

872
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:18,265
From whom?

873
00:59:19,895 --> 00:59:20,975
My husband.

874
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:23,815
You mean Mr. Kwon Hyunjo?

875
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:26,985
GUARD: He's on the line, sir.

876
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:30,785
Hi, Mr. Lee.

877
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:34,285
About the scenario from earlier,

878
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:38,205
why don't we go with suicide
instead of disappearance?

879
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:42,335
That might seem more genuine.

880
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:44,715
WOOSIN: <i>Mr. Kwon told you?</i>

881
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:48,255
It was more like he rattled on.

882
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:55,515
Those flowers belong to him.

883
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,725
HYUNJO: I told you so.

884
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,315
My father…

885
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:06,775
(groans)
…killed someone with the Adamas.

886
01:00:08,315 --> 01:00:10,025
I heard him say that
and sent you the letter.

887
01:00:11,865 --> 01:00:12,905
Why?

888
01:00:13,495 --> 01:00:15,245
It has nothing to do with you.

889
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:17,115
That's not important right now.

890
01:00:19,455 --> 01:00:21,125
Why did you come to this place?

891
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:26,005
Answer me.

892
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,475
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

893
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:40,435
To reveal that it was used for the murder,

894
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:43,105
the autopsy result and Adamas
must be collated.

895
01:00:43,395 --> 01:00:44,775
Would Haesong cooperate?

896
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:46,315
No, never.

897
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,735
-Are you out of your mind?
-You need to help me.

898
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:51,825
-Why should I?
-You called me here.

899
01:00:53,155 --> 01:00:54,655
Soon after I got the letter,

900
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,865
I was offered
to ghostwrite the chairman's memoir.

901
01:00:57,205 --> 01:00:58,495
By coincidence?

902
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,875
Apparently, someone highly recommended me.

903
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,495
-Since you sent me the letter--
-It wasn't me.

904
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:06,045
I didn't recommend you.

905
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:09,715
-Then who…
-That's the problem.

906
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:14,255
Nothing happens by coincidence here.

907
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,765
