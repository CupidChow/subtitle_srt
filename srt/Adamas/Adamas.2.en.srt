1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,006
(theme music)

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,379
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,845
WOOSIN: <i>The symbol of Haesong Group.</i>

5
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,682
<i>The arrow with a diamond tip.</i>

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,977
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

7
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,522
You're insane. How?

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,024
What if there's someone helping me?

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,778
WOOSIN: <i>Somebody…</i>

10
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>invited me to this mansion.</i>

11
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,078
Who do you think recommended
that I ghostwrite Chairman Kwon's memoir?

12
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,958
Does that person know about me?

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,418
Probably not.

14
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,046
We haven't met each other yet.

15
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,759
Then I guess I'll be safe
if I keep your mouth shut.

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,682
I couldn't stick to being good
in order to gain their trust.

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,727
I had to dirty my hands.

18
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,355
You're going to shoot me?

19
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,856
If needed.

20
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,192
Accidents are common when hunting.

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,944
What will you do about the witness?

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,579
What are you two doing there?

23
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,376
Oh, hello.

24
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,796
This is a little flustering, right?

25
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,339
Yes, very much.

26
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,056
I think this needs to be reported.

27
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,059
MS. KWON: <i>Mr. Choi?</i>

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,817
He was pointing a gun at Mr. Ha?

29
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,944
Why?

30
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,368
MR. CHOI:
<i>I came across suspicious behavior.</i>

31
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,705
I sensed the presence of someone
while hunting,

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,625
and some stranger was looking around
when I checked.

33
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,626
As if…

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
he was looking for someone.

35
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,507
So I pointed my gun at him
to identify him.

36
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,093
And it turned out to be Mr. Ha.

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,848
Ms. Eun saw us
and got the wrong idea, I presume.

38
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,559
It seemed like he was looking for someone?

39
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,477
In my eyes, yes.

40
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,522
What do you think, Hyesoo?

41
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,941
You must've seen something.

42
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,402
I'm not sure.

43
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,529
What I saw was

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,908
him pointing his gun at Mr. Ha.

45
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,993
Not what happened before and after.

46
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,205
But Mr. Choi,

47
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,833
he didn't seem suspicious at all to me.

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,837
HYESOO: What could he have been doing?

49
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,549
In that open space in broad daylight.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,512
-That's--
-KWON: What should we do?

51
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,848
Two people are giving different stories

52
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,392
about the same situation.

53
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,771
So one of you must be lying.

54
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,525
It seems to me that Mr. Choi was mistaken.

55
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,693
(door opens)

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,445
MS. KWON: Mistaken?

57
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,073
Mr. Choi isn't the kind of person
to point his gun at someone

58
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,492
because of a misunderstanding.

59
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,706
I apologize for the rushed interruption.

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,419
No, it's fine.
Let me hear your side of the story.

61
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,215
Then I will tell you.

62
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,635
I'd like to know why
they were in the woods.

63
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,388
Mr. Choi went to hunt.
What about you, Ms. Hyesoo?

64
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,099
I went to get some
golden-rayed lilies for the garden.

65
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,142
These.

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,813
What about you, Mr. Ha?

67
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,899
If you weren't looking for someone
like Mr. Choi thought, why?

68
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,739
Why aren't you saying anything?

69
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,660
KWON: Mr. Ha.

70
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,705
You're making Mr. Choi's story
more plausible.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,503
Sir, you shouldn't
let this slide so easily.

72
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,171
We need to get to the bottom of this--

73
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,089
I will tell you.

74
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,265
Sir, may I speak with you
in private first?

75
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,351
One of us here might find
what I say uncomfortable.

76
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,354
(tense music)

77
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,695
(sighs)

78
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,537
Ms. Hyesoo.

79
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,124
Don't get close to the writer.

80
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,793
I have a leery feeling about him,
and I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,550
You're worried about me?

82
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,719
That's very unusual.

83
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,680
Maybe it's time you leave this world.

84
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,270
That rude witch…

85
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,482
What happened?

86
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,195
It's just as I told the chairman.
I spotted someone suspicious,

87
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,866
-and he…
-So what about him was suspicious?

88
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,785
Why can't you read between the lines?

89
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,288
(grunts)
He was glancing about, and I wondered

90
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,332
if he was looking for someone.

91
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,084
Looking for someone? Who?

92
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,673
Ms. Kwon, I could've
jumped to conclusions.

93
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,300
You can't change your words now!

94
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,763
Anyway, he did seem suspicious.

95
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,142
His eyes gave me a strange feeling
from the beginning.

96
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,063
Why on earth did he come to Haesong?

97
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,526
You know why. To ghostwrite…

98
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,027
No, that's not it.

99
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,989
Money can't move the likes of him.

100
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,700
I know very well about those lowlifes
who do anything for money.

101
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,162
It doesn't feel right.

102
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,875
You must have good reason
to have such an idea,

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,337
but the chairman wouldn't let
just anyone into Haesong.

104
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922
And if there was a problem with him,

105
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,758
the chairman wouldn't be that fond of him.

106
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,343
Fond?
(scoffs)

107
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,180
If he wanted money
or anything else from the master,

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,849
he would've tried to win me over first.

109
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,392
Because I'm the gate to the master!

110
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,562
Everyone did so. Even assemblymen
and the Public Prosecutor General.

111
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
But that weasel skipped me.

112
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,693
Ma'am, don't worry.

113
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,528
I'll keep an eye on him.

114
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,283
I know he has an ulterior motive.

115
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,960
Now that everyone else is gone,
you can speak to me.

116
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,590
I believe it's the difference
in how you interpret it.

117
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,175
The difference in how you interpret it?

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,052
Yes, Mr. Choi had a misjudgment.

119
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,431
He has doubts about everything
because it's his job.

120
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,475
And that probably affected
his interpretation.

121
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,897
Depending on your occupation,
you have a different way

122
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,690
of expressing your memory.

123
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,692
Thus, instead of the facts,

124
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,236
he interpreted his emotion of that time
as a memory.

125
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,033
Let's say he did.

126
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,913
Then why did you go into the woods?

127
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,374
MS. KWON: <i>A walk?</i>

128
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
(scoffs)

129
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,463
He went there alone for a walk?
And you believe him?

130
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,215
What's not to believe?

131
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,550
I do that too, from time to time.

132
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,385
But, master. Mr. Choi--

133
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,356
WOOSIN: <i>Mr. Choi.</i>

134
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,487
Make this your last test.

135
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,992
-What test?
-Whether I expose your identity.

136
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,911
You made a big deal out of it
to check that.

137
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,789
You're pretty quick-witted.

138
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,749
I guess you survived.

139
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,377
Don't go too far though.
I won't take it next time.

140
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
Think about my situation.

141
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,174
I couldn't trust you enough
to go easy on you.

142
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,509
I kept my promise.

143
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,553
Exclude me
from the security system right now.

144
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,929
I never gave you my word.

145
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,682
And excluding you isn't a simple matter.

146
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,392
Instead, I'll give you a tip.

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,770
-A tip?
-Beware of Ms. Kwon.

148
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
She's like a guard dog.

149
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,024
She easily gets suspicious.

150
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,528
On top of that, she has a nasty hobby.

151
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,282
MR. CHOI: <i>You know that one of the maids
was taken to the hospital unconscious.</i>

152
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,325
<i>Flocoumafen was found in her body.</i>

153
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,536
That's rat poison.

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,538
It was the third time.

155
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,416
Good luck.

156
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,214
Will you be okay if your cover gets blown?

157
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,055
Then what? Do you think
I'll just sit back and watch it happen?

158
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,184
I could expose that
some thief is after the Adamas.

159
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,395
And that he has an accomplice.

160
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,981
You have my weakness?

161
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,734
I have your weakness too.

162
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,238
You know what?

163
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,908
Hands and feet are tricky
to control subconsciously.

164
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,329
But in this adverse situation,
your hands are in your pockets.

165
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,164
That means you're feeling anxious.

166
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,043
(sighs)

167
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,553
Are you certain that
the Adamas is in this house?

168
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,610
It's here.

169
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,657
Because its owner is here.

170
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,718
(grunting)

171
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,808
I don't know
how he sweet-talked the master,

172
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,810
but he can't fool me.

173
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,523
DONGRIM: Will you keep this up?
I already know everything.

174
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,649
WOOSIN: About what?

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,943
DONGRIM: About why you chose to come here.

176
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,612
I know what your true intentions are.

177
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,489
What do you mean?

178
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,033
DONGRIM:
You'd be insane to ghostwrite for someone.

179
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,868
WOOSIN: What are you getting at?

180
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,913
DONGRIM: You're preparing for your
next book, and it's about conglomerates.

181
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,626
You're here for research purposes.
We're in the same boat.

182
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,422
That darn rat.

183
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,885
DIRECTOR: <i>Revise it.</i>

184
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,845
Excuse me?

185
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,556
Revise the article.

186
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,141
Why?

187
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,645
It's like a perfect piece of art
that follows 5W1H.

188
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,856
I put all my skills
into writing this article.

189
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,276
Hey, I can't tell Newscaster Cha
to criticize Candidate Hwang.

190
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,944
Why not?

191
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,447
It's not like I'm asking him
to literally attack him.

192
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,700
He better quit being a newscaster
if he's bothered to say a few words.

193
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,744
-He will quit.
-What?

194
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,871
He's been nominated to be a spokesman.

195
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,664
Don't get in your senior's way.

196
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,335
Are you kidding me?

197
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,338
You guys are just ridiculous.

198
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,717
Darn them.

199
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,305
What a load of crap.

200
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,979
(phone buzzing)

201
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,735
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

202
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,032
Hello?

203
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,953
GOVERNOR HWANG'S CONTROVERSIAL HANDLING
OF MOUNT GYEONGWON LANDSLIDE

204
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,624
REPORTER KIM SEOHEE

205
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,752
What is this?

206
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,963
To understand someone,
you must look into their past first.

207
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,090
SUHYEON: These are your past articles.

208
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,469
You targeted Candidate Hwang quite often.

209
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,681
Just be direct.

210
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,059
It's pathetic to beat around the bush.

211
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,356
Is it your passionate sense of justice
that's making you cover my father's case?

212
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,565
(scoffs)

213
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
No, I'm just awfully nosy.

214
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,487
Or you're anti-campaigning
against Candidate Hwang.

215
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,156
You want to stop his approval ratings
from hiking.

216
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,741
Lee Changwoo has to be innocent

217
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,536
so Candidate Hwang loses trust
for supporting the death penalty system.

218
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,205
You're using the death-row inmate
to draw attention

219
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,874
and make Candidate Hwang hit rock bottom.

220
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,586
So you're sure about
the missing weapon now?

221
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,677
I admit it. But then, it's strange.

222
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,763
Just who took the murder weapon?

223
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,682
You may think
the real culprit is someone else.

224
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,726
But the crucial evidence proves it wrong.

225
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,645
The witness. Oh, dear.

226
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,272
He even testified in court.

227
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:22,152
I saw the two of them
enter the house that night.

228
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,281
The victim was angry.

229
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,867
He demanded Lee pay off his debt.

230
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,954
PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, the victim visited
Lee Changwoo at his house

231
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,749
to claim his rightful payment.

232
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,418
Then after an argument, he was murdered.

233
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,754
And you still think
Lee Changwoo was framed?

234
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,882
What if the witness committed perjury?

235
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
On what grounds?

236
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,802
The witness even described
Lee Changwoo's attire.

237
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,638
PROSECUTOR:
You've seen this jacket before, correct?

238
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,392
Yes.

239
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,604
Lee Changwoo was wearing it.

240
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,939
PROSECUTOR:
The accused was wearing this jacket

241
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,524
when he got arrested at the crime scene.

242
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,859
I will submit it as evidence.

243
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,946
SEOHEE: <i>That witness
has a red-green color deficiency.</i>

244
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,701
Don't say he could differentiate
red and green at night.

245
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,455
It should've been considered
during the investigation.

246
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,040
He had a driver's license.

247
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,004
That means he's not colorblind,
so they may not have known.

248
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,716
How did you find out?

249
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,263
I met him.

250
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,223
Let's go.

251
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,809
Where is he?

252
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
(solemn music)

253
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,632
A room that no one enters or leaves.

254
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,888
Should I get the wrong idea
about what you just did?

255
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,602
I was admiring the unique interior design.

256
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,730
I only meant to peep but you caught me.

257
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,983
Let me apologize. Excuse me.

258
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,818
Just like what happened with Mr. Choi,

259
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
you're causing yourself
to be misunderstood.

260
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,740
I'll be careful from now on.

261
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,617
(device beeps)

262
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,705
That's strange. I thought I turned it off.

263
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,710
HYESOO: It's a portable metal detector.

264
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,425
WOOSIN: Oh, it's the metal pin.

265
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,260
I got surgery on my finger
when I was little.

266
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,303
I see.

267
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,388
You're carrying something quite unusual.

268
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,725
I keep losing my ring
when I tend the garden.

269
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,977
HYESOO: It was the seventh time today.

270
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,937
WOOSIN: I see.
That ring must mean a lot to you.

271
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,023
It doesn't seem so special,

272
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,941
but you look for it
every time you lose it.

273
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,236
Did I just cross a line?

274
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,197
Yes, I feel offended.

275
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,741
Oh. Let me apologize again.

276
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,162
Please think of it
as an occupational habit.

277
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,290
It's just that psychologists
find people so interesting--

278
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,458
You're flustered.

279
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,627
Pardon?

280
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,423
There's no need to explain.
I'll accept your apology.

281
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,808
Right, I was flustered and rambled on.

282
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,228
(suspenseful music)

283
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,576
(door closes)

284
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,790
WOOSIN: It was the only locked room.

285
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,547
What could be inside?

286
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,802
(alarm beeping)

287
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,097
-What's that?
-An alarm.

288
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,643
It's time to take my pills.
I set an alarm to remind myself.

289
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,646
What pills? Nutritional supplements?

290
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,858
I'm very attentive
to maintaining my health these days.

291
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,945
Do you even know what they're for?

292
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,321
Of course.

293
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,993
Omega-3. Milk thistle.

294
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,119
DONGRIM: And vitamin K.

295
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,960
If you share your pills with someone,
they won't be as effective.

296
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,503
I won't take them.

297
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,464
It's not like
I don't want to share them with you.

298
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,675
You're healthy enough already,

299
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,387
and taking these could make you
live unnecessarily long.

300
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,518
Come to think of it,
our boss is never wrong.

301
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,729
Ms. Yeo? What did she say?

302
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,776
That your words call for a beating.

303
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,613
Well, I'm kind of like that.

304
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,240
-Guess what?
-Whatever.

305
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,160
There's a treasure in this mansion.

306
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
Adamas.

307
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,179
You knew that, old man?

308
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,224
I guess we took the same taxi.
He told me the same thing.

309
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,184
-Could it be real?
-What if it is?

310
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,852
It should belong to the one who finds it.

311
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,521
I was good at treasure hunting
ever since I was little.

312
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,900
My know-how is to see the forest,
not the trees.

313
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,361
DONGRIM: Looking from afar…

314
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,862
I spotted a beauty right away.

315
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,331
Where are you going?
The study is this way.

316
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,042
Is he playing hooky again?

317
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,010
"See the forest, not the trees,"
says Lee Dongrim.

318
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,431
The house itself is too high
for a three-story building.

319
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,557
Besides,

320
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,185
it was extended.

321
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,105
Except for that place.

322
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,113
(birds chirping)

323
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,858
(eerie music)

324
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,006
(beeping)

325
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,348
MAN: His real name is Song Woosin.

326
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,516
His pen name is Ha Woosin
with his mother's surname.

327
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,101
So he blackmailed you?

328
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,728
MR. CHOI: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

329
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,146
He seems normal

330
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,648
and has a decent job,
yet he enjoys danger.

331
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,108
What does he want?

332
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,943
He wants to steal the Adamas.

333
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,695
MR. CHOI: <i>The diamond arrow.</i>

334
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,198
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS
HAESONG ADAMAS

335
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,451
THE MOST EXPENSIVE DIAMOND ARROW
IN THE WORLD, ADAMAS

336
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,788
MAN:
He's even gutsy. That thing is priceless.

337
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,623
Then again,

338
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,543
he blackmailed a police officer
so he could steal it.

339
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,753
He's more than just ordinary.

340
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,256
Taesung, this is tricky.

341
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,009
<i>If we try to do something about him,</i>

342
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,594
your identity could be exposed.

343
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,972
Sir, this isn't the time to calculate.

344
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,600
MR. CHOI: <i>That writer's reckless behavior</i>

345
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,477
could take us all down.

346
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,773
Are you going to risk our project
over this one thief?

347
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,943
Of course not.

348
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,991
Ha Woosin or whatever his name is.
Do whatever it takes to get rid of him.

349
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,203
MAN: <i>That way, we can get him
to confess to how he got your info.</i>

350
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,579
SONG WOOSIN

351
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,501
How dare this punk
try to pull a trick on our turf?

352
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,338
(doorbell rings)

353
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,509
Anyone home?

354
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,680
WONJOONG: Who are you?

355
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,980
My name is Song Suhyeon.

356
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,482
And?

357
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,236
I'm Song Soonho's son.

358
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,658
So you remember.

359
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,675
(water pouring)

360
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,185
I apologize for coming unannounced.

361
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,478
You must be quite surprised.

362
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
I won't deny it.

363
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,151
But what brings you here?

364
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,863
You see,

365
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,032
I'm a prosecutor.

366
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,158
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

367
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,953
I looked into my father's case again
and I had some questions.

368
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,792
What questions?
The ruling has already been made.

369
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,419
Let me ask you one thing.

370
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,758
You testified that you saw Lee Changwoo
and my father that night.

371
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,760
You described Lee Changwoo too.

372
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,972
Yes, I did.

373
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,224
Why did you lie?

374
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,020
I lied? What are you talking about?

375
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,271
I have evidence.

376
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,236
It's a copy of the investigation record.

377
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,489
SUHYEON: Read the parts underlined in red.

378
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,916
"The witness testified
that the victim visited

379
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,876
-the accused's house--"
-No.

380
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,963
The parts underlined in red.

381
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,427
This one's in green.

382
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,637
INVESTIGATION PROGRESS

383
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,390
EVIDENCE REGARDING MAJOR SUSPICIONS

384
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,766
SUHYEON: This one's in red.

385
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,896
EVIDENCE 3 IS THE JACKET
THE ACCUSED WORE WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED

386
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,066
Well, you said the underlined--

387
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,277
I know you're blind to red and green.

388
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,241
Yet you saw the green jacket
with red patterns

389
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,827
that Lee Changwoo was wearing?

390
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,331
-That's…
-Look.

391
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,377
Sir.

392
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,964
Tell me the truth.

393
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,264
I'll stay until you give me an answer.

394
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,394
(sighs)

395
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,647
I did wrong.

396
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,192
The detectives showed me the picture
and said Lee Changwoo wore that jacket.

397
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,028
They asked me if I saw it.

398
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,405
I just ended up saying that I did.

399
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,658
It's true that I'm colorblind,

400
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,243
but I did see them.

401
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,372
WONJOONG: <i>I clearly saw them
enter the house together.</i>

402
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,209
<i>I parked my car across the road</i>

403
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>and was waiting for my wife.</i>

404
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,299
To support our family,

405
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,177
she used to work at a sewing factory
until late at night.

406
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,762
A family in those circumstances

407
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,974
happened to move into this apartment
after that testimony.

408
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,811
What do you mean by that?

409
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,191
We got this house with the compensation
from my wife's accident.

410
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,442
Compensation?

411
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,197
My gosh!
Let's say I lied about the whole thing.

412
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,948
What about Lee Changwoo?

413
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,369
He confessed that he murdered your father!

414
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,920
What can be done
about a case from 22 years ago?

415
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,589
You're a prosecutor,
so you should know better.

416
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,388
Don't come here ever again.
I have nothing more to say.

417
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,031
Did you know
that his wife got into an accident?

418
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,368
A car accident
five days before the testimony.

419
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,247
They were compensated
with an enormous amount of money.

420
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,708
They were threatened and compensated
at the same time?

421
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,588
SUHYEON: So he had no choice
but to accept the deal.

422
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,843
<i>In order to protect his family.</i>

423
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,430
Typical of a soap opera.

424
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,351
Ms. Kim.

425
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,606
This case happened 22 years ago,
and it's statute-barred.

426
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,985
Even if the real culprit gets caught,
they won't stand trial.

427
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,864
Nevertheless, this is meaningful to me
because I'm the victim's son.

428
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,535
But why are you so obsessed
with this case?

429
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,913
I can't let Lee Changwoo die in prison.

430
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,416
So why?

431
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,089
I know that he's innocent.

432
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,929
MS. KWON: <i>What? He sneaked around where?</i>

433
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,515
Mr. Minjo's room?

434
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,895
Yes, but Ms. Hyesoo
showed up at that time.

435
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,646
And?

436
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,485
He just said
he was looking around the house.

437
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,028
And she believed him?

438
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,490
She didn't say much.

439
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,241
(growls)

440
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
So annoying.

441
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,414
I'm getting this ominous feeling.

442
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,752
Leave it up to me.
I'll always have my eye on him.

443
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,840
MS. KWON: Put one down.

444
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,469
You got me a bunch of empty intel.

445
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,346
Now have some conscience.

446
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,890
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,690
Oh, I wonder if this could be useful.

448
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,359
Go ahead and tell me.

449
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,321
Ms. Hyesoo often loses her ring
while she tends the garden.

450
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,866
So she got herself
a portable metal detector.

451
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,873
MS. OH:
<i>And it detected metal in his left hand.</i>

452
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,626
WOOSIN: Oh, it's the metal pin.

453
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,628
He has a metal pin in his finger.

454
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,004
What about it?

455
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,759
When a new hire joins the house,
they have their medical records checked

456
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,053
in case they'd cause harm to the chairman.

457
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,890
But I didn't hear anything
about his surgery.

458
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,433
Hmm.

459
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,353
If he'd had surgery, I'd be aware of it.

460
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,606
Every medical record is reported to me.

461
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,650
Exactly.

462
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,237
Because it's directly connected
to the chairman's well-being.

463
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,539
(door closes)

464
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,748
Look at this guy.

465
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,216
WOOSIN: <i>A modern and sophisticated
building structure.</i>

466
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,518
It should be similar to the first floor.

467
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,105
The third floor remains.

468
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,075
Why did they leave this place as is?

469
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,245
The locked room on the third floor.

470
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,669
This drawing room.

471
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,423
And…

472
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,985
(cunning music)

473
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,163
WOOSIN: <i>If there's a hidden space in here…</i>

474
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,319
This raised floor…

475
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,196
There could be something
underneath the carpet.

476
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,881
(knocking on door)

477
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,433
What are you doing here?

478
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,564
I asked, what are you doing here?

479
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,450
We have an interview to do.

480
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,744
An interview?

481
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,206
Yesterday, you suggested an interview
around this time today.

482
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,004
Oh, right. I did.

483
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,840
Old age makes me forgetful.

484
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,393
(beeps)

485
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,271
KWON: The beginning of Haesong…

486
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,274
I can't leave out this person.

487
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,943
You mean your grandfather, the founder?

488
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,862
He was a born businessman.

489
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,700
He founded a munitions factory in Japan
when he wasn't even 30.

490
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,953
The arrowhead logo that we use today

491
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,581
was used since the beginning.

492
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
I see.

493
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,837
Was Haesong faced with any crises?

494
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,798
It's the 80th anniversary this year.

495
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:56,135
KWON (chuckles):
Of course, it wasn't smooth sailing.

496
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,929
So many people criticized the group

497
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,973
for being pro-Japanese.

498
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,643
Oh, I briefly remember the boycott.

499
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,772
It was certainly tough even for Haesong.

500
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,816
So…

501
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,568
I came up with a game changer.

502
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,030
Inspired by the logo,

503
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,743
I made the Adamas

504
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,663
and declared it the symbol of Haesong.

505
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,083
What a move.

506
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,088
DISCLOSURE CEREMONY OF ADAMAS,
THE SYMBOL OF HAESONG

507
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,756
(people applauding)

508
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,259
KWON: Adamas.

509
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,303
I got the name from a Greek word

510
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,889
that's cognate with diamond.

511
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,935
It means "unable to conquer."

512
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,605
This diamond arrow…

513
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,446
will be the symbol of Haesong.

514
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,032
(people applauding, cheering)

515
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,909
WOOSIN:
<i>The most expensive arrow in the world</i>

516
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,704
<i>quickly became the center of attention.</i>

517
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,665
It turned the tables.

518
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,586
The boycott was no longer their interest.

519
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,299
The arrowhead itself is a 300-carat
diamond worth tens of billions of won.

520
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,384
It naturally caught attention.

521
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,470
I didn't know there was
such a story behind Adamas.

522
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,143
You haven't shown it ever since.
When are you planning to do it?

523
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,104
When my time is over…

524
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,233
The day I retire,
I will hand it over to my son.

525
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,402
Like a crown?

526
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,487
He has to inherit the symbol of Haesong

527
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,948
for him to be its rightful owner.

528
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,910
Oh, I see.

529
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,583
I wanted to see it for the memoir writing.

530
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,047
Do you want to see it?

531
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
Pardon?

532
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,943
KWON: What do you think?

533
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,155
Isn't it splendid yet graceful?

534
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,741
Right.

535
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,537
I can't wait to see it in the flesh.
Just the picture is already imposing.

536
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,458
(chuckles)

537
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,670
Well, we will see.

538
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,214
Maybe there will be a chance next time.

539
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,304
Next time?
That's an indirect way to say no.

540
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,735
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

541
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,237
I noticed something strange.

542
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,572
What do you mean?

543
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,158
I looked around the mansion today.

544
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,997
The sculpture on the third floor,
it seemed quite extraordinary.

545
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,835
You know the Italian sculptor, Casas?

546
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,295
It's his artwork.

547
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,463
Oh, that's why.

548
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,341
The office room there
hasn't been extended, unlike the others.

549
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,387
Because it's worth
being preserved as it is.

550
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,931
The building was extended around the place

551
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,851
as it was maintained unaffected.

552
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,562
It's a piece of artwork.

553
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,189
And the chairman cherishes it.

554
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,649
I see.

555
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,276
Excuse me then.

556
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,278
By the way…

557
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,864
Is there another strange matter?

558
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,823
Yes.

559
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,492
You've been following me.

560
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,124
Me? I think you're mistaken.

561
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,626
Can you say the same to the chairman?

562
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,133
Is Ms. Kwon behind it?

563
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,055
(Ms. Kwon clicks tongue)

564
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,681
I apologize.

565
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,974
MS. KWON: Do you remember, Ms. Oh?

566
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,186
That clumsy fool
who couldn't even do her job.

567
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

568
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,326
MR. CHOI: <i>Flocoumafen was found
in her body. That's rat poison.</i>

569
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,170
Is there something you want to say?

570
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,964
-I don't understand.
-MS. KWON: What don't you understand?

571
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,716
Why you're watching me.

572
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,886
I'm just doing my job. If you have nothing
to hide, what's the problem with it?

573
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,348
-Ms. Kwon.
-Earlier, Mr. Choi said

574
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,017
that you behaved suspiciously
in the woods.

575
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,770
I couldn't stay still.

576
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,981
I've talked to the chairman about it.

577
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,817
Oh, no.

578
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,570
You may have softened him up,
but you can't do the same with me.

579
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,781
I like to test the waters, you see.

580
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,284
Ms. Kwon.

581
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,246
You see,

582
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,500
I want to be on great terms with you.

583
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,459
(clears throat)

584
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,462
-WOOSIN: But…
-But?

585
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,383
If you make me uncomfortable,
I can be just as aggressive.

586
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,468
Is that a threat?

587
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,303
Of course not. I'm asking you for a favor.

588
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,348
Your interest in me

589
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,059
is quite a nuisance.

590
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,984
That arrogant jerk.

591
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,237
Ms. Kwon, I--

592
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,280
Bring Ms. Yoon over.

593
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,865
Yes, ma'am.

594
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
Are you going somewhere?

595
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,973
She's going out alone
without the chairman.

596
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,477
It must be Ms. Kwon's order.

597
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,531
CHIEF JEONG:
<i>A group rally is to take place</i>

598
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,949
<i>in favor of the death penalty
this weekend.</i>

599
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,911
The bereaved have been recruited
and TV cameras will be there.

600
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,039
Okay, that's going to be one nice story.

601
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,249
Have Candidate Hwang give a speech.

602
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,834
His thigh hasn't fully--

603
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,752
Hey.

604
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,338
He should fight through it.

605
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,590
He can't be President for free.

606
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,134
Understood, sir.

607
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,303
-(door opens)
-MANAGER LEE: Sir.

608
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,555
Be careful not to trip. What is it?

609
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,934
-We got a call from outside.
-A call?

610
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,145
A call from outside
can only mean one thing.

611
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
What's the case number?

612
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,858
WONJOONG: You told me before.

613
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,653
That if something happened in the future,

614
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,405
I should dial
my resident registration number here.

615
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,950
That I'd be able to reach you anytime.

616
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,536
WOMAN: Tell me what kind of help you need.

617
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,956
WONJOONG:
<i>The victim's son visited me today.</i>

618
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:26,043
I feigned ignorance
and he left without saying much, but…

619
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,380
WOMAN: <i>Your request has been submitted.
Please go home and wait.</i>

620
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,674
Wait, I didn't do anything wrong.

621
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,176
I had no idea he'd come
after all this time.

622
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,390
Please… Please don't harass me
or my family again.

623
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,017
-(dial tone)
-Hello?

624
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,019
Hello?

625
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,483
Please…

626
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,572
Don't harass my family…

627
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,700
TEAM LEADER LEE:
<i>Witnesses are always a problem.</i>

628
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,245
Kim Wonjoong, the witness
in Lee Changwoo's case.

629
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,249
(sighs)
His wife was so pretty.

630
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,668
Should we come up with a scenario?

631
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,296
We must respond by the book.

632
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,465
-Okay.
-Joonho.

633
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,593
-Yes?
-Let me borrow your tie.

634
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,969
Oh.

635
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,558
The victim's son came to see him.

636
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,936
What a devoted son.

637
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,565
Hustling around to see
what's behind his father's death.

638
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,443
But that could lead him
to die young just like his father.

639
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,236
Right?

640
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,411
My gosh!
Let's say I lied about the whole thing.

641
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,204
What about Lee Changwoo?

642
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,541
He confessed that he murdered your father!

643
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,004
It's a mess the more I dig into it.

644
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,300
If he was framed, why did he confess?

645
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,969
Why?

646
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,766
-Hey.
-Oh, my goodness.

647
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,144
If it isn't the alpha dog,
Mr. Song Suhyeon.

648
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,356
You've done enough, so stop teasing me.

649
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,982
I'm just grateful.

650
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,233
For what?

651
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,820
Thanks. I was given the case
because you turned it down.

652
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,364
The Kangchun case.

653
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,532
Wow, congrats.

654
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,202
I get to jump on a bandwagon
thanks to you.

655
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,288
Will I get a box full of cash
this coming Chuseok holiday?

656
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,706
From Candidate Hwang?

657
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,750
Come on, the money comes
from the financier.

658
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,293
The financier?

659
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,796
You know who's backing him.

660
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,382
-Haesong?
-Yes.

661
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,011
Gosh, you are so proud
talking about something so filthy.

662
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,060
That rude punk.

663
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,078
HAESONG GROUP
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEES AWARD CEREMONY

664
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,712
(audience applauding)

665
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,882
HAESONG GROUP
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEES AWARD CEREMONY

666
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
Everyone,

667
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,443
have you heard of the phrase,
company livestock?

668
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,280
Domestic animals are called livestock.

669
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,283
And office workers are called
company livestock

670
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,202
for they are raised in a company.

671
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,539
I do not agree with this phrase.

672
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,209
You are never company livestock.

673
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,130
Then what is your identity?

674
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,049
You are guests.

675
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,888
Guests who deserve hospitable treatment.

676
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,601
Let me take this chance
to make one thing clear.

677
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,519
Those who force you to be loyal

678
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,773
and to have a sense of ownership.
They are all frauds.

679
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,859
You don't own the company,
so how could you?

680
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,571
Throw away all those remarks in the trash.

681
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,413
You just have to work your salary's worth.

682
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:36,376
This means, you have to get paid
as much as you work,

683
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,378
and if it doesn't satisfy you,

684
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,590
you can throw the company out.

685
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,508
(laughter)

686
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,304
You work for Haesong,

687
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,473
and the executives' duty

688
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,226
is to make sure

689
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,353
you can work conveniently.

690
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,149
Please stay with Haesong for a long time.

691
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:04,655
I will serve you as the rightful guests.

692
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:11,036
(audience applauding)

693
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,342
(cackling)

694
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,262
Wow.

695
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,392
Digging into his father's murder case
from 22 years ago!

696
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:40,649
Even a TV show would be criticized
for having such a story.

697
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,109
It's too much.

698
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,318
Tell me about it.

699
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:48,323
So the son came to visit the witness?

700
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,619
-(sighs)
-Why are they so pathetic?

701
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,248
Obsessed with the past,
they can't move on.

702
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,791
That's why their lives are miserable.

703
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,087
The Heukseok-dong shaman
told me to be careful.

704
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,755
This was it.

705
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,217
(sighs)
You have a scenario?

706
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,803
It's ready.

707
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,683
KIM WONJOONG, IM JISOOK
DISAPPEARANCE SCENARIO

708
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,352
HYUNJO: What a pathetic father.

709
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,440
He just had to pass down
something like this.

710
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,818
Not bad.

711
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,821
Then should we proceed accordingly?

712
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,075
Oh, please.

713
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,246
If I say okay here,

714
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,957
I'd be abetting murder.

715
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,590
Take care of it

716
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,134
solely based on your decision.

717
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,430
Yes, sir.

718
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,193
(line ringing)

719
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,779
Stand by, Mr. Jung.
We're making a move tonight.

720
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,787
Gather up. We have an order to carry out.

721
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,794
CHIEF JEONG: <i>What's the target's routine?</i>

722
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,963
They take a walk at 3 p.m. every day.

723
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,757
CHIEF JEONG:
Wouldn't that be in broad daylight?

724
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,926
There's a secluded place along the route.

725
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,636
It's a blind spot with no CCTV cameras.

726
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,388
CHIEF JEONG: I see, here at 3:40 p.m.

727
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,306
EMPLOYEE 1:
From there to the nearby mountain.

728
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,016
Mr. Kang is checking the area right now.

729
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,059
CHIEF JEONG: And the clear-out team?

730
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,019
EMPLOYEE 2:
They will be standing by on time.

731
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,355
CHIEF JEONG: Okay. Let's get it right.

732
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,690
MEN: Yes, sir.

733
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,570
(helicopter whirring)

734
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,376
WOOSIN: <i>Why aren't they showing up
after sending me the letter?</i>

735
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,754
DONGRIM: I saw a beautiful woman earlier
during the day.

736
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,465
I hear she's the chairman's secretary.
She's totally my type.

737
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,967
She's Osan style.

738
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,846
You see, my mom's my ideal woman
and she's from Osan.

739
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,892
What are you doing?

740
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,814
Mr. Ha, what are you doing?

741
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,525
An assignment.

742
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,694
I see.

743
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,490
Then I'll go work on an assignment too.

744
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,662
(sighs)
Who on earth could it be?

745
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,001
(helicopter whirring)

746
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,184
Good evening.

747
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, that woman.

748
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,984
The Osan-style lady.

749
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,581
(panting)

750
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,583
She walks so fast.

751
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,460
Excuse me.

752
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,880
Did I startle you? I'm sorry.

753
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,965
I didn't mean to scare you.

754
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,967
I kept calling you, but you didn't answer.

755
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,347
I'm Lee Dongrim.

756
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,474
The memoir writer's pupil.

757
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,771
I'll be writing my book soon too.

758
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,565
I hope we get along.

759
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,322
(Dongrim gasps)

760
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:01,034
She's an Ice Queen. How cool.

761
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,542
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER

762
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,253
Thank you. I asked you to do this
because I could trust you.

763
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,755
My suspicion will be resolved now.

764
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,508
If he had surgery,
I should be aware of it.

765
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,011
And if he lied, for what reason…

766
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,224
-(knocking on door)
-(door opens)

767
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,311
-Ms. Kwon.
-Talk to me later.

768
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,274
NAME: SONG WOOSIN

769
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,317
OPEN FRACTURE IN LEFT HAND

770
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,283
What…

771
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,952
The chairman wants to see you.

772
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,955
-The master?
-Yes, right now.

773
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,123
Right now? Why?

774
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,875
I'm not sure.

775
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,964
If you make me uncomfortable,
I can be just as aggressive.

776
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,551
That little…

777
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,101
How could you?

778
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,021
You suggested an amicable relationship
just to stab me in the back!

779
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,608
-Stab you in the back?
-You told on me to the master!

780
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,237
I don't know what this is about,
and I'm not even interested. It's not me.

781
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,323
Stop suspecting me for nothing.

782
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,991
If I don't stop, what will you do?

783
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,870
I was being patient out of courtesy,
but don't expect more.

784
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,121
Don't be patient.

785
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,957
Let's fight and see
how long you can take my beating.

786
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,792
I could be the one beating you.

787
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,962
(growls)

788
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,008
You're no match for me.

789
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,802
Are you proud
because the master likes you?

790
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,263
He likes me? I didn't know that.

791
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,598
Don't delude yourself.

792
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,308
It's not because he adores you.

793
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,852
He's just reminded of Mr. Minjo!

794
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,066
Mr. Minjo?

795
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,902
That's none of your business.

796
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,987
The one who died in a helicopter accident.

797
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,453
Do I have a resemblance to him?

798
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,958
That smile.

799
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:18,046
That disgusting smile.
It's as if you see through me.

800
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,384
Seeing how you hate me,
I guess you didn't--

801
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,387
Don't smirk. You know nothing!

802
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,974
It's just drawing my attention.

803
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,309
Even more because I look like him.

804
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,855
(breathing heavily)

805
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,322
WOOSIN: <i>It's just drawing my attention.</i>

806
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,366
<i>Even more because I look like him.</i>

807
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,203
More?

808
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,723
WOOSIN: "Eunkook Medical Center"?

809
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,692
Was it you?

810
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,958
Ms. Kwon checked my surgery records.

811
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,545
I actually never got surgery.

812
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,422
Someone fabricated the record.

813
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,342
Director Eun Kyunggu
of Eunkook Medical Center.

814
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,801
You're his only daughter, Ms. Eun.

815
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,596
I can assume why.

816
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,516
If they found out that I lied, they'd
figure out what I have in my left hand.

817
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,685
Then they'd question
my actual purpose for coming here.

818
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,645
That could also put you in danger.

819
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,154
Because you're the one
who sent me the letter.

820
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,786
If not, why would you help me?

821
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,624
You're right. It was me.

822
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,794
(thunder rumbles)

823
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,463
(rain pattering)

824
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,554
My assignment is finally complete.

825
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,978
You had Ms. Yoon
run an errand for you earlier today.

826
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,732
KWON: Don't look at her.

827
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,610
Of course I noticed
my secretary's absence.

828
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,656
I apologize.
I had an urgent matter to tend to.

829
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,116
Your guess turned out to be wrong.

830
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,202
Leave Mr. Ha be.

831
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,372
Sir, you shouldn't let him fool you.

832
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,333
You think I can be fooled?

833
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,961
That's not what I mean.

834
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:07,257
Mr. Choi said that the writer
seemed to be looking for someone.

835
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,716
I only tried to figure out who--

836
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,968
KWON: Mr. Ha…

837
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,345
works for me.

838
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,307
Then why did you go into the woods?

839
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,476
I followed your daughter-in-law.

840
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,688
Hyesoo?

841
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,400
I thought I'd use a coincidental encounter
to become acquainted with her.

842
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,485
What do you mean by that?

843
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,739
I'll accept your suggestion.

844
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,410
Yesterday, you said you wanted
to know what's on her mind

845
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,455
and asked me to tell you
everything she says.

846
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,209
That's what happened, so stay out of it.

847
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,462
Master.

848
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,756
I said stop.

849
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
You and your suspicions are at it again!

850
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,843
That's not it.

851
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:58,266
I know you're being
overly generous to him.

852
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,978
I can assume why you chose him
to write your memoir.

853
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,023
His smile looks just like Mr. Minjo…

854
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,276
(groans)

855
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,404
I apologize.

856
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,033
I didn't mean to talk about him.

857
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,201
You've gotten old.

858
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,286
Have you forgotten already?

859
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,413
The more you talk,

860
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,582
the shorter you live.

861
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,463
(sobbing)

862
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,554
Ha Woosin…

863
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,184
WOOSIN: Now let me ask.

864
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,561
What you wrote in the letter.
How did you know?

865
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,070
(thunderclaps)

866
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,905
HYESOO:
<i>Lee Changwoo is not the real culprit.</i>

867
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,450
<i>The missing murder weapon
is the symbol of Haesong.</i>

868
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,869
<i>The diamond arrow,</i>

869
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,080
<i>Adamas.</i>

870
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,709
-(thunder rumbles)
-WOOSIN: <i>Ms. Eun?</i>

871
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,339
I heard about it.

872
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,258
From whom?

873
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,969
My husband.

874
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,805
You mean Mr. Kwon Hyunjo?

875
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:21,975
GUARD: He's on the line, sir.

876
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,770
Hi, Mr. Lee.

877
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,274
About the scenario from earlier,

878
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,194
why don't we go with suicide
instead of disappearance?

879
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,323
That might seem more genuine.

880
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,701
WOOSIN: <i>Mr. Kwon told you?</i>

881
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,246
It was more like he rattled on.

882
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,503
Those flowers belong to him.

883
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,717
HYUNJO: I told you so.

884
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,302
My father…

885
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:01,764
(groans)
…killed someone with the Adamas.

886
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,018
I heard him say that
and sent you the letter.

887
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,895
Why?

888
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,231
It has nothing to do with you.

889
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,108
That's not important right now.

890
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,112
Why did you come to this place?

891
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,992
Answer me.

892
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,460
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

893
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,423
To reveal that it was used for the murder,

894
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,092
the autopsy result and Adamas
must be collated.

895
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,761
Would Haesong cooperate?

896
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,304
No, never.

897
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,724
-Are you out of your mind?
-You need to help me.

898
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,809
-Why should I?
-You called me here.

899
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,646
Soon after I got the letter,

900
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,856
I was offered
to ghostwrite the chairman's memoir.

901
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,483
By coincidence?

902
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,860
Apparently, someone highly recommended me.

903
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,488
-Since you sent me the letter--
-It wasn't me.

904
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,032
I didn't recommend you.

905
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,702
-Then who…
-That's the problem.

906
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,248
Nothing happens by coincidence here.

907
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,754
(tense music)

908
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,097
(car door closes)

909
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,600
(car beeps)

910
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,441
(door opens)

911
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,740

Kim had nursed his wife alone</i>

<i>for more than 21 years.</i>

929
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,475
<i>The police find it highly probable

930
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,269

(closing theme music)

936
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,105
MR. CHOI: <i>I need you to leave this house.</i>

937
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,358
<i>People around you will face harm

my mouth shut, leave Suhyeon alone.</i>
