00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,681
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,972
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,514
Taesung. Mr. Han. Are you guys okay?

4
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,676
-MR. CHOI: Yes, sir.
-MR. HAN: Yes, sir. We're okay.

5
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,737
SEOHEE: They're planning
to raid Chairman Kwon's funeral.

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,860
15 HOURS AGO

7
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,116
As if their operation
is to arrest Lee Changwoo.

8
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,028
Eun Hyesoo is in league with them.

9
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,867
They're trying to lure
Team Leader Lee there.

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,502
He'll most definitely mobilize
the entire team.

11
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,793
Meanwhile, we only have seven

12
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,212
including Prosecutor Song
and Lee Changwoo.

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,542
Now do you think we have a chance?

14
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,053
They're going there to get killed.

15
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,548
Go persuade them to cease the operation.

16
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:22,064
Pleading with me won't change anything.
I'm already done for.

17
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,861
Did you say it was 23 people?

18
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,824
Those who were sacrificed
to take Haesong and Team A down.

19
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,028
That number will soon become 30.

20
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,822
Are you really okay with that?

21
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,445
I am not okay with that.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,203
Help them.

23
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,088
What do you mean, break into their base?

24
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,384
That's right.

25
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,005
They think we'll be at the funeral
for an operation,

26
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,055
so all of them will probably flock there.

27
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,849
Then their base will be unguarded.

28
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,273
That's when I'll go there.

29
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,107
WOOSIN: <i>It's too dangerous to do it alone.</i>

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,029
SUHYEON: <i>They'll catch on
if we all go there together.</i>

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,568
If Team A blows the place up,

32
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,323
we won't get to find anything again.

33
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,695
Suhyeon, it's dangerous.

34
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,332
WOOSIN: <i>There are too many variables.</i>

35
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,829
If neither plan works…

36
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,871
We'll make sure neither falls through.

37
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,464
Speaking of which,
pretend to be me one more time.

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,706
What?

39
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,303
While I'm there,

40
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,959
go to the funeral with the others
on my behalf.

41
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,678
Act like me so that Team A
doesn't notice where I am.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,259
And Woosin.

43
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,178
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,193
SUHYEON: <i>For making you know and cope with</i>

45
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,904
<i>the unbearable alone.</i>

46
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,439
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,945
Like you said, we will catch Lee
and reveal everything

48
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,582
to punish him the right way.

49
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,042
So trust me, and let's

50
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,865
put an end to this, okay?

51
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,720
Where's Prosecutor Song?

52
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,346
Suhyeon

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,310
is at Team A's B site.

54
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,977
By himself?

55
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,101
He's not here.

56
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,353
Team Leader Lee wasn't here.

57
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,374
I can't see.

58
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,597
Suhyeon is in danger.

59
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,236
POLICE: One, two, three.

60
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,078
SEOHEE: Mr. Kang.

61
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,129
He's not here, right?

62
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,383
-No.
-What do you mean?

63
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,757
Prosecutor Song went to their base alone,
and Team Leader Lee isn't here.

64
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,805
We must go to him now.

65
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Mr. Kang.

66
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,520
-Send another team to their base now.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,524
Go. I'll handle it here.

68
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,515
-Mr. Han.
-Yes.

69
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,066
-Go save Prosecutor Song.
-Okay.

70
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,618
Where is Suhyeon?

71
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,004
I think he's still there.

72
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,330
Lee, that damn bastard.

73
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,347
You…

74
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,312
You're Song Suhyeon, right?

75
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,895
Yes, you bastard.

76
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,863
We finally meet.
I've been wanting to meet you.

77
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,823
Do you know why you're going to die?

78
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,290
Lee Joonho, my younger brother!

79
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,787
He's the reason, you damn bastard.

80
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,423
You tortured my brother,

81
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,678
kidnapped him, and killed him!

82
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,885
Do you remember?

83
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,935
I'm going to make you experience the same.

84
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,649
You damn bastard.

85
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,025
You bastard.

86
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,505
Damn you.

87
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,279
You bastard.

88
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,276
You're the one who killed your brother.

89
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,781
Do you remember the names
of those you killed?

90
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,947
Do you even remember their faces?

91
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,080
Die.

92
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,593
Die, you bastard.

93
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,036
Song Soonho.

94
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,081
I remember that name. His face too.

95
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,173
Your father whom I killed.

96
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,472
I'm going to kill you just like him,
you damn bastard.

97
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,306
Ha Woosin. I'm going to kill him too.
I'll tear him to pieces.

98
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,222
Watch what I do from hell.

99
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,142
This is how you take revenge, damn it.

100
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,651
I'll kill you today.

101
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,327
He's moving.

102
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,575
Suhyeon's on the move?

103
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,376
WOOSIN: Which direction?

104
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,669
Mr. Choi, they're headed
in a different direction.

105
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,506
Follow them. They're probably
going after the GPS signal.

106
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,973
Yes, sir.

107
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,472
POLICE: Sir.

108
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,598
We've checked the CCTV.

109
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,860
He ran off?

110
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,769
POLICE:
<i>We think he took Song Suhyeon with him.</i>

111
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,127
Any last words?

112
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,093
Yoon Sun.

113
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,717
Did you just call my name?

114
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,718
You're not going
to beg me for mercy, are you?

115
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,598
That doesn't suit you.

116
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,147
Why don't you do something
that will make you happy instead?

117
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,610
-Is that a piece of advice?
-No, an offer.

118
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,032
It might be more tempting
than what Kwon Hyunjo suggested.

119
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,753
You want to kill Ms. Yoon, don't you?

120
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,090
Kwon Hyunjo won't do it.

121
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,710
Because he loves her.

122
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,675
Once he's done using you,
he'll probably get rid of you.

123
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,435
Isn't it the same for you?

124
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,234
Because I killed

125
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,105
Minjo.

126
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,276
So this time,

127
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,122
save me.

128
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,619
Then Minjo will forgive you.

129
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
What's your offer?

130
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,680
Let's get to the point then.

131
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,516
I believe there's something
more interesting

132
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,096
than killing Ms. Yoon.

133
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,898
Why won't you answer your phone, Suhyeon?

134
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,035
Why all the way here?
Is he trying to dispose of the body?

135
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,001
Don't jinx anything, and just follow them.

136
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,632
SUN

137
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,560
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER
FUNERAL HOME

138
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,953
Are you surprised that I'm alive?

139
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,923
This is unexpected.

140
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,876
It sure is disappointing.

141
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,258
I wonder what happened.

142
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,760
I made an offer.

143
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,429
An offer?

144
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,897
Yoon Sun…

145
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,154
She can weigh her options now?

146
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,702
One of us will be done for.

147
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,315
Aren't you too relaxed?

148
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,327
Looks like you'll be busy.

149
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,036
Team A.

150
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,496
They got busted quite badly.

151
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,040
REPORTER:
<i>Lee Changwoo the escaped prisoner</i>

152
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,457
<i>is said to be involved in the gunfight.</i>

153
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,796
<i>According to what has been revealed,</i>

154
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,261
<i>a big criminal syndicate
played a part in it.</i>

155
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,892
<i>The police announced that
they started investigating right away.</i>

156
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,970
Oh, dear. Your backup's gone now.

157
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,438
Get the situation straight.

158
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,109
What Team A did has nothing to do with me.

159
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,858
You're the one in trouble.

160
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,819
They won't be able to find anything
to link me.

161
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,605
Team A was under Mr. Lee's orders.

162
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,356
Nothing at all indicates

163
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,277
that I made the orders.

164
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,995
I see. That's a relief.

165
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,460
You won't have to go to jail.

166
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,171
Anyway,

167
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,746
we're back to square one.

168
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,844
I wonder what you can do without Team A.

169
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,936
Ms. Kim, are we getting there?

170
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,935
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

171
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,317
Where is it?

172
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,244
I think we're almost there.

173
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,452
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes?

174
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,662
-Something's not right.
-Why?

175
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,913
It stopped. It's not moving.

176
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,365
Where did it stop?

177
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,339
Mr. Choi.

178
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,263
Damn it.

179
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,307
Mr. Ha.

180
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,318
Hello?

181
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,451
Mr. Choi,
they've located Prosecutor Song's car.

182
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,498
MOKPO COASTAL FERRY TERMINAL

183
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,180
No one's in there.

184
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,814
Let's look around.

185
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,639
ENTRANCE
MOKPO FERRY PASSENGER TERMINAL

186
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,117
Do you damn bastards
take me for a pushover?

187
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,865
Why do you come at me one after another?

188
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,247
I work alone too.

189
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,583
You're dead.

190
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,350
It feels nice, doesn't it?

191
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,107
My eye!

192
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,463
Ha Woosin?

193
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,554
What's with that gun?

194
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,466
Are you going to shoot me?

195
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,641
Can you?

196
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,481
Where is Suhyeon?

197
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,855
I'm not sure. Where could he be?

198
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,907
Did you really throw him in the sea?

199
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,198
Don't you want to shoot me?

200
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,749
Go ahead. Shoot me.

201
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,711
In the head? Do it.

202
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,048
Shoot me. Do it, you bastard!

203
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,429
If you can't shoot me,

204
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,934
shoot yourself instead.

205
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,307
Your brother died because of you.

206
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,944
Hadn't you made that fuss
about stealing the Adamas,

207
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,441
none of this would've happened, no?

208
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,694
Shut up.

209
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,858
I told Song Suhyeon
right before he took his last breath.

210
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,489
"You're going to die
because of your stupid brother."

211
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,786
I said, shut up.

212
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,866
Guess what his last words were.

213
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,754
He begged me pathetically to spare him.

214
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,627
Please spare me. Please show mercy.

215
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,668
You should've seen that sight.

216
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,809
That was too uncool for a damn prosecutor.

217
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,734
No, I doubt it.

218
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,404
Damn…

219
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,494
You bastard.

220
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,808
You little…

221
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,806
Ha Woosin.

222
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,073
It's okay.

223
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,501
Everything's over.

224
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,705
It's okay now.

225
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,985
REPORTER 1: <i>As the police continue
investigating the big criminal syndicate</i>

226
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,529
<i>involving Lee Changwoo's
prison escape case,</i>

227
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,493
<i>shocking details are being disclosed.</i>

228
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,243
REPORTER 2: <i>If it turns out to be true,</i>

229
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,825
<i>Haesong will face inevitable damage.</i>

230
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,713
<i>Prosecutor Song Suhyeon was kidnapped</i>

231
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>while tracking the criminal syndicate,
and it's assumed</i>

232
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,922
<i>his body was disposed of in the sea.
He's still missing,</i>

233
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,223
<i>and the authorities have stated
that they'll do their best to find him.</i>

234
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,968
REPORTER 3: <i>President Kwon Hyunjo refused</i>

235
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,350
<i>to be investigated as a testifier
and strongly denied every possibility.</i>

236
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,509
<i>Stating that Haesong also was victimized</i>

237
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,427
<i>by its affiliate, ARES' criminal acts,</i>

238
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,806
<i>he demanded a strict investigation.</i>

239
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,936
<i>Mr. Kwon promised if the case
gets transferred to the prosecution,</i>

240
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:57,442
<i>he will fully cooperate
as soon as he regains his health.</i>

241
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,857
Congratulations on winning the election.

242
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,405
Why don't we grab a meal sometime soon?

243
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,540
We have to settle things somehow.

244
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,120
Or should I just reveal everything?

245
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,875
It's not like I can just do what I want.

246
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:18,205
Since you've all been Haesong's partners,
I'd better hear what you think.

247
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,336
I'll be waiting for your call then.

248
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,351
Let's send out a press release.

249
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,319
Kwon Hyunjo knows nothing of it.
He will cooperate faithfully.

250
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,478
The media will have my diagnosis too.

251
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,151
It's fortunate in a sense.

252
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,946
I held my title only in name.

253
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,700
Everything was up to my father.

254
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,445
Everyone knows it.

255
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:52,327
Our priority is to silence Mr. Lee.

256
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,264
He's not that stupid.

257
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,795
I bet he knows what to do.

258
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,519
MR. CHOI: It's meaningless to hold out.

259
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,515
The evidence is so clear.

260
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,979
Is it in your team's manual?

261
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,240
All of you are remaining silent.

262
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,986
Doing this won't do you any good.

263
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,657
The higher-ups aren't all that generous.

264
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,622
The police investigation
has already begun.

265
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,502
Those involved will be sent
to the prosecution.

266
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,830
Once the trial begins,
even Haesong won't have a way out.

267
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,841
Look at you trying to act tough.

268
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,048
But you're just a hound.

269
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,966
Lieutenant Choi Taesung.

270
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,641
You don't think you are a hound?

271
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,439
Team A is no different from the SIH.

272
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,521
Enough with your crap.

273
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,065
Who shot Chairman Kwon?

274
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,485
Now you want to play
a righteous cop with me?

275
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,700
Then you shouldn't have dumped me
in the reservoir.

276
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,156
Don't tell me you're shameless enough

277
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,254
to claim it's acceptable

278
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,708
to catch bad guys through bad means.

279
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,671
Chairman Kwon and the reservoir…

280
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,665
None of that can be proved anyway.

281
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,804
Haesong concealed it all.

282
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,257
Haesong, Haesong…

283
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,552
You keep mentioning Haesong.

284
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,845
You and I obviously follow
the higher-ups' orders.

285
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,274
Let's take it easy.

286
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,858
It's embarrassing to see you try so hard.

287
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,231
The higher-ups who?

288
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,435
Jeez.

289
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,278
Do you actually think you can catch us?

290
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,406
This case hasn't been transferred
to the prosecution yet.

291
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,121
And you know what that means.

292
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,458
The higher-ups

293
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,087
are discussing what to do with me.

294
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,878
They will decide how this ends,

295
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,839
and we just follow through.

296
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,353
So the higher-ups who?

297
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,312
Give me names, or this won't end.

298
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,436
Come on. I told you not to try so hard.

299
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,152
It will only drain you.

300
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,542
MR. CHOI: What do you think?

301
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,924
He doesn't deny his charges.

302
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,128
WOOSIN:
He says he only did what he was told to.

303
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,920
And he admits to being a hound.

304
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,133
He's staying silent
about who's behind him.

305
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,594
Because he doesn't know.

306
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,467
What do you mean?

307
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,681
He hasn't received an order

308
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,969
regarding what to admit

309
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,270
and whom to drag in.

310
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,888
Let me talk to him.

311
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,765
No, I can't let you talk to him directly.

312
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,605
I have something to ask him.

313
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,067
Please let me, Mr. Choi.

314
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,608
Mr. Choi.

315
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,750
Wow.

316
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,785
I guess you have quite the influence.

317
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,585
A civilian isn't supposed
to meddle in a police investigation.

318
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,926
WOOSIN: Let's talk off the record.

319
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,149
Suhyeon.

320
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,398
What did you do with him?

321
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,569
I made sure his body wouldn't be found.

322
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,372
Don't you want to kill me?

323
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,406
I felt exactly the same.

324
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,415
It's not too late. Kill me.

325
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,182
That's my decision to make.

326
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,015
The Adamas.

327
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,147
I still have it.

328
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,700
Should I go and try

329
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,695
to bargain with it?

330
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,002
Are you going to ask Eun Hyesoo

331
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,293
to kill me in exchange

332
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,577
for handing her the Adamas?

333
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,883
I doubt it will go as you want.

334
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,255
Damn, it does have me curious.

335
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,933
Whom will she choose? You or me?

336
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,247
Mom.

337
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,745
Dad.

338
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,426
I'm here.

339
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,071
Everything's over now.

340
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,235
But I'm left with no one.

341
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,216
I actually regret it so much.

342
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,476
I'm sorry.

343
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,147
I'm sorry, Dad.

344
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,371
I'm sorry.

345
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,445
Drink some.

346
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,786
I know it's not the right time
to say this,

347
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,920
but I'll just say it.

348
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,636
When I heard that
you spared Team Leader Lee,

349
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,596
guess how I felt.

350
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,015
"Thank goodness."

351
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,154
I was relieved.

352
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,729
Do you know why I shot Chairman Kwon?

353
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,145
Back at the reservoir, I thought…

354
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,952
<i>…I had killed Lee.</i>

355
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,413
I was no different from Team A.

356
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,254
In the meantime,
the infiltration team was disbanded.

357
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,327
Sergeant Ko's family got murdered.

358
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,292
I gave way in the end.

359
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,171
"You demon. I'll kill you myself."

360
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,051
That's why I shot him.

361
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,010
Although I couldn't kill him myself.

362
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,136
Don't be foolish like me.

363
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,305
Chairman Kwon's death
didn't put an end to anything.

364
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,647
Team Leader Lee's death
won't save you from the pain either.

365
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,662
Mr. Choi.

366
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,283
Yes?

367
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,909
I didn't say

368
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,584
whom I'd go to meet.

369
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,705
What are you talking about?

370
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,299
Are you going to ask Eun Hyesoo

371
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,425
to kill me in exchange

372
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,471
for handing her the Adamas?

373
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,557
He naturally mentioned

374
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,850
Ms. Eun Hyesoo.

375
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,654
It means she is the decision maker.

376
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,944
The new owner of Haesong.

377
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,667
-Ms. Kwon.
-Did you see a ghost or something?

378
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,710
What brings you here?

379
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,053
What's wrong with me coming to my house?

380
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,763
Did you keep the house under control
while I was away?

381
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,928
-Well--
-Is she on the third floor?

382
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,176
I should greet her first.

383
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,175
Welcome.

384
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,141
I'm back,

385
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,096
master.

386
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,302
WOMAN: Seohee.

387
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,469
I hear you've been
covering the case undercover.

388
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,010
No wonder we couldn't see you.

389
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,256
Who cleaned my desk?

390
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,394
The director did.

391
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,058
What?

392
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,639
He's got high expectations
for an exclusive.

393
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,606
You've become very kind.

394
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,622
Let's start with an exclusive
on Song Suhyeon.

395
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,454
I heard you two were close
and worked undercover together.

396
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,286
So the article should be
about the late Prosecutor Song's--

397
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,963
He's missing.

398
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,541
They're still searching for him.

399
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,467
Okay, all right. He's missing.

400
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,804
Anyway, to honor his wish--

401
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,046
I won't do it.

402
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,638
Hey, this is a direct order
from upper management.

403
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,635
-I won't do it.
-Hey, Ms. Kim.

404
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,847
I get that you want
to uphold social justice.

405
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,518
Don't think
you can see it through in one go.

406
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,897
You've got to see it
as a long-term battle.

407
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,950
I'll write articles on my own.

408
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,289
Hey!

409
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,091
HYESOO: <i>First of all, I'd like to make
a sincere apology.</i>

410
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,597
<i>Chairman Kwon Jaekyu used
to handle the matters in general,</i>

411
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,772
<i>but he has passed away.</i>

412
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,937
<i>Although I don't know much about the case,</i>

413
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,810
<i>I'll trust the police and prosecution</i>

414
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,766
<i>-and cooperate faithfully.</i>
-This is unexpected.

415
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,938
-Haesong is admitting it?
-HYESOO: <i>I strongly condemn…</i>

416
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,606
-No.
<i>-…the past management system where…</i>

417
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,572
She's putting the blame on Chairman Kwon.

418
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,276
He can't be prosecuted
because he's dead anyway.

419
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,367
WOMAN: You're right.

420
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,373
SEOHEE: The investigation has begun

421
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,041
under Haesong's supervision.

422
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,834
The order has been given.

423
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,247
They're putting all the blame on the dead?

424
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,502
HYESOO: <i>I strongly condemn
the past management system</i>

425
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,758
<i>where instead of following the law,</i>

426
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,430
<i>violence was used
to resolve power struggles</i>

427
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,889
<i>with the involvement
of an organized crime ring.</i>

428
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,431
President Kwon Hyunjo
who should lead the group

429
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,604
in the late chairman's stead

430
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,903
has suffered a great shock
due to the recent events.

431
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,608
<i>He's needed to step down from management
and receive treatment at the moment.</i>

432
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,780
<i>-I thought someone from the family--</i>
-What is she saying? Damn it!

433
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,533
I need to step down from management?

434
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,449
All right, let's see

435
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,712
who takes down the other
during the upcoming board meeting.

436
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,539
Did you watch the press conference?

437
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,045
What is Eun Hyesoo trying to do?

438
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,840
I didn't see it coming either.

439
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,339
I thought she'd be friendly
because she used to help Mr. Ha.

440
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,097
I guess she's a part of Haesong after all.

441
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,560
She isn't with us. That's for sure.

442
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,771
MR. CHOI: <i>She wants to protect Haesong.</i>

443
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,231
Maybe that's why
Mr. Ha had that talk with Team Leader Lee.

444
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,691
What do you mean?

445
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,694
He said Eun Hyesoo was the decision maker.

446
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,864
He talked about bargaining with the Adamas

447
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,777
in exchange for killing Team Leader Lee.

448
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,658
Suhyeon.

449
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,795
Suhyeon.

450
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,964
Dongrim told me

451
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,713
that you come here every day.

452
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,381
Not every day.

453
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,723
I come here every day

454
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,309
ever since that day.

455
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,858
I heard you talked to Lee.

456
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,358
Yes.

457
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,743
I wasn't sure about what I wanted.

458
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,530
So did you find the answer?

459
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,912
Whatever choice I make,

460
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,672
I won't feel guilty.

461
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,881
I became sure of that.

462
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,631
Mr. Ha.

463
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,295
I may be mistaken,

464
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,555
but don't do it. I hope you won't do it.

465
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,805
Don't waver.

466
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,031
Remember what we've been fighting for.

467
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,566
Nothing at all

468
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,867
is left to waver about.

469
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,911
It's meaningless now that Suhyeon's gone.

470
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,536
If you kill Lee,
will it become meaningful?

471
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,046
I am not

472
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,930
a hero like you.

473
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,933
I started this
to help Suhyeon feel less guilty.

474
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,725
And it resulted

475
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,318
in pushing him

476
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,487
into that sea myself.

477
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,446
Would you understand how I feel?

478
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,674
No, I wouldn't.

479
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,544
How could I?

480
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,012
I just want to console you.

481
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,510
And I'm not a hero either.

482
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,599
I was just in that situation
at that particular time.

483
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,977
Someone had to take action,

484
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,188
and it just happened to be me.

485
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,816
Suhyeon wouldn't want it either.

486
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,947
I want it.

487
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,250
Would he want you

488
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,710
to take revenge?

489
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,268
I miss Suhyeon so much…

490
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,118
Me too.

491
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,267
Mr. Ha, come and have dinner.

492
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,778
I looked for recipes
and made a devoted order.

493
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,779
DONGRIM: Come on.

494
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,288
I put the mail on your desk.

495
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,463
One was from a fan.
I'm not sure who sent it though.

496
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,091
Aren't you going to go home?

497
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,430
I will, when you get better.

498
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,972
Stop being a nuisance and go home.

499
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,771
I can't leave you alone.

500
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,390
You know what?

501
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,475
I wake up during my sleep
to check up on you.

502
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,483
Every night, you space out in your bed.

503
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,074
Just what's on your mind?

504
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,917
MR. CHOI: <i>Chairman Kwon's death
didn't put an end to anything.</i>

505
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,050
<i>Team Leader Lee's death
won't save you from the pain either.</i>

506
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,969
SEOHEE: <i>Would he want you</i>

507
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,429
<i>to take revenge?</i>

508
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,398
Are you here for the board meeting?

509
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,436
SUN: Mr. Kwon can't go.

510
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,281
I saw his diagnosis.

511
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,576
It wouldn't be strange
even if he had a stroke.

512
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,417
So well…

513
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,126
Don't worry.

514
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,835
He's still breathing.

515
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,352
I'm only going to paralyze him for a bit.

516
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,524
A forced coma.

517
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,112
Sis.

518
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,238
In case I'll do something to you,

519
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,569
he's making a fuss.

520
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,292
It's a little touching.

521
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,752
Meanwhile, you're busy
backing away once again.

522
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,510
Help me, Jin.

523
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,720
Please.

524
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,937
Jin.

525
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,294
Darn it.

526
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,495
You know what?

527
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,245
I've decided to keep you alive.

528
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,802
I might feel happier

529
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,761
to see you alive and unhappy.

530
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,231
Here's a message from Eun Hyesoo.

531
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:37,821
At least the person you love is alive.

532
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,321
Stay by his side all your life,

533
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,326
attending to him on his sickbed.

534
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,868
This is

535
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,955
where you belong.

536
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,564
PATIENT NAME: KWON HYUNJO

537
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,660
We've been ordered to transfer him
to the prosecution right away.

538
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,790
That means
they've decided how to handle him.

539
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,830
The investigation was done perfectly.
We got enough evidence too.

540
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,079
Now the rest…

541
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,840
It's not up to us.

542
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,752
Ms. Kwon?

543
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,582
We meet again, Mr. Ha.

544
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,383
We sure have a tight connection, don't we?

545
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,921
You ended up coming back.

546
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,844
Life goes the way it is.

547
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,894
Everything has its place.

548
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,677
Did you find your new master?

549
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,184
No, I chose my new master.

550
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,814
MS. KWON: Go to the office.

551
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:23,154
The master is there.

552
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,023
HYESOO: Hello.

553
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,564
I might be inattentive to the garden
for the time being.

554
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,107
I plan on being busy.

555
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:14,027
I'm sorry about what happened
to Prosecutor Song.

556
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,464
What is that?

557
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,459
It's the Adamas.

558
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,048
You recklessly
brought the Adamas here like this?

559
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,092
Well, it's not that precious to me.

560
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,135
I thought our deal was off.

561
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,233
Mr. Lee was caught,

562
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,442
but it went very differently
from what we agreed upon.

563
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,529
Or do you want to offer a new deal?

564
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,939
Mr. Lee.

565
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,832
Don't touch him. Keep him alive.

566
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,083
I'll make him stand trial for sure.

567
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,920
That's the reason why I want him alive.

568
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,337
You're fighting a hard battle.

569
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,876
You never take the easy path.

570
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,054
I know.

571
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,219
It's a hard battle
that's impossible to win.

572
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,184
However,

573
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,854
I won't give up.

574
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,937
How annoying.

575
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,312
You just don't change, Mr. Ha.

576
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,823
Fine.

577
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,396
Do as you wish. I'll be rooting for you.

578
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,737
Ms. Eun.

579
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,616
Can I

580
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,208
trust you?

581
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,461
I didn't think you trusted me.

582
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,213
I rather had expectations.

583
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,090
That within Haesong, you of all people

584
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,216
would have a decent heart.

585
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,387
Mr. Ha,

586
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,309
we won't see each other again, will we?

587
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,694
No,

588
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,817
we will meet again.

589
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,279
When we do, we'll be on opposite sides.

590
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,239
It'd be my pleasure.

591
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,531
What's going on?

592
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,236
If we take you to the prosecution,
you'll be sentenced heavily.

593
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,491
Because public sentiment
shouldn't be neglected.

594
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,451
But you'll be under our protection.

595
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,156
If you don't like that, get off.

596
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,502
And disappear.

597
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,956
Once you get out of this car,
we can't guarantee your safety.

598
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,091
You'll be solely on your own.

599
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,593
Make a choice.

600
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,471
Bye.

601
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,309
I'll see you again next time.

602
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,120
DONGRIM:
"Team A? What are they, the Mafia?"

603
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,130
"Why don't you just claim
that Haesong created the world?"

604
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,630
"This reporter is awfully imaginative."

605
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,417
"I guess Haesong didn't pay her off."

606
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,470
"Reporters aren't judges."

607
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,932
"I'll stay neutral
until the ruling is out."

608
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,814
These people are crazy.

609
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,269
She wrote a true story,
and their opinions differ drastically.

610
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,058
Mr. Ha. Where are you going?

611
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,977
THE PROSECUTION DIGS UP
ARES' MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS

612
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,855
HAESONG GROUP DECIDES TO SELL OFF ARES

613
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,077
Haesong is slipping through.

614
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,340
It's funny

615
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:21,918
how people are.

616
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,183
They don't believe a true story,

617
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,845
and they easily believe
a fabricated story.

618
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,893
Once again, I'm realizing

619
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,654
that the truth holds no power

620
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,275
unless people believe it.

621
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,704
We've tried to reveal the truth thus far.

622
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,452
Now we will try to make people believe it.

623
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,158
Do you have any ideas?

624
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,041
Thanks to you,
I've realized what I should do.

625
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,673
I'm going to write a book.

626
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,142
They think the truth
is a fictitious story.

627
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,469
So I plan to go the other way.

628
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:15,810
"This story is entirely irrelevant
to what actually happened."

629
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,603
What if I stress that?

630
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,646
Then people might wonder

631
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,435
what actually happened
and who was involved.

632
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,948
They will start looking.

633
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,582
Will it be about what we experienced?

634
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,674
Yes.

635
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,841
About the owner of the Adamas.

636
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,503
REPORTER:
<i>As the initial trial has been set,</i>

637
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:23,422
<i>some say that the prosecution's
investigations may have been done hastily.</i>

638
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,758
-Welcome.
-How are you, Dongrim?

639
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,473
I'm fine as always.

640
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,102
How are you?

641
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,222
I'm well.

642
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,767
Where is Mr. Ha?

643
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,185
He stepped out.

644
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,734
He wanted to interview me
