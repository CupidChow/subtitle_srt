Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,

twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

6
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,815
There are 29 barrels in total.

7
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm sure this isn't everything.

8
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,236
I'll go with him.

9
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,422
What is this place?

10
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,125
A place where the clear-out team

11
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,463
disposed of the bodies.

12
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,590
There's also a sea nearby

13
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,469
where they could just toss them.

14
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,352
Don't you find it odd
that they just left this place as is?

15
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,098
They didn't even hesitate to blow up

16
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,894
the ARES headquarters
after its location was exposed.

17
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,651
Judging by the looks
of this place, I think it's decades old.

18
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,361
They must've forgotten about this place

19
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,113
when the management support department
was changed to Team A.

20
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,605
That's not what I mean.

21
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,742
If they were planning
to blow this place up

22
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,824
but simply forgot about it…

23
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,330
Then this building must have explosives
installed as well.

24
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,371
That way, they could blow it up
if an emergency arises.

25
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,183
Please pick up, Suhyeon.

26
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,953
Wait. Let me bring my gear.

27
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,405
No, let's make this quick.

28
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,877
TEXT ME. IT'S URGENT

29
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,929
Prosecutor Song Suhyeon.

30
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,930
Who are you?

31
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,643
We're from Kangchun Police Station.

32
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,812
I see. I'm…

33
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,395
How may I help you?

34
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,019
You know Lee Changwoo, right?

35
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,856
You visited him before.
He broke out of prison.

36
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,822
You were the last person to have met him,

37
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,493
so I wanted to ask you
if you had noticed anything in particular.

38
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,738
Not really.

39
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,947
How did he escape?

40
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,365
While being transferred
to a higher-security prison,

41
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,754
he murdered the guards and fled.

42
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,629
<i>We think that there may be
someone helping him.</i>

43
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,505
Over here.

44
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,506

THIS IS BAD! SOMETHING'S UP

47
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,732
WHERE ARE YOU?
DIRECTOR EUN RUSHED OVER TO THE CHAIRMAN

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,020
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER

49
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,859
What is going on?

50
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,155
It's the chairman!

51
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,200
Move aside.

52
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,537
Move!

53
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,709
Father.

54
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,419
He passed away.

55
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,176
Father.

56
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,357
Father.

57
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,692
Father…

58
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,453
The cause of death was sepsis.

59
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,776
The infection had spread
throughout his body.

60
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,084
-Father…
-There was nothing I could do.

61
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,243
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,997
Father…

63
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,344
Father…

64
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,755
One could think those tears are genuine.

65
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,637
Are you mourning?

66
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,822
Of course.

67
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,729
My father passed away.

68
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,240
Did you kill him?

69
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,912
This was sooner than I expected.

70
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,583
Was this also a part of your plan
or something impulsive?

71
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,455
His condition had worsened post-surgery.

72
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,343
Plus, he was also chronically ill.

73
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,551
Shut up.

74
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,220
What? Hyunjo.

75
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,929
Shut up and get lost.

76
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,056
-Sepsis?

77
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,139
If you lift that blanket,

78
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,324
you'll have to take responsibility

79
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,863
for everything that'll happen afterward.

80
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,380
You prepared well.

81
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,013
All right. Keep up the good work.

82
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,635
See you soon.

83
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,774
Move.

84
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,364
Call the funeral department.
They should get ready.

85
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,924
Summon the management support department.

Well, I'm sure
you didn't gather us here to mourn.

There's someone I'd like to introduce.

00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,758
You all know her, right?

164
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,228
She's the VIP that we, Team A,
will be supporting from now on.

165
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,227
Mr. Lee, I'm a bit offended.

166
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,573
We're told to serve one person

167
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,068
then another.

168
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,951
Do you think
we're a pack of dogs or something?

169
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,240
You're mistaken.

170
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,040
Had I thought you were dogs,
I wouldn't have come here myself.

171
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,964
I would like us to accompany one another.

172
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,586
However, I thought
I should make it clear...

173
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,382
that I'm the one holding the leash.

174
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,675
All right, then.

175
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,176
I hope we get along.

176
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,857
SUN

177
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,874
Hey, it's me.

178
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,746
Something baffling just happened.

179
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,590
Who do you think mobilized
the management support department?

180
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,469
So that's been taken care of.
What about Haesong's directorate?

181
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,023
It'll go as planned.

182
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,654
I gave you what you wanted,
so I should get what I want.

183
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,990
I only had one condition.

184
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,320
I know.
There's someone you were dying to kill.

185
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,329
Did you say you needed my help?

186
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,620
-Yes.
-And who is this person?

187
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,834
The bastard that killed my brother.

188
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,747
Song Suhyeon.

189
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,376
Any thoughts on this?
Do you feel any guilt?

190
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,679
Hey, Mr. Former Team A.

191
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,012
The derailment of a Hwangju-bound train
in 1986 that killed 31 individuals.

192
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,138
The fire at Hotel Geummyung in 1987
that killed 12 individuals.

193
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,402
-Who knew Team A was behind these?

194
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,189
A family of six also died,

195
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,943
faked as a car accident.

196
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,315
The major shareholders of ARES
are responsible for them.

197
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,744
We just need to expose them
to the rest of the world.

198
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,454
That'll be useless.

199
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,701
Haesong will just cut them off.

200
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,496
That's why we have to get the body.

201
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,330
At Chairman Kwon's funeral.

202
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,004
They'll all be there. Then we'll--

203
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,384
Why are we targeting them?

204
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,130
So what if
the statute of limitations has expired?

205
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,551
Does that make them innocent?

206
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,888
What a load of garbage.

207
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,430
Lieutenant Choi.

208
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,927
I'll go.

209
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,613
REPORTER KIM SEOHEE

210
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,198
Yes?

211
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,655
Ms. Kim.

212
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,038
Ms. Kim?

213
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,117
Ms. Kim.

214
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,250
Seohee.

215
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,054
Seohee?

216
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,802
<i>Prosecutor Song.</i>

217
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,335
You startled me.
Why didn't you say anything?

218
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,346
If I could go back to that day,

219
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,387
what choice should I have made?

220
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,145
That day? What day?

221
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,941
<i>The day I visited you for the first time.</i>

222
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,067
I only started this
thinking it was the right thing to do.

223
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,780
But things are getting worse...

224
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,739
and more dangerous.

225
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,959
I agree. This isn't easy.

226
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,334
Nothing is going our way.

227
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,875
Maybe we shouldn't have started this
from the get-go.

228
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,183
-Ms. Kim.
<i>-My parents were eventually killed</i>

229
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,296
<i>because I had told my dad</i>

230
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,890
after witnessing that incident.

231
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,944
Who will fall victim

232
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,312
this time around?

233
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,942
I'm so terrified.

234
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,032
<i>Is something going on?
Where are you?</i>

235
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,868
<i>The SIH says they're going
to eliminate Team A.</i>

236
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,488
But in fact,

237
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,250
they're the ones who'll get killed.

238
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,999
We're all aware of that.

239
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,835
Let's talk in person.
I'll go to wherever you are.

240
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,132
What about you?

241
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,394
You'd make the same decision
even if you could turn back time, right?

242
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,143
And so would you.

243
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,943
<i>Even if we could turn back time,</i>

244
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,019
<i>we'll still end up doing the same thing.</i>

245
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,816
Do you really believe that?

246
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

247
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,408
So where are you?
I'll head over right now.

248
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,658
I visited Hwang Byungchul
at the hospital today.

249
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,420
And I ran into a doctor
that I vaguely remembered seeing

250
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,878
when I was kidnapped.

251
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,835
<i>Feeling suspicious, I tailed his car.</i>

252
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,310
I think this was where I was.

253
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,228
Where you were kept after being kidnapped?

254
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,623
He's driving me crazy.

255
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,544
Sir, I know there are things
we must do to apprehend Team A.

256
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,253
But we shouldn't punish them ourselves.

257
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,133
Just let me get rid of them, will you?

258
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,340
You always talked about how
the outcome wasn't our goal.

259
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,340
Our goal is to apprehend Team A,
not punish them.

260
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,175
What I mean is, we should expose them.

261
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,012
How long will we do this covertly?

262
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,604
People should know

263
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,641
what we've been doing
and whom we've been up against.

264
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,846
But…

265
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,361
I found it.

266
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,152
I think I found it. The black site.

267
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,989
It used to be
a Haesong training institute.

268
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,491
It was a resort once,
but it's an abandoned building now.

269
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,911
So that's where those Team A bastards are?

270
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,080
Okay. Let's ambush them.

271
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,328
You can't go in there.

272
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,127
Why not?

273
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,748
I'm sure there's an underground site.
If you fail to enter,

274
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,513
Code Black will activate.

275
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,048
The building...

276
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,551
will explode.

277
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,269
So we shouldn't raid them
solely out of fear of dying?

278
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,484
We should still do it.

279
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,435
It's not about dying.

280
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,685
An explosion will get rid
of all the evidence.

281
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,567
If they realize
that we know where they are--

282
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,744
They'll get rid of the place
and hide elsewhere.

283
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,532
This is driving me nuts.

284
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,538
Then how about this?

285
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,790
First, we lure them all out.

286
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,543
After that, we'll go inside
and secure the evidence.

287
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,035
How will we lure them out?

288
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,297
I'll do it.

289
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,962
I was the one who shot Kwon Jaekyu.

290
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,548
They'll come running after me.

291
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,842
Are you going there to kill them
or to get killed instead?

292
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,009
Ms. Kim was right.

293
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,555
You should stop here.

294
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,643
-What do you mean?
-You don't seem like

295
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,345
you have a plan. You just look reckless.

296
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,518
Simply put, you look like
you've given up everything.

297
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,606
-You bastard.
-Stay strong.

298
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,322
If you can't,
you'll bring all of us down with you.

299
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,635
I'm almost there. Come out.

300
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,913
You should've just come up.
Why did you make me come out?

301
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,333
So? What is it?

302
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,998
Some detectives visited me.

303
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,551
Detectives?

304
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,049
They were looking for Lee Changwoo.

305
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,675
Really? That's quick.

306
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,385
Since it wouldn't have been easy
to escape singlehandedly,

307
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,022
they think someone is helping him.

308
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,893
This is getting out of hand.

309
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,096
I hope the SIH
won't be held responsible for everything.

310
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,806
Hurry and put an end to this.

311
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,016
That's what I want as well,
and I'm working on it.

312
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,105
How about this?

313
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,829
I'm planning to make a deal with Ms. Eun.

314
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,830
She can hand over Team Leader Lee.

315
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,003
That's useless.

316
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,170
That deal is only valid
once we find the Adamas.

317
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,009
Suhyeon.

318
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,774
Did you find it?

319
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,443
-I think so.
-You think so?

320
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,060
I haven't checked yet.

321
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,027
Then you should've done that
instead of coming here.

322
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,440
Where is it? Let's go.

323
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,069
Suhyeon.

324
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,490
About that figurine Dad bought…

325
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,417
Where is it?

326
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,585
What are you talking about?

327
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,508
That night,

328
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,184
the person who left that at our house…

329
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,435
wasn't Dad.

330
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,492
It was Lee Changwoo.

331
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:41,082
The Adamas is inside the figurine.

332
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,284
Is it true what Woosin just told me?

333
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,366
Answer me!

334
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,245
I'm sorry.

335
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,593
Please turn a blind eye to it.

336
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,260
Things will get even more dangerous
if word gets out.

337
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,586
Are you insane?

338
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,594
How could you put that
in your young son's gift?

339
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,514
Had Chairman Kwon found out,
we would've all died.

340
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,274
It was in here all along,
yet you said you hid it?

341
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,941
I couldn't tell you.

342
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,937
If I had, it would've put you
in even greater danger.

343
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,855
And you were the one
who put this dangerous object in here.

344
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,945
You put us in danger!

345
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,659
I didn't think anyone would know.

346
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,831
After catching Junkyung,

347
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,580
I was going to return it.

348
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,123
What a load of nonsense.

349
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,626
Are you kidding me?

350
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,709
Suhyeon.

351
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,632
Song Suhyeon.

352
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,512
Damn it!

353
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,986
This is just ridiculous.

354
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,213
The very Adamas that determined
who lived and died

355
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,709
was in my room all along.

356
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,904
It's better off this way.

357
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,490
I feel relieved.

358
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,453
Now that I know
you were the one who gave this to me,

359
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,239
I don't care anymore.

360
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,121
Not one bit.

361
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,801
Was this why...

362
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,885
you never told anyone
where the Adamas was?

363
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,886
I wanted him to remember it…

364
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,269
as his father's last gift.

365
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,034
No. You shouldn't have done that.

366
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,078
Do you know why I began all of this?

367
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,374
It wasn't because of Mother's dying wish

368
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,207
or because you were my real father.

369
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,342
I wanted to find the real culprit
behind my father's murder.

370
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,594
But to be more honest, it was for Suhyeon.

371
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,984
<i>He was always tormented by guilt.</i>

372
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,899
<i>He believed our father had died
because of him.</i>

373
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,404
He thought…

374
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,907
our late father
had given him that figurine.

375
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,084
Despite being poor,
he managed to buy him that.

376
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,331
He went there that night to get his money
and died because of it.

377
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,335
That's what Suhyeon believed.

378
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,675
If it wasn't for you,
my father wouldn't have…

379
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,716
No.

380
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,057
If it wasn't for me…

381
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,782
If it wasn't for me,
my father wouldn't have…

382
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,197
He wouldn't have…

383
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,956
It was all because of me.

384
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,216
<i>Suhyeon was punishing himself.</i>

385
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,685
He didn't reminisce
the good memories he had with our father.

386
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,187
He just blamed himself for everything.

387
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,605
He told himself that countless times.

388
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,065
But it was actually you
who left that at our house?

389
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,754
I was the one…

390
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,999
who ruined everything.

391
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,133
You're right. It was you.

392
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,589
A part of me is relieved

393
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,183
that Suhyeon will no longer blame himself.

394
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,016
But that's pretty much the only good news.

395
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,521
And he'll still be in pain

396
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,478
because…

397
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,821
he'll despise you forever.

398
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,624
I've found a way to lure Team A.

399
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,366
How?

400
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,169
We'll make a deal with Eun Hyesoo.

401
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,589
-A deal?
We'll ask her to hand over Lee.

402
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,884
I found the real Adamas.

403
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,389
Are you sure?

404
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,651
I'm telling you. Mr. Lee is still alive.

405
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,940
How could that be? He was--

406
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,694
Is that what you're curious about?

407
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,777
Are you not curious about who saved him?

408
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,038
Eun Hyesoo.

409
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,997
So?

410
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,457
So what's the next order?

411
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,591
Kill them.

412
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,742
Get rid of all these flowers.

413
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,908
-Pardon?
-We said we wanted a small funeral.

414
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,998
Following the deceased's wishes.

415
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,384
Make it shabby.

416
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,551
The shabbiest funeral imaginable.

417
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,520
You must be delighted

418
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,692
since you've finally reunited with Minjo.

419
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,194
I'm trying to understand you

420
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,025
and believe that the owner of Haesong…

421
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,373
has no choice
but to have blood on their hands.

422
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,117
We finally feel like a family.

423
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,211
Goodbye,

424
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,586
Father.

425
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,572
How brave of you

426
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,784
to come all the way here.

427
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,164
They said he died
of a chronic illness despite getting shot.

428
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,744
Are you the new owner of Haesong already?

429
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,787
You've already learned
how to bury the truth.

430
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,211
I didn't learn it. It was instinctive.

431
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,128
I didn't know you had such an instinct.

432
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,130
That instinct made me eligible
to become the next chairman.

433
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,263
Eligible?

434
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,837
It feels like
I'm talking to Chairman Kwon.

435
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,177
I'll take that as a compliment.

436
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,934
So why did you want to see me?

437
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,305
What is this secret rendezvous for?

438
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,064
Let's make a deal.

439
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,107
Hand over Team Leader Lee.

440
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,863
I found the real Adamas.

441
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,571
You did?

442
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,827
Does it seem like I'm lying?

443
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,198
I thought maybe you'd want it
for yourself.

444
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,913
Just like Mr. Lee, your father,

445
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,705
and everyone else who wanted it.

446
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,376
Not at all.

447
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,384
All I ever wanted

448
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,184
was to find the Adamas,
the cause of everything.

449
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,053
Now that I've found it,
I should catch and punish

450
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,599
Team Leader Lee, the real killer.

451
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,062
I believe you. But one question.

452
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,483
If I hand him over to you,

453
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,244
will you be able to catch him?

454
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,112
Are you confident?

455
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,030
Leave that up to me.

456
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,325
The SIH?

457
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,381
All right, then.
Give me the time and place.

458
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,001
It'll be 3 p.m. tomorrow.

459
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,207
Room nine at the funeral hall.

460
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,215
What happened to your hand?

461
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,555
It's none of your concern.

462
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,283
Goodbye, Mr. Ha.

463
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,504
I didn't expect...

464
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,838
to help you this soon.

465
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,087
-A deal?
<i>With Mr. Ha.</i>

466
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:51,056
I agreed to hand you over
and get the Adamas.

467
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,178
Me? Hand me over?

468
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,733
How honest of you. What are you scheming?

469
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,612
This is our chance to eliminate the SIH.

470
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,152
Right. That's true.

471
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,065
And Song Suhyeon may be there.

472
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,243
<i>I've kept my end of the bargain.</i>

473
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,909
Yes, you have. Well done.

474
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,550
Song Suhyeon.

475
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,384
Joonho? Your brother's here.

476
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,137
Wake up.

477
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,010
Hey. Open your eyes.

478
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,392
So it was all because of that.

479
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,807
It does look incredible.

480
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,190
Stop staring, or you'll pay for it.

481
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,938
Will Ms. Eun cooperate?

482
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,698
I doubt Team Leader Lee
will get fooled that easily.

483
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,279
We'll have to try.

484
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,412
We'll finally put an end to everything.

485
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,158
This will begin and end with the Adamas.

486
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,502
Woosin.

487
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,714
Did you meet with Eun Hyesoo?

488
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,047
Yes, I did.

489
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,755
I told her the time and place.

490
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,222
Good job.

491
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,510
My heart feels heavy
that I dragged you into this.

492
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,188
Don't be. I started all of this anyway.

493
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,523
So it's only right that I finish it.

494
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,113
How did we get into this mess?

495
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,907
Suhyeon, are you okay?

496
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:36,986
What do you mean?

497
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,080
No, I'm not okay.

498
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,004
I feel wronged, and it's driving me crazy.

499
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,337
I had been blaming myself every day
ever since Dad passed away.

500
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,890
But then again, I've been liberated.

501
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,938
Don't worry about your big brother.
That's not your job.

502
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,016
Suhyeon, Lee Changwoo--

503
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,534
Don't talk about him
being our real father.

504
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,689
I've only known one father.

505
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,909
Once this is over,
I'm going to dig into everything

506
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,617
related to him.

507
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,960
He should pay for his crimes.

508
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,419
I hope you won't do that.

509
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,999
He must pay.

510
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,464
I agree,
but you shouldn't take part in it.

511
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,705
No, I will punish him.

512
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,046
I won't stop you
if you're doing this as a prosecutor.

513
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,262
But I know

514
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,930
you're doing this as his son.

515
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,965
His son? Me?

516
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,306
Are you crazy?

517
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,391
You just want to punish him out of guilt

518
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,441
toward the victims.

519
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,025
Damn it.

520
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,742
Because you consider him your real father.

521
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,451
No. Never.

522
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,292
But you must consider him so,

523
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,198
seeing how you're acting as a mediator.

524
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,535
-Suhyeon--
-Stop it.

525
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,634
It's already upsetting as is.

526
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,460
I can't believe he's my father.

527
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,255
Even if I deny it, I'm still his son.

528
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,169
Why did he show up now, looking like that?

529
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,008
Why couldn't he have lived better?

530
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,178
I'll never forgive him.

531
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,494
You don't need to.

532
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,945
You can despise him.

533
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,041
You're allowed to.

534
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,352
I hope you won't be in pain for too long…

535
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,733
unlike me.

536
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,261
That hurts.

537
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,632
Do you mean that?

538
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,072
Suhyeon.

539
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,066
He wants us to use him for this mission.

540
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,162
That's what Lee Changwoo said?

541
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,543
He wants to help. What do you say?

542
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,077
Sure. I considered that too.

543
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,085
A battle between the two Team As,
past and present.

544
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,219
Will you be okay?

545
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,548
Of course.

546
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,433
But first, I need you to do me a favor.

547
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,983
If we want to catch all of them,

548
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,822
we need all the agents
to gather at the funeral hall.

549
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:03,197
In that case, Team Leader Lee
needs to know that we've set up a trap.

550
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,658
You want us to reveal our plan to them?

551
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,200
"The disbanded infiltration team
is fully armed

552
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,164
to catch Team Leader Lee."

553
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,536
Once the SIH hears this,

554
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,423
the spies will make their move.

555
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,251
We need to reveal all of our cards

556
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,587
<i>for Team A to make their move.</i>

557
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,098
Okay. Are you sure?

558
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,097
All right.

559
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,439
Okay. Got it.

560
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,477
Okay.

561
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,623
Sir, I just got some intel.

562
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,004
The SIH is going to make a move tomorrow.

563
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,002
Sir?

564
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,796
They must be serious.

565
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,051
Summon all the boys.

566
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,716
All of them?

567
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,063
Why? Can you not do that?

568
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,194
No, sir. I'll get on it.

569
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,230
Our plan is simple.

570
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,108
There are two ways to enter
the basement floor of the funeral hall.

571
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,664
The underground parking lot
and the way from the main hospital.

572
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,870
We'll take the latter.

573
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,529
Room nine is where we'll meet.

574
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,078
Ms. Eun will send Team Leader Lee there.

575
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,582
Meanwhile, you will distract them.

576
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,424
The police will come
after hearing gunshots,

577
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,669
and they'll arrest you.

578
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,712
It needs to be recorded
as an official police operation.

579
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,295
It needs to look like Team A
helped him escape prison.

580
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,380
I'm glad

581
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,966
that I can help.

582
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,137
Don't think
this will atone for all your sins.

583
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,693
Of course not. This is only the beginning.

584
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,185
There's one more thing we need.

585
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,954
<i>License plate number 2365 is approaching.</i>

586
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,162
Clear.

587
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,542
Are you okay?

588
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,963
I am.

589
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,341
So where is the Adamas?

590
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,426
-In there.
-Where's Lee Changwoo?

591
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,181
I knew it. You're not okay.

592
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,854
Don't try too hard to forgive him.

593
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,095
What's sad is sad.

594
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,404
What's heartbreaking is heartbreaking.

595
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,611
What's wrong is wrong.

596
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,441
No matter how much I regret it…

597
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,570
No matter how much I loved my dad,

598
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,912
he did make a mistake.

599
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,793
So don't try too hard to forgive him.

600
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,457
All right.

601
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,748
I'm really fine. Don't worry.

602
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,167
I'll no longer worry about you either.

603
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,389
You said you'd make the same decision
even if you could turn back time.

604
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,641
In that case, we have no choice
but to end this fight.

605
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,387
We started this, so we're going to end it.

606
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,146
Stop beating around the bush
and just be straightforward.

607
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,111
It's pathetic.

608
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,493
I need you to be

609
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,081
a witness once again.

610
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,747
Pardon?

611
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,538
That's the key to arresting Lee Changwoo.

612
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,461
A witness.

613
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,376
We need someone who can broadcast it
to the world in real-time.

614
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,419
Fighting under the radar is meaningless?

615
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,877
You want to reveal everything?

616
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,887
Haesong needs to be unveiled

617
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,469
so Team A can no longer bury the truth.

618
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,569
<i>Following the election on the 28th,</i>

619
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,400
<i>Candidate Noh Jungwan of the Third Party
was elected the next president.</i>

620
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:59,117
<i>Of the 56% of the votes counted,</i>

621
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,539
<i>President-elect Noh received 42.39%.</i>

622
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,289
<i>The people have chosen him</i>

623
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,212
<i>as the new leader of the country
for the next five years.</i>

624
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,421
<i>Onto the next report…</i>

625
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,211
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER FUNERAL HOME

626
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,034
Thank you for coming.

627
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,951
We ought to come, ma'am.

628
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,820
Goodbye.

629
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,517
Father.

630
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,654
I'm the best son one could ever have.

631
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,688
I'll make Hyesoo pay…

632
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,569
for what she's done to you.

633
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,324
Would you have complimented me

634
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,035
had you still been alive?

635
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,542
At least you'll have company
in the afterlife.

636
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,983
Hi.

637
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,858
Offering your condolences?

638
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,735
As if.

639
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,572
Why do you think I'm here?

640
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,622
Are you here to see me?

641
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,622
What a pity.

642
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,671
I wanted our friendship to last.

643
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,221
Did Hyunjo put you up to this?

644
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,889
Any last words?

645
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,071
I feel wronged.

646
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,574
The rumor that I had run away
during the bombing

647
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,074
is untrue.

648
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,200
Do you mean you were slandered?

649
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,833
Please elaborate.

650
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,449
Who is responsible for that?

651
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,580
Haesong.

652
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,417
Why would they do that?

653
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,391
They wanted to retaliate.

654
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,472
The Kangchun Penitentiary case
was planned.

655
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,267
They disguised their real purpose

656
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:16,020
and made it seem like
it was for my death penalty pledge.

657
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,063
Once I learned of this

658
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,938
and declined,

659
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,025
they were determined
to drop me from the election.

660
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,451
Simply put,

661
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,907
the Kangchun Penitentiary case
had nothing to do

662
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,201
with the death penalty system
but something else.

663
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:37,174
Correct. One of the victims
was related to Haesong.

664
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,670
They wanted to get rid of him.

665
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,630
And that man is…

666
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,087
Hwang Byungchul is exposing everything
during a press conference.

667
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,056
DO NOT RELEASE ANYTHING
HWANG BYUNGCHUL SAID

668
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,428
<i>No matter what
Hwang Byungchul says about Haesong,</i>

669
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,805
<i>the reporters won't report it.</i>

670
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,022
<i>Rather, they'll cover it up
with other news.</i>

671
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,475
<i>Let's use that to our advantage.</i>

672
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,226
<i>Lee Changwoo's arrest will be our bait.</i>

673
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,617
DO NOT RELEASE ANYTHING
HWANG BYUNGCHUL SAID

674
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,440
This could be your last mission.

675
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,186
Now's your cue to leave if you want.
I mean it.

676
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,609
What do you mean?

677
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,525
What?

678
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,664
Where would we go?

679
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,241
We have no names or friends.

680
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,160
Let's put an end to this.

681
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,129
-Thanks.

682
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,887
Enough with the drama. Let's hurry up.

683
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,314
Wait.

684
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,733
Hold on. Wait.

685
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,439
Wait!

686
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,113
-Wait…

687
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,653
-Go back inside.

688
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,238
Hurry up!

689
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,409
Go!

690
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,285
Let's go inside.

691
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,298
-You two, cover from downstairs.
-Yes, sir.

692
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,222
The rest of you, follow me! This way!

693
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,810
Move!

694
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,781
Behind the pillar!

695
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,553
Sir!

696
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,471
-No! Come to your senses!
-Damn it!

697
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,976
Over here!

698
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,315
Stay awake!

699
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,451
Move in!

700
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,091
Damn it!

701
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,484
-Move aside.
-Open up!

702
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,493
Damn it!

703
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,778
Something is wrong.

704
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,781
No one knew about this except for us.

705
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,413
Who leaked this information?

706
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,042
They pulled one over on us.

707
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,500
Damn it!

708
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,409
-Han.
-Come here.

709
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,473
Open up, you bastards!

710
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,101
Hey! Stand by.

711
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,885
Move.

712
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,265
Should I bring the gear?

713
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,728
No, just wait.

714
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,241
What's going on?
Why are they suddenly quiet?

715
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,786
What are they doing outside?

716
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:03,551
Once that door opens,
stand behind me, Woosin.

717
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,199
Drop your gun.

718
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,209
Drop your guns!

719
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,627
It was you.

720
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,299
Drop your guns and open the door.

721
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,420
You bastard.

722
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,548
Do you want to see him dead?

723
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,474
Calm down. All of you.

724
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,812
-Shoot him.
-Don't shoot him.

725
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,560
Shoot him.

726
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,016
You little…

727
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,780
It'll all be over once the door opens.

728
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,189
So just shoot him.

729
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,613
You bastard.

730
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,525
Kick down the door.

731
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,150
Lee Changwoo.

732
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,091
Woosin.

733
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,520
No.

734
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,557
Taesung. Mr. Han. Are you guys okay?

735
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,225
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. We're okay.

736
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:34,906
Prosecutor Song.

737
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,503
Mr. Ha?

738
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,463
Where's Prosecutor Song?

739
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,501
Suhyeon

740
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,462
is at Team A's B site.

741
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:32,762
By himself?

742
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:10,627
He's not here.

743
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,880
Team Leader Lee wasn't here.

744
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,143
<i>Song Suhyeon, we finally meet.</i>

745
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,851
I've been wanting to meet you.

746
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,394
Something's not right.

747
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,475
It stopped. It's not moving.

748
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,193
<i>The order has been given.</i>

749
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,316
<i>I'm back,</i>

750
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,412
master.

751
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,408
<i>Mr. Ha, we won't see
each other again, will we?</i>

752
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,623
<i>We will meet again.</i>

753
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,157
<i>They've located Prosecutor Song's car.</i>

754
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,333
<i>I'll kill you today.</i>
