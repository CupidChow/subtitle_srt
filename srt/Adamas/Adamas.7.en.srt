PYEONGCHANG-GUN, GANGWON PROVINCE

6
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,377
That bastard.

7
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,588
How dare he go there?

8
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,309
- Who is it?
- I'm not expecting anyone.

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,773
Wait here.

10
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,959
Who is it?

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>I'm from the repair company.</i>

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,256
Water is leaking from your bathroom
to the apartment below.

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,717
But we never called you.

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>Wellâ€¦ That's strange.</i>

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,721
<i>One minute.</i>

16
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,641
<i>Hello?</i>

17
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>I'm at the studio apartment right now.</i>

18
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,063
<i>But the tenant said
he wasn't aware that I was coming.</i>

19
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,483
<i>Okay. Hold on. I'll put him on the phone.</i>

20
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,487
<i>Sir. Would you like to speak to her?</i>

21
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,201
One minute.

22
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,086
Here you go.

23
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,843
Hello?

24
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,513
Who is this?

25
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,100
Oh, Prosecutor Song.

26
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>- Of course I remember you.</i>
- Ah.

27
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,857
The maintenance office called.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,943
The tenant below complained
about a leak in the ceiling.

29
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,739
I found it odd because I knew
Mr. Ha wasn't home.

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,909
Goodness, don't be sorry.

31
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,287
Let's grab a meal sometime with Mr. Ha.

32
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,373
Okay. Goodbye.

33
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,129
But why is his brother there?

34
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,140
Hello, ma'am.

35
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,435
Ms. Lee, I was almost at the office

36
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,355
when I got into a car accident.
I think I'll just go home from here.

37
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,773
Is everything all right?

38
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,526
What? Who's there?

39
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,279
A reporter who came to interview Mr. Ha.

40
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,240
Apparently you knew about it.

41
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,659
What are you talking about? I knew?

42
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,370
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
What? When did he leave?

44
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,937
<i>Take a seat.</i>

45
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,194
What's there to talk about
in the chairman's office?

46
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,406
We'll be in trouble
if the chairman finds out.

47
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,494
If you're well aware of it,
why did you do that?

48
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,334
What were you doing here

49
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,212
at 10 p.m. yesterday?

50
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,931
Cat got your tongue?

51
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm asking you what you were doing here

52
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,773
at 10 p.m. last night.

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,901
Don't try to lie.

54
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,238
Mr. Kim over there
saw everything in real time.

55
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,160
I wasn't trying to tattle on you.

56
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,038
But she already knew about it.

57
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,873
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,292
You're sorry? Why would you apologize?

59
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,627
Are you two scheming something?

60
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,298
No, ma'am. We're not.

61
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,760
Then why did you lie for him?

62
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,429
Why did you lie
and tell Mr. Park that it was me?

63
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,474
Because...

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,601
This has nothing to do with him.

65
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,270
Mm.

66
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,275
So you were up to something.

67
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,865
All right. Then what did you do here...

68
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,369
all by yourself?

69
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,704
Answer me.

70
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,176
Charles XIII Rare Cask.

71
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,184
The king of cognac.

72
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,814
I wanted a taste of that limited edition.

73
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,154
So you're telling me that
you secretly drank the chairman's liquor?

74
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,032
It was merely a small sip.
You can't even tell.

75
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,872
I had no idea. I was worried about you.

76
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,791
What's so funny?

77
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,168
You should've reported it to me
right away.

78
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,295
How dare you keep it from me?

79
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,757
You could get sacked for this.

80
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,716
Sacked?

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,680
Ms. Oh, please be merciful
and turn a blind eye to it this once.

82
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,433
I'll go by the rules.

83
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,769
Ms. Kwon will hear about this
as soon as she returns.

84
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,813
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

85
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,690
Please turn a blind eye just this once.

86
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,900
You've always adored me.

87
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,569
I did.

88
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,196
But this is strictly work-related.

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,698
Ms. Oh.

90
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,366
Let go.

91
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,330
What should I do?

92
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,414
When's the arrival time?

93
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,042
Ms. Kwon will arrive around 6 p.m.

94
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,544
Not her.

95
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,424
The toilet is usually the problem.

96
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,719
The leak occurs
when the silicone on the bottom falls off.

97
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,971
You knew exactly where the bathroom was.

98
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,765
You couldn't even see it
from the front door.

99
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry? All the buildings
around here are similar.

100
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,523
I often came
to this neighborhood for repairs.

101
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,326
You can wait outside.

102
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,454
I'm afraid this will take some time.

103
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,302
I don't trust him.

104
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,099
Why are you doing this?

105
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,478
Sir.

106
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,814
Hold on.

107
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
Wait.

108
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,112
Why are you doing this?

109
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,907
- Shut up.
- Why are you doing this?

110
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,743
What's going on?

111
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,500
Shut up.

112
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,337
Ma'am, please call the police. Okay?

113
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,880
Don't believe him.

114
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,633
I'm going to make him talk.

115
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,972
Prosecutor Song, why are you doing this?

116
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,515
They even attacked the SIH.

117
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,933
They'll get to us too.

118
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,561
But he's just here to fix something.
He's just a repairman.

119
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,729
He's being suspicious,
and the timing was strange.

120
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,981
Trust your gut instinct.

121
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,232
What if we're wrong?

122
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,111
That's possible.
But I've been right more often than not.

123
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,073
Sir, please don't hurt me.

124
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,826
Hey, you're from Team A, aren't you?

125
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,871
Team A? I work for a repair company.

126
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
Don't you dare lie.

127
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,585
Wait...

128
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,338
Damn it.

129
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,719
It's an emergency. I'm going in.

130
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,563
Tell me.

131
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,903
Look. There's nothing suspicious here.

132
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,615
What's all this?

133
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,783
They're components for the toilet.

134
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,368
I brought them just in case.

135
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,245
Weren't you trying to install a bug?

136
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,496
No, sir.

137
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
You're not fooling me.

138
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,791
- You little...
- Sir!

139
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,752
Stop this! Come to your senses!

140
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,046
You need to become a lunatic
to deal with one.

141
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,964
This is no time to mind my manners!

142
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,342
Keep this up, and I'm out.

143
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,345
Gosh.

144
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,139
Hey, spill the truth if you want to live.

145
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,352
I'm sorry for everything.

146
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,478
Who are you?

147
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,065
Answer me.

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,609
Who are you?

149
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,861
I'm a repairman.

150
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,239
So you want to take this all the way?

151
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,075
Fine.

152
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
Damn it.

153
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,871
Tell me.

154
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,167
You're smiling?

155
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,794
Look at you glaring at me.

156
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,337
- Go on.
- What?

157
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,464
Keep going.

158
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,928
Do you think Ha Woosin will be safe?

159
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,424
Did you just mention my brother?

160
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,400
You bastard.

161
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
Open up!

162
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,578
Open up!

163
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,623
Open up!

164
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,796
What took the SIH so long to come?

165
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,803
Damn you!

166
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,849
God, you're so slow.

167
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,768
We didn't want to believe it.
Were we bait?

168
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,520
Did you want Team A to find us?

169
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,163
You could've easily tracked us
with the cameras around the cabin,

170
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,649
but you were nowhere to be seen.

171
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,237
That's how we knew you were observing us.

172
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,948
You were waiting
for Team A to attack us first.

173
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,784
And this kid must be one of your guys.

174
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,416
Are you okay?

175
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,209
I'm sorry, sir.

176
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,504
Watch what you say, bastard.

177
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,508
Lead the way to headquarters.

178
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,179
It's not up to me.

179
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,055
I wasn't talking to you.

180
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,728
Are you listening, Mr. Kang?

181
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,105
Do you remember Dangsan Railway Bridge?

182
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,149
<i>I won't be fooled twice.</i>

183
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,611
Bring them over.

184
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,991
Get rid of all the footage on Song

185
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,910
since our operation fell through.

186
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,120
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,959
What's the point in doing Team A a favor?

188
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,921
They're slower than I thought.

189
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,178
Hello, sir.

190
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,305
Sir, we were a second too late.

191
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,024
You failed to get the last footage
of Song Suhyeon's whereabouts?

192
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,276
The SIH got their hands
on it first. I'm sorry.

193
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,573
Okay. It's all good.

194
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,618
- Sir?
- Things became simpler.

195
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,081
We just need to track the SIH
to get to Song Suhyeon.

196
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,748
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,585
This is Lee Changwoo's case file.

198
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,173
Is this it? Did you get everything?

199
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,510
We got the case file,
legal records, and evidence.

200
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,178
We got everything.

201
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,058
This photoâ€¦

202
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,246
Dispose of the rest. Do it yourself.

203
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,791
Yes, sir.

204
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,092
<i>I still don't have a clear answer.</i>

205
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,470
<i>I get that it's his job as a prosecutor.</i>

206
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,639
<i>But what about that writer?</i>

207
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,186
<i>Why is he so fixated on a case
from 22 years ago?</i>

208
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,856
<i>It's not like
his dead father will come back.</i>

209
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,026
<i>He wasn't even
their real father at that. So why?</i>

210
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,992
LEFT, WOOSIN
RIGHT, SUHYEON

211
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,619
The father...

212
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,080
couldn't differentiate the twins?

213
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,418
Song Soonho

214
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,547
had this photo with him
when he went to Lee Changwoo.

215
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,591
But why?

216
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,905
This is Security.

217
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,533
I see. Okay.

218
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,797
Phone three connects to the head office.

219
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,514
Mr. Kim.

220
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,105
Mr. Choi.

221
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,984
What was the call about
that you're rushing to the mansion?

222
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,362
Oh, that? It was nothing important.

223
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,162
What is that?

224
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,956
Drink up. It's chamomile tea.

225
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
What is it this time?

226
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,420
Jeez. Don't drink it if you don't want to.

227
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,213
Put it down.

228
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,137
Mr. Ha. About the Adamasâ€¦

229
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,640
What if you steal it and it turns out
not to be the murder weapon?

230
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,226
Then it's a failed op.

231
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,896
Why would you say that?
It's actually the opposite.

232
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,401
Can't we just sell it and split the money?

233
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,362
Lee Dongrim.

234
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,865
It's a helicopter.
The chairman must be back.

235
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,994
Wrong. Ms. Kwon wouldn't be coming late
if that was the chairman.

236
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,370
She'd be here already.

237
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,018
I was told that Ms. Eun would arrive soon.

238
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,814
So why were you headed
to the mansion after that call?

239
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,151
For Mr. Ha.

240
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,988
Mr. Ha?

241
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,325
Yes. He wanted to know
when she was arriving.

242
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,936
I'm tired. It's been a long day.

243
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,230
Should I run a bath?

244
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,648
Sounds great.

245
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,650
Right.

246
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,611
Where's Mr. Ha?

247
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,908
What? Ms. Hyesoo looked for Mr. Ha
as soon as she returned?

248
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,495
Yes, ma'am. She had a message
from the chairman.

249
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,289
- Which was?
- Sorry?

250
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,084
I'm not sure.

251
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,171
Why can't you be a decent spy

252
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,465
and know exactly what to do?

253
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,925
I'm sorry, ma'am.

254
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,510
Forget it. Get going.

255
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,181
Hurry up. Ms. Kwon will be here
any moment now.

256
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,859
Come in.

257
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,342
The Adamas isn't here.

258
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,969
Ms. Kwon took it.

259
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,970
I know.

260
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,722
You do?

261
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,101
I saw a jewelry designer's portfolio

262
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,104
in the chairman's office.

263
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,564
That means only one thing.

264
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,858
He wants to recraft it.

265
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,694
Well, you spoiled everything.

266
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,864
I went to Ms. Jang myself
to find out about that.

267
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,990
Patti Jang?

268
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,160
Yes.

269
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,705
But the Adamas
was moved elsewhere by the company.

270
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,044
Is the chairman stepping down
from his position?

271
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,130
Is his son taking over?

272
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,801
So that's it.

273
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,845
When my time is overâ€¦

274
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,807
The day I retire,
I will hand it over to my son.

275
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,976
Like a crown?

276
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,187
He has to inherit the symbol of Haesong

277
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,689
for him to be its rightful owner.

278
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,318
The 80th-anniversary ceremony
is probably the day,

279
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,654
given how they're rushing it.

280
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,572
I didn't know that.

281
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,200
Anyway, this is bad news.

282
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,953
The Adamas' shape will change
once it's recrafted.

283
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,556
Then it'll be meaningless
to compare it with the autopsy result.

284
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,334
What's your plan now?

285
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,213
I need to find out where it's stored
as soon as possible.

286
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,798
Before the recrafting begins.

287
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,882
Should I look into it?

288
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,053
No. Leave it up to us.

289
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,637
Us?

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,726
About Ms. Ohâ€¦

291
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,937
What about her?

292
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,565
Something happened this afternoon.

293
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,235
Can you help me?

294
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,363
With pleasure.

295
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,953
What is this?

296
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,455
It's a bribe.

297
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,623
A bribe?

298
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,201
My having a sip of the chairman's liquor
in his office.

299
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,170
Please sweep it under the rug.

300
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,840
How rude of you.

301
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,467
Are you trying to buy me off with this?

302
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,721
<i>She's been working as a maid
for the past 40 years.</i>

303
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,640
She has tended
to many conglomerate families.

304
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,269
Don't expect her to have a heart.

305
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,440
<i>She rarely bats an eye
at anything.</i>

306
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,485
<i>She's bold and cold-hearted.</i>

307
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,250
<i>You're saying someone like her was
Ms. Kwon's right hand for over a decade?</i>

308
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,422
Was everything fine?

309
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,177
Yes, ma'am.
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

310
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,473
<i>Why do you think
she has obeyed her all these years?</i>

311
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,655
This is just all in good faith.

312
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,334
Mm.

313
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,255
It'd be rude of me to decline.

314
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,802
I may reject a bribe
but not something given in good faith.

315
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,430
I'll give you a freebie
since this is our first deal.

316
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,938
I'm just saying this out of kindness.

317
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,982
Be wary of Ms. Yoon.

318
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,859
Ms. Yoon?

319
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,279
She was the one who recommended you.

320
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,122
<i>Ms. Yoon?</i>

321
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,999
Yes. That's what Ms. Oh said.
I don't know why though.

322
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,524
It all worked out for the best.
I finally find out who it was.

323
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,550
What a funny girl.

324
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,677
Something come to mind?

325
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,097
I may be the reasonâ€¦

326
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,393
why Ms. Yoon recommended you.

327
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,255
MY LOVE

328
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,799
TO MY BELOVED SISTER

329
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,280
TO MY BELOVED SISTER

330
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,249
PERSONA NON GRATA
BY HA WOOSIN

331
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,340
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
HA WOOSIN

332
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,355
What a cute hobby he has.

333
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,485
Hi, Prosecutor Song.

334
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,321
Is your owner...

335
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,448
a twin?

336
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,828
Which one is Song Suhyeon?

337
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,915
Him? Or him?

338
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,212
I need to kill him, you see.

339
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,050
<i>Because of you?</i>

340
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,719
She probably wanted me...

341
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,806
to have an affair with you.

342
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,183
To steal my husband.

343
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,936
I don't followâ€¦

344
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,856
Why me, of all people?

345
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,525
She must think you two look alike.

346
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,820
You and my brother-in-law.

347
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,616
Kwon Minjo?
The one who died in a helicopter accident?

348
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,040
What was your relationship with...

349
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,249
We were in love.

350
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,177
You asked me the true reason
why I sent you that letter.

351
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,057
Minjo was an angel.

352
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,226
<i>He was a gentle and kind soul.</i>

353
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,604
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

354
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,523
<i>He regularly volunteered
at a correctional facility.</i>

355
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,276
Could you serve them
some pizza and fried chicken? Thank you.

356
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,238
Enjoy your meal.

357
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,616
VOLUNTEER GROUP

358
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,000
<i>He said
one of the death-row inmates was innocent.</i>

359
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,127
<i>And that wasâ€¦</i>

360
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,338
Correct. It was Lee Changwoo.

361
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,174
I didn't think much of it at first.

362
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,177
But then my husband saidâ€¦

363
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,894
I'm telling you.

364
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,605
My father killed someoneâ€¦

365
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,983
with the Adamas.

366
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,569
Yes, Lee Changwoo.

367
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,365
And Lee Changwoo
was the one who took the fall.

368
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,909
That's right.

369
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,497
I don't know.

370
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,709
<i>"My father killed someone with the Adamas.</i>

371
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,047
<i>And Lee Changwoo
was the one who took the fall."</i>

372
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,842
That was when I realized

373
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,388
that the helicopter incident
was no accidentâ€¦

374
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,642
and that Minjo was murdered.

375
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,936
Are you saying

376
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,815
he was killed after trying to prove
Lee Changwoo's innocence?

377
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,984
He already had his eldest son.

378
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,278
He couldn't have cared less about Minjo.

379
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,613
You're suspecting Chairman Kwon.

380
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,906
Suspect?

381
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,493
I'm sure of it.

382
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,457
Then I immediately dug into that case
from 22 years ago.

383
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,836
That's when I learned
that you were the victim's son.

384
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,880
THE TRACE OF SIN
BY HA WOOSIN

385
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,798
<i>I've read all your books.</i>

386
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,760
D'S SONG

387
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,100
<i>So that's why Ms. Yoon
ecommended me for the ghostwriting job.</i>

388
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,812
<i>She thought you were interested in me.</i>

389
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,338
And it just so happened to be
right after I sent that letter.

390
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,319
But in reality,
that letter was for your brother.

391
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,781
So you sent that letter

392
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,448
because you wanted
to take revenge on the chairman?

393
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,621
Aren't we after the same thing?

394
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,500
You want to catch
your father's real killer.

395
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,170
And I want to punish Minjo's killer.

396
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,339
Ms. Eun.

397
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,509
Revenge isn't free.

398
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,135
It always comes with a price.

399
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,055
Enough with your lousy lecture.
Just remember this.

400
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,475
Minjo was trying to reveal the truth
about your father's case.

401
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,769
And that got him killed.

402
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,274
I'm not Kwon Minjo.

403
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,485
I can't be his substitute.

404
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,905
I'm saying I'm not interested
in punishing the chairman.

405
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,116
Because we're not after the same thing.

406
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,041
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,384
Sir, it's been a long time.

408
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,052
Yes. It has been.

409
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,721
Why did you want to see me?

410
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,015
There's something I need to report to you.

411
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,475
Report?

412
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,270
You take care of most matters
independently.

413
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,067
The victim's son is digging into the case?

414
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,152
Yes, with the help of the SIH.

415
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,071
How interesting.

416
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,448
You don't need to worry, sir.

417
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,784
I'll take care of it.

418
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,411
It's quite simple.

419
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,373
Evidence holds the most weight in court
in this country.

420
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,876
We just need to get rid of it.

421
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,588
We've already gotten our hands
on all the files.

422
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,551
Next, we just need
to get rid of that prosecutor, the son.

423
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,535
Then we can bid adieu to this case.

424
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,851
There's actually another target, sir.

425
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,979
Another target? Who?

426
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,693
The female reporter.

427
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,071
Right, the witness.

428
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,366
Yes, sir. Once we get rid of those two,

429
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,868
it'll be over.

430
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,745
I see.

431
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,080
Anything else?

432
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,083
No, sir.

433
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,186
They all look plain.
I expected more from the SIH.

434
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,655
That's a field agent's
most important virtue.

435
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,398
They need to blend in to survive.

436
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,235
The most ordinary-looking criminals
are the biggest headaches.

437
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,738
Where are we going?

438
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,078
That littleâ€¦

439
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,133
I have a security chip in my hand.

440
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,718
Biometrics?

441
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,845
So you know?

442
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,139
Yes. I know my onions.

443
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,977
Not pressing the button?

444
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,481
We're living in the 21st century.
Nothing is done manually.

445
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,735
It reads the information on my chip.

446
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,499
There's a hidden floor
between levels 12 and 13.

447
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,502
That's the heart of the SIH.

448
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,338
How ridiculous.
Are you guys 007 or something?

449
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,925
- What?
- Never mind.

450
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,262
Let's be calm and reasonable
since we're here.

451
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,055
Exactly. That's what I'm doing.

452
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,397
Welcome.

453
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,151
You should know
that you've made a mistake, honey.

454
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,114
You'll be monitored all year round
as soon as you set foot in here.

455
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,240
No matter what you do.

456
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,326
Quit calling us honey
and bring your boss over.

457
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
You're a feisty one, honey.

458
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,581
- Annoyingâ€¦
- Kang Hyukpil.

459
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,167
Kang Hyukpil.

460
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,588
Come on out!

461
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,724
When were you going to tell us
about Team A?

462
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,352
Was Chairman Kwon not your sole target?

463
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,355
Were you after Team A as well?

464
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,027
Answer me.

465
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,120
Team A. Haesong's troubleshooters.

466
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,166
They're closely involved
in countless crimes.

467
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,168
Murder disguised as an accident.

468
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,462
<i>Death from falling.</i>

469
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>Medical accidents.</i>

470
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,260
<i>Car accidents.</i>

471
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,304
<i>Death by drowning.</i>

472
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,723
<i>Disappearances.</i>

473
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,308
KYUNGWOON DAILY

474
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,978
They're in charge of obliterating
Haesong's enemies or hindrances.

475
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,022
Formerly the Management Support Team.

476
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,944
Once Lee became the team leader,
the name was changed to Team A.

477
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,738
They've been dodging the law,
doing whatever they want.

478
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,907
Simply put, they're hitmen.

479
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,450
That's a cute way to put it.

480
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,162
They're soldiers,
and Chairman Kwon is their king.

481
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,372
That's right.

482
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,291
Chairman Kwon doesn't bribe anyone.

483
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,168
He just gets rid of their enemies.

484
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,214
You become an accomplice
as soon as you join hands with him.

485
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,883
That's why they do everything
they can to protect him.

486
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,884
If the chairman fallsâ€¦

487
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,345
â€¦it's the end for them as well.

488
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,166
How much of this ridiculous story
am I supposed to believe?

489
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,560
Let me add to that.

490
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,440
Whose orders do you think we follow?

491
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,778
The chief of the National Police Agency?
The Minister of Justice?

492
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,823
It's someone even higher.

493
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,242
The VIP?

494
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,834
<i>We must put an end to this
before his term ends.</i>

495
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,918
<i>Wait.</i>

496
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,298
From what I know,
you guys aren't that clean to begin with.

497
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,925
Why don't you just kill the chairman?

498
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,052
I considered doing that.

499
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,432
But killing him off won't disband Team A.

500
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,726
A new leader would emerge.

501
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,228
Our purpose is to apprehend the chairman

502
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,314
and dissolve Team A.

503
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,358
The growth of Haesong, the monster.

504
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,360
Their heinous actions.

505
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,322
And Lee, the one spearheading it all.

506
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,323
Damn him.

507
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,702
Sadly, no one has seen him in person.

508
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,121
We have.

509
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,541
You saw him? Be more specific.

510
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,668
He was at the cabin.

511
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,587
I know what I saw.

512
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,631
They called him their leader.

513
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,508
Mr. Kang.

514
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,744
You're late.

515
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,121
I was hungry, so I helped myself.

516
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,623
I had to stop by the head office.

517
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,127
You look good. How was your break?

518
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,879
Okay.

519
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,505
And your task?

520
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,758
Can you manage?

521
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,720
Three seconds.

522
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,431
That's all I need.

523
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,478
What? Are you going
to slice my neck or something?

524
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,984
Right.

525
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,113
It's a gift.

526
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,215
Why do you need Song Suhyeon's toothbrush?

527
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,124
You must've lost your touch
while you were gone.

528
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,501
We never ask why.

529
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,922
Okay, whatever.

530
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,133
And you know who the targets are?

531
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,386
Song Suhyeon. Kim Seohee.

532
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,762
Kill them no matter what.

533
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,560
By the way, Mr. Lee.

534
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,689
He's a twin.

535
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,443
What if I get them mixed up
and kill his brother instead?

536
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,279
Can I just kill them both?

537
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,949
Of course not.

538
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,201
Listen carefully.

539
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,746
Song Suhyeon is your target.

540
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,250
Don't lay a finger on his brother.

541
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,377
Never?

542
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,839
That's right. Never.

543
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,179
Okay. Never.

544
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,367
Please, excuse me.

545
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,410
I'm done eating.

546
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,291
You haven't changed one bit.

547
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
What is it?

548
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,736
<i>You drank the wine.</i>

549
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
What if I had poisoned it?

550
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,789
Just kidding. Enjoy your meal.

551
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,967
That lunatic.

552
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,261
<i>You saw Team A's leader?</i>

553
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,638
Let's get a composite sketch immediately.

554
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,722
I already have one.

555
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,565
It's him.

556
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,567
And he could be the one
who killed my father.

557
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,151
I'm sure of it.

558
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,406
<i>The man I saw that nightâ€¦</i>

559
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,742
Kim Seohee?

560
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,287
He was the one who raided the safe house.

561
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,915
The leader of Team A

562
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,169
may be your father's real killer?

563
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,089
Jeez. Look at that.

564
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,177
The chairman is involved in everything.

565
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,802
Happy?

566
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,098
Are you?

567
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,644
What about Woosin?
Is he still at that house?

568
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,397
Trying to get him out of there
in a hurry could put him in danger.

569
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,900
Cut that nonsense, god damn it.

570
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,653
You guys are all trash.

571
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,655
You knew Team A was a part of Haesong

572
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,419
and that Woosin was in danger,
yet you still haven't pulled him out?

573
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,828
Bring him out this instant.

574
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,872
I can't do that.

575
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,126
You can't? Why can't you take

576
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,004
Woosin out of that house?

577
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,380
Prosecutor Song.

578
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,591
Prosecutor Song.

579
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,912
Do you think Team A
will never find out about your brother?

580
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,347
You're their target.

581
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,183
Yet they leave your brother unscathed?

582
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,975
Is that possible?

583
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,608
Damn it.

584
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,820
There's no place he can hide
even if he leaves the estate.

585
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,700
The best thing we can do is
complete our mission as soon as possible.

586
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,873
We need to apprehend the chairman
and dissolve Team A.

587
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,524
What he said is true.

588
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,902
If we act rashly
and Chairman Kwon gets wind of it,

589
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,445
he'll get rid of the evidence.

590
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,198
You and your brother
will be his targets forever.

591
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,577
I know, but the SIH has too many secrets.

592
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,247
Even about Team A.
I just can't trust them.

593
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,583
Then what'll you do?

594
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,710
Get out of here.

595
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,188
Those brats.

596
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,858
I told them to close the curtains
properly after cleaning!

597
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,874
Ms. Kwon knows.

598
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,460
She knows where the Adamas is.

599
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,379
Darn. It's not like
I can torture her to make her spill it.

600
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,965
In any case, we should hurry.

601
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,967
I'll tell headquarters to track her.

602
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,219
Fortunately, we still have time.

603
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,849
Ms. Eun said they've yet
to draw the new design.

604
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,477
It'll take some time to recraft it.

605
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,604
But first things first.

606
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,733
Ms. Kwon has a son, right?

607
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,569
Yes. How did you know that?

608
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,529
Is he dead?

609
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,824
Yes. How did you know?

610
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,869
I saw a photo album in her room.

611
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,246
The last photo was from a decade ago.

612
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,500
I don't know much

613
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,623
since it was before I came here.
But why do you ask?

614
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,961
I thinkâ€¦

615
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,675
Ms. Kwon's late son is her weakness.

616
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,094
Her room was empty.

617
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,221
She has no earthly desires.

618
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,767
The only object she cherishes
is her son's photo album.

619
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,355
What's your plan?
Pretend to be her son and make her talk?

620
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,108
Given her dubious personality,

621
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,485
you'll fail even before starting anything.

622
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,945
That's not what I'm saying.

623
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,240
It's just unexpected.

624
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,243
The chairman isn't the only one

625
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,413
who's receiving her love and care.

626
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,623
Chairman Kwon and Ms. Kwon.

627
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,210
They have a strangeâ€¦

628
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,506
relationship.
But I just can't put my finger on it.

629
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,592
It's obvious.
It's unconditional obedience.

630
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,430
You're wrong.
It isn't some blind obedience.

631
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,556
It's more likeâ€¦

632
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,560
her protective instinct.

633
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,062
Don't be absurd.

634
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,939
He doesn't need any protection.

635
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,566
That's exactly why it's strange.

636
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,947
I do know someone who may have the answer.

637
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,955
Interview? This late at night?

638
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,416
I want to pick up the pace.

639
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,960
I'd like to finish the memoir
as soon as possible.

640
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,631
You don't need to interview me.
It'll be such a hassle for you.

641
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:05,262
It'd be nice to learn
some new things about him.

642
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,607
Oh, please.

643
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,151
I can't talk about his personal life.

644
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:23,864
Do I look like someone who'd gladly
expose the chairman's weaknesses

645
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,783
just for some money?

646
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,701
Oh, I think you misunderstood.

647
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,412
I just want to know
a different side of him.

648
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,540
Perhaps his heartwarming relationships
with others.

649
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,169
For example,
his relationship with Ms. Kwon.

650
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,299
I'm not so sure.

651
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,804
They seem to have quite a unique bond.

652
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,391
Could it be friendship?
Or a certain type of love?

653
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,937
They have a history together.

654
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,939
You see,

655
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,025
she was like his shadow
ever since he was young.

656
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,654
Young Master, are you okay?

657
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,655
Young Master!

658
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,366
Are you okay?

659
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,750
<i>If the chairman did something wrong,</i>

660
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,836
<i>she was often punished instead.</i>

661
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,796
I told you to take good care of him!

662
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,383
I'm sorry, Father.

663
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,593
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

664
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,056
<i>The limp she has proves it.</i>

665
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,811
She treats him like a babe in the woods.

666
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,480
That's because her family

667
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,524
has been serving this household

668
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,569
for countless generations.

669
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,739
Could anyone possibly fathom
the unconditional loyalty

670
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,117
she has for him?

671
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,660
Could that be why?

672
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,415
It was more than just simple loyalty.

673
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:00,627
More like a guardian who's overprotective

674
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,963
of her child.

675
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,387
There is a heartbreaking story
behind that.

676
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,348
Do elaborate.

677
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,358
I think I shouldâ€¦

678
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,156
take this.

679
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,579
She doesn't think
he's a babe in the woods.

680
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,667
But more like her kid.

681
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,713
Her son.

682
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,929
The chairman had a heart transplant.

683
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,306
Yes. I'm aware of that.

684
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,516
So?

685
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,395
The donor wasâ€¦

686
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,490
Was itâ€¦

687
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,993
her son?

688
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,956
Oh.

689
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,669
So she must feel like
she's reunited with her dead son

690
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,588
every time she sees the chairman.

691
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,634
After all, his heart once belonged
to her one and only son.

692
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,595
Gosh, I could only imagine.

693
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,268
Butâ€¦ How could that happen?

694
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,730
There is an order of priority
when it comes to those waiting lists.

695
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,027
Mr. Ha, we're talking about Haesong here.

696
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,947
They can easily put him
at the top of the list.

697
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,620
To be frank, it's such a pity.

698
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,832
Her son was so young
when he failed at his suicide attempt.

699
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,458
He ended up in a coma.

700
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,294
Hold on. Suicide?

701
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,132
Her son?

702
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,385
Yes. He hanged himself.

703
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,929
On the tree in front of her room.

704
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,100
And then,

705
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,979
he ended up brain-dead
and his heart was donated.

706
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,446
<i>So that's why
she always closed the curtains.</i>

707
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,788
<i>She wasn't trying to hide something.</i>

708
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,542
<i>She was the one hiding.</i>

709
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,555
It was motherly love, not just affection.

710
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,517
<i>Chairman Kwon was given</i>

711
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,480
<i>her son's heart.</i>

712
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,364
Could that meanâ€¦

713
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,897
Did Eunkook Medical Center
carry out the chairman's heart transplant?

714
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,900
Yes. Is that why you're...

715
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,195
Ms. Oh told me
that Ms. Kwon's son was the donor.

716
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,864
Ms. Kwon's son?

717
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,199
Did you not know that?

718
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,243
No.

719
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,454
You once told me that nothing
happened by coincidence here.

720
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,725
But it just so happened that
your hospital carried out the procedure,

721
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,459
and Ms. Kwon's son was the donor.

722
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,379
If what Ms. Oh said was true

723
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,798
and the anonymous donor
was indeed Ms. Kwon's son,

724
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,509
then my father was involved.

725
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,221
Those who declared him brain-dead
worked at our hospital.

726
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,266
Perhaps, my father and the chairman

727
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,643
had made a deal.

728
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,062
<i>What did you say?</i>

729
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,773
What do you want me to do?

730
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,859
Get married.

731
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,111
Do you mean that?

732
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,446
I'm still grieving Minjo's death.

733
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,365
So?

734
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,201
Will waiting around
bring him back to life?

735
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,245
- Dad!
- Come on.

736
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,385
Chairman Kwon promised that
you'd become Haesong's daughter-in-law.

737
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,500
We should take him up on that offer.

738
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,335
Will you decline because Minjo died?

739
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,339
There's Hyunjo.

740
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,512
Who?

741
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,933
If you think about it,
this is actually much better.

742
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,145
It's better to marry the eldest.

743
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,980
He's Minjo's brother.

744
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,565
How could I marry him?

745
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,943
Why not? It's not like
you and Minjo were married.

746
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,238
Get it done within the year.

747
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,366
Am I an animal to you?

748
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,661
- How dare you?
- That's a pipe dream.

749
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,623
- The chairman would never...
- That's what he wants.

750
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,793
What do you meanâ€¦

751
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,132
This is small potatoes.

752
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,676
It's nothing compared
to what I did for him.

753
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,681
I finally get it now.

754
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,768
Instead of Minjo,

755
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,270
my husband was the one who had to pay.

756
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,691
- Pay?
- Becoming Haesong's daughter-in-law

757
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,402
must come with a price.

758
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,172
<i>Did Ms. Kwon's son</i>

759
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,841
<i>really commit suicide?</i>

760
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,680
It was staged.

761
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,372
What are you doing here?

762
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,586
It's our wedding night.

763
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:04,509
How could a new groom sleep
in another room on his honeymoon?

764
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,887
Imagine the rumors that'll spread.

765
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,974
Get up.

766
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,275
Don't get ahead of yourself.

767
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,236
I have no interest in you either.

768
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,823
Ever since I was young,

769
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,826
I never touched any of Minjo's things.

770
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,663
You piece of trash.

771
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,710
Iâ€¦

772
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,883
I wasn't up for this marriage either.

773
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,052
I'm just fulfillingâ€¦

774
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,097
â€¦Minjo's job.

775
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,560
Why did I marry you?

776
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,189
I'm not sure.

777
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,111
Why did I marry you?

778
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,451
You want to know why we got married?

779
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,955
There's no reason.

780
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,916
It was what my father wanted.

781
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,890
Decline, and I would've
ended up like Minjo.

782
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,437
What do you mean?

783
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,275
What was that?

784
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,823
Answer me.

785
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,326
Is asking questions your second nature?

786
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,329
What if I told you
the meaning behind that?

787
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,623
Then what? Will you take revenge?

788
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,585
I see! Good luck with that!

789
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,090
I hope you get your revenge.

790
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,092
But you know what?

791
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,137
I can guarantee

792
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,265
that'll never happen.

793
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,686
Cut the nonsense and answer me.

794
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,689
Ended up like Minjo...

795
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,315
It's exactly what you think it means.

796
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,489
That's it.

797
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,453
We need an access card.
The stairs are a no-go.

798
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,954
Then the elevator?

799
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,248
We'll need to pass that room.

800
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,626
Leave it to me. Follow me.

801
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,095
- Excuse me.
- Why are you still up?

802
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,014
Is the night-duty room uncomfortable?

803
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,475
No, I just have a question.

804
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,394
That guy that I saw. Mr. Lee.

805
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,688
If he was the one who killed Mr. Song,

806
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,149
does that mean
the chairman isn't the killer?

807
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,194
Would that make him just guilty
of aiding and abetting?

808
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,029
I'm not that familiar with the law.

809
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,031
If that's all that he's guilty of,

810
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,592
the statute of limitations
must've expired.

811
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,743
And it'd be a headache
if Lee was the killer

812
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,829
since we don't know when
his statute of limitations will run out.

813
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:05,041
If the chairman is only guilty
of aiding and abetting,

814
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,044
there's no reason for you guys
to carry out this mission.

815
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,713
Right. Team A is also your target.

816
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,048
Then does it not matter?

817
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,509
Or is there something else

818
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,344
that you guys are keeping from us?

819
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,221
What's wrong with this?

820
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,682
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

821
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,019
Did Prosecutor Song put you up to this?
To distract me?

822
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,279
Busted.

823
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,074
I need to get out.
There's something I have to do.

824
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,494
Right.

825
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,872
Biometrics.

826
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,626
Let's grab something to eat.

827
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,004
There's no time for such luxuries.

828
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,798
Are you really a prosecutor?

829
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,594
Everything that's crucial
happens while eating.

830
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,946
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

831
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,742
I have a weak stomach
and can't eat with anyone I despise.

832
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,123
What is this?

833
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,126
Your new phone.
You can contact us with it.

834
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,837
After all, we're in the same boat.

835
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,090
Mm.

836
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,108
I applied for sick leave at your office.

837
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:42,972
For whom?

838
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,765
Me?

839
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,311
What the hell?

840
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,607
God damn it.

841
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,027
Prosecutor Song.

842
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,572
My days are numbered.

843
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,285
Are you trying
to make me sympathize with you?

844
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,828
What do you mean, numbered?

845
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,916
The presidential election
will be over soon.

846
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,585
I'd be good as dead
if Hwang Byungchul is elected.

847
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,712
What are you on about?

848
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,799
LATE-NIGHT RICE BOWL

849
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,553
Haesong?

850
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,473
So you know.

851
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,893
Chairman Kwon has his back.

852
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,520
NEW FUTURE PARTY
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

853
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,605
What a scumbag.

854
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,440
You get the picture, right?

855
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,068
I've read your articles.

856
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,880
Your relationship
with Candidate Hwang is quite ill-fated.

857
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,572
I'm sick of him.

858
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,411
It's obvious if a Local News reporter
is more well-informed than political ones.

859
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,414
His name was always included
in every corrupt deed that I investigated.

860
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,374
Once Hwang becomes President,

861
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,459
what do you think
Haesong's first move will be?

862
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,298
A purge.

863
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,677
They'll set an example
by killing you first.

864
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,972
I know what I signed up for.

865
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,725
And they'll also go after you.

866
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,977
I've always likedâ€¦

867
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,563
living dangerously.

868
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,401
Do you know how many former presidents
were put up there by Haesong?

869
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,320
We're trying to put an end to that.

870
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,199
There are times
when Mr. Kang steps over the line.

871
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,535
But since he has conviction,

872
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:30,371
we obey him no matter what.

873
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,416
He doesn't hesitate to take the fall.

874
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,139
Because that's his definition of justice.

875
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,610
You won't hesitate
to be the lesser evil to defeat the worst?

876
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,299
You remembered what I said.

877
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,428
Fine. Let's do this.

878
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,513
Let's dig into this together.

879
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,892
But what's your name?

880
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,102
I don't have one.

881
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,397
We don't exist on paper.

882
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,692
As members of the infiltration team,
we shouldn't know one another.

883
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,362
Then how should I address you?
I can't just say "Hey."

884
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,364
Ms. Lee.

885
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,452
Kang Hyukpil.

886
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,245
You're the only one with your name out.

887
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,009
That means you're willing
to take responsibility if things go south.

888
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,958
I get that.

889
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,335
I have one question.

890
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,213
I get that Haesong has gotten
several presidents elected so far.

891
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,465
But why are you so determined

892
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,760
to specifically stop
Candidate Hwang of all people?

893
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,640
Haesong's next business

894
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,809
is growing ARES, their defense industry.

895
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,936
They want to legalize firearms.

896
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,524
- What?
- Legalizing firearms.

897
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,152
They want to sell weapons?

898
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,489
Those lunatics.

899
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,012
That's the real reason why
they're supporting Candidate Hwang.

900
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,160
That's exactly why we must stop Team A.

901
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,208
Now, let's talk business.

902
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,171
I'm down.

903
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,758
All right, then.

904
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,718
Good news or bad news?

905
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,055
Make it good news
since I'm on an empty stomach.

906
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,563
They've moved the Adamas.
They're going to recraft it.

907
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,399
They want to get rid of any evidence of it
being the murder weapon?

908
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,525
How's that good news?

909
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,735
It is for you.

910
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,445
Me?

911
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,033
You're right.

912
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,411
Jeez.

913
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,956
I don't know whose idea it was,
but they deserve credit.

914
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,749
The fact that the Adamas isn't there

915
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,294
means that the SIH will need
to get involved, not Woosin.

916
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,172
But here's the catch. The bad news.

917
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,426
We need to hurry and find out where it is.

918
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,596
They'll reveal it at the upcoming
80th-anniversary ceremony.

919
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,932
Don't be such a baby.
I'm sure you're looking into it.

920
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,643
You're probably tracking the designer.

921
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,978
Good luck with that.

922
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,188
I need

923
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,025
to visit Lee Changwoo.

924
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,528
That's the thing you must do?

925
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,281
Those bastards even raided
your safe house.

926
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:13,367
There's no guarantee that he's safe.
I need to check on him.

927
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:31,886
Get up.

928
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,804
Get up.

929
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,520
What is it?

930
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,730
We received a tip-off.

931
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,360
I heard you took some narcotics
that were smuggled in.

932
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,113
No, sir.

933
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,245
Why are you doing this?
I never did such a thing.

934
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,122
That's what I think too.

935
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,583
But I still need to check.

936
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,504
Perhaps, Lee Changwoo isâ€¦

937
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,638
<i>I got a strand of his hair, sir.</i>

938
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,693
We'll find out soon enough.

939
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,933
Damn it.

940
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,072
What? You're not Lee Changwoo.

941
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,700
No wonder. Damn.

942
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,660
I'm screwed.

943
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,010
Don't kill meâ€¦

944
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,430
Don't kill meâ€¦

945
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,410
Yes, sir.

946
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,704
I got it.

947
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,331
I'm on my way.

948
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,051
Jeez.

949
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,596
<i>Are that prosecutor
and female reporter still alive?</i>

950
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,850
<i>Team A took Lee Changwoo's case file.</i>

951
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,227
<i>Where's Song Suhyeon?</i>

952
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,438
<i>I have a favor to ask of you.</i>

953
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,567
<i>Are you sure you got her weak spot?</i>

954
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,318
<i>About her dead son.</i>

955
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,363
<i>What if we spread word
that she knows where the Adamas is?</i>

956
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,615
You're no different from Team A.

957
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,617
<i>Did you deceive me?</i>

958
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,995
<i>Who are you?</i>
