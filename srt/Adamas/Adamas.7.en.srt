6
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,335
That bastard.

7
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,546
How dare he go there?

8
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,267
-Who is it?
-I'm not expecting anyone.

9
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,690
Wait here.

10
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:05,917
Who is it?

11
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,419
I'm from the repair company.

12
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,214
Water is leaking from your bathroom
to the apartment below.

13
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,675
But we never called you.

14
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,011
Well… That's strange.

15
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,679
One minute.

16
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,599
Hello?

17
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm at the studio apartment right now.

18
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:27,021
But the tenant saidhe wasn't aware that I was coming.

19
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,441
Okay. Hold on. I'll put him on the phone.

20
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,445
Sir. Would you like to speak to her?

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,159
-One minute.

22
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,044
Here you go.

23
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,801
Hello?

24
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,305
Who is this?

25
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,058
Oh, Prosecutor Song.

26
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,811
Of course I remember you.
-Ah.

27
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,815
The maintenance office called.

28
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:13,901
The tenant below complained
about a leak in the ceiling.

29
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,697
I found it odd because I knew
Mr. Ha wasn't home.

30
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,867
Goodness, don't be sorry.

31
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,245
Let's grab a meal sometime with Mr. Ha.

32
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,331
Okay. Goodbye.

33
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,087
But why is his brother there?

34
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,098
Hello, ma'am.

35
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:47,393
Ms. Lee, I was almost at the office

36
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,313
when I got into a car accident.
I think I'll just go home from here.

37
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,731
Is everything all right?

38
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,484
What? Who's there?

39
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,237
A reporter who came to interview Mr. Ha.

40
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,197
Apparently you knew about it.

41
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,617
What are you talking about? I knew?

42
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,328
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,004
What? When did he leave?

44
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,854
Take a seat.

45
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,152
What's there to talk about
in the chairman's office?

46
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,364
We'll be in trouble
if the chairman finds out.

47
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,452
If you're well aware of it,
why did you do that?

48
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,292
What were you doing here

49
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,170
at 10 p.m. yesterday?

50
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,889
Cat got your tongue?

51
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,479
I'm asking you what you were doing here

52
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,731
at 10 p.m. last night.

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,859
Don't try to lie.

54
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:22,196
Mr. Kim over there
saw everything in real time.

55
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,118
I wasn't trying to tattle on you.

56
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,996
But she already knew about it.

57
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,831
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,250
You're sorry? Why would you apologize?

59
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,585
Are you two scheming something?

60
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,256
No, ma'am. We're not.

61
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,718
Then why did you lie for him?

62
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,387
Why did you lie
and tell Mr. Park that it was me?

63
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,432
Because--

64
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,559
This has nothing to do with him.

65
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,228
Mm.

66
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,233
So you were up to something.

67
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,823
All right. Then what did you do here...

68
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,326
all by yourself?

69
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,662
Answer me.

70
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,134
Charles XIII Rare Cask.

71
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,142
The king of cognac.

72
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,772
I wanted a taste of that limited edition.

73
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,112
So you're telling me that
you secretly drank the chairman's liquor?

74
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,990
It was merely a small sip.
You can't even tell.

75
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:54,830
I had no idea. I was worried about you.

76
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,749
What's so funny?

77
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,126
You should've reported it to me
right away.

78
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,253
How dare you keep it from me?

79
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,715
You could get sacked for this.

80
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:06,634
Sacked?

81
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,638
Ms. Oh, please be merciful
and turn a blind eye to it this once.

82
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,390
I'll go by the rules.

83
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,727
Ms. Kwon will hear about this
as soon as she returns.

84
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

85
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,648
Please turn a blind eye just this once.

86
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,858
You've always adored me.

87
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,527
I did.

88
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,154
But this is strictly work-related.

89
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,656
Ms. Oh.

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,324
Let go.

91
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,288
What should I do?

92
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,331
When's the arrival time?

93
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:40,000
Ms. Kwon will arrive around 6 p.m.

94
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,502
Not her.

95
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,382
The toilet is usually the problem.

96
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,677
The leak occurs
when the silicone on the bottom falls off.

97
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,929
You knew exactly where the bathroom was.

98
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,723
You couldn't even see it
from the front door.

99
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,769
Sorry? All the buildings
around here are similar.

100
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,481
I often came
to this neighborhood for repairs.

101
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,284
You can wait outside.

102
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,412
I'm afraid this will take some time.

103
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't trust him.

104
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,057
Why are you doing this?

105
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,436
Sir.

106
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,772
Hold on.

107
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,316
Wait.

108
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,070
Why are you doing this?

109
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,865
Shut up.
Why are you doing this?

110
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,701
What's going on?

111
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,458
Shut up.

112
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,295
Ma'am, please call the police. Okay?

113
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,838
Don't believe him.

114
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,591
I'm going to make him talk.

115
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,930
Prosecutor Song, why are you doing this?

116
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,473
They even attacked the SIH.

117
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,891
They'll get to us too.

118
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,518
But he's just here to fix something.
He's just a repairman.

119
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,687
He's being suspicious,
and the timing was strange.

120
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,939
Trust your gut instinct.

121
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,190
What if we're wrong?

122
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:30,069
That's possible.
But I've been right more often than not.

123
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:34,031
Sir, please don't hurt me.

124
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,784
Hey, you're from Team A, aren't you?

125
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,829
Team A? I work for a repair company.

126
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,539
Don't you dare lie.

127
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,542
Wait--

128
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,296
Damn it.

129
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,677
It's an emergency. I'm going in.

130
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,521
Tell me.

131
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,861
Look. There's nothing suspicious here.

132
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,572
What's all this?

133
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,741
They're components for the toilet.

134
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,326
I brought them just in case.

135
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,203
Weren't you trying to install a bug?

136
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,454
No, sir.

137
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,498
You're not fooling me.

138
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,749
-You little--
-Sir!

139
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,710
Stop this! Come to your senses!

140
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,004
You need to become a lunatic
to deal with one.

141
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,922
This is no time to mind my manners!

142
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,300
Keep this up, and I'm out.

143
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,303
Gosh.

144
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,097
Hey, spill the truth if you want to live.

145
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm sorry for everything.

146
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,436
Who are you?

147
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,023
Answer me.

148
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,567
Who are you?

149
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,819
I'm a repairman.

150
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,197
So you want to take this all the way?

151
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,033
Fine.

152
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,118
-Damn it.

153
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,829
Tell me.

154
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,125
You're smiling?

155
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,752
Look at you glaring at me.

156
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,295
Go on.
-What?

157
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,422
Keep going.

158
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,886
Do you think Ha Woosin will be safe?

159
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,354
Did you just mention my brother?

160
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,358
You bastard.

161
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,741
-Open up!

162
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,536
Open up!

163
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,581
Open up!

164
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,754
What took the SIH so long to come?

165
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,761
Damn you!

166
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,807
God, you're so slow.

167
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,726
We didn't want to believe it.
Were we bait?

168
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,478
Did you want Team A to find us?

169
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,106
You could've easily tracked us
with the cameras around the cabin,

170
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,607
but you were nowhere to be seen.

171
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,195
That's how we knew you were observing us.

172
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,906
You were waiting
for Team A to attack us first.

173
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,742
And this kid must be one of your guys.

174
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,374
Are you okay?

175
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,167
I'm sorry, sir.

176
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,462
Watch what you say, bastard.

177
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,466
Lead the way to headquarters.

178
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,137
It's not up to me.

179
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,013
I wasn't talking to you.

180
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,686
Are you listening, Mr. Kang?

181
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,063
Do you remember Dangsan Railway Bridge?

182
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,107
I won't be fooled twice.

183
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,569
Bring them over.

184
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,949
Get rid of all the footage on Song

185
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,868
since our operation fell through.

186
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,078
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,917
What's the point in doing Team A a favor?

188
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,879
They're slower than I thought.

189
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,136
Hello, sir.

190
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,263
Sir, we were a second too late.

191
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,982
You failed to get the last footage
of Song Suhyeon's whereabouts?

192
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,234
The SIH got their hands
on it first. I'm sorry.

193
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,531
Okay. It's all good.

194
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,576
Sir?
Things became simpler.

195
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,039
We just need to track the SIH
to get to Song Suhyeon.

196
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,665
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,543
This is Lee Changwoo's case file.

198
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,131
Is this it? Did you get everything?

199
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,468
We got the case file,
legal records, and evidence.

200
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,136
We got everything.

201
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,016
This photo…

202
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,204
Dispose of the rest. Do it yourself.

203
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,749
Yes, sir.

204
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,050
I still don't have a clear answer.

205
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,428
I get that it's his job as a prosecutor.

206
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,597
But what about that writer?

207
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,144
Why is he so fixated on a casefrom 22 years ago?

208
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,814
It's not likehis dead father will come back.

209
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,984
He wasn't eventheir real father at that. So why?

210
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:09,950
LEFT, WOOSIN
RIGHT, SUHYEON

211
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,577
The father...

212
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,038
couldn't differentiate the twins?

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,376
Song Soonho

214
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,505
had this photo with him
when he went to Lee Changwoo.

215
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,549
But why?

216
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,863
This is Security.

217
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,491
I see. Okay.

218
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,755
Phone three connects to the head office.

219
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,472
Mr. Kim.

220
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,063
Mr. Choi.

221
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,941
What was the call about
that you're rushing to the mansion?

222
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh, that? It was nothing important.

223
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,120
What is that?

224
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,914
Drink up. It's chamomile tea.

225
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,624
What is it this time?

226
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,378
Jeez. Don't drink it if you don't want to.

227
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,171
Put it down.

228
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:53,095
Mr. Ha. About the Adamas…

229
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,598
What if you steal it and it turns out
not to be the murder weapon?

230
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,184
Then it's a failed op.

231
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,854
Why would you say that?
It's actually the opposite.

232
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,359
Can't we just sell it and split the money?

233
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,320
-Lee Dongrim.

234
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,823
It's a helicopter.
The chairman must be back.

235
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,952
Wrong. Ms. Kwon wouldn't be coming late
if that was the chairman.

236
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,328
She'd be here already.

237
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,976
I was told that Ms. Eun would arrive soon.

238
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,772
So why were you headed
to the mansion after that call?

239
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,109
For Mr. Ha.

240
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,946
Mr. Ha?

241
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,283
Yes. He wanted to know
when she was arriving.

242
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:23,894
I'm tired. It's been a long day.

243
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,188
Should I run a bath?

244
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,606
Sounds great.

245
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,608
Right.

246
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,569
Where's Mr. Ha?

247
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,866
What? Ms. Hyesoo looked for Mr. Ha
as soon as she returned?

248
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,453
Yes, ma'am. She had a message
from the chairman.

249
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,247
-Which was?
-Sorry?

250
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,042
I'm not sure.

251
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,129
Why can't you be a decent spy

252
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,423
and know exactly what to do?

253
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,883
I'm sorry, ma'am.

254
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,468
Forget it. Get going.

255
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,139
Hurry up. Ms. Kwon will be here
any moment now.

256
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,817
Come in.

257
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,300
The Adamas isn't here.

258
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,927
Ms. Kwon took it.

259
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,762
I know.

260
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,514
You do?

261
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,059
I saw a jewelry designer's portfolio

262
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,062
in the chairman's office.

263
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,522
That means only one thing.

264
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,816
He wants to recraft it.

265
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,652
Well, you spoiled everything.

266
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,822
I went to Ms. Jang myself
to find out about that.

267
00:19:58,905 --> 00:19:59,948
Patti Jang?

268
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,118
Yes.

269
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,663
But the Adamas
was moved elsewhere by the company.

270
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,002
Is the chairman stepping down
from his position?

271
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,088
Is his son taking over?

272
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,759
So that's it.

273
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,803
When my time is over…

274
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:25,765
The day I retire,
I will hand it over to my son.

275
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,934
Like a crown?

276
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,145
He has to inherit the symbol of Haesong

277
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,647
for him to be its rightful owner.

278
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:36,276
The 80th-anniversary ceremony
is probably the day,

279
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,612
given how they're rushing it.

280
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,530
I didn't know that.

281
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,158
Anyway, this is bad news.

282
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,911
The Adamas' shape will change
once it's recrafted.

283
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,455
Then it'll be meaningless
to compare it with the autopsy result.

284
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:52,292
What's your plan now?

285
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,171
I need to find out where it's stored
as soon as possible.

286
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,756
Before the recrafting begins.

287
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,799
Should I look into it?

288
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,011
No. Leave it up to us.

289
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,512
Us?

290
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,684
About Ms. Oh…

291
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,854
What about her?

292
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,523
Something happened this afternoon.

293
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,193
Can you help me?

294
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,321
With pleasure.

295
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,870
What is this?

296
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,413
It's a bribe.

297
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,415
A bribe?

298
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:35,126
My having a sip of the chairman's liquor
in his office.

299
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,128
Please sweep it under the rug.

300
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,798
How rude of you.

301
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,425
Are you trying to buy me off with this?

302
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,679
She's been working as a maidfor the past 40 years.

303
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,598
She has tended
to many conglomerate families.

304
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,227
Don't expect her to have a heart.

305
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,398
She rarely bats an eyeat anything.

306
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,443
She's bold and cold-hearted.

307
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,208
You're saying someone like her wasMs. Kwon's right hand for over a decade?

308
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,380
Was everything fine?

309
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:25,135
Yes, ma'am.
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

310
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,431
Why do you thinkshe has obeyed her all these years?

311
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,583
This is just all in good faith.

312
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,209
Mm.

313
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,213
It'd be rude of me to decline.

314
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,760
I may reject a bribe
but not something given in good faith.

315
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,351
I'll give you a freebie
since this is our first deal.

316
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,896
I'm just saying this out of kindness.

317
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,940
Be wary of Ms. Yoon.

318
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:22,817
Ms. Yoon?

319
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,237
She was the one who recommended you.

320
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,080
Ms. Yoon?

321
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,957
Yes. That's what Ms. Oh said.
I don't know why though.

322
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,419
It all worked out for the best.
I finally find out who it was.

323
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,508
What a funny girl.

324
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,635
Something come to mind?

325
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,055
I may be the reason…

326
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:56,351
why Ms. Yoon recommended you.

327
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,213
MY LOVE

328
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,757
TO MY BELOVED SISTER

329
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,238
TO MY BELOVED SISTER

330
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,206
PERSONA NON GRATA
BY HA WOOSIN

331
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,298
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
HA WOOSIN

332
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,313
What a cute hobby he has.

333
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,443
Hi, Prosecutor Song.

334
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,279
Is your owner...

335
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,406
a twin?

336
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,786
Which one is Song Suhyeon?

337
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:23,873
Him? Or him?

338
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,170
I need to kill him, you see.

339
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,008
Because of you?

340
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,677
She probably wanted me...

341
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:39,764
to have an affair with you.

342
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:42,141
To steal my husband.

343
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,894
I don't follow…

344
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,814
Why me, of all people?

345
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,483
She must think you two look alike.

346
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,778
You and my brother-in-law.

347
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,573
Kwon Minjo?
The one who died in a helicopter accident?

348
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,998
What was your relationship with--

349
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,207
We were in love.

350
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,135
You asked me the true reason
why I sent you that letter.

351
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:22,015
Minjo was an angel.

352
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,184
He was a gentle and kind soul.

353
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,562
-Enjoy.
Thank you.

354
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,481
He regularly volunteeredat a correctional facility.

355
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,234
Could you serve them
some pizza and fried chicken? Thank you.

356
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,196
Enjoy your meal.

357
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,574
VOLUNTEER GROUP

358
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,958
He saidone of the death-row inmates was innocent.

359
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,085
And that was…

360
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,296
Correct. It was Lee Changwoo.

361
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,132
I didn't think much of it at first.

362
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,135
But then my husband said…

363
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm telling you.

364
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:10,563
My father killed someone…

365
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,941
with the Adamas.

366
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,527
Yes, Lee Changwoo.

367
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,323
And Lee Changwoo
was the one who took the fall.

368
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:22,867
That's right.

369
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:27,455
I don't know.

370
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,666
"My father killed someone with the Adamas.

371
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:36,005
And Lee Changwoowas the one who took the fall."

372
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,800
That was when I realized

373
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:43,346
that the helicopter incident
was no accident…

374
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,600
and that Minjo was murdered.

375
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,894
Are you saying

376
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,773
he was killed after trying to prove
Lee Changwoo's innocence?

377
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:55,942
He already had his eldest son.

378
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,236
He couldn't have cared less about Minjo.

379
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,571
You're suspecting Chairman Kwon.

380
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,864
Suspect?

381
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,451
I'm sure of it.

382
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,414
Then I immediately dug into that case
from 22 years ago.

383
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:14,794
That's when I learned
that you were the victim's son.

384
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,838
THE TRACE OF SIN
BY HA WOOSIN

385
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,756
I've read all your books.

386
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,717
D'S SONG

387
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,058
So that's why Ms. Yoonecommended me for the ghostwriting job.

388
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,770
She thought you were interested in me.

389
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,232
And it just so happened to be
right after I sent that letter.

390
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,277
But in reality,
that letter was for your brother.

391
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,738
So you sent that letter

392
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,366
because you wanted
to take revenge on the chairman?

393
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,579
Aren't we after the same thing?

394
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,457
You want to catch
your father's real killer.

395
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,128
And I want to punish Minjo's killer.

396
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,297
Ms. Eun.

397
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,466
Revenge isn't free.

398
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:04,093
It always comes with a price.

399
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,013
Enough with your lousy lecture.
Just remember this.

400
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,433
Minjo was trying to reveal the truth
about your father's case.

401
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,727
And that got him killed.

402
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,232
I'm not Kwon Minjo.

403
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,443
I can't be his substitute.

404
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,863
I'm saying I'm not interested
in punishing the chairman.

405
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,074
Because we're not after the same thing.

406
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,342
Sir, it's been a long time.

408
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,010
Yes. It has been.

409
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,679
Why did you want to see me?

410
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:50,973
There's something I need to report to you.

411
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,433
Report?

412
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,228
You take care of most matters
independently.

413
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,025
The victim's son is digging into the case?

414
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,110
Yes, with the help of the SIH.

415
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,029
How interesting.

416
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,406
You don't need to worry, sir.

417
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,742
I'll take care of it.

418
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,369
It's quite simple.

419
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:15,331
Evidence holds the most weight in court
in this country.

420
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,833
We just need to get rid of it.

421
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,545
We've already gotten our hands
on all the files.

422
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:26,509
Next, we just need
to get rid of that prosecutor, the son.

423
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
Then we can bid adieu to this case.

424
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,809
There's actually another target, sir.

425
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:37,937
Another target? Who?

426
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,651
The female reporter.

427
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,029
Right, the witness.

428
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:50,324
Yes, sir. Once we get rid of those two,

429
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,826
it'll be over.

430
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,703
I see.

431
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,038
Anything else?

432
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,041
No, sir.

433
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:18,144
They all look plain.
I expected more from the SIH.

434
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,604
That's a field agent's
most important virtue.

435
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,356
They need to blend in to survive.

436
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,193
The most ordinary-looking criminals
are the biggest headaches.

437
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,696
Where are we going?

438
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,036
That little…

439
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:49,091
I have a security chip in my hand.

440
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,676
Biometrics?

441
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,803
So you know?

442
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,097
Yes. I know my onions.

443
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,934
Not pressing the button?

444
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,439
We're living in the 21st century.
Nothing is done manually.

445
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,693
It reads the information on my chip.

446
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,457
There's a hidden floor
between levels 12 and 13.

447
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,460
-That's the heart of the SIH.

448
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,296
How ridiculous.
Are you guys 007 or something?

449
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,883
-What?
-Never mind.

450
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,220
Let's be calm and reasonable
since we're here.

451
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,013
Exactly. That's what I'm doing.

452
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,355
Welcome.

453
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,109
You should know
that you've made a mistake, honey.

454
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:53,072
You'll be monitored all year round
as soon as you set foot in here.

455
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:54,198
No matter what you do.

456
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:57,284
Quit calling us honey
and bring your boss over.

457
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,078
You're a feisty one, honey.

458
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,539
-Annoying…
-Kang Hyukpil.

459
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,125
Kang Hyukpil.

460
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,546
Come on out!

461
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:19,682
When were you going to tell us
about Team A?

462
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,310
Was Chairman Kwon not your sole target?

463
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,313
Were you after Team A as well?

464
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,985
Answer me.

465
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:41,078
Team A. Haesong's troubleshooters.

466
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:45,124
They're closely involved
in countless crimes.

467
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,126
Murder disguised as an accident.

468
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,420
Death from falling.

469
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,590
Medical accidents.

470
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,218
Car accidents.

471
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,262
Death by drowning.

472
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,681
Disappearances.

473
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,266
KYUNGWOON DAILY

474
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:05,936
They're in charge of obliterating
Haesong's enemies or hindrances.

475
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,980
Formerly the Management Support Team.

476
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,902
Once Lee became the team leader,
the name was changed to Team A.

477
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,696
They've been dodging the law,
doing whatever they want.

478
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,865
Simply put, they're hitmen.

479
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:19,408
That's a cute way to put it.

480
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,120
They're soldiers,
and Chairman Kwon is their king.

481
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,330
That's right.

482
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,249
Chairman Kwon doesn't bribe anyone.

483
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,126
He just gets rid of their enemies.

484
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,172
You become an accomplice
as soon as you join hands with him.

485
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,841
That's why they do everything
they can to protect him.

486
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,842
If the chairman falls…

487
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,303
…it's the end for them as well.

488
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:42,056
How much of this ridiculous story
am I supposed to believe?

489
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,518
Let me add to that.

490
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,398
Whose orders do you think we follow?

491
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,736
The chief of the National Police Agency?
The Minister of Justice?

492
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,781
It's someone even higher.

493
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,200
The VIP?

494
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,792
We must put an end to thisbefore his term ends.

495
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:11,835
Wait.

496
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,256
From what I know,
you guys aren't that clean to begin with.

497
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,883
Why don't you just kill the chairman?

498
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,010
I considered doing that.

499
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,390
But killing him off won't disband Team A.

500
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,684
A new leader would emerge.

501
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,186
Our purpose is to apprehend the chairman

502
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,272
and dissolve Team A.

503
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,316
The growth of Haesong, the monster.

504
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,318
Their heinous actions.

505
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,280
And Lee, the one spearheading it all.

506
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,115
Damn him.

507
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,660
Sadly, no one has seen him in person.

508
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,079
We have.

509
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,499
You saw him? Be more specific.

510
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,626
He was at the cabin.

511
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,545
I know what I saw.

512
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,589
They called him their leader.

513
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,466
Mr. Kang.

514
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,702
You're late.

515
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,079
I was hungry, so I helped myself.

516
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,581
I had to stop by the head office.

517
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,085
You look good. How was your break?

518
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:36,837
Okay.

519
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,339
And your task?

520
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,716
Can you manage?

521
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:44,678
Three seconds.

522
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:47,389
That's all I need.

523
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:52,436
What? Are you going
to slice my neck or something?

524
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,941
Right.

525
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,071
It's a gift.

526
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,119
Why do you need Song Suhyeon's toothbrush?

527
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,082
You must've lost your touch
while you were gone.

528
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,459
We never ask why.

529
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,880
Okay, whatever.

530
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,091
And you know who the targets are?

531
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,344
Song Suhyeon. Kim Seohee.

532
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:26,720
Kill them no matter what.

533
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,518
By the way, Mr. Lee.

534
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,647
He's a twin.

535
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,401
What if I get them mixed up
and kill his brother instead?

536
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,237
Can I just kill them both?

537
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,907
Of course not.

538
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,159
Listen carefully.

539
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,704
Song Suhyeon is your target.

540
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:56,208
Don't lay a finger on his brother.

541
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,335
Never?

542
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,797
That's right. Never.

543
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,137
Okay. Never.

544
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,324
Please, excuse me.

545
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:31,368
I'm done eating.

546
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,249
You haven't changed one bit.

547
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,734
What is it?

548
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,694
You drank the wine.

549
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,696
What if I had poisoned it?

550
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,747
Just kidding. Enjoy your meal.

551
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,925
That lunatic.

552
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,219
You saw Team A's leader?

553
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,596
Let's get a composite sketch immediately.

554
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,680
I already have one.

555
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:42,523
It's him.

556
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,525
And he could be the one
who killed my father.

557
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:45,943
I'm sure of it.

558
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,364
The man I saw that night…

559
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,700
Kim Seohee?

560
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,245
He was the one who raided the safe house.

561
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,873
The leader of Team A

562
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,126
may be your father's real killer?

563
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,047
Jeez. Look at that.

564
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,134
The chairman is involved in everything.

565
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,678
Happy?

566
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,056
Are you?

567
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,602
What about Woosin?
Is he still at that house?

568
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,355
Trying to get him out of there
in a hurry could put him in danger.

569
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,858
Cut that nonsense, god damn it.

570
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,611
You guys are all trash.

571
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,613
You knew Team A was a part of Haesong

572
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,283
and that Woosin was in danger,
yet you still haven't pulled him out?

573
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,786
Bring him out this instant.

574
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,830
I can't do that.

575
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:44,084
You can't? Why can't you take

576
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,962
Woosin out of that house?

577
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,338
Prosecutor Song.

578
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,549
Prosecutor Song.

579
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,844
Do you think Team A
will never find out about your brother?

580
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,305
You're their target.

581
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,141
Yet they leave your brother unscathed?

582
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:00,809
Is that possible?

583
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,566
Damn it.

584
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,778
There's no place he can hide
even if he leaves the estate.

585
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:16,658
The best thing we can do is
complete our mission as soon as possible.

586
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:22,831
We need to apprehend the chairman
and dissolve Team A.

587
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,482
What he said is true.

588
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,860
If we act rashly
and Chairman Kwon gets wind of it,

589
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,403
he'll get rid of the evidence.

590
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,156
You and your brother
will be his targets forever.

591
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,534
I know, but the SIH has too many secrets.

592
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:03,205
Even about Team A.
I just can't trust them.

593
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:05,540
Then what'll you do?

594
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,668
Get out of here.

595
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,146
Those brats.

596
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,816
I told them to close the curtains
properly after cleaning!

597
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:46,832
Ms. Kwon knows.

598
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:49,418
She knows where the Adamas is.

599
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,337
Darn. It's not like
I can torture her to make her spill it.

600
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:54,923
In any case, we should hurry.

601
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,925
I'll tell headquarters to track her.

602
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,177
Fortunately, we still have time.

603
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:03,807
Ms. Eun said they've yet
to draw the new design.

604
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:06,435
It'll take some time to recraft it.

605
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:08,562
But first things first.

606
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,691
Ms. Kwon has a son, right?

607
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,527
Yes. How did you know that?

608
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,487
Is he dead?

609
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:20,782
Yes. How did you know?

610
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,827
I saw a photo album in her room.

611
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,204
The last photo was from a decade ago.

612
00:44:27,914 --> 00:44:29,458
I don't know much

613
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,543
since it was before I came here.
But why do you ask?

614
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:32,919
I think…

615
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:37,632
Ms. Kwon's late son is her weakness.

616
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,052
Her room was empty.

617
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,179
She has no earthly desires.

618
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,725
The only object she cherishes
is her son's photo album.

619
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:51,313
What's your plan?
Pretend to be her son and make her talk?

620
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:54,066
Given her dubious personality,

621
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:56,443
you'll fail even before starting anything.

622
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,903
That's not what I'm saying.

623
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,198
It's just unexpected.

624
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,201
The chairman isn't the only one

625
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,370
who's receiving her love and care.

626
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,581
Chairman Kwon and Ms. Kwon.

627
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,168
They have a strange…

628
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,464
relationship.
But I just can't put my finger on it.

629
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,550
It's obvious.
It's unconditional obedience.

630
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,387
You're wrong.
It isn't some blind obedience.

631
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,514
It's more like…

632
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,518
her protective instinct.

633
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,020
Don't be absurd.

634
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,897
He doesn't need any protection.

635
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,524
That's exactly why it's strange.

636
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,905
I do know someone who may have the answer.

637
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:49,913
Interview? This late at night?

638
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,374
I want to pick up the pace.

639
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,918
I'd like to finish the memoir
as soon as possible.

640
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,589
You don't need to interview me.
It'll be such a hassle for you.

641
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:05,220
It'd be nice to learn
some new things about him.

642
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,565
Oh, please.

643
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,109
I can't talk about his personal life.

644
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:23,822
Do I look like someone who'd gladly
expose the chairman's weaknesses

645
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:25,740
just for some money?

646
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,659
Oh, I think you misunderstood.

647
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,370
I just want to know
a different side of him.

648
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:33,498
Perhaps his heartwarming relationships
with others.

649
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,127
For example,
his relationship with Ms. Kwon.

650
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,257
I'm not so sure.

651
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,761
They seem to have quite a unique bond.

652
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,349
Could it be friendship?
Or a certain type of love?

653
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:54,895
They have a history together.

654
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,897
You see,

655
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,983
she was like his shadow
ever since he was young.

656
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,612
Young Master, are you okay?

657
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,447
Young Master!

658
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,158
Are you okay?

659
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,708
If the chairman did something wrong,

660
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,793
she was often punished instead.

661
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,754
-I told you to take good care of him!

662
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:24,341
I'm sorry, Father.

663
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,551
That's what I heard.

664
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:31,014
The limp she has proves it.

665
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,769
She treats him like a babe in the woods.

666
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,438
That's because her family

667
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,482
has been serving this household

668
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,526
for countless generations.

669
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,697
Could anyone possibly fathom
the unconditional loyalty

670
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,075
she has for him?

671
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,618
Could that be why?

672
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:56,373
It was more than just simple loyalty.

673
00:47:56,581 --> 00:48:00,585
More like a guardian who's overprotective

674
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,921
of her child.

675
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,345
There is a heartbreaking story
behind that.

676
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,306
Do elaborate.

677
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:23,316
I think I should…

678
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,114
take this.

679
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,537
She doesn't think
he's a babe in the woods.

680
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,625
But more like her kid.

681
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,671
Her son.

682
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,886
The chairman had a heart transplant.

683
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,264
Yes. I'm aware of that.

684
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,474
So?

685
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:00,353
The donor was…

686
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,448
Was it…

687
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,951
her son?

688
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:19,748
Oh.

689
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,626
So she must feel like
she's reunited with her dead son

690
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,546
every time she sees the chairman.

691
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,592
After all, his heart once belonged
to her one and only son.

692
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,553
Gosh, I could only imagine.

693
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:40,226
But… How could that happen?

694
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,688
There is an order of priority
when it comes to those waiting lists.

695
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:48,985
Mr. Ha, we're talking about Haesong here.

696
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,905
They can easily put him
at the top of the list.

697
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,578
To be frank, it's such a pity.

698
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:01,790
Her son was so young
when he failed at his suicide attempt.

699
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,416
He ended up in a coma.

700
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,252
Hold on. Suicide?

701
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,090
Her son?

702
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,343
Yes. He hanged himself.

703
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,887
On the tree in front of her room.

704
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,058
And then,

705
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,937
he ended up brain-dead
and his heart was donated.

706
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,404
So that's whyshe always closed the curtains.

707
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,746
She wasn't trying to hide something.

708
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,500
She was the one hiding.

709
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,513
It was motherly love, not just affection.

710
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,475
Chairman Kwon was given

711
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:06,437
her son's heart.

712
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,322
Could that mean…

713
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,855
Did Eunkook Medical Center
carry out the chairman's heart transplant?

714
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,858
Yes. Is that why you're--

715
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:55,153
Ms. Oh told me
that Ms. Kwon's son was the donor.

716
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,822
Ms. Kwon's son?

717
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,157
Did you not know that?

718
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,201
No.

719
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:04,412
You once told me that nothing
happened by coincidence here.

720
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,624
But it just so happened that
your hospital carried out the procedure,

721
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,417
and Ms. Kwon's son was the donor.

722
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,337
If what Ms. Oh said was true

723
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,756
and the anonymous donor
was indeed Ms. Kwon's son,

724
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,467
then my father was involved.

725
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,179
Those who declared him brain-dead
worked at our hospital.

726
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,224
Perhaps, my father and the chairman

727
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,601
had made a deal.

728
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:29,020
What did you say?

729
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,731
What do you want me to do?

730
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:33,816
Get married.

731
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,069
Do you mean that?

732
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,404
I'm still grieving Minjo's death.

733
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,323
So?

734
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:43,159
Will waiting around
bring him back to life?

735
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,203
-Dad!
-Come on.

736
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:48,248
Chairman Kwon promised that
you'd become Haesong's daughter-in-law.

737
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,458
We should take him up on that offer.

738
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,293
Will you decline because Minjo died?

739
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,297
There's Hyunjo.

740
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,470
Who?

741
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,891
If you think about it,
this is actually much better.

742
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,103
It's better to marry the eldest.

743
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,938
He's Minjo's brother.

744
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,523
How could I marry him?

745
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:16,901
Why not? It's not like
you and Minjo were married.

746
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,196
Get it done within the year.

747
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,324
Am I an animal to you?

748
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,619
-How dare you?
-That's a pipe dream.

749
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,580
-The chairman would never--
-That's what he wants.

750
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,751
What do you mean…

751
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,090
This is small potatoes.

752
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,634
It's nothing compared
to what I did for him.

753
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,639
I finally get it now.

754
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,726
Instead of Minjo,

755
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,228
my husband was the one who had to pay.

756
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,649
-Pay?
-Becoming Haesong's daughter-in-law

757
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,360
must come with a price.

758
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,130
Did Ms. Kwon's son

759
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,799
really commit suicide?

760
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,637
It was staged.

761
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,330
What are you doing here?

762
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,544
It's our wedding night.

763
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:04,467
How could a new groom sleep
in another room on his honeymoon?

764
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,845
Imagine the rumors that'll spread.

765
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:11,849
Get up.

766
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,233
Don't get ahead of yourself.

767
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,194
I have no interest in you either.

768
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,781
Ever since I was young,

769
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,784
I never touched any of Minjo's things.

770
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,621
You piece of trash.

771
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,668
I…

772
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,841
I wasn't up for this marriage either.

773
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,009
I'm just fulfilling…

774
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,055
…Minjo's job.

775
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,518
Why did I marry you?

776
00:55:58,062 --> 00:55:59,147
I'm not sure.

777
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:05,069
Why did I marry you?

778
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:11,409
You want to know why we got married?

779
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,913
There's no reason.

780
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,874
It was what my father wanted.

781
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,796
Decline, and I would've
ended up like Minjo.

782
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,395
What do you mean?

783
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,193
What was that?

784
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:49,780
Answer me.

785
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,284
Is asking questions your second nature?

786
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,287
What if I told you
the meaning behind that?

787
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,581
Then what? Will you take revenge?

788
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,543
I see! Good luck with that!

789
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:07,048
I hope you get your revenge.

790
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,050
But you know what?

791
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,094
I can guarantee

792
00:57:13,971 --> 00:57:15,223
that'll never happen.

793
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,644
Cut the nonsense and answer me.

794
00:57:20,978 --> 00:57:22,647
Ended up like Minjo--

795
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,273
It's exactly what you think it means.

796
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,447
That's it.

797
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,411
We need an access card.
The stairs are a no-go.

798
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:19,912
Then the elevator?

799
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,206
We'll need to pass that room.

800
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,584
Leave it to me. Follow me.

801
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,053
-Excuse me.
-Why are you still up?

802
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,972
Is the night-duty room uncomfortable?

803
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:40,433
No, I just have a question.

804
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,352
That guy that I saw. Mr. Lee.

805
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,646
If he was the one who killed Mr. Song,

806
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,107
does that mean
the chairman isn't the killer?

807
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,152
Would that make him just guilty
of aiding and abetting?

808
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,987
I'm not that familiar with the law.

809
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,989
If that's all that he's guilty of,

810
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:56,490
the statute of limitations
must've expired.

811
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,701
And it'd be a headache
if Lee was the killer

812
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:01,787
since we don't know when
his statute of limitations will run out.

813
00:59:01,954 --> 00:59:04,999
If the chairman is only guilty
of aiding and abetting,

814
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:08,002
there's no reason for you guys
to carry out this mission.

815
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:10,671
Right. Team A is also your target.

816
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,006
Then does it not matter?

817
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:14,467
Or is there something else

818
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,302
that you guys are keeping from us?

819
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,179
What's wrong with this?

820
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:20,640
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

821
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,977
Did Prosecutor Song put you up to this?
To distract me?

822
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,236
Busted.

823
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:38,032
I need to get out.
There's something I have to do.

824
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,452
Right.

825
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,830
Biometrics.

826
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,584
Let's grab something to eat.

827
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,961
There's no time for such luxuries.

828
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:53,756
Are you really a prosecutor?

829
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,551
Everything that's crucial
happens while eating.

830
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,904
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

831
01:00:16,987 --> 01:00:20,700
I have a weak stomach
and can't eat with anyone I despise.

832
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:27,081
What is this?

833
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,084
Your new phone.
You can contact us with it.

834
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:32,795
After all, we're in the same boat.

835
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:36,048
Mm.

836
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:39,009
I applied for sick leave at your office.

837
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,930
For whom?

838
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,557
Me?

839
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,269
What the hell?

840
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:52,565
God damn it.

841
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:55,985
Prosecutor Song.

842
01:00:58,362 --> 01:00:59,530
My days are numbered.

843
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:04,243
Are you trying
to make me sympathize with you?

844
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:05,786
What do you mean, numbered?

845
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,874
The presidential election
will be over soon.

846
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,543
I'd be good as dead
if Hwang Byungchul is elected.

847
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,670
What are you on about?

848
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,757
LATE-NIGHT RICE BOWL

849
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:23,471
Haesong?

850
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,431
So you know.

851
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,851
Chairman Kwon has his back.

852
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,478
NEW FUTURE PARTY
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

853
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,563
What a scumbag.

854
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,398
You get the picture, right?

855
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,026
I've read your articles.

856
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,779
Your relationship
with Candidate Hwang is quite ill-fated.

857
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,530
I'm sick of him.

858
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:46,368
It's obvious if a Local News reporter
is more well-informed than political ones.

859
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,371
His name was always included
in every corrupt deed that I investigated.

860
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,332
Once Hwang becomes President,

861
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:53,417
what do you think
Haesong's first move will be?

862
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,256
A purge.

863
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,635
They'll set an example
by killing you first.

864
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,930
I know what I signed up for.

865
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,682
And they'll also go after you.

866
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,935
I've always liked…

867
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,521
living dangerously.

868
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,359
Do you know how many former presidents
were put up there by Haesong?

869
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:21,278
We're trying to put an end to that.

870
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:25,157
There are times
when Mr. Kang steps over the line.

871
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:27,493
But since he has conviction,

872
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:30,329
we obey him no matter what.

873
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,374
He doesn't hesitate to take the fall.

874
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:35,042
Because that's his definition of justice.

875
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:38,546
You won't hesitate
to be the lesser evil to defeat the worst?

876
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,257
You remembered what I said.

877
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:45,386
Fine. Let's do this.

878
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:47,471
Let's dig into this together.

879
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:50,850
But what's your name?

880
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,060
I don't have one.

881
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,355
We don't exist on paper.

882
01:02:56,438 --> 01:02:59,650
As members of the infiltration team,
we shouldn't know one another.

883
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,320
Then how should I address you?
I can't just say "Hey."

884
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:05,322
Ms. Lee.

885
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,410
Kang Hyukpil.

886
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:11,203
You're the only one with your name out.

887
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,914
That means you're willing
to take responsibility if things go south.

888
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,916
I get that.

889
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,293
I have one question.

890
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,170
I get that Haesong has gotten
several presidents elected so far.

891
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,423
But why are you so determined

892
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:25,718
to specifically stop
Candidate Hwang of all people?

893
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,598
Haesong's next business

894
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,766
is growing ARES, their defense industry.

895
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,894
They want to legalize firearms.

896
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:39,481
-What?
-Legalizing firearms.

897
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,110
They want to sell weapons?

898
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,447
Those lunatics.

899
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,908
That's the real reason why
they're supporting Candidate Hwang.

900
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:51,118
That's exactly why we must stop Team A.

901
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,166
Now, let's talk business.

902
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:02,129
I'm down.

903
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,716
All right, then.

904
01:04:06,216 --> 01:04:07,676
Good news or bad news?

905
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:11,013
Make it good news
since I'm on an empty stomach.

906
01:04:14,975 --> 01:04:18,520
They've moved the Adamas.
They're going to recraft it.

907
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,357
They want to get rid of any evidence of it
being the murder weapon?

908
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,483
How's that good news?

909
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,693
It is for you.

910
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,403
Me?

911
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,991
You're right.

912
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,369
Jeez.

913
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:36,914
I don't know whose idea it was,
but they deserve credit.

914
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:38,707
The fact that the Adamas isn't there

915
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,251
means that the SIH will need
to get involved, not Woosin.

916
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,130
But here's the catch. The bad news.

917
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,384
We need to hurry and find out where it is.

918
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,553
They'll reveal it at the upcoming
80th-anniversary ceremony.

919
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,890
Don't be such a baby.
I'm sure you're looking into it.

920
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,601
You're probably tracking the designer.

921
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,936
Good luck with that.

922
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:01,146
I need

923
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,983
to visit Lee Changwoo.

924
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:07,486
That's the thing you must do?

925
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,239
Those bastards even raided
your safe house.

926
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:13,325
There's no guarantee that he's safe.
I need to check on him.

927
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:31,844
Get up.

928
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:33,762
Get up.

929
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:41,478
What is it?

930
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,688
We received a tip-off.

931
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:47,317
I heard you took some narcotics
that were smuggled in.

932
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,071
No, sir.

933
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,203
Why are you doing this?
I never did such a thing.

934
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,080
That's what I think too.

935
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,541
But I still need to check.

936
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:06,462
Perhaps, Lee Changwoo is…

937
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,596
I got a strand of his hair, sir.

938
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:28,650
We'll find out soon enough.

939
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,891
Damn it.

940
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,030
What? You're not Lee Changwoo.

941
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,658
No wonder. Damn.

942
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:19,618
I'm screwed.

943
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,968
Don't kill me…

944
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,388
Don't kill me…

945
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,368
Yes, sir.

946
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:03,662
I got it.

947
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,289
I'm on my way.

948
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,009
Jeez.

949
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,554
Are that prosecutorand female reporter still alive?

950
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,807
Team A took Lee Changwoo's case file.

951
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,185
Where's Song Suhyeon?

952
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,396
I have a favor to ask of you.

953
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,524
Are you sure you got her weak spot?

954
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,276
About her dead son.

955
01:09:16,526 --> 01:09:19,321
What if we spread wordthat she knows where the Adamas is?

956
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,573
You're no different from Team A.

957
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,575
Did you deceive me?

958
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:25,953
Who are you?
