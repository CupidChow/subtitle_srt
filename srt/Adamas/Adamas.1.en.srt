MS. YEO: Let's be honest.
You're too successful

You're trying to prove to her
that we're closer than she thinks

-Power play.

that I'm on your side.

Whether it's intentional or not,
she'll think that way.

We shouldn't disappoint them.

191
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,905
After all, we're guardians of justice
who are paid by our country.

I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:59,305
It was just too hilarious
that I couldn't hold back.

202
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,515
-"Hilarious"?
-Yes, sir.

203
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:02,635
What was?

204
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,645
The fact that you want my department

205
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:06,355
to take over this case.

206
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:08,065
It seems like you're planning

207
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:10,775
to win the public over
with this controversial case

208
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,565
by supporting the death penalty.

209
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,695
All I want is for you
to help out with the trial.

210
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,615
What you really want is to support
Candidate Hwang as much as you can.

211
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,195
He's the most promising candidate.

212
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,455
If he gets elected,
it'll benefit us as well.

213
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,325
Mm. I don't think that's relevant to me.

214
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:30,205
There are many in the Special Department
who long to succeed, so ask them instead.

Hey, do you think I chose you
because I like you?

Your father's killer

217
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:41,345
is still alive, isn't he?

218
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,475
(clicks tongue)

219
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:47,055
I see. So that's why you picked me.

220
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:49,935
A murder victim's son becomes a prosecutor

221
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,975
and leads this case.
That'd be interesting.

222
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,565
Watch what you say.

223
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:54,735
No, thank you.

224
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:58,565
Even if Candidate Hwang
asks me in person, it'll still be a no.

225
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,275
I understand.

226

scheming such things.

But just help me out this once, will you?

Don't you think there will come a time
when you'll need my help too?

229
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,665
I don't rely on others for my success.

230
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:13,335
And I definitely don't need others
to have my back either.

323
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,325
and we may have been prepared for it,

324
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,535
but it's still sad and painful.

325
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,375
Saying goodbye is always heartbreaking.

326
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,385
I still won't treat you
like an older brother.

327
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:17,845
You little...

328
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,475
Where are you going?

329
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,265
Just here and there.

330
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,435
Exactly where?

331
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:27,605
Have mine. Bye.

332
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,815
That lunatic.

333
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,365
(retreating footsteps)

334
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,825
This is good.

335
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:46,915
(classical music)

336
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:56,555
DRIVER: By the way,

337
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:00,435
the residents in this area
call his residence a palace.

338
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:04,015
You may not know
since you're not from here.

339
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:06,935
But apparently,
he has a very expensive treasure.

340
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,565
You know what it is, right?

341
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:12,655
A treasure?

342
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:15,235
How thrilling.

343
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,955
(classical music continues)

344
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,005
(classical music fades)

345
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,435
(birds chirping)

346
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,775
(engine revs)

347
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,035
AGENT KIM: Mr. Ha Woosin!

348
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:02,575
-Hello.
-Hello.

349
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:05,375
This way, please.

350
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,635
(gloomy music)

351
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:31,985
AGENT KIM: This way.

352
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,275
(door whirring)

353
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:40,905
As a fan, I was so excited
to hear that you were coming.

354
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:42,325
WOOSIN: I appreciate it.

355
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:47,785
AGENT: He's good to go.

356
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,335
-(walkie beeps)
-Area two, clear.

357
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,205
AGENT KIM: Mr. Ha?

358
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,215
This way, please.

359
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:10,015
I have two separate copies
of all of your works.

360
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:13,025
One to just keep, and the other to read.

361
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,605
Right. I'll take your bag.

362
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,065
That's okay.

363
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:19,735
Excuse me.

364
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:24,535
Let me explain.
I'll give it back to you when you leave.

365
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:26,705
Personal items are not allowed.

366
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,285
There are only clothes
and writing utensils.

367
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,125
That's the rule. We'll provide you
with everything you need.

368
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:49,145
Do you know what biometrics are?

369
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,605
WOOSIN: A bit. Aren't they used
to identify an individual?

370
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,395
(exclaims)
You know your onions.

371
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:57,735
That's our security system.

372
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:01,575
We register our physical characteristics
on the system.

373
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:05,655
That way, we can tell
if someone is an outsider on the CCTV.

374
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:08,785
If someone
who's not registered comes close,

375
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,165
the alarm goes off.

376
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,125
So that's why those cameras
were all outside.

377
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:20,925
I was curious about the security system
inside the house.

378
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,715
Is this how you do it?

379
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,715
Not at all.
We don't have access to the indoor ones.

380
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:29,685
The chairman is very strict
about his private life.

381
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,935
-(chuckles)
-Maybe he has many secrets.

382
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,565
-Sorry?
-Nothing. What should I do now?

383
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,065
Right. Please enter this machine.

384
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:43,155
Enter that?

385
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:46,235
However, you must undress.

386
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,285
-Completely?
-Of course.

387
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:49,325
Wow.

388
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,205
(snorts)
I'm just joking.

389
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,455
Please.

390
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:59,085
(soft chuckle)
That's a relief.

391
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,675
(pensive music)

392
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,735
(computer trilling)

393
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:33,705
(trilling continues)

394
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,205
(beeps)

395
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:46,425
(pensive music stops)

396
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,355
Lastly, this is the most important agenda.

397
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,945
Can I have your autograph?
It's my most cherished book.

398
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:04,905
Sure. Can you hold the cap?

399
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:08,075

{\an8}CHIEF OF SECURITY
CHOI TAESUNG

404
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:26,885
Welcome, Mr. Ha.

405
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,675
(suspenseful music)

406
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:39,475
(engine revving)

407
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,365
Jeez.

408
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,745
They'll go extinct at this rate.

409
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,535
Was that him?

410
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,705
Our chairman's ghostwriter?

411
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:03,125
Yes. Isn't he handsome?

412
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,755
He is.

413
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:07,585
He looks like someone.

414
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,055
Who?

415
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:12,805
You wouldn't know.

416
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:15,595
(slow dramatic music)

417
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,315
(slow dramatic music continues)

418
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,985
(birds chirping)

419
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:00,305
AGENT PARK: This way, please.

420
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,525
(slow dramatic music continues)

421
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,225
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ha Woosin.

422
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:43,185
Do you not know how to bow? How impudent.

423
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,735
Right. Hello.

424
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,395
I'm Ms. Kwon.

425
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:53,825
Should I greet the chairman first?
Could you take me to him?

426
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:57,825
Are you implying
that you're my boss' guest,

427
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,075
so I should treat you well?

428
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,665
-Not really.
-MS. KWON: What a shame.

429
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:05,125
He's away at the moment
and won't return until tomorrow.

430
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:07,915
When the tiger
is absent from the mountain,

431
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:10,755
the fox is the alpha.

432
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:14,715
-I see.
-If you understand,

433
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:18,595
don't you dare talk back to me ever again
while you're here.

434
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:22,645
Yes, ma'am. Noted.

435
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,435
Escort our guest.

436
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,565
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:30,445
This way, please.

438
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:35,025
(dramatic music)

439
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:55,345
She's just as impressive as this house.

440
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:59,385
(tense music)

441
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:25,745
If you want to call someone outside,

442
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:28,455
you can use this phone in the lobby.

443
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:40,515
HEAD MAID: Your meals will be provided
at 7 a.m., 12 p.m.,

444
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:42,055
and 6 p.m.

445
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:44,635
They will be served here
on the first floor.

446
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:48,435
Feel free to make an order
if you crave anything in particular.

447
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:01,655
You may walk around the mansion
as you wish.

448
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:04,865
But the chairman's family areas
are off limits.

449
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,325
Above all else...

450
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:12,165
you are strictly forbidden from entering
his office on the third floor.

451
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,255
(tense music continues)

452
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:30,815
(tense music stops)

453
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:34,065
This is your bedroom.

454
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,195
Thank you. What's your name?

455
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:39,815
We maids are not allowed
to converse with our guests.

456
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:42,285
You may address me as Ms. Oh.

457
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:43,575
I see.

458
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:46,865
WOOSIN: By the way, Ms. Oh...

459
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:50,085
Yes, sir?

460
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,585
Why are you always looking down?

461
00:31:57,545 --> 00:32:00,135
Is it because
you shouldn't remember your guests' faces?

462
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:05,175
Right, we're not allowed to converse.

463
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:06,675
Thank you for escorting me.

464
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,225
(door closes)

465
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:20,365
People with a 19th-century mindset
in the 21st century?

466
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,745
How refreshing.

467
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:38,295
-Lee Dongrim.
-Did you just get here?

468
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,465
Why are you here?

469
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:42,885
It's obvious. How could I let
my owner leave without me?

470
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,005
But how did you know--

471
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:48,175
Ms. Yeo told me.
She said you'd need an assistant.

472
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,845
I asked her for some money in advance,

473
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,975
and she didn't hesitate
to give me extra work.

474
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,145
-(exhales)
-(grunts)

475
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:00,405
(sighs)

476
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:06,865
You see, I did a background check
on this place in advance

477
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,195
and checked out some rumors.

478
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,825
The people here are really something.

479
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:14,915
They're so old-fashioned. I can't believe
I'm in the middle of a class society.

480
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:16,585
They were meticulous.

481
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,545
Right? They're really no joke.

482
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,375
They must've done
a thorough background check.

483
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:24,345
The clothes they've given you
are exactly the style you normally wear.

484
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,755
Even the coffee.

485
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:30,305
It tastes very similar to the café
below your writing room.

486
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:34,645
(cap clatters)

487
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:42,565
Mm. You're right.

488
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:43,905
And about Ms. Kwon.

489
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:47,075
I thought she was a distant relative
of Chairman Kwon due to the same surname.

490
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,325
But her ancestors served
the family for generations.

491
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,575
During the Gabo Reform,
the caste system was abolished.

492
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,785
All the servants who had no surname
followed their masters'.

493
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,125
This is the real-life version of it.
It's really bizarre.

494
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,295
She has a unique communication method.
She processes others' words differently.

495
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:05,425
She tends to twist the meaning in them.

496
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:09,805
When communicating, we need to understand
each other's intentions universally.

497
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:12,595
But she processes their intentions
however she wants. She twists them.

498
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:16,895
But what's more bizarre is that
she acts like the lady of the house.

499
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:20,735
She could easily be mistaken for one
in those expensive clothes.

500
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,025
-Dongrim.
-Yes, sir?

501
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,605
Right. Did you know?

502
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,695
This mansion has cutting edge--

503
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,865
Just go.

504
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:29,655
Go? Where?

505
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,325
I don't need an assistant.

506
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,785
No, thanks. I'm getting paid a hefty sum.

507
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,955
DONGRIM: Jeez.

508
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,125
I'm also going to get my share of this.

509
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:40,955
Just listen to me.

510
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,875
I don't want to. Where could I possibly go
this late at night?

511
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,465
Turn off the lights.

512
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,425
(soft chuckle)

513
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:00,395
(sly music)

514
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,245
Ms. Kwon?

515
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,455
(music stops)

516
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,295

LOCAL NEWS REPORTER

A reporter?

522

How dare she come to my house?

Help.

Excuse me.

Someone has collapsed. Help.

Breathe.

(tense music)

564
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:12,855
Help us.

565
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:15,445
Hey.

566
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:16,775
What are you doing?

567
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,775
Ms. Oh, this woman collapsed.

568
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:22,405
What are you doing here?

569
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:24,825
Is that important right now?

570
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,825
-That woman has collapsed.
-MS. KWON: What's all this commotion?

(tense music stops)

572
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:31,665
Ma'am.

573
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:35,125
(ominous music)

574
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,045
(clicks tongue)
What a nuisance.

575
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,885

What should I do?
This wasn't part of the plan.

580
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:02,795
(birds chirping)

581
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,255
(door opens)

582
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,515
This is incredible.

583
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:10,135
This would be a great writing room.
It's spacious too.

584
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:11,435
Don't you agree?

585
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,395
(exhales deeply)

586
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,355
They sure know how to welcome their guest.

587
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:20,695
WOOSIN: This is the same
voice recorder that I use.

588
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,655
DONGRIM:
Are we going to start working today?

589
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:24,735
I will.

590
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:27,035
But not you since you'll be going home.

591
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:30,155
(sighs)
There you go again. I'm not leaving.

592
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:33,075
-Go.
-Come on.

593
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,665
Just go.

594
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,715
(sighs)
Will you keep this up?

595
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,755
-I already know everything.
-About what?

596
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,925
About why you chose to come here.

597
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,175
I know what your true intentions are.

598
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:48,965
What do you mean?

599
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:52,895
You'd be insane to ghostwrite for someone.

600
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:56,145
What are you getting at?

601
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,775
You're preparing for your next book,
and it's about conglomerates.

602
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,245
You're here for research purposes.

603
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:12,665
We're in the same boat.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

604
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:15,575
A melodramatic crime of passion
committed by the wealthy. That's my theme.

605
00:42:16,205 --> 00:42:18,295
This is free research,
and I'll be getting paid too.

606
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,375
-I struck gold, yet you want me to leave?
-Dongrim.

607
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,215
Call my name all you want.

608
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:23,925
I'm not going anywhere.

609
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,305
What is it?

610
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:34,515
This flower.

611
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,145
What about it?

612
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,725
Is that expensive? I picked it myself.

613
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:40,475
Where?

614
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:41,565
Outside.

615
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,155
There were many of them, so I picked one.

616
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,985
They wouldn't tell me
to compensate for it, would they?

617
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:53,705
(eerie music stings)

618
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:55,285
Mr. Ha.

619
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,335
Yes? How may I help you?

620
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:03,005
Things were chaotic last night,
so I didn't say anything.

621
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:05,295
But I feel bad for you.

622
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,215
You had to witness
such a sad sight so late at night.

623
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,135
I couldn't sleep, so I was taking a walk.

624
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:13,345
I see. A walk?

625
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:16,975
Ms. Oh told me
I could go wherever I wanted

626
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:20,015
except for the chairman's territory.

627
00:43:24,695 --> 00:43:25,985
I'll be more careful from now on.

628
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:27,405
(low grumbling)

629
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:30,025
By the way...

630
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,365
how's the maid?

631
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:36,075
-I heard she was taken to the hospital--
-(clacks)

632
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:39,375
I guess Ms. Oh left one thing out.

633
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,205
You should keep everything
you see or hear in this place a secret.

634
00:43:44,045 --> 00:43:45,045
Shh.

635
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,805
Yes, ma'am.

636
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:53,885
HA WOOSIN

637
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,345
(imitates static)
Isn't it amazing?

638
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,265
Is this book really that good?

639
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,935
Yes, it's the best.

640
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,975
What does this title mean? Is it English?

641
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:06,235
What does it mean?

642
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:07,815
MR. CHOI: Let me see it.

643
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:12,865
It's Latin for "the unwelcome one."

644
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,325
BOTH: Ooh.

645
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:15,825
Mr. Choi.

646
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:19,115
Is it about a diplomat
or a police officer?

647
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:21,495
Yes, it's the latter. How did you know?

648
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:24,875
Originally, that's what they called
a deported diplomat.

649
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:28,755
But it's also a term
for a police whistleblower.

650
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:30,085
The title of that book.

651
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:34,005
You must know so well since you also--

652
00:44:34,095 --> 00:44:35,175
(gun cocks)

653
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:36,885
What I mean is...

654
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:43,605
You know very well
since you were a former police officer.

655
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,065
MR. CHOI: What's it about?

656
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:49,775
Is the main character a corrupt cop
who tattled on his partner?

657
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,195
Well... Actually,

658
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:56,075
he's a hero of justice.

659
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,245
That's so cliché.

660
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,165
I could become a writer myself.

661
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,165
Anyway...

662
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:03,165
(cocks gun)

663
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:06,125
so that's that nerd's book?

664
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,255
(pensive music)

665
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:13,925
(birds chirping)

666
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:35,025
(pensive music continues)

667
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:02,685
Poppies.

668
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,435
WOMAN: Who are you?

669
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:09,855
I see. You're the chairman's guest.

670
00:46:11,775 --> 00:46:15,405
Yes, I am. And you're Eun Hyesoo,
his daughter-in-law, right?

671
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:17,615
Don't I look better in person?

672
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:21,705
But what brings you to my garden?

673
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:26,415
The door was open, so I let myself in
and spotted these.

674
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,665
Judging by the lack of fine hairs
and the round seed pockets,

675
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:32,715
this is opium.

676
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:36,005
-Correct.
-Isn't it illegal to grow them?

677
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:39,305
Nothing is illegal in this household.
We can do whatever we want.

678
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:45,475
I heard we need to be interviewed
for that memoir.

679
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:48,765
Yes, but it can be a casual one.

680
00:46:49,395 --> 00:46:51,435
It's up to me to determine
what to put in the memoir.

681
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,905
Let's have that interview right now.

682
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:57,615
-Right now?
-Is that a no?

683
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:00,365
We can.

684
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,075
HYESOO: Ask away.

685
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:08,205
Rather, should I tell you
the type of person I deem him as?

686
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:12,755
He'll do anything for his company.

687
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:15,255
Anything?

688
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,715
Imagine all the heinous
and disgusting things you can imagine.

689
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:21,675
HYESOO: He's capable
of committing all of them.

690
00:47:22,265 --> 00:47:24,305
His second son passed away
in a helicopter accident.

691
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,345
But was it really an accident?

692
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:34,525
This will be off the record.
That's a dangerous statement.

693
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:37,065
You're the one in danger, not me.

694
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:40,575
The more you know, the more dangerous
your situation here will be.

695
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:43,285
And you just exacerbated it.

696
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:46,955
I advise you to leave these premises
as soon as possible.

697
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:52,665
I beg to differ.

698
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:54,965
I'll take care of myself.

699
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:57,465
(helicopter whirring)

700
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,635
Do you hear that?

701
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:02,465
(whirring continues)

702
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:04,725
The chairman is here.

703
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:07,185
(water bottle hisses)

704
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:58,145
Leave as soon as possible?

705
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:00,405
That was a warning.

706
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:01,775
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

707
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:04,025
Where have you been? I've been looking--

708
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:05,985
Jeez, he's getting worse by the day.

709
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:09,205
WOOSIN: You did that on purpose,
didn't you?

710
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:10,745
You've become worse this year.

711
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:12,705
That doubles the pain.

712
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:14,455
It hurts.

713
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,705
Isn't she the daughter-in-law?

714
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:20,425
DONGRIM: The only daughter of Eunkook
Medical Center who married the eldest son.

715
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,425
Rumor has it that she's a psycho.

716
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:23,925
She can't hold a candle to you.

717
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:26,715
Isn't she bored here?

718
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:28,595
Her husband was nowhere in Seoul.

719
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,145
Mr. Ha. He wants to see you.

720
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:34,815
Chairman Kwon.

721
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:40,235
(tense music)

722
00:49:57,415 --> 00:50:00,715
I heard you skipped
the medication I gave you twice.

723
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,625
Why are you being so stubborn?

724
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:05,795
Did Ms. Yoon tell you that?
I told her not to tell you.

725
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:08,015
I should fire her.

726
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:12,515
Oh, please. Do you think
the new girl wouldn't report to me?

727
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:14,015
(Kwon chuckles)

728
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,065
KWON: You'll torment them all.
No one can disobey you.

729
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,405
By the way, Chairman Kwon.

730
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:29,615
Why are you calling me so softly?
You're scaring me.

731
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:33,205
About that writer. I just can't read him.

732
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:35,535
He's the biggest headache ever.

733
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,745
He doesn't give in when I intimidate him.
He actually fights back.

734
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,295
It'll be fun for you then.

735
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:44,715
Tame him if you can.
I know you're good at doing that.

736
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,465
Are you not going to take this seriously?

737
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:49,425
It's only been a day since he came.
Let's watch him for now.

738
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,845
-(Kwon sighs)
-(chair clatters)

739
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,225
(eerie music)

740
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:37,395
KWON: Come in.

741
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:00,995
Hello, sir. I'm Ha Woosin.

742
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:04,715
It's nice to meet you.

743
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:08,135
He looks like a decent guy.

744
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,555
Is that so?

745
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:14,425
He looks like him.

746
00:52:24,395 --> 00:52:25,525
It's strange.

747
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:28,735
His smile reminds me of that man.

748
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:31,445
How distasteful.

749
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:37,205
It's an honor to meet you.

750
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,785
(chuckles)
I'm flattered.

751
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,125
Cognac for me.

752
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:48,795
-Did you take a tour around the house?
-(door opens, closes)

753
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,755
-Yes, sir.
-What do you think?

754
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,465
It's an excellent environment.
I won't have any problems writing here.

755
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:56,095
That's good to hear.

756
00:52:56,805 --> 00:53:00,805
Anyway, what did you think about Hyesoo?

757
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:04,685
-Sorry?
-I heard you met her in the garden.

758
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:08,395
KWON: Don't be surprised.
Everyone here is watching.

759
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,905
You'll have to get used to it.

760
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:12,985
I interviewed her about you.

761
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:16,035
And what did she say?

762
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,955
He'll do anything for his company.

763
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:23,995
She said your company
was your top priority.

764
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:25,585
What else?

765
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:29,085
Imagine all the heinous
and disgusting things you can imagine.

766
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,635
He's capable of committing all of them.

767
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,465
She also said you made
the most unimaginable things come true.

768
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:36,095
And?

769
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:38,175
His second son passed away
in a helicopter accident.

770
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,185
But was it really an accident?

771
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:43,805
Sadly, we couldn't talk for long.

772
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:47,105
Once you get to have a long chat,

773
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,105
do let me know.

774
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,115
Tell me as it is.
I want to know everything.

775
00:53:56,905 --> 00:53:58,365
(tray clatters)

776
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:02,035
You can talk freely. She's deaf.

777
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:04,205
She can only read lips.

778
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:05,835
(liquid sloshing)

779
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:08,585
(bottle thuds)

780
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:10,795
(in English) Thank you.

781
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:15,425
(slurps)

782
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,845
WOOSIN: Excuse me for saying this, sir.

783
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:23,765
But what you just asked me to do
regarding your daughter-in-law

784
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:28,225
seems like you want me
to become your mole.

785
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:31,485
Not at all.

786
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:32,395
(inhales deeply)

787
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:35,565
I just don't know
what's going through her mind.

788
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,405
I only want to understand her.

789
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:40,115
I'm not so sure, sir.
I'd feel uncomfortable doing that.

790
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:43,915
Only those...

791
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:47,745
who are capable
of making refusals can do so.

792
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:50,705
I believe you have no right to do that.

793
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,425
(tense music)

794
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:56,845
Is this how you run your business?

795
00:54:56,925 --> 00:55:00,675
You offer a cheap price from the get-go
and try to intimidate others.

796
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:03,135
You're trying to scare me.

797
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:05,145
(scoffs)

798
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,935
Then what's your counterstrategy?

799
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:14,235
I advise you to find another ghostwriter.

800
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:15,565
You don't like the conditions?

801
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:17,315
I'm demanding the conditions
that I deserve.

802
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:21,745
I understand.

803
00:55:25,745 --> 00:55:27,125
KWON: I do.

804
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:35,545
Since I run a business,

805
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:38,595
I'm often in a situation
when I need to negotiate.

806
00:55:38,675 --> 00:55:40,715
Do you know who the fussiest people are?

807
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:43,475
The one who has the upper hand? No.

808
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:47,185

-MAN 1: Hello, sir.
-MAN 2: Hello, sir.

824
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:50,095
Let's have our meeting.

825
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:55,145
MANAGER LEE: Over nine million petitions
have been submitted to the Blue House,

826
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:56,475
asking to reinstate the death penalty.

827
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:58,645
We'll be submitting more once we get
more resident registration numbers

828
00:57:58,735 --> 00:57:59,895
from China this weekend.

829
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:01,815
We're doing our best
to win over the media as well.

830
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:03,865
I see. It's panning out well.

831
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:06,155
How's it going online?
Are people being swayed?

832
00:58:06,235 --> 00:58:07,655
Yes, it's going well. The Internet--

833
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,945
We've split the comment team
into three shifts.

834
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:12,995
Four additional groups have been made
to create new online communities.

835
00:58:13,165 --> 00:58:15,455
TEAM LEADER LEE:
Good. Make sure you keep this up.

836
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:18,295
The Internet is
the catalyst of all events.

837
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,755
Yes, sir.

838
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,415
TEAM LEADER LEE: Okay.

839
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,965
I believe we've set the basics.

840
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,425
Let's win this upcoming election.

841
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:28,715
MEN: Yes, sir.

842
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:32,935
Sir, Candidate Hwang seems
to be acting out a bit.

843
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:35,685
Is he? What is he saying?

844
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,725
He wants to spend more of our money

845
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,475
since he made the pledge
like we had asked.

846
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:42,395
If not, he thinks he'll be reminded of it
once he's in the Blue House.

847
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:46,985
(scoffs)
That bastard. He knows how to play.

848
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:48,905
He knows how to demand more money.

849
00:58:49,405 --> 00:58:51,285
What do you say? Should I meet with him?

850
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:53,995
That's okay.
Let me try to reason with him.

851
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:55,455
Yes, sir.

852
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:58,705
Did you process the expenses for 2006?

853
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:01,205
Yes, the accounting team took care of it
with the cost you mentioned.

854
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,125
I'll submit the report soon.

855
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:05,465
That was cheap.

856
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:06,925
There won't be any trouble.

857
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:09,175
We picked someone
who had great love for his children.

858
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:11,725
Okay. This is great.

859
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:15,435
(grunts)
DUKSOO: I won't be executed anyway.

860
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:17,975
Killing a few more won't change anything.

861
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:22,025
I hadn't killed anyone in a while.

862
00:59:23,275 --> 00:59:26,655
I'll have my cake and eat it too.

863
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:31,115

GONG: Prosecutor Song.

SUHYEON:
Is Chief Yang throwing a fit again?

866
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,075
Tell him I'm dead.

867
00:59:38,165 --> 00:59:41,335
It's not about him.
Some woman is here for you.

868
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:42,625
Hello.

869
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:45,085
(approaching footsteps)

870
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:48,545
And you are?

871
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:52,095
Hello, I'm Kim Seohee,
a local news reporter from TNC.

872
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:54,765
SEOHEE:
You were ignoring my calls and texts.

873
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:57,345
So I put my business card
on your gate yesterday.

874
00:59:57,435 --> 00:59:58,765
I'm sure you saw it.

875
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,265
Mr. Gong.

876
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:05,395
Yes, I did see it.

877
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,735
But what's the occasion?
Why would you want to see me?

878
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:11,405
I want some legal consultation.

879
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:12,615
I'm afraid I can't help you.

880
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:15,825
If it's for writing up an article,
ask our PR team.

881
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:17,915
No.

882
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:20,455
It has to be you.

883
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:30,005
-(paper rustles)
-(scoffs)

884
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,465
(inhales deeply)

885
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:34,595
I'll give you five minutes
since I'm curious.

886
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:40,895
I'm sure you're aware that the public
is supporting the death penalty.

887
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:44,225
It's all over the media, TV,
and both offline and online.

888
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:46,855
This widespread effect
is typical of media manipulation.

889
01:00:46,945 --> 01:00:48,275
Everything's planned out.

890
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:50,365
Candidate Hwang from New Future Party

891
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:53,115
pledged to reinstate
the death penalty if he gets elected.

892
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:55,785
Do you think
this is all just a coincidence?

893
01:00:56,405 --> 01:01:00,115
Look, Ms. Kim.
Can't you just cut to the chase?

894
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:05,255
He's using the death penalty
to his advantage so he can be elected.

895
01:01:08,255 --> 01:01:09,925
Do you know how ridiculous you are?

896
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:12,005
Why would you tell me this?

897
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:15,095
If Candidate Hwang gets elected,
the death penalty will be reinstated.

898
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,975
And among the first to get executed...

899
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:20,265
is Lee Changwoo.

900
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:22,935
Your late father's murderer.

901
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,485
What are you getting at?

902
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:30,605
I believe he was framed.

903
01:01:30,695 --> 01:01:31,655
(scoffs)

904
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:34,195
-Framed?
-Yes.

905
01:01:37,785 --> 01:01:40,155
You're being quite rude
during our first encounter.

906
01:01:40,245 --> 01:01:43,205
They say reporters are all novelists.
Are you writing fiction?

907
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:45,295
If this is a novel, then it's a tragic one

908
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:47,415
because Lee Changwoo
will meet a wrongful death.

909
01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:49,045
Listen.

910
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:51,585
That bastard is the culprit.

911
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,335
I'm a prosecutor, you know?

912
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:55,925
The murder weapon was never found.

913
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,765
That means someone took it.

914
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:02,515
Think about that. Who could it have been?

915
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:07,225
That's enough. You may leave.

916
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,525
If he gets executed,

917
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:12,985
you'll never find the one
who really murdered your father.

918
01:02:13,065 --> 01:02:14,405
Get out!

919
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:15,405

921
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,165
I put this case file together.
Take a look.

922
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:30,505
As a prosecutor,

923
01:02:30,585 --> 01:02:33,005
I'm sure you're more familiar
with reasonable doubt than I am.

01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:19,215
Chew this. They can read your lips.

970
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:21,425
-What's this about?
-(paper rustles)

971
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,805
Headquarters reported something urgent.

972
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:25,965
It better be urgent.

973
01:05:26,595 --> 01:05:30,015
They received
an anonymous e-mail regarding you.

974
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:32,725
-Me?
-Yes.

975
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:34,895
The content was simple.

976
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,105
Your name...

977
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:39,025
(fingers snap)
...and this address.

978
01:05:41,025 --> 01:05:44,695
MR. CHOI: The sender must know who I am
if they sent it to headquarters.

979
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,075
-Someone from Chairman Kwon's side?
-No, I doubt it.

980
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,035
Had he learned about my past,
I would be long gone.

981
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:52,665
You would never even find my body.

982
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:55,795
-You're right.
-It could've been worse.

983
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:58,205
Seeing how they sent it there instead,

984
01:05:58,295 --> 01:06:00,165
they want to strike a deal with us.

985
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:02,505
Then they'll reveal themselves soon.

986
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:04,925
-The sender?
-We're looking into it.

987
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:10,305
SERGEANT:
The e-mail address is <i>"persona non grata."</i>

988
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:14,015
They used an overseas IP address.

989
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:17,935
So I doubt we'll be able to catch them.

990
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,645
This little scumbag.

991

Stop cussing at me.
I'm in my forties now, okay?

992
01:06:27,945 --> 01:06:29,155

That's exactly what you are.
The unwelcome one.

999
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:16,875
Why did you come here?

1000
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:24,875
WOOSIN'S MOM: <i>Woosin.</i>

1001

Yes, Mom?

1002
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:30,385
Your father...

1003
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:32,925
My father?

1004
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:37,395
He's innocent.

1005
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:40,225
What do you mean?

1006
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:42,395
He's...

1007
01:07:43,945 --> 01:07:46,065

Jeez, how terrifying.
What is this world coming to?

1015
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:12,425
WOOSIN: What is it?

1016
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,055
It's about Candidate Hwang Byungchul.

1017
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,015
He was stabbed in the thigh
in front of his house.

1018
01:08:18,435 --> 01:08:20,685
I just spoke with my mom,
and it has caused a commotion.

1019
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,395
WOOSIN:
I guess they weren't going to kill him.

1020
01:08:25,025 --> 01:08:25,985
What?

1021
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:28,235
He was stabbed in the thigh
in front of his house.

1022
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:31,275
He must've let his guard down
since it was his own home.

1023
01:08:33,115 --> 01:08:35,535
They could've stabbed him
in a critical area if they wanted to.

the flyers at the crime scene

to go after the culprit.

1027
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:46,415
Candidate Hwang Byungchul
who has been taken to the hospital

1028
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,545
stated that he was not intimidated.

What? What was that?

1034
01:09:08,775 --> 01:09:11,155
I heard you were hurt, so I came to visit.

1035
01:09:12,155 --> 01:09:14,325
At this hour? Are you kidding me?

All right. Good news.

You'll be on the front page

That's a head-turner.
You'll benefit from it.

1042

Did you like it? It was my idea.

1043

I should've sliced your neck instead.

Why are you doing this?

Why?

Let me tell you why.

1051
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,165

who tries to control his master

1053

Look.

1055
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:12,255
I'm sorry.

1056
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:16,005
I must've been exhausted
from all the campaigning

1057

All right. Remember this.

Haesong is the one in control.

(Byungchul groans)

1062

You're just a pawn on a chessboard.

1063
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:35,115
The game will still resume
even if a pawn is gone.

You were bribed by Haesong Group

1128
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:20,775
Look at that.

1129
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:23,945
It seems like you came here
with an ulterior motive.

1130

LEE CONFESSES TO MURDERING SONG

1131
01:15:29,235 --> 01:15:31,655
SEOHEE: <i>The murder weapon was never found.</i>

1132
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,155
That means someone took it.

1133
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:36,035
(sighs)

1134
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,245
MURDER CASE WITH NO EVIDENCE

Mr. Writer, let's put an end to this
if you're not going to tell me the truth.

1136
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:49,805
That arrowhead logo.

1137
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:52,015
WOOSIN: That's it.

1138
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:53,925
That's why I'm here.

1139
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:57,935
Don't be vague and explain in detail.

SUHYEON: The murder weapon disappeared.

1142
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:08,275
Where could it be?

01:16:11,615 --> 01:16:13,075
WOOSIN: <i>The symbol of Haesong Group.</i>

1144
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:16,455
<i>The arrow with a diamond tip.</i>

1145
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,915
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

in private first?

1154
01:16:55,615 --> 01:16:57,285
{\an8}SUHYEON:
<i>Is it your passionate sense of justice</i>

1155
01:16:57,365 --> 01:16:59,665
{\an8}<i>that's making you cover my father's case?</i>
