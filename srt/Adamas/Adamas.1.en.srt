59

Do you think they will bring it back
after this incident?

Let's do it then.

83
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,842
Okay.

MS. YEO SOOJUNG

85
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,014
Let's do it.

(horn honking in distance)

87
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,113
Chairman Kwon
must know someone who's your fan,

88
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,908

89
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,369
Is that so? I wonder who it is.

90
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,955
You'll see for yourself,
but the conditions...

91
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,500
(scoffs)
They're good. They're excellent.

92
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,961
Let me read it first.

93
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
WRITING CONTRACT

94
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,297
MS. YEO: Let's be honest.
You're too successful

95
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,258
to be a ghostwriter.

96
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,884
Why would a best-selling writer

97
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,387
choose to become a ghostwriter?

98
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,555
However,

99
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,432
this isn't just any memoir.

100
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,185
We're talking about
Kwon Jaekyu of Haesong.

101
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,774
WOOSIN: "The writing will take place
where the client desires"?

102
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,109
MS. YEO: Yes, at his residence.

103
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,778
And I can't leave his place
until I'm done with the memoir?

104
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,530
Due to security reasons.

105
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,283
Put up with it for just one month,
and the money will be yours.

106
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,702
I understand the need
for a confidentiality agreement,

107
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,370
but why can't I use my phone?

108
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,747
They'll provide a fixed-line.

109
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,957
That they'll tap.

110
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,333
Come on.

111
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,628
How fascinating.
Everything will be confidential,

112
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,256
and I'll merely be a ghostwriter.

113
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,800
Woosin.

114
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,345
You'll benefit from this
even with all these restrictions.

115
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,931
I'd take the offer right away
if I were you.

00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,933
DONGRIM: Who ordered coffee?

117
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,728
You even make coffee now?
When do you write?

118
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,939
I didn't ask him to.
I'm not that kind of person.

119
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,567
I can brew coffee and write.

120
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,277
I may be your pupil,

121
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,487
but she's the one who's paying me.

-Why did you even bring us the coffee?

124
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,122

-MS. YEO: You little...

126

128
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
I didn't think you'd cave.

129
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,134
-(thuds)
-It's a handsome sum.

130
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,554
Come on. I know you're not the type
who's swayed by money.

131
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,681
What is it you want to say?

132
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,559
-What do you mean?
-What do you need to say to her?

133
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
Me?

134
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,731
Among all the seats here,
you chose to sit next to me.

135
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,233
You're acting friendlier than usual
toward me.

136
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,070
You're trying to prove to her
that we're closer than she thinks

137
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,364
so she'll say yes to whatever you say.

138
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,492
-That's not true.
-Power play.

139
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,036
You want her to think
that I'm on your side.

140
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,831
Whether it's intentional or not,
she'll think that way.

141
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,378
Really? Is that so?

142
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,380
(awkward chuckle)
He's wrong.

143
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,383
I'll leave you two to it then.
I have lunch plans.

-No way.

181
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
It's you, right?

182
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,830
Yes.

183
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,708
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Section Chief Gong.

184
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,127
(laughs)

185
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,339
Jeez. But he's not in.

186
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,633
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

187
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,260
DEPUTY HEAD: This was an unprecedented
case in the entire constitutional history.

188
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,220
KANGCHUN PENITENTIARY MASSACRE

189
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,889
The public has high expectations
for the prosecution.

190
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,225
We shouldn't disappoint them.

191
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,895
After all, we're guardians of justice
who are paid by our country.

192
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,188
CHIEF YANG: Yes, sir.

193
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,649
DEPUTY HEAD: You're the only one
who can save our faces.

194
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,443
Prosecutor Song, are you confident?

195
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,653
(snorts)

196
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,280
-Hey.
-Chief Yang.

197
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,241
Yes, sir.

198
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,992
(laughs)

199
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,411
You're laughing?

200
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,291
It was just too hilarious
that I couldn't hold back.

202
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,502
-"Hilarious"?
-Yes, sir.

203
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,628
What was?

204
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,630
The fact that you want my department

205
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,340
to take over this case.

206
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,050
It seems like you're planning

207
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,761
to win the public over
with this controversial case

208
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,555
by supporting the death penalty.

209
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,682
All I want is for you
to help out with the trial.

210
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,601
What you really want is to support
Candidate Hwang as much as you can.

211
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,188
He's the most promising candidate.

212
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,440
If he gets elected,
it'll benefit us as well.

213
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,318
Mm. I don't think that's relevant to me.

214
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,197
There are many in the Special Department
who long to succeed, so ask them instead.

215
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,118
Hey, do you think I chose you
because I like you?

216
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,039
Your father's killer

217
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,333
is still alive, isn't he?

218
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,460
(clicks tongue)

219
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,047
I see. So that's why you picked me.

220
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,925
A murder victim's son becomes a prosecutor

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,969
and leads this case.
That'd be interesting.

222
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,554
Watch what you say.

223
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,722
No, thank you.

224
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,559
Even if Candidate Hwang
asks me in person, it'll still be a no.

225
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,269
I understand.

226
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,772
I know you're against
scheming such things.

227
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,482
DEPUTY HEAD:
But just help me out this once, will you?

228
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,319
Don't you think there will come a time
when you'll need my help too?

229
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,654
I don't rely on others for my success.

230
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,324
And I definitely don't need others
to have my back either.

231
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,286
-Song Suhyeon.
-Sir?

232
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,704
Life is long.

233
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,873
You will regret this one day.

234
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,253
Then I'll see you when that day comes.

235
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,175
DEPUTY HEAD: What?

236
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,718
That idiot.

237
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,179
-Hey, Song Suhyeon!
-(door closes)

238
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,016
(crashing)

239
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,728
-(thuds)
-CHIEF YANG: Where's Song Suhyeon?

240
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,855
That lunatic!

241
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,525
He should calm down.

242
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,444
Sir, please calm down.

243
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,321
Darn it!

244
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,698
How dare he disobey the deputy head?

245
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,201
Does he think he's all that

246
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,536
since the deputy head
has always been nice to him?

247
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,497
Darn it! Where is he?

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,084
I don't know, sir.

249
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,795
Jeez.

250
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,048
Everyone here is impossible.

251
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,092
They're serious
about the most ridiculous matters.

252
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,094
What is it this time?

253
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,054
Never mind.

254
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,601
What's the occasion? Why are you here?

255
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,937
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

256
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,146
You little punk.

257
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,607
SUHYEON: Buy me a meal.

258
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,693
An expensive one since I feel like crap.

259
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,612
Do I owe you money or something?
You always tell me to treat you.

260
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,489
SUHYEON:
Prosecutors barely make ends meet.

261
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
Isn't that Prosecutor Song?

262
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,207
Just stop whatever you're doing.

263
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,418
Keep this up,
and you won't be here for long.

264
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,421
Don't butt in
when you don't know anything.

265
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,966
Demote or ostracize me all they want.
I still won't resign.

266
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,509
You'll probably expose them.

267
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,890
After all, you only live once.

268
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,855
<i>♪ You only live once ♪</i>

269
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,189
Hey.

270
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,737
Darn it.

271
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,072
(protesters clamoring)

272
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,991
I came all the way here for nothing.

273
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,453
I heard they were twins.

274
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
(wind gusting)

275
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,664
What?

276
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,709
It's raining now?

277
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,919
-WOMAN 2: Excuse me.
-Yes?

278
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,505
-Please take a look at this.
-SEOHEE: Okay.

279
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,925
Those death-row inmates are evil.

280
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,219
-(awkward chuckle)
-They all deserve to die.

281
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,556
Candidate Hwang Byungchul strives
to make this nation clean.

282
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,932
What? Clean?

283
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,602
That's right. Sinners need to be punished.

284
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,937
Then he needs to be punished first.

285
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,191
-What?
-He's the most heinous person I know.

286
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
-Who are you?
-What are you doing?

287
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,070
-Who sent you?
-What's wrong with you?

288
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,738
-Who?
-Please stop.

289
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,240
How much did they pay you to bother us?
How much?

290
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,242
-GUARD: Please stop.
-WOMAN 2: Let me go!

291
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,162
(sighs)

292
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,753
HWANG BYUNGCHUL
NEW FUTURE PARTY

293
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,507
Darn it. Clean, my foot.

294
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,884
Don't make me laugh.

295
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,929
PROTESTERS: We demand it!

296
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,014
MAN: Heinous criminals deserve
the death penalty!

297
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,391
PROTESTERS: They deserve it!

298
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,811
MAN:
We demand a strong law-governed country!

299
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,896
(protesters gasp)

300
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,234
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

301
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,951
SUHYEON: Why would you have lunch outside
on such a gloomy day?

302
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,369
(paper rustles)

303
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,538
And all you could treat me to
was a burger? Seriously?

304
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,958
You and I seriously don't get along.

305
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,920
You're stuffing yourself well.

306
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,589
Stuffing what?
Watch what you say to your older brother.

307
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,593
Older brother, my foot.
I'm sick of hearing that.

308
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,889
Just wait and see. One day,
you will give me the respect I deserve.

309
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,891
Sure, I'll give it to you once
before you die.

310
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,770
Just cut to the chase, will you?

311
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,773
Jeez. I'm a busy man.

312
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,067
And don't just be nice to me
when you need something.

313
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,946
It's nothing big.

314
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,450
I'm going on a month-long trip.

315
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,706
A trip?
(chuckles)

316
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,792
That's it? I thought you were
getting married or something.

317
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm leaving my phone behind.
I'll call you if I want to.

318
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,630
I don't care.

319
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,845
That's actually good.

320
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,764
We didn't have much time to heal...

321
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,602
after Mom passed away.

322
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,814
She may have been bedridden for a while,

323
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,317
and we may have been prepared for it,

324
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,529
but it's still sad and painful.

325
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,368
Saying goodbye is always heartbreaking.

326
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,375
I still won't treat you
like an older brother.

327
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,836
You little...

328
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,465
Where are you going?

329
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,258
Just here and there.

330
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,427
Exactly where?

331
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,596
Have mine. Bye.

332
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,808
That lunatic.

333
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,353
(retreating footsteps)

334
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,814
This is good.

335
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,907
(classical music)

336
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,541
DRIVER: By the way,

337
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,420
the residents in this area
call his residence a palace.

338
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,007
You may not know
since you're not from here.

339
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,927
But apparently,
he has a very expensive treasure.

340
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,554
You know what it is, right?

341
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,641
A treasure?

342
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,227
How thrilling.

343
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,940
(classical music continues)

344
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,994
(classical music fades)

345
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,426
(birds chirping)

346
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,762
(engine revs)

347
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,020
AGENT KIM: Mr. Ha Woosin!

348
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,566
-Hello.
-Hello.

349
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,360
This way, please.

350
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,620
(gloomy music)

351
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,970
AGENT KIM: This way.

352
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,266
(door whirring)

353
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,896
As a fan, I was so excited
to hear that you were coming.

354
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,314
WOOSIN: I appreciate it.

355
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,778
AGENT: He's good to go.

356
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,322
-(walkie beeps)
-Area two, clear.

AGENT KIM: Mr. Ha?

358
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
This way, please.

359
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,008
I have two separate copies
of all of your works.

360
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,011
One to just keep, and the other to read.

361
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,598
Right. I'll take your bag.

362
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,058
That's okay.

363
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,726
Excuse me.

364
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,523
Let me explain.
I'll give it back to you when you leave.

365
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,691
Personal items are not allowed.

366
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,278
There are only clothes
and writing utensils.

367
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,116
That's the rule. We'll provide you
with everything you need.

368
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,131
Do you know what biometrics are?

369
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,592
WOOSIN: A bit. Aren't they used
to identify an individual?

370
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,386
(exclaims)
You know your onions.

371
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,722
That's our security system.

372
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,560
We register our physical characteristics
on the system.

373
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,647
That way, we can tell
if someone is an outsider on the CCTV.

374
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,775
If someone
who's not registered comes close,

375
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,152
the alarm goes off.

376
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,118
So that's why those cameras
were all outside.

377
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,912
I was curious about the security system
inside the house.

378
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,706
Is this how you do it?

379
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,709
Not at all.
We don't have access to the indoor ones.

380
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,671
The chairman is very strict
about his private life.

381
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,923
-(chuckles)
-Maybe he has many secrets.

382
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,553
-Sorry?
-Nothing. What should I do now?

383
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,057
Right. Please enter this machine.

384
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,143
Enter that?

385
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,229
However, you must undress.

386
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,273
-Completely?
-Of course.

387
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,316
Wow.

388
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,196
(snorts)
I'm just joking.

389
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,448
Please.

390
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,075
(soft chuckle)
That's a relief.

391
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,662
(pensive music)

392
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,720
(computer trilling)

393
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:28,693
(trilling continues)

394
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
(beeps)

395
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,414
(pensive music stops)

396
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,340
Lastly, this is the most important agenda.

397
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,931
Can I have your autograph?
It's my most cherished book.

398
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,891
Sure. Can you hold the cap?

399

Welcome, Mr. Ha.

405
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,668
(suspenseful music)

407
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,357
Jeez.

408
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,735
They'll go extinct at this rate.

409
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,528
Was that him?

410
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,697
Our chairman's ghostwriter?

411
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,116
Yes. Isn't he handsome?

412
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,744
He is.

413
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,579
He looks like someone.

414
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,040
Who?

415
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,792
You wouldn't know.

00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,298
AGENT PARK: This way, please.

420
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,517
(slow dramatic music continues)

421
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,213
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ha Woosin.

422
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,174
Do you not know how to bow? How impudent.

423
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,720
Right. Hello.

424
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,389
I'm Ms. Kwon.

425
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,810
Should I greet the chairman first?
Could you take me to him?

426
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,814
Are you implying
that you're my boss' guest,

427
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,065
so I should treat you well?

428
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,651
-Not really.
-MS. KWON: What a shame.

429
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,113
He's away at the moment
and won't return until tomorrow.

430
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,907
When the tiger
is absent from the mountain,

431
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,744
the fox is the alpha.

432
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,706
-I see.
-If you understand,

433
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,585
don't you dare talk back to me ever again
while you're here.

434
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,630
Yes, ma'am. Noted.

435
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,426
Escort our guest.

436
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,553
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,430
This way, please.

438
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,018
(dramatic music)

439
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,330
She's just as impressive as this house.

440
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,375
(tense music)

441
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,735
If you want to call someone outside,

442
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,446
you can use this phone in the lobby.

443
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,500
HEAD MAID: Your meals will be provided
at 7 a.m., 12 p.m.,

444
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,043
and 6 p.m.

445
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
They will be served here
on the first floor.

446
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,424
Feel free to make an order
if you crave anything in particular.

447
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,646
You may walk around the mansion
as you wish.

448
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,858
But the chairman's family areas
are off limits.

449
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,317
Above all else...

450
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,156
you are strictly forbidden from entering
his office on the third floor.

451
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,243
(tense music continues)

452
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,800
(tense music stops)

453
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,053
This is your bedroom.

454
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,180
Thank you. What's your name?

455
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,809
We maids are not allowed
to converse with our guests.

456
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,270
You may address me as Ms. Oh.

457
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,563
I see.

458
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,858
WOOSIN: By the way, Ms. Oh...

459
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,069
Yes, sir?

460
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,575
Why are you always looking down?

461
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,121
Is it because
you shouldn't remember your guests' faces?

462
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,168
Right, we're not allowed to converse.

463
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,669
Thank you for escorting me.

464
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,217
(door closes)

465
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,350
People with a 19th-century mindset
in the 21st century?

466
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,736
How refreshing.

467
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,284
-Lee Dongrim.
-Did you just get here?

468
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,452
Why are you here?

469
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,872
It's obvious. How could I let
my owner leave without me?

470
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,999
But how did you know--

471
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,169
Ms. Yeo told me.
She said you'd need an assistant.

472
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,838
I asked her for some money in advance,

473
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,966
and she didn't hesitate
to give me extra work.

474
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,133
-(exhales)
-(grunts)

475
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,390
(sighs)

476
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,854
You see, I did a background check
on this place in advance

477
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,189
and checked out some rumors.

478
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,817
The people here are really something.

479
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,904
They're so old-fashioned. I can't believe
I'm in the middle of a class society.

480
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,572
They were meticulous.

481
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,534
Right? They're really no joke.

482
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,369
They must've done
a thorough background check.

483
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,330
The clothes they've given you
are exactly the style you normally wear.

484
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,749
Even the coffee.

485
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,294
It tastes very similar to the café
below your writing room.

486
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,632
(cap clatters)

487
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,557
Mm. You're right.

488
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,891
And about Ms. Kwon.

489
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,061
I thought she was a distant relative
of Chairman Kwon due to the same surname.

490
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,313
But her ancestors served
the family for generations.

491
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,567
During the Gabo Reform,
the caste system was abolished.

492
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,778
All the servants who had no surname
followed their masters'.

493
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,115
This is the real-life version of it.
It's really bizarre.

494
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,285
She has a unique communication method.
She processes others' words differently.

495
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,413
She tends to twist the meaning in them.

496
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,792
When communicating, we need to understand
each other's intentions universally.

497
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,587
But she processes their intentions
however she wants. She twists them.

498
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,883
But what's more bizarre is that
she acts like the lady of the house.

499
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,720
She could easily be mistaken for one
in those expensive clothes.

500
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,014
-Dongrim.
-Yes, sir?

501
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,599
Right. Did you know?

502
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,684
This mansion has cutting edge--

503
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,852
Just go.

504
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,645
Go? Where?

505
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,314
I don't need an assistant.

506
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,776
No, thanks. I'm getting paid a hefty sum.

507
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,943
DONGRIM: Jeez.

508
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,113
I'm also going to get my share of this.

509
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,948
Just listen to me.

510
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,868
I don't want to. Where could I possibly go
this late at night?

511
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,453
Turn off the lights.

512
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,415
(soft chuckle)

513
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,384

514
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,236

00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:18,134
<i>After serving 15 years behind bars
for habitual larceny,</i>

534
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,720
<i>he murdered Song, his victim,
near his residence</i>

535
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,598
<i>only one month after being discharged.
He was arrested on the spot--</i>

536
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,898
That bastard.

537
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,361
(pensive music)

538
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,243
(tense music stings)

539
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,455
(breathes heavily)

540
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,542
(grunts)

541
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,421
(sighs)

542
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,243
You are strictly forbidden from entering
his office on the third floor.

543
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,287
(door closes)

544
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,839
(suspenseful music)

545
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,519
(door opens)

546
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,482
(door closes)

547
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,944
(suspenseful music continues)

548
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,541
(woman grunts)

549
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,504
(woman retching)

550
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,007
(woman gasping)

551
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,509
(woman coughing)

552
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,345
(gagging)

553
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,393
(woman gagging)

554
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,478
(tense music)

555
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,608
Hey.

556
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,112
Help.

557
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,114
Excuse me.

558
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,450
Someone has collapsed. Help.

559
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,410
Someone has collapsed. Help.

560
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,583
WOOSIN: Hey.

561
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,419
Can you see me?

562
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,629
Breathe.

563
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,216
(tense music)

564
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,845
Help us.

565
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,431
Hey.

566
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,766
What are you doing?

567
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,769
Ms. Oh, this woman collapsed.

568
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,396
What are you doing here?

569
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,815
Is that important right now?

570
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,818
-That woman has collapsed.
-MS. KWON: What's all this commotion?

571
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,903
(tense music stops)

572
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,655
Ma'am.

573
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,117
(ominous music)

574
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,037
(clicks tongue)
What a nuisance.

575
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,875
(ominous music)

576
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,398
(engine revs)

577
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
(ominous music stops)

578
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,438
(eerie music)

579
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,116
What should I do?
This wasn't part of the plan.

580
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,788
(birds chirping)

581
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,249
(door opens)

582
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,501
This is incredible.

583
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,129
This would be a great writing room.
It's spacious too.

584
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,422
Don't you agree?

585
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,383
(exhales deeply)

586
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,344
They sure know how to welcome their guest.

587
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,681
WOOSIN: This is the same
voice recorder that I use.

588
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,642
DONGRIM:
Are we going to start working today?

589
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,727
I will.

590
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,021
But not you since you'll be going home.

591
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,149
(sighs)
There you go again. I'm not leaving.

592
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,068
-Go.
-Come on.

593
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,653
Just go.

594
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,700
(sighs)
Will you keep this up?

595
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,744
-I already know everything.
-About what?

596
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,914
About why you chose to come here.

597
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,166
I know what your true intentions are.

598
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,959
What do you mean?

599
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,880
You'd be insane to ghostwrite for someone.

600
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,133
What are you getting at?

601
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,767
You're preparing for your next book,
and it's about conglomerates.

602
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,230
You're here for research purposes.

603
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,650
We're in the same boat.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

604
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,569
A melodramatic crime of passion
committed by the wealthy. That's my theme.

605
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,280
This is free research,
and I'll be getting paid too.

606
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,366
-I struck gold, yet you want me to leave?
-Dongrim.

607
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,201
Call my name all you want.

608
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,911
I'm not going anywhere.

609
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,291
What is it?

610
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,505
This flower.

611
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,131
What about it?

612
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,717
Is that expensive? I picked it myself.

613
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,469
Where?

614
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,554
Outside.

615
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,139
There were many of them, so I picked one.

616
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,976
They wouldn't tell me
to compensate for it, would they?

617
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,691
(eerie music stings)

618
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,276
Mr. Ha.

619
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,320
Yes? How may I help you?

620
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,992
Things were chaotic last night,
so I didn't say anything.

621
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,286
But I feel bad for you.

622
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,205
You had to witness
such a sad sight so late at night.

623
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,125
I couldn't sleep, so I was taking a walk.

624
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,335
I see. A walk?

625
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,964
Ms. Oh told me
I could go wherever I wanted

626
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,009
except for the chairman's territory.

627
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,973
I'll be more careful from now on.

628
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,391
(low grumbling)

629
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,019
By the way...

630
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,355
how's the maid?

631
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,066
-I heard she was taken to the hospital--
-(clacks)

632
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,361
I guess Ms. Oh left one thing out.

633
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,198
You should keep everything
you see or hear in this place a secret.

634
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,034
Shh.

635
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,791
Yes, ma'am.

636
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,876
HA WOOSIN

637
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,337
(imitates static)
Isn't it amazing?

638
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,255
Is this book really that good?

639
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,923
Yes, it's the best.

640
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,969
What does this title mean? Is it English?

641
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,221
What does it mean?

642
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,806
MR. CHOI: Let me see it.

643
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,853
It's Latin for "the unwelcome one."

644
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,313
BOTH: Ooh.

645
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,814
Mr. Choi.

646
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,109
Is it about a diplomat
or a police officer?

647
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,487
Yes, it's the latter. How did you know?

648
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,865
Originally, that's what they called
a deported diplomat.

649
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,744
But it's also a term
for a police whistleblower.

650
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,079
The title of that book.

651
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,999
You must know so well since you also--

652
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,167
(gun cocks)

653
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,877
What I mean is...

654
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,592
You know very well
since you were a former police officer.

655
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,053
MR. CHOI: What's it about?

656
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,765
Is the main character a corrupt cop
who tattled on his partner?

657
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,185
Well... Actually,

658
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,063
he's a hero of justice.

659
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,232
That's so cliché.

660
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,150
I could become a writer myself.

661
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,152
Anyway...

662
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,153
(cocks gun)

663
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,115
so that's that nerd's book?

664
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,242
(pensive music)

665
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,914
(birds chirping)

666
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,018
(pensive music continues)

667
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,671
Poppies.

668
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,423
WOMAN: Who are you?

669
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,845
I see. You're the chairman's guest.

670
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,392
Yes, I am. And you're Eun Hyesoo,
his daughter-in-law, right?

671
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,603
Don't I look better in person?

672
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,690
But what brings you to my garden?

673
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,403
The door was open, so I let myself in
and spotted these.

674
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,656
Judging by the lack of fine hairs
and the round seed pockets,

675
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,701
this is opium.

676
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,996
-Correct.
-Isn't it illegal to grow them?

677
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,291
Nothing is illegal in this household.
We can do whatever we want.

678
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,464
I heard we need to be interviewed
for that memoir.

679
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,759
Yes, but it can be a casual one.

680
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,428
It's up to me to determine
what to put in the memoir.

681
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,890
Let's have that interview right now.

682
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,601
-Right now?
-Is that a no?

683
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,354
We can.

684
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,067
HYESOO: Ask away.

685
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,195
Rather, should I tell you
the type of person I deem him as?

686
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,741
He'll do anything for his company.

687
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,244
Anything?

688
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,705
Imagine all the heinous
and disgusting things you can imagine.

689
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,667
HYESOO: He's capable
of committing all of them.

690
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,294
His second son passed away
in a helicopter accident.

691
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,338
But was it really an accident?

692
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,513
This will be off the record.
That's a dangerous statement.

693
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,057
You're the one in danger, not me.

694
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,561
The more you know, the more dangerous
your situation here will be.

695
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,272
And you just exacerbated it.

696
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,942
I advise you to leave these premises
as soon as possible.

697
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,656
I beg to differ.

698
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,950
I'll take care of myself.

699
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,452
(helicopter whirring)

700
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,621
Do you hear that?

701
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,457
(whirring continues)

702
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,710
The chairman is here.

703
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,170
(water bottle hisses)

704
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,138
Leave as soon as possible?

705
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,390
That was a warning.

706
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,767
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

707
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,019
Where have you been? I've been looking--

708
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,979
Jeez, he's getting worse by the day.

709
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,191
WOOSIN: You did that on purpose,
didn't you?

710
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,734
You've become worse this year.

711
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,694
That doubles the pain.

712
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,446
It hurts.

713
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,699
Isn't she the daughter-in-law?

714
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,410
DONGRIM: The only daughter of Eunkook
Medical Center who married the eldest son.

715
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,412
Rumor has it that she's a psycho.

716
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,914
She can't hold a candle to you.

717
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,708
Isn't she bored here?

718
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,585
Her husband was nowhere in Seoul.

719
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,129
Mr. Ha. He wants to see you.

720
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,800
Chairman Kwon.

721
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,222
(tense music)

722
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,701
I heard you skipped
the medication I gave you twice.

723
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,619
Why are you being so stubborn?

724
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,789
Did Ms. Yoon tell you that?
I told her not to tell you.

725
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,000
I should fire her.

726
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,504
Oh, please. Do you think
the new girl wouldn't report to me?

727
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,006
(Kwon chuckles)

728
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,050
KWON: You'll torment them all.
No one can disobey you.

729
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,392
By the way, Chairman Kwon.

730
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,604
Why are you calling me so softly?
You're scaring me.

731
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,191
About that writer. I just can't read him.

732
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,527
He's the biggest headache ever.

733
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,739
He doesn't give in when I intimidate him.
He actually fights back.

734
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,282
It'll be fun for you then.

735
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,703
Tame him if you can.
I know you're good at doing that.

736
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,455
Are you not going to take this seriously?

737
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,416
It's only been a day since he came.
Let's watch him for now.

738
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,835
-(Kwon sighs)
-(chair clatters)

739
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,218
(eerie music)

740
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,380
KWON: Come in.

741
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,987
Hello, sir. I'm Ha Woosin.

742
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,699
It's nice to meet you.

743
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,120
He looks like a decent guy.

744
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,541
Is that so?

745
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,417
He looks like him.

746
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,512
It's strange.

747
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,723
His smile reminds me of that man.

748
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,434
How distasteful.

749
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,190
It's an honor to meet you.

750
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,776
(chuckles)
I'm flattered.

751
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,112
Cognac for me.

752
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,785
-Did you take a tour around the house?
-(door opens, closes)

753
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,745
-Yes, sir.
-What do you think?

754
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,457
It's an excellent environment.
I won't have any problems writing here.

755
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,084
That's good to hear.

756
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,797
Anyway, what did you think about Hyesoo?

757
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,676
-Sorry?
-I heard you met her in the garden.

758
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,388
KWON: Don't be surprised.
Everyone here is watching.

759
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,890
You'll have to get used to it.

760
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,976
I interviewed her about you.

761
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,021
And what did she say?

762
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,941
He'll do anything for his company.

763
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,987
She said your company
was your top priority.

764
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,572
What else?

765
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,075
Imagine all the heinous
and disgusting things you can imagine.

766
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,620
He's capable of committing all of them.

767
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,456
She also said you made
the most unimaginable things come true.

768
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,082
And?

769
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,168
His second son passed away
in a helicopter accident.

770
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,170
But was it really an accident?

771
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,798
Sadly, we couldn't talk for long.

772
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,093
Once you get to have a long chat,

773
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,095
do let me know.

774
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,099
Tell me as it is.
I want to know everything.

775
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,355
(tray clatters)

776
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,025
You can talk freely. She's deaf.

777
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,194
She can only read lips.

778
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,820
(liquid sloshing)

779
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,573
(bottle thuds)

780
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,784
(in English) Thank you.

781
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,413
(slurps)

782
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,834
WOOSIN: Excuse me for saying this, sir.

783
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,755
But what you just asked me to do
regarding your daughter-in-law

784
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,218
seems like you want me
to become your mole.

785
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,471
Not at all.

786
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,389
(inhales deeply)

787
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,558
I just don't know
what's going through her mind.

788
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,394
I only want to understand her.

789
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,105
I'm not so sure, sir.
I'd feel uncomfortable doing that.

790
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,900
Only those...

791
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,737
who are capable
of making refusals can do so.

792
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,699
I believe you have no right to do that.

793
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,411
(tense music)

794
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,830
Is this how you run your business?

795
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,667
You offer a cheap price from the get-go
and try to intimidate others.

796
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,128
You're trying to scare me.

797
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,130
(scoffs)

798
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,924
Then what's your counterstrategy?

799
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,222
I advise you to find another ghostwriter.

800
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,557
You don't like the conditions?

801
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,309
I'm demanding the conditions
that I deserve.

802
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,730
I understand.

803
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,110
KWON: I do.

804
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,535
Since I run a business,

805
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,580
I'm often in a situation
when I need to negotiate.

806
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,707
Do you know who the fussiest people are?

807
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,460
The one who has the upper hand? No.

808
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,172
Those who negotiate empty-handedly.

809
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,798
And that's you.

810
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,844
Thank you for understanding.

811
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,513
When should we have the interview?

812
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,147
(door closes)

813
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,576
KWON: <i>Everyone here is watching.
You'll have to get used to it.</i>

814
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,621
(sly music)

815
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,182
(car beeps)

816
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,403
(whirs)

817
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,075
(beeps)

818
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:10,051
(whistling)

819
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,472
(elevator chimes)

820
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,146
(beeping)

821
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,984
IM DUKSOO PROSECUTED FOR MURDER

822
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,485
IM DUKSOO STANDS TRIAL

823
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,831
-MAN 1: Hello, sir.
-MAN 2: Hello, sir.

824
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,086
Let's have our meeting.

825
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,133
MANAGER LEE: Over nine million petitions
have been submitted to the Blue House,

826
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,468
asking to reinstate the death penalty.

827
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,636
We'll be submitting more once we get
more resident registration numbers

828
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,888
from China this weekend.

829
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,806
We're doing our best
to win over the media as well.

830
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,850
I see. It's panning out well.

831
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,144
How's it going online?
Are people being swayed?

832
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,645
Yes, it's going well. The Internet--

833
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,939
We've split the comment team
into three shifts.

834
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,984
Four additional groups have been made
to create new online communities.

835
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,445
TEAM LEADER LEE:
Good. Make sure you keep this up.

836
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,281
The Internet is
the catalyst of all events.

837
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,741
Yes, sir.

838
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,409
TEAM LEADER LEE: Okay.

839
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,954
I believe we've set the basics.

840
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,415
Let's win this upcoming election.

841
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,708
MEN: Yes, sir.

842
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,921
Sir, Candidate Hwang seems
to be acting out a bit.

843
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,673
Is he? What is he saying?

844
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,717
He wants to spend more of our money

845
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,469
since he made the pledge
like we had asked.

846
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,388
If not, he thinks he'll be reminded of it
once he's in the Blue House.

847
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,976
(scoffs)
That bastard. He knows how to play.

848
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,895
He knows how to demand more money.

849
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,272
What do you say? Should I meet with him?

850
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,983
That's okay.
Let me try to reason with him.

851
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,443
Yes, sir.

852
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,696
Did you process the expenses for 2006?

853
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,199
Yes, the accounting team took care of it
with the cost you mentioned.

854
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,117
I'll submit the report soon.

855
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,453
That was cheap.

856
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,913
There won't be any trouble.

857
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,165
We picked someone
who had great love for his children.

858
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,709
Okay. This is great.

859
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,421
(grunts)
DUKSOO: I won't be executed anyway.

860
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,966
Killing a few more won't change anything.

861
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:17,011
I hadn't killed anyone in a while.

862
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,641
I'll have my cake and eat it too.

863
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:26,104
(laughs maniacally)

864
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,607
GONG: Prosecutor Song.

865
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,442
SUHYEON:
Is Chief Yang throwing a fit again?

866
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,069
Tell him I'm dead.

867
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:36,322
It's not about him.
Some woman is here for you.

868
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,615
Hello.

869
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,076
(approaching footsteps)

870
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,538
And you are?

871
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,083
Hello, I'm Kim Seohee,
a local news reporter from TNC.

872
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,752
SEOHEE:
You were ignoring my calls and texts.

873
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,338
So I put my business card
on your gate yesterday.

874
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,756
I'm sure you saw it.

875
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,259
Mr. Gong.

876
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,388
Yes, I did see it.

877
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,725
But what's the occasion?
Why would you want to see me?

878
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,394
I want some legal consultation.

879
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,604
I'm afraid I can't help you.

880
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,815
If it's for writing up an article,
ask our PR team.

881
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:12,900
No.

882
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,445
It has to be you.

883
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,996
-(paper rustles)
-(scoffs)

884
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,456
(inhales deeply)

885
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,584
I'll give you five minutes
since I'm curious.

886
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,882
I'm sure you're aware that the public
is supporting the death penalty.

887
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,218
It's all over the media, TV,
and both offline and online.

888
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,846
This widespread effect
is typical of media manipulation.

889
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,264
Everything's planned out.

890
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,350
Candidate Hwang from New Future Party

891
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,102
pledged to reinstate
the death penalty if he gets elected.

892
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,772
Do you think
this is all just a coincidence?

893
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,109
Look, Ms. Kim.
Can't you just cut to the chase?

894
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,239
He's using the death penalty
to his advantage so he can be elected.

895
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,911
Do you know how ridiculous you are?

896
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,996
Why would you tell me this?

897
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,083
If Candidate Hwang gets elected,
the death penalty will be reinstated.

898
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,960
And among the first to get executed...

899
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,254
is Lee Changwoo.

900
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,924
Your late father's murderer.

901
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,471
What are you getting at?

902
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,598
I believe he was framed.

903
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,641
(scoffs)

904
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,185
-Framed?
-Yes.

905
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,149
You're being quite rude
during our first encounter.

906
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,194
They say reporters are all novelists.
Are you writing fiction?

907
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,279
If this is a novel, then it's a tragic one

908
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,407
because Lee Changwoo
will meet a wrongful death.

909
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,033
Listen.

910
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,577
That bastard is the culprit.

911
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,329
I'm a prosecutor, you know?

912
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,915
The murder weapon was never found.

913
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,750
That means someone took it.

914
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,505
Think about that. Who could it have been?

915
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,218
That's enough. You may leave.

916
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,513
If he gets executed,

917
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,974
you'll never find the one
who really murdered your father.

918
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,392
Get out!

919
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,393
(clicks tongue)

920
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,273
(tense music)

921
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,157
I put this case file together.
Take a look.

922
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,491
As a prosecutor,

923
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,994
I'm sure you're more familiar
with reasonable doubt than I am.

924
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,582
(door opens)

925
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,292
What a lunatic.

926
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,376
(door closes)

927
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,504
(sighs)

928
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,100
I know. I probably looked crazy.

929
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,227
But you were my last hope.

930
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,899
PROTESTERS:
Hwang Byungchul! Hwang Byungchul!

931
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,735
(chanting)
Hwang Byungchul! Hwang Byungchul!

932
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,905
-Hwang Byungchul!
-Hwang Byungchul!

933
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:07,325
-Hwang Byungchul!
-Hwang Byungchul!

934
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,411
-Hwang Byungchul!
-Get lost.

935
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,038
-(car honks)
-SEOHEE: Get lost!

936
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,457
MAN: What was that?

937
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,502
PROTESTERS:
Hwang Byungchul! Hwang Byungchul!

938
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,463
-Hwang Byungchul!
-Hwang Byungchul!

939
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,215
BYUNGCHUL: <i>What has our country come to?</i>

940
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,884
There's been a five-percent increase
in the number of heinous crimes

941
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,677
compared to last year's.

942
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,431
The law should protect the civilians

943
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,060
and condemn the sinners.

944
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,313
A lawful country!

945
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:43,236
I, Hwang Byungchul, promise
to make that come true!

946
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,782
PROTESTERS:
Hwang Byungchul! Hwang Byungchul!

947
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:51,869
(tires screeching)

948
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,252
AGENT KIM: What are they doing here?

949
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,340
Why are they here
when it's not even their payday?

950
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,011
They must want to celebrate something.

951
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,931
Give them some allowance
and tell them to leave.

952
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,140
(sighs)

953
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,600
We don't owe them any money.

954
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,687
They ask us for money
every chance they get.

955
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,608
MR. CHOI: Don't.

956
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,196
They'll think we're doormats
if we always comply.

957
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:28,906
(grunts)

958
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,743
I should mortify them.

959
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,745
Good luck, Mr. Choi.

960
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,628
(Mr. Choi clears throat)

961
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,384
MR. CHOI: Jeez, those obnoxious pigs.

962
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,137
Those disgusting money-grubbers.

963
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,097
Hello, sir.

964
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,267
Jeez.

965
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,604
SERGEANT: Look at you. You look good.

966
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,235
-(grunts)
-Sir.

967
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,738
Are you insane?
Why do you keep coming here?

968
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,448
Your superiors will get wind of this.

969
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,201
Chew this. They can read your lips.

970
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,412
-What's this about?
-(paper rustles)

971
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,789
Headquarters reported something urgent.

972
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,958
It better be urgent.

973
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,004
They received
an anonymous e-mail regarding you.

974
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,715
-Me?
-Yes.

975
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,884
The content was simple.

976
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,094
Your name...

977
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,013
(fingers snap)
...and this address.

978
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,685
MR. CHOI: The sender must know who I am
if they sent it to headquarters.

979
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:43,064
-Someone from Chairman Kwon's side?
-No, I doubt it.

980
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,025
Had he learned about my past,
I would be long gone.

981
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,652
You would never even find my body.

982
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,780
-You're right.
-It could've been worse.

983
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,199
Seeing how they sent it there instead,

984
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,159
they want to strike a deal with us.

985
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,495
Then they'll reveal themselves soon.

986
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,914
-The sender?
-We're looking into it.

987
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:05,294
SERGEANT:
The e-mail address is <i>"persona non grata."</i>

988
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:09,006
They used an overseas IP address.

989
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,927
So I doubt we'll be able to catch them.

990
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,639
This little scumbag.

991
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,477
Stop cussing at me.
I'm in my forties now, okay?

992
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,146
What?

993
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,149
(tense music)

994
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:41,831
(mouthing)
What's up with him?

995
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,165
(mouthing)
Beats me.

996
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,464
PERSONA NON GRATA
BY HA WOOSIN

997
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,061
Persona non grata.
(scoffs)

998
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,565
That's exactly what you are.
The unwelcome one.

999
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,861
Why did you come here?

1000
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,869
WOOSIN'S MOM: <i>Woosin.</i>

1001
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,830
Yes, Mom?

1002
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,374
Your father...

1003
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,918
My father?

1004
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,381
He's innocent.

1005
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,217
What do you mean?

1006
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,386
He's...

1007
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,057
(short breaths)

1008
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,518
(mutters)

1009
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,230
(grunts)

1010
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:50,858
(monitor beeping)

1011
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,776
(gasps)

1012
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,279
(somber music)

1013
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,119
Mother.

1014
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,998
Jeez, how terrifying.
What is this world coming to?

1015
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,416
WOOSIN: What is it?

1016
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,044
It's about Candidate Hwang Byungchul.

1017
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:13,005
He was stabbed in the thigh
in front of his house.

1018
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,674
I just spoke with my mom,
and it has caused a commotion.

1019
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,385
WOOSIN:
I guess they weren't going to kill him.

1020
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:20,971
What?

1021
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,224
He was stabbed in the thigh
in front of his house.

1022
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,268
He must've let his guard down
since it was his own home.

1023
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,523
They could've stabbed him
in a critical area if they wanted to.

1024
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,110
ABOLISH THE DEATH PENALTY
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

1025
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,196
HANEUL: The police are using
the flyers at the crime scene

1026
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,989
to go after the culprit.

1027
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,408
Candidate Hwang Byungchul
who has been taken to the hospital

1028
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,536
stated that he was not intimidated.

1029
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,621
This was Jung Haneul from GBS News.

1030
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:51,210
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER

1031
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,711
-(snoring)
-(approaching footsteps)

1032
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,925
(snoring continues)

1033
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,180
What? What was that?

1034
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,142
I heard you were hurt, so I came to visit.

1035
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,311
At this hour? Are you kidding me?

1036
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,981
Do you think I am?

1037
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,484
All right. Good news.

1038
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,070
You'll be on the front page
of all the newspapers.

1039
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,490
"A candidate who pledged
to reinstate the death penalty

1040
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,160
was attacked by someone
who was against it."

1041
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:27,663
That's a head-turner.
You'll benefit from it.

1042
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,583
Did you like it? It was my idea.

1043
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:34,003
You were behind this?

1044
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,504
Do you not like it?

1045
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,465
Uh...

1046
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,467
Then maybe...

1047
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,763
I should've sliced your neck instead.
Am I right?

1048
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,058
(grunts)
Why are you doing this?

1049
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,852
Why?

1050
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,689
Let me tell you why.

1051
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,150
A servant

1052
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,862
who tries to control his master

1053
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,573
should be punished.

1054
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,283
Look.

1055
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,244
I'm sorry.

1056
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,998
I must've been exhausted
from all the campaigning

1057
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,459
that I lost my mind.

1058
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,753
-Sir.
-Yes?

1059
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,923
All right. Remember this.

1060
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,300
Haesong is the one in control.

1061
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,428
(Byungchul groans)

1062
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,972
You're just a pawn on a chessboard.

1063
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:30,100
The game will still resume
even if a pawn is gone.

1064
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,812
Of course. I know that.

1065
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,780
POWER VITAMINS

1066
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,949
This is gas money
for your trip to the Blue House.

1067
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,077
The chairman gave you a handsome sum.

1068
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,871
Goodbye then.

1069
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:56,752

HWANG BYUNGCHUL REFUSES
TO BE INTIMIDATED DESPITE THE ATTACK

1073
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,904
SEOHEE: <i>This widespread effect
is typical of media manipulation.</i>

1074
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,698
Everything's planned out.

1075
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,576
He's using the death penalty
to his advantage so he can be elected.

1076
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,752
<i>If Candidate Hwang gets elected,
the death penalty will be reinstated.</i>

1077
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,629
<i>And among the first to get executed</i>

1078
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,589
is Lee Changwoo.

1079
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,384
Your late father's murderer.

1080
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,388
SEOHEE: <i>I believe he was framed.</i>

1081
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,807
<i>If this is a novel, then it's a tragic one</i>

1082
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,268
because Lee Changwoo
will meet a wrongful death.

1083
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,437
<i>If he gets executed,</i>

1084
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,148
you'll never find the one
who really murdered your father.

1085
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,574

1086
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,617

PERSONA NON GRATA
BY HA WOOSIN

1091
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,308
THEIR PLACE OF REFUGE
WAS INSIDE THE FOREST

1092
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,561
THEY JUST HAD TO SAY, "I'LL SEE YOU THERE"

1093
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,230
(book clanks)

1094
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:33,784
(Woosin whistling)

1095
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,333
MR. CHOI: Look who it is.
Our famous writer.

1096
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:45,838
(whistling)

1097
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,050
You placed my book there on purpose.

1098
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,927
Page 217.

1099
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:55,472
The main character and his partner
meet up in the forest.

1100
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,683
You understood it right away.

1101
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,144
Mr. Writer.

1102
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:04,148
I'm going to ask you a question.

1103
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,276
And I better like your answer.

1104
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,906
It was you
who sent that e-mail, wasn't it?

1105
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,491
Correct.

1106
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:16,535
You knew about me?

1107
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,830
You were bribed by Haesong Group
and exposed your partner.

1108
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:22,583
In return, you became
the chief of security of Haesong

1109
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,710
and got a hefty sum for a paycheck.

1110
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,546
That's your cover.

1111
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:34,344
You're actually an undercover cop
who's watching Chairman Kwon, right?

1112
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,014
(tense music)

1113
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,265
Who are you?

1114
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,434
How much do you know?

1115
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:42,019
That's the wrong question.

1116
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,897
You should ask me what I want.

1117
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,940
Stop being cheeky and answer me properly

1118
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,567
if you want to live.

1119
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,694
How much do I know?

1120
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:52,779
The Central Investigation Division.

1121
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,074
The special investigation headquarters
that is similar to the FBI.

1122
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,869
Class one criminal investigation bureau.

1123
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:00,579
You're Lieutenant Choi Taesung.

1124
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,582
You don't exist on paper.

1125
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:09,588
What do you want?

1126
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,716
I know you're watching everyone
in that mansion.

1127
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,551
Let me be an exception.

1128
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,761
Look at that.

1129
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,931
It seems like you came here
with an ulterior motive.

1132
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,149
That means someone took it.

1133
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:31,026

1134
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,237
MURDER CASE WITH NO EVIDENCE

1135
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:37,491
Mr. Writer, let's put an end to this
if you're not going to tell me the truth.

1136
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,790
That arrowhead logo.

1137
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,000
WOOSIN: That's it.

1138
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,919
That's why I'm here.

1139
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,923
Don't be vague and explain in detail.

1140
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,177
Adamas.

1141
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,556
SUHYEON: The murder weapon disappeared.

1142
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:03,267
Where could it be?

1143
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:08,063
WOOSIN: <i>The symbol of Haesong Group.</i>

1144
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,441
<i>The arrow with a diamond tip.</i>

1145
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,904
I'm going to steal the Adamas.

1146
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,533

1147
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,587

WOOSIN: <i>Somebody...</i>

1149
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,180

01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,227
SUHYEON: <i>Who are you?</i>

1153
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:50,105
Sir, may I speak with you
in private first?

1154
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,274
SUHYEON:
<i>Is it your passionate sense of justice</i>

1155
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,651
<i>that's making you cover my father's case?</i>

1156
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,321
I know that he's innocent.

1157
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,865
DONGRIM:
<i>There's a treasure in this mansion.</i>

1158
