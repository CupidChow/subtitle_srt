ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,996
NEW BEGINNING OF LIFE!
IT IS UP TO YOUR MINDSET

3
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,546
Sir.

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,970
To a patient, an illness is despair,
and a doctor is hope.

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,182
That hope. Will you let him down?

6
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,312
What must I do…

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,690
-to save him?
-First of all,

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,568
tie your shoes.

9
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,697
And then…

10
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,366
follow the patient to the hospital.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,785
That's the first step.

12
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,205
AMBULANCE

13
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,375
EMERGENCY ROOM

14
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,514
Blood pressure, 130 over 90,
heart rate, 50.

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,558
In a mental stupor.
Spontaneous but irregular breathing.

16
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,478
I guess we're in the same boat.

17
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,523
Check his vitals. Hook him up to an IV
and give him normal saline.

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,482
-Yes.
-Come here.

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,359
Doctor.

20
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,486
His kidneys.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,448
Check his kidneys first.

22
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,004
Here is your coffee, sir.

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,011
What happened?
What is wrong with Inmate 5353?

24
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,555
Will he live?

25
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,307
-I don't know.
-What?

26
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,354
Whether he lives or dies
isn't up to me now.

27
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,858
It's up to Dr. Kang.

28
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,443
Si-young?

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,406
You don't know?

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,869
If you don't know what the problem is,
why did you tell me to check his kidneys?

31
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
-Well…
-Hold on.

32
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,665
No way.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,835
-Don't tell me it's him.
-Pardon?

34
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,087
He didn't tell you to do this, did he?

35
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,006
Inmate 6238 at Chungil Penitentiary.

36
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,465
Do you know him?

37
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,929
-Are you crazy?
-What?

38
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,097
Did you give me an order

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,474
based on the opinion
of a disqualified doctor in prison?

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
-Well, the thing is--
-Did he say the patient was going to die?

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,189
Every single time.

42
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,152
I don't know what he told you,
but you shouldn't trust him.

43
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,114
-What is this all about?
-Doctor, the result is out.

44
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,581
RENAL FUNCTION TEST

45
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,558
Did he name a disease too?

46
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,061
What was he suspecting?

47
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,062
What's going on?

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,607
His BUN and creatinine levels
are elevated.

49
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,026
The urinalysis for protein
turned out positive.

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,488
In any case, it was a good call
to check his kidneys.

51
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,032
So, what's his diagnosis?

52
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,913
UNCLE JEONG-NAM

53
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,165
Excuse me for a second.

54
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,878
Uncle.

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,380
Did they check his kidneys?

56
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,340
Yes, they did.

57
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,468
-What's the result?
-Positive for protein in the urine.

58
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,345
All right. Start a kidney biopsy.

59
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,222
A kidney biopsy?

60
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,558
Start right away. There's no time to lose.

61
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,935
Hold on.

62
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,812
Yes?

63
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,605
What's the disease you have in mind?

64
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,233
I don't think you'll believe me.

65
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,902
One out of 117,000.

66
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,405
There's only
a 0.00001 percent probability.

67
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,449
-What?
-In other words,

68
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,911
because of
that 0.00001 percent probability,

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,538
the patient might die.

70
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,622
So?

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,958
What's the name of the disease?

72
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,712
Angiokeratoma gives him
burning pains in his limbs.

73
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,758
Corneal clouding
irrespective of his sight.

74
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,927
He's not sweating at all.

75
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,179
Anhidrosis stops his sweating completely.

76
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,976
TIAs, which mean
transient ischemic attacks.

77
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,981
In addition, he's been experiencing
diarrhea, vomiting, and stomachache.

78
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,108
Therefore, the diagnosis is…

79
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,110
-Fabry disease.
-Fabry disease.

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,539
EMERGENCY ROOM

81
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:32,915
Fabry disease?

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,752
Which affects only 100 people
in the whole country?

83
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,671
Do you want to do a kidney biopsy
relying on that slim chance?

84
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,757
Still, all the symptoms are right.

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,135
Also, even though the chance is slim,
it also means

86
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:48,264
that the patient might die because
of that 0.00001 percent probability.

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,308
Fabry disease is hard to diagnose.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,978
Also, that disease requires
enzymatic therapy.

89
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,314
-The medication is hard to come by.
-So?

90
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,024
Are you not even going to check for it?

91
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,360
What if it really is Fabry disease?

92
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,365
Then check his family history first.

93
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,661
Someone else might have it
as it's a genetic disorder?

94
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,788
What's your department?

95
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,082
Anesthesiology.

96
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,583
Same here. Which year?

97
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,043
Second…

98
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,463
year.

99
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,964
You can relax.

100
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,675
I'm just a fellow
who is on duty all the time.

101
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,928
What's wrong with being a fellow?

102
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,306
Si-young.

103
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,766
Just a second.

104
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,935
-Find out his family history.
-Yes.

105
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,478
One more thing.

106
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,525
You don't have to tell me what Inmate 6238
thinks from now on. I don't trust him.

107
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,865
Si-young, how did it go?

108
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,367
He's still being tested.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,662
My goodness. Why did this happen
right before his release?

110
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,455
Will he recover?

111
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,207
We're suspecting a genetic disorder.

112
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,336
We need his family history to see
if anyone else has had the same symptoms.

113
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,630
Did you hear that? Find that out.

114
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,674
Tell his family to come
as soon as they can.

115
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,591
-Yes.
-Yes.

116
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:13,141
By the way, are you okay
with missing your flight?

117
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,018
You're staying, right?

118
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,937
I didn't say I'd stay.

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,981
What? No?

120
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,608
I'll leave as soon
as he's diagnosed and stable again.

121
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,569
I can always find another flight.

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,614
Inmate 6238 made a good call.

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,324
What's with him?

124
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,369
He also said Si-young
was the one who will save the patient.

125
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,874
I'll be released next week.

126
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,793
I'll go to a big hospital then
like you told me to.

127
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,753
What if you die before your release?

128
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,810
Yo-han, it's today.

129
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,437
D-day.

130
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,404
Are you not done yet? Hurry up.

131
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,357
-Did you get your certificate?
-Of course.

132
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,901
Here it is.

133
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,196
1ST CLASS BARISTA CERTIFICATE

134
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,907
Your vocational training here paid off.

135
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
You could start working
as a barista as soon as you're out.

136
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,164
Yo-han, when I get a job,
come taste my coffee.

137
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,959
I'll brew a really good cup
of coffee for you.

138
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,758
All right.

139
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:12,927
Here you go.

140
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,607
Coffee tastes best when it's piping hot.

141
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,026
I can't drink something too hot.

142
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,361
My goodness.

143
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,905
Sometimes, you're just like a little kid.

144
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,116
You can't eat hot and spicy foods.

145
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,418
-It's perfect.
-I'm so relieved.

146
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,755
By the way, why are you so nice to me?

147
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,386
You were the first person.

148
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,139
"First"? What do you mean?

149
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,308
You were the first person

150
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,478
who didn't think
I was only pretending to be sick.

151
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,481
My mom was sick all the time too.

152
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,361
She was always laughed at by my dad
for pretending to be sick

153
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,822
until she passed away.

154
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,120
No refills. Please leave now, sir.

155
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,332
Can I make another phone call?

156
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,420
By the way, the doctor earlier
seemed to know Inmate 6238.

157
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,839
Do you mean Dr. Lee Yoo-joon?

158
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,509
He's the one who usually treats
our patients.

159
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,513
He made a couple of misdiagnoses,

160
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,641
and Inmate 6238 corrected them.

161
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,476
It totally hurt his pride.

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,854
I knew it. He seemed to despise him.

163
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,316
Inmate 6238 is his biggest enemy
even though they haven't even met.

164
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,407
Yes?

165
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
Inmate 6238?

166
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,579
Let me talk to him.

167
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,543
Yes. They're doing a kidney biopsy.

168
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,588
They're still finding out
about his family history.

169
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,507
All right.

170
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,220
What? Did he just hang up?

171
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,472
Why? Do you have something to tell him?

172
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,641
Didn't he ask for me?

173
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,558
No.

174
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,604
Uncle, can you call him back?

175
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,523
Inmate 6238.

176
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,733
There's a call for you.

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,409
-Hello?
-They're doing a kidney biopsy.

178
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,369
-I heard.
-Exactly.

179
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,871
-What?
-You asked me in the first place.

180
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,290
Why did you only talk to my uncle?

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,376
Are the results out yet?

182
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,003
-Of course not.
-Let's talk when they're out.

183
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,130
Hang on.

184
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,468
What am I supposed to do?

185
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,262
-What do you mean?
-You said

186
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,350
if I followed the patient to the hospital,
you'd tell me how to save him.

187
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,438
Did you tell the doctor on duty
to test him for Fabry disease?

188
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,439
You told me to.

189
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,023
That's how you save the patient.

190
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,859
Can you talk so that I can understand?

191
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,861
If prison officers told the doctor

192
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,072
the patient might have Fabry disease,
would he have believed them?

193
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,658
They would have wasted time

194
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,369
doing all kinds of tests on him
while the patient became worse.

195
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,370
Are you saying…

196
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,790
you just borrowed my mouth?

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,750
This time,

198
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,919
can I borrow your hands?

199
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,839
My hands?

200
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,926
Now, you need to find ERT,
which is the treatment for Fabry disease.

201
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,304
If you try to receive it
through a pharmaceutical company,

202
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,555
it'll take over a week.

203
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,183
The fastest way to get it
is to look for a hospital

204
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,934
that has a Nephrology Department.

205
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,145
And if they have any patients
with Fabry disease,

206
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,980
you can borrow the ERT from them.

207
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,399
You don't have any?

208
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,610
Hello, I'd like to talk
to the Nephrology Department.

209
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,445
I'm looking for ERT.

210
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,420
Can I talk to the Nephrology Department?

211
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,674
Dr. Lee!

212
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,720
-I found ERT.
-Where?

213
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,764
A university hospital
40 minutes away from here.

214
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,766
-We can borrow it if we go now.
-Did they agree?

215
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,936
I promised to return it
if it isn't Fabry disease

216
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,437
because I know it's very expensive.

217
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,981
But we don't even have
a definite diagnosis yet.

218
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,650
So I mentioned your name.

219
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,903
-What?
-You have a great reputation.

220
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,781
I heard you are
the most competent fellow here.

221
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,327
Well, I'm not exactly that competent.

222
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,038
This is a small neighborhood,
so word spreads fast.

223
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,833
And the elders tend to always ask for me.

224
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,006
Can you chart it and send it here?

225
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,512
Do you really think it's Fabry disease?

226
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,099
You told me earlier
that it's a 0.00001 percent probability.

227
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,811
I like that possibility.

228
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,147
I'll be back.

229
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,987
THANK YOU, DR. LEE!

230
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,073
My gosh.

231
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,918
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

232
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,469
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

233
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,015
Tae-kyung, what did I tell you? I told you
I had a good feeling about this.

234
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,268
That patient that got taken
to the hospital earlier,

235
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,937
-do they know what his illness is?
-No, not yet.

236
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,148
But they already have a guess
as to what it could be,

237
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,567
and Si-young's trying her best
to find the cure.

238
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,820
That means he didn't even get diagnosed
yet, and he's in a bad condition.

239
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,489
Well, yes.

240
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,619
Let Si-young go.

241
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,536
What?

242
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,289
Why?

243
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,999
It's her first patient after the accident.

244
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,042
If something goes wrong,

245
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,379
she won't be able to handle it.

246
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,105
Where can you buy those things?

247
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,274
I'll be released next week.

248
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,153
I'm meeting my sister after years.
I'd love to get a bracelet for her.

249
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,413
-Uncle.
-Hey.

250
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
What's wrong?

251
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,546
Nothing.

252
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,883
It's been a while
since I've seen you so excited.

253
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,551
Let's go.

254
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,099
Si-young.

255
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,644
How about you take your hands off this
after you give them that cure?

256
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,897
I'll… I'll take you home.

257
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,775
Why all of a sudden?

258
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,194
You wanted me to stay.

259
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm worried you might have a hard time.
And it's such a rare illness.

260
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,618
I heard there's like
a 0.00001 percent probability.

261
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,538
Yes.

262
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,208
There's only
a 0.00001 percent probability.

263
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,712
-It's one out of 117,000.
-Exactly.

264
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,673
But, you see,
that's exactly how it was with me.

265
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,428
When I left the hospital,
the probability of my returning

266
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,180
felt that low.

267
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:02,271
I thought 0.00001 percent
was practically impossible.

268
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,276
So I kind of feel like I might get better

269
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,612
if this patient gets better.

270
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,823
That's all.

271
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,993
I even got the cure.

272
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,663
The probability has now increased
to 0.0001 percent.

273
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,624
I guess you're right.

274
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,627
It doesn't matter
how low the probability is.

275
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,796
In the end, it's all just a 50-50 chance.

276
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,800
It either exists or it doesn't. You either
live or you die. It's one or the other.

277
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,053
Let's go.

278
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
First of all, tie your shoes.

279
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,436
There's always a time limit to a patient.

280
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,564
If they're not treated then,
it'll be too late.

281
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,443
So a doctor always needs
to be ready to run.

282
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,039
I'm all done.

283
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,832
Let's go, Uncle.

284
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,318
Did you look into the patient's family?

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,322
Yes, they found his sister's number
and called her.

286
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,282
But apparently, the number doesn't exist.

287
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,703
To be honest,
no one ever came to visit him.

288
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,623
His dad left when he was young
after his parents got divorced,

289
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,126
and he lived with his mom and sister.

290
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,629
It seemed like
he's really fond of his sister.

291
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,173
He got locked up in prison because of her.

292
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,218
Someone stole four months' worth
of salary from her.

293
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,846
So he went to get that money for her,
but ended up in a fight.

294
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,640
The other person got hurt
during the fight,

295
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,143
but he had no money
to pay for the settlement.

296
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,021
-Stop.
-Wait.

297
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,772
No, please don't do this.

298
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,566
Don't go inside.

299
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,222
Dad!

300
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,242
Good morning.

301
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,451
Good morning.

302
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,372
My gosh, you should start getting ready.

303
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,958
Is anyone coming today?

304
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,042
No.

305
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,171
No one's coming?
Not even your parents or your friends?

306
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,257
Or maybe a girlfriend?

307
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,843
Did the hospital call?

308
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,927
No, not yet.

309
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,724
Dr. Kang even gave up
her plane ticket for that patient,

310
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,517
so I'm sure we'll hear good news.

311
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,485
It's negative?

312
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,488
We couldn't find any signs
of zebra bodies.

313
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,906
That means it's not Fabry disease.

314
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,287
We're wasting time right now
because of Inmate 6238.

315
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,124
I told you not to trust him.
Do you even know why he got imprisoned?

316
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,917
No, but why--

317
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,713
Then don't trust him,
respect him, or be loyal to him.

318
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,049
I'm warning you
because I almost got fooled myself.

319
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,010
What do you mean?

320
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,138
Why did he get imprisoned?

335

It's not Fabry disease.

336
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,986
-It's not?
-Not according to the biopsy.

337
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,490
-So?
-They suspect FSGS,

338
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,993
-and they will treat him for that.
-Treat how?

339
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,328
With steroids?

340
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,913
Yes.

341
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,291
The steroids will kill his kidneys.

342
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,629

351
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,401
Yoon Seong-kyu's guardian?

352
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,952
Okay.

353
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,037
I'll be ready.

354
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,339
The case that rocked the nation
three years ago.

355
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,969
The patient had terminal anal cancer,

356
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,888
and you administered
a lethal amount of painkillers.

357
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,641
For that, you were sentenced
to three years.

358
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,185
Was that you?

359
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,522
Yes.

360
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,277
What did you say?

361
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,237
I murdered my patient?

362
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,489
Why did you use that word?

363
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,660
People usually call it euthanasia
instead of murder.

364
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,828
There's no difference.

365
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,290
You gave up on your patient.
You abandoned him.

366
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,335
You made him breathe his last breath.
You stopped his heart.

367
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,919
What's the difference?

368
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,259
You're laughing?

369
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,844
I'm surprised.

370
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,930
Grab any doctor you see

371
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,017
and ask what they think of euthanasia.

372
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,021
Their answer will be one of two,
they're for or against it.

373
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,774
Most won't even want to discuss it. Why?

374
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,027
Because they think
it's the most pointless discussion.

375
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,821
So,

376
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,910
how come a second-year resident

377
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,539
has such a detailed opinion on the topic?

378
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,596
Was that…

379
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,808
something to rush here for?

380
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,854
Betrayal?

381
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,399
Fury?

382
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,905
It looks more like despair.

383
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,495
You thought I could give you hope,

384
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,789
but now, you think I can't
and you're in despair.

385
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,583
Aren't you?

386
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,963
Have you tried it?

387
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,137
Did you…

388
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,431
do it too?

389
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:49,978
Did you?

390
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,649
Did you give up on, abandon a patient,

391
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,486
make him breathe his last breath,
or stop his heart?

392
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,497
Could you have saved him?

393
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,962
Could he have been treated?

394
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,091
Could he have been revived and cured?

395
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,601
Answer me! Could you have saved him?

396
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,727
No!

397
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,438
I couldn't have!

398
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,482
I couldn't have.

399
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,694
I couldn't…

400
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,572
save him.

401
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,351
Was there nothing you could do?

402
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,981
Was there no way you could save him?

403
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,026
Except stopping his pain?

404
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,779
Is that why you did that?

405
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,782
Did you stop his pain?

406
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,455
If you can't cure pain,

407
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,458
you should stop it.

408
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,340
If the doctor does nothing,
the patient's torment doesn't stop.

409
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,803
Even at this moment,

410
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,057
the patient feels pain.

411
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,143
Park Jung-bo.

412
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,397
He feels pain even in this moment.

413
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,609
Go.

414
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:03,987
Go…

415
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,447
and make him better.

416
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,929
Open the gate.

417
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,641
Darn it.

418
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,145
Dr. Kang, I have bad news.

419
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,273
Inmate 5353 disappeared from his room.

420
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,692
-He disappeared?
-Hurry.

421
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,912
It has to be Fabry disease.

422
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,710
It's rare, but sometimes,
the biopsy doesn't show zebra bodies.

423
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,464
Run an enzyme test one last time.

424
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,012
KYUNGWON HOSPITAL

425
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,892
WARD 3

426
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,810
Find him, quick.

427
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,603
What happened?

428
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,605
They undid his handcuffs
when he had a seizure.

429
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,359
-He disappeared while the guard was gone.
-He's not in the toilets or other rooms.

430
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,528
Check the security cameras
and search outside.

431
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,154
He couldn't have gotten far. Hurry.

432
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,155
-Okay.
-Hurry.

433
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,158
Go.

434
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,120
You go that way.

435
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,038
Search that way.

436
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,460
Where did he go?

437
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,519
A COZY GENERAL HOSPITAL, KYUNGWON HOSPITAL

438
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,147
-He's not here?
-No.

439
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,922
KYUNGWON HOSPITAL

440
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,444
Over there.

441
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,361
Park Jung-bo.

442
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,743
What if he's passed out somewhere?

443
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,915
Dr. Lee.

444
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,068
He's over there.

445
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,323
-What?
-Move slowly and quietly.

446
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,193
No.

447
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
Dr. Lee.

448
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,660
-Calm down.
-Mr. Park Jung-bo.

449
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,662
I hear it.

450
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,207
I hear it. I hear her.

451
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,750
What do you hear?

452
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,960
My mom's voice.

453
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,254
I hear my mom's voice.

454
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,595
Mr. Park Jung-bo.

455
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,847
Mr. Park Jung-bo.

456
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,448
Were you told
if he has a history of mental illness?

457
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,867
No.

458
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,620
Then why was he on the roof?

459
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,206
Why did he suddenly want to kill himself?

460
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,001
What if it wasn't a suicide attempt?

461
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,796
He said he heard his mother's voice.

462
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,883
What if that was
an auditory hallucination?

463
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,551
An auditory hallucination?

464
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,764
It's not common, but some Fabry patients
suffer from psychoses like--

465
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,184
Have you forgotten?
It's not Fabry disease.

466
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,896
It has to be Fabry disease.

467
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,107
It's rare, but sometimes,
the biopsy doesn't show zebra bodies.

468
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,818
Run an enzyme test one last time.

469
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,573
Get out of here.
You're not needed anymore.

470
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,991
Please leave.

471
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,535
Stay out here.

472
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,336
I was sick of her saying she was sick.

473
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,505
I told her to stop pretending to be sick.

474
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,219
My wife ended up dying
before she turned 40.

475
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,973
I can't let him die like that.

476
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,308
I'll make him better.

477
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,899
Uncle, who was that?

478
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,236
That was Inmate 5353's father.

479
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,906
Did his wife die of the same symptoms?

480
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,783
I don't know,

481
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,369
but his daughter died not long ago.

482
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,289
His daughter? How?

483
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,582
Chronic renal failure?

484
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,671
Inmate 5353 has an older brother
who isn't well either.

485
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,929
His mother died in her 30's,

486
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,973
and his sister has a history of CKD.

487
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,225
Can there be a clearer family history?

488
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,311
If the mother has Fabry disease,

489
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,314
her offspring has
a 50 percent chance of inheriting it.

490
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,442
Isn't this why Fabry disease
should be diagnosed early?

491
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,569
It's totally treatable,

492
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,613
but many people miss out and die
because of a late diagnosis.

493
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,409
If only they'd known what they had,
his mother and sister

494
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,245
-wouldn't have died.
-Is it a definite diagnosis?

495
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,789
So, for one last time,

496
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,792
how about running an enzyme test?

497
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,254
What if he has another seizure while
we run a test and wait for the result?

498
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,672
What if it's still negative?

499
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,050
Who will be responsible, then?

500
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,011
There's nothing more to do here.

501
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,513
What do you mean?

502
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,141
He'll be transferred.

503
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,770
It's what his father wants
and I'll respect his wishes.

504
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,398
The best thing is to send him
to a bigger hospital.

505
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,865
What if he gets worse?

506
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,037
Because we ruled out Fabry disease,

507
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,165
once he's transferred,
they'll start testing from scratch.

508
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,503
What if he has acute renal failure
and has to be on dialysis forever?

509
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,380
Do you think you're making sense?

510
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,798
It's not entirely improbable.

511
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,384
We'll trust in the chances
within our time and resources

512
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,177
and start with the most probable.

513
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,097
You're just a part-timer.

514
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,140
You said it's a temporary gig.

515
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,975
Why are you so obsessed with him?

516
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,603
Do you know how different you are
from yesterday?

517
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,563
Stop it now.

518
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,357
You've done enough.

519
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,068
You did your best.

520
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,533
Si-young.

521
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,788
I reached his older brother.
He's on his way.

522
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,331
It's too late.

523
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,584
-What?
-He's being transferred.

524
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,754
Well, that was…

525
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,550
His father was so adamant.

526
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,220
There's nothing I can do now.

527
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,596
You tried hard.

528
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,057
Ever since last night.

529
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,600
No.

530
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,937
"Need to visit Nephrology
at a tertiary hospital. Urgent."

531
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,981
If only I'd listened.

532
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,358
If only I'd sent him to a hospital.

533
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:52,867
Hi.

534
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,623
-A transfer?
-Yes.

535
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,002
-He'll be transferred.
-It'll be a mess if he's transferred.

536
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,336
They'll have to start over.

537
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,172
There's nothing we can do.

538
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,382
They can't do anything here.

539
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,768
You have the cure.

540
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,103
The cure?

541
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,023
Si-young got some yesterday.

542
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,399
Put it in his room.

543
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,693
Put it next to the bed.

544
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,028
I'll come over.

545
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,363
What? Hello? Hello? Inmate 6238.

546
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:33,949
What was that about?

547
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,035
What did he say?

548
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,413
He wants you to put the cure by the bed.

549
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,040
The cure?

550
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,293
Yes, the cure.

551
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,587
Thanks, Uncle.

552
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,838
Thank you.

553
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,091
Si-young.

554
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,392
Dr. Lee.

555
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,231
Do you have more to say?

556
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,816
Just prepare the ERT medicine.

557
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,695
The hospital he'll be transferred to
could need it.

558
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,200
It takes a while to procure.

559
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,993
Just in case.

560
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,080
That's why we went
to such lengths to get it.

561
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,218
It's the ERT medicine.

562
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,053
Take it, just in case.

563
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,389
Pass it on to the hospital
he'll be transferred to.

564
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,349
-Okay. I'll do that.
-No.

565
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,645
He has to be injected right now.

566
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,981
The patient has Fabry disease.

567
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,941
How many times must I say
he had no zebra bodies?

568
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,360
It's rare, but depending
on where the tissue was from,

569
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,070
zebra bodies might be absent.

570
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,780
Said who? Inmate 6238?

571
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,324
Are you crazy?

572
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,370
You believe it's Fabry disease because
a doctor who lost his license said so?

573
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,496
Get out.

574
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,039
Get out right now.

575
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,259
Dr. Lee Yoo-joon
whom I've heard so much about?

576
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,760
Who are you?

577
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,012
Nice to meet you.

578
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,305
I'm Inmate 6238.

579
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,226
Excuse me.

580
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,982
Wait. How did you get here?

581
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,318
Inmate 6238.

582
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,530
As of noon today, he's a free man.

583
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,911
A few years ago, a patient came

584
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,290
to Myeongwon University Hospital's
Nephrology Department.

585
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,960
After suffering from albuminuria,
she deteriorated rapidly

586
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,379
and required dialysis.

587
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,548
Her kidney biopsy

588
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,176
showed she had FSGS.

589
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,765
That's exactly what
Dr. Lee diagnosed Jung-bo with.

590
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,604
The patient's sister
offered to give her a kidney,

591
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,898
but guess what her biopsy showed?

592
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,026
Thick and clear zebra bodies.

593
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,611
She had Fabry disease.

594
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,404
Did she?

595
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,491
-Then why did her sister--
-Not show the same?

596
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,618
It's not that she didn't.

597
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,746
They were obscured by the many dead cells.

598
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,997
Just like Jung-bo's case.

599
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,292
You can't transfer him now.

600
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,002
While they search for a diagnosis,

601
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,962
he could deteriorate beyond help.

602
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,255
He must be treated here.

603
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,508
Treatment comes
after a definite diagnosis.

604
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,510
A definite diagnosis?

605
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,930
What's the prevalence rate
of Fabry disease?

606
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:43,931
You know what it is.

607
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,475
One out of 117,000.

608
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,936
-It's very rare.
-Not at all.

609
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,605
If you include all the people
who couldn't get a diagnosis

610
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,650
despite visiting many hospitals,
resorted to alternative medicine,

611
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,902
lost their savings, and died,
Fabry patients…

612
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,322
are more numerous than you think.

613
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,869
They can live if they're just diagnosed,
but many people died because they weren't.

614
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,996
We don't have that diagnosis yet.

615
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,042
You want to inject an expensive cure
to an ambiguous case?

616
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,169
Why should I take such a risk?

617
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,046
It's the patient who's taking the risk.

618
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,424
You flooded him with steroids.

619
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,385
If his kidneys fail and
can't even withstand transplant surgery,

620
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,470
-who'll take the blame?
-How dare you threaten me?

621
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,849
This is a warning, not a threat.
From the patient's whole body.

622
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,225
He's my patient!

623
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,649
You might have been
a famous professor of medicine,

624
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,276
but he's my patient right now.

625
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,987
So stay out of it.

626
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,826
Are you really sure
it's not Fabry disease?

627
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,915
It's true that you're his doctor.

628
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,669
But I followed his condition for a year.

629
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,090
In prison.

630
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,260
I'm not like you.

631
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,138
I won't risk my license like that.

632
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,354
Have him transferred.

633
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,910
What are you doing?

634
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,584
You're not a doctor!

635
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,675
Don't you know it's illegal
to treat without a license?

636
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,941
Dr. Kang, are you a doctor?

637
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,623
Yes.

638
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,084
I'm a doctor.

639
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,030
What on earth…

640
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,827
-I'll take responsibility.
-Will you?

641
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,869
How?

642
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,582
-Treating when you aren't staff…
-I'll accept any punishment.

643
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,709
But if we don't do anything,

644
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,836
the patient continues to suffer.

645
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,921
Not because of the illness,

646
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,384
but because the doctor

647
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,886
did nothing.

648
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:17,936
Dr. Lee.

649
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,355
His brother's here.

650
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,649
-Jung-min.
-Father.

651
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,068
Jung-bo.

652
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,406
Why are you sick too?

653
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,827
I'm sorry, Father.

654
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,747
Why are you sorry?

655
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,249
It's all my fault.

656
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,293
He's on dialysis.

657
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,922
Doctor, please save my sons.

658
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,051
I'm not afraid of losing them.

659
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:53,221
I'm more afraid that they'll die,
like their mom and sister,

660
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,723
not knowing what they have.

661
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,936
What kind of illness is it
that's so cruel to us?

662
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,814
Please save my sons.

663
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,152
Do a kidney biopsy on the brother.

664
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,946
You'll see it right away.

665
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,366
I see it.

666
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,450
He'll live.

667
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,788
You saved him, Dr. Kang. And…

668
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,097
Dr. Lee.

669
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,224
What is it?

670
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,769
It's definitely Fabry disease.

671
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,646
Then, will he get better?

672
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,025
Yes. Both of your sons can be treated.

673
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,530
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

674
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,492
Dr. Lee, thank you.

675
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,577
Well…

676
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,248
Si-young, thank you. You did well.

677
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,422
Inmate 6238?

678
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,592
Oh, we shouldn't call him that anymore.
He's Cha Yo-han now.

679
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:55,844
He just left.

680
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,723
He left? Where did he go?

681
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,975
Anywhere, I guess. He's free now.

682
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,750
Welcome back, Professor Cha.

683
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,300
Wait!

684
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,761
Wait!

685
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,179
Dr. Cha!

686
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,139
Cha Yo-han!

687
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,225
Dr. Cha!

688
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,563
Dr. Cha!

689
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,815
Dr. Cha!

690
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,669
Can I…

691
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,338
go back?

692
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,842
Can I do well?

693
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,349
HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

694
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,102
I have an announcement to make.

695
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,439
It is about Kang Si-young,
a second-year resident

696
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,024
of the Anesthesiology Department.

697
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,195
I'm considering

698
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,032
accepting her back.

699
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,875
She's been undergoing psychotherapy.

700
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,711
Recently, it was diagnosed
that she doesn't have PTSD.

701
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,547
She completed
the training process successfully

702
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,301
and always received
excellent resident evaluations.

703
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,385
However,

704
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,680
we can't be sure
if she's ready to treat patients

705
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,099
without being affected by the incident.

706
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,144
It was just an accident.

707
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:54,147
I guess how long it takes
to recover from an accident

708
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,482
depends on the person.

709
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,359
Yes, it was an accident.

710
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:01,196
Still, there were other things
she needed to work on even before that.

711
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,615
Like what?

712
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:07,118
Excessive empathy
with her patients, of course.

713
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,831
Yes. From the first year,
her examinations took too long.

714
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,043
She was even ordered not to talk
to her patients for longer than a minute.

715
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,503
That could be

716
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,754
a strength too.

717
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,968
Residents often fail to understand
their patients well enough.

718
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,387
But her excessive empathy

719
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,264
often clouded her judgment as a doctor.

720
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,934
Who knows if the incident happened
because--

721
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,211
Aren't you sick of chicken breast yet?

722
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,755
Why does it have so much protein anyway?

723
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,976
I'm sorry.

724
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,438
I caused you all trouble
by quitting so suddenly.

725
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,025
And now, I shamelessly came back.
I'm really sorry.

726
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,534
Nice to see you again, Si-young.

727
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,621
Nice to see you too, Jun.

728
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,168
"Nice to see you again,

729
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,045
Dr. Heo."

730
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,466
You're only a second-year.
We're not in the same year anymore.

731
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,550
I'm a fourth-year.

732
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,636
Show some respect.

733
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,263
Yes.

734
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,933
Everyone, we're late. Let's go.

735
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,144
Stop eating chicken breast.

736
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,072
-Mi-rae.
-Don't call me by my first name.

737
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,531
I'm a third-year now.

738
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,159
I had…

739
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,662
two choices.

740
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,084
I could either run away or come back here.

741
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,293
I saw it.

742
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,504
Your one-way ticket to Madagascar.

743
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,467
Why didn't you just go?
You're not going to last long anyway.

744
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,737
KANG SI-YOUNG

745
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,499
Dr. Kang, are you a doctor?

746
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,877
Yes, I'm a doctor.

747
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:15,056
ANESTHESIOLOGY

748
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,873
It's my first day back at the hospital.

749
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,250
I'm sorry it took so long.

750
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,377
I won't let you down.

751
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,091
Excuse me.

752
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:14,282
CHA YO-HAN

753
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
We meet again.

754
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,138
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN
AND JUNG IN-GI FOR THEIR CAMEO PARTS

755
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,487
This person is a murderer.

756
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,780
He is a doctor.

757
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,949
He killed a person.

758
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,453
Male, 38 years old.

759
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,790
This patient had an emergency canthotomy
two days ago.

760
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,167
The patient refused
any treatment or tests.

761
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,627
He wanted Dr. Cha to be prohibited

762
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,255
-from approaching him.
-Do you want to learn from me?

763
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,340
-But don't learn these things.
-We say no!

764
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,010
What is going on?

765
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,303
Is Cha Yo-han in?

766
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,889
I haven't seen Professor Cha
in three years.
