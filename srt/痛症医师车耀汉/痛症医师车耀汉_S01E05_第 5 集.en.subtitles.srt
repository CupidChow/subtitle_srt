1
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,995
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,832
I interviewed the interns yesterday.

3
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,045
They gave all sorts of answers
to why they became doctors.

4
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,631
Do you remember your answer?

5
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,674
It must've been something cheesy.

6
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,428
Frankly speaking, such an answer
is not necessary.

7
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,847
Newbies don't have answers to that.

8
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,683
Then why do they ask?
You guys ask that for every interview.

9
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,187
-You ask why we chose to become doctors.
-And you all say the same.

10
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,106
You say that it was because
you wanted to save lives.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,067
But it's true.

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,779
But the problem is, we can't always
save all the patients.

13
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,198
Save all the patients?

14
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,994
There's a way for a doctor to always save

15
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,871
the patients.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,583
The way to save lives all the time.

17
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,961
-What is it?
-Are you curious?

18
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,504
Yes.

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,634
I'll tell you once we reach the top.
We're almost there.

20
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,760
Come on.

21
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,339
Dad!

22
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,096
Dad!

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,558
Dad!

24
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,564
Dad!

25
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,841
Dad!

26
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,010
Dad. Dad.

27
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,601
Dad. Dad.

28
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,857
Dad.

29
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,742
Dad.

30
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,746
Dad.

31
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,517
Dad.

32
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,686
Hello?

33
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,815
We're in Mount Sumun. Someone fell.

34
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,526
Hello? Hello?

35
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,111
Hello?

36
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,034
Hello? Yes, I can hear you.

37
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,705
Yes. We are in Mount Sumun.

38
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,039
Please hurry.

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,919
Dad, help is on the way,
so you have to remain conscious.

40
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,650
Hang in there.

41
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,946
Let's go.

42
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,656
No.

43
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,117
Please stop.

44
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,536
-We need to go.
-Let's wait.

45
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,081
-We need to go.
-Let's wait.

46
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,418
Help is on the way.

47
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,086
No.

48
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,381
No one's coming.

49
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,427
I couldn't call for help
because my phone broke.

50
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,596
Then...

51
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,681
I thought someone would come.

52
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,100
I thought someone would pass by.

53
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,980
That's why we need to move.

54
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,649
Let's go.

55
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,779
Dad. Dad.

56
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,917
It hurts.

57
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,923
It hurts so much.

58
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,803
This just came in.

59
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,057
The police are searching
Mount Sumun for a person.

60
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,226
Dad, I think Mom reported us missing.

61
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,811
However, they're facing difficulties.

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,397
Due to the ongoing gale and blizzard,

63
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,651
the police have decided
to stop the search.

64
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,529
Once the weather clears up,

65
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,406
they will resume the search once again.

66
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,408
Next.

67
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,745
In Paju...

68
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,498
-Si-young.
-Yes?

69
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,250
What time is it?

70
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,503
It's 6:20 p.m.

71
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,383
It'll take 12 hours

72
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,136
until morning comes.

73
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,347
But in this state,

74
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,435
I won't be able to last another hour.

75
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,603
Dad, please.

76
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll suffer from hypothermia and shock.

77
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:26,946
Si-young.

78
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,740
You are

79
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,702
a doctor.

80
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,123
Explain my state
using Visual Analogue Scale.

81
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,339
Compound fractures.

82
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,092
Pelvic fracture.

83
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,388
Massive bleeding and hypothermia.

84
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,017
In this case, VAS is...

85
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,143
VAS: PAIN MEASURING SCALE

86
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,311
eight.

87
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,147
Nine.

88
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,316
Ten.

89
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,446
Right. You're right.

90
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,573
Theoretically

91
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,367
and clinically speaking,

92
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,871
that's how we taught you.

93
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,290
But

94
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,792
you're wrong.

95
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,671
That's incorrect.

96
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,259
The moment when you feel

97
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,180
the most pain is

98
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,976
when you realize

99
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,980
that you won't get better and lose hope.

100
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,950
Let go of your hand.

101
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,495
No! Don't say that!

102
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,872
Let go.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,171
You're not killing me.

104
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,011
You're helping me feel at peace.

105
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,518
I'll tell you how

106
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,897
a doctor can always save lives.

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,316
Only

108
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,611
taking

109
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,032
care of

110
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,494
patients who won't die to begin with.

111
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,002
That's the only way.

112
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,761
So let go of your hand.

113
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,181
Let go.

114
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,784
Dad. Dad!

115
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,703
Dad!

116
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,998
Dad!

117
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,793
Dad!

118
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,226
Stop.

119
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,400
Dad is in pain.

120
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,373
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

121
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,131
-Mi-rae...
-Let me go!

122
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,388
No.

123
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,516
One, two, three, four, five, six...

124
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,177
Why did you tell her to stop?

125
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,596
Was once not enough?

126
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,891
-Are you trying to kill him again?
-Mi-rae.

127
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,197
I'd like all of you to leave.

128
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,751
Do you think they're going to end
his life-prolonging treatment?

129
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,879
They should've done it a long time ago.

130
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,673
But they had to take his inheritance
and succession into consideration.

131
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,841
Really complicated.

132
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,302
Shouldn't the board also talk about this?

133
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,720
I guess.

134
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,893
Si-young, what are you thinking?

135
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,565
By any chance, are you...

136
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,317
We know your dad's in pain.

137
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,362
But we can still detect brain activity.
So he can't be considered brain dead.

138
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,282
But the chances that he'll recover
is also pretty low.

139
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,368
Mom.

140
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,955
So are you saying we should
remove the ventilator?

141
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,042
No, I don't want that.

142
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,169
I can't do that.

143
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,674
Why did you stop her?

144
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,136
His heart rate's back to normal,
so why did you stop her?

145
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,722
That doesn't mean he got better.

146
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,935
I don't care if he's not like
how he used to be.

147
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,436
I just want him to stay alive.

148
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,733
Even if he's bedridden like this,
I still want him to stay by our side.

149
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,201
He's still so warm.

150
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,121
Does this mean nothing?

151
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,832
I'm able to feel and touch him.

152
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,088
I know. Dad can feel everything as well.

153
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,217
He can feel your hand, your warmth,

154
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,053
and he also feels pain.

155
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:14,645
What if we're just
prolonging his pain rather than his life?

156
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,608
Do you really think that is best for him?

157
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,199
Do you even care what's best for him?

158
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
Are you sure it's not because
you want to feel at ease?

159
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,289
I know you're struggling
to see Dad like this.

160
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,291
And if he regains his consciousness

161
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,167
but is no longer able
to live a normal life,

162
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,045
you'll probably end up
struggling even more.

163
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,924
I'm never going to give up on him.

164
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,154
-What's going to happen now, sir?
-What do you mean?

165
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,781
It's the first time people started
questioning whether the chairman

166
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,992
should continue receiving
life-prolonging treatment.

167
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,411
If his family decides to stop
the treatment...

168
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,747
Why are you getting ahead of yourself?

169
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,832
And they can't just end
his life-prolonging treatment

170
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,751
just because his family decides
to approve it.

171
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,919
Well, yes.

172
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,173
The chairman can't exactly be
considered brain dead.

173
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,344
It all depends on what
Chief Min decides to do.

174
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,473
Even if she decides to end
his life-prolonging treatment,

175
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,060
this could end up going to court
if any legal problems happen to arise.

176
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,951
Some people think I don't deserve
to be a doctor again.

177
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,329
But I don't care about them.

178
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,707
I care more about the patients
that are in front of me.

179
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,378
I hope you also think the same way.

180
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,340
Okay.

181
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,624
Would you like to order?

182
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,712
Two IVLs and a piece of cake.

183
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,047
-Give me the sweetest one.
-IVL?

184
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,259
Iced vanilla latte.

185
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,015
How does she not know that?

186
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,853
-I should get going.
-Sit down.

187
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,941
Eat and drink what I ordered.

188
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,609
You need to calm down.

189
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,446
Do you think
I'm being emotional right now?

190
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,405
Then what is it?

191
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,409
You can't possibly be cool-headed
about your dad.

192
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,495
You look very angry.

193
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,040
But I know you're not.

194
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,045
You're not upset
because you're angry at Si-young.

195
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,923
It's because you're scared
that you might lose your dad.

196
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,231
Are you okay?

197
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,737
Okay, everyone!
This is a tough world to live in!

198
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,490
Let's recharge ourselves
with some caffeine!

199
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,532
One, two, three.

200
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,369
Americano!

201
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,333
-Thank you, Dr. Lee.
-Thank you.

202
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,085
Have something sweet!

203
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,716
-Have something sweet!
-I already did.

204
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,645
The chairman's case is quite complicated.

205
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,940
First, the entire family needs to approve.

206
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,692
Then, the ethics commission
will have to discuss what to do.

207
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,195
If they do a brainwave test,
he won't be considered brain dead.

208
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,031
And if you remove
the ventilator in that state,

209
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,493
it won't be a legal way of ending
his life-prolonging treatment.

210
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,746
It'll clearly be considered
as death with dignity.

211
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,166
But are you really

212
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,545
thinking about doing that to the chairman?

213
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,637
Welcome.

214
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,682
A culprit was charged with
homicide and theft

215
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,059
after stealing jewelry from
and murdering a senior citizen.

216
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,894
But the prosecution demanded
life imprisonment

217
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,272
instead of capital punishment,
and that's causing an uproar.

218
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,774
When it comes to homicide by a robber,
you either get sentenced

219
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,484
to life imprisonment or
capital punishment.

220
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
However, Son Seok-ki,
the prosecutor in charge

221
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,280
from Seoul Southern District
Prosecutors' Office,

222
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,408
demanded life imprisonment, not
capital punishment during today's trial.

223
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,785
And it caused the victim's family
to strongly protest.

224
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,579
People say the prosecution
should've demanded

225
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,498
-a stronger sentence. Any comments?
-Any comments to the victim's family?

226
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,542
What do you think about this issue?

227
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,752
Amnesty International has classified Korea

228
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,546
as an abolitionist in practice country.

229
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,258
The Ministry of Justice hasn't executed
any criminals for over 20 years.

230
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,010
So if I demand a death penalty,

231
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,263
it'll only be a waste
of prosecutorial power.

232
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,390
People think if we abolish
capital punishment,

233
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,350
it'll reduce the awareness
of brutal crimes.

234
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,894
What do you think about that?

235
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,980
COURT

236
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,691
Capital punishment
is the same thing as murder.

237
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,361
Every act that takes away
someone's life is an act of murder.

238
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,946
There no exceptions to murder.

239
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,991
I will not respond to murder

240
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,786
by committing murder.

241
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,421
Every single word he said
was exactly the same

242
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,924
as what he said three years ago
during the final argument.

243
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,550
Actually, this was different.

244
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,054
"Euthanasia is the same thing as murder."

245
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,101
DEFENDANT

246
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,063
Let's say there's a patient
who is beyond recovery.

247
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,232
A meaningless life-prolonging
treatment could violate

248
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,359
the patient's right to dignity
and freedom to choose.

249
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,361
That's right. Cha Yo-han, the defendant,

250
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,738
ended that meaningless
life-prolonging treatment.

251
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,909
However, the basis of
all basic human rights

252
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,994
that are written in the Constitution

253
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,081
is the right to live.

254
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,417
The defendant injected
a lethal dose of anesthetics

255
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,795
and violated the basic human right
of Yoon Seong-kyu

256
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,380
which was his right to live.

257
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,467
A living being has dignity, value, and
rights only when he or she is alive.

258
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,261
What will any of that matter

259
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,221
once that person's dead?

260
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,182
Is he going to say he protected
the patient's dignity after he killed him?

261
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,767
A doctor's duty

262
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,854
is to save

263
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,565
their patients.

264
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,153
No doctor in this world can
or should be allowed to say

265
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,948
he did his duty after killing a patient.
Such a doctor shouldn't exist.

266
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,908
Even if it was
because of a disease, malpractice,

267
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,582
or euthanasia.

268
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,462
Did he visit you?

269
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,383
Maybe he already did.

270
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,178
Yesterday's protest.
Who do you think was behind it?

271
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,562
-Is it cold?
-Yes. You asked us to cool it.

272
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,480
Thank you.

273
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,027
You have such weird taste.

274
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,366
Did you hear about Chairman Kang?

275
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,370
His wife asked about his mercy killing.

276
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,167
I think it's a highly controversial issue.
It could end up in court.

277
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,670
If the chairman's death is ever discussed,

278
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,465
there's no way Son Seok-ki
won't get involved.

279
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,636
-So?
-You know how persistent he is.

280
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,182
He knew nothing about medicine at first,

281
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,602
but in just two weeks, he studied
enough to rival a med student

282
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,897
and revealed how much
of what medicine was prescribed.

283
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,149
What's your point?

284
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,402
Seoul Hanse Medical Center.
It's where you work

285
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,404
and the chairman is
your resident's father.

286
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,823
A mercy killing involving your student.

287
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,910
And you first met at the prison.

288
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,830
Even if you have nothing to do with it,
he'll stitch you two up.

289
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,500
Be careful. Don't get dragged into it.

290
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,962
-You still have to be careful.
-How can I be careful?

291
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,424
Pretend you don't know about
the chairman's condition.

292
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,843
And don't give advice.

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,763
What is it?

294
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,772
The day Yoon Seong-kyu died,

295
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,400
an insect got into my office.

296
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,004
-See you.
-Bye.

297
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,096
On any other day,
I'd have killed it without thought.

298
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,015
But that day,

299
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,227
I couldn't kill the insect.

300
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,857
I felt the weight of life on my hands.

301
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,741
You look nice in this.

302
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,077
DAD

303
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,614
Yoon Seong-kyu and I
are not related at all.

304
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,868
He was actually a heinous criminal
who killed two children.

305
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,080
Despite that,

306
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,418
as I injected him with medicine
which would kill him,

307
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,215
I felt so afraid and I had a heavy heart.

308
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,766
In her case, it was her father.

309
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,435
With her own hands

310
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,021
she stopped her father's heart.

311
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,799
Welcome.

312
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,430
Sorry.

313
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,099
Welcome.

314
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,590
Are you looking for a restaurant?

315
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,429
I know a place that closes late. Let's go.

316
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,435
I don't...

317
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,938
remember.

318
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,361
After work, we used to eat
somewhere around here.

319
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,614
However hard I think,

320
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,991
I can't remember.

321
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,000
The last place where I had dinner
with my dad.

322
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,675
Let's look around. We'll find the place.

323
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,012
Come along.

324
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,365
Did your father drink?

325
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,992
Yes.

326
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,870
Beer? Or soju?

327
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,498
Soju.

328
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,334
You two must've been close

329
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,796
if you ate together after work.

330
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,052
I often ignored his calls.

331
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,724
To eat with a friend,

332
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,811
I often lied and said I'd already eaten.

333
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,398
He kept telling me to eat.

334
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,568
I refused.

335
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,279
I said I was full.

336
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,083
-Eat up. Why aren't you eating?
-I don't want to eat.

337
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,335
You eat this. I don't eat shrimp.

338
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,421
Come on.

339
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,089
I'll eat it then.

340
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,386
It's delicious. You're so silly.

341
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,893
I should have enjoyed it.

342
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,981
If I'd known that would be
our last meal together,

343
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,694
I'd have enjoyed it all.

344
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,784
Okay. One, two, three.

345
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,369
You look scary.

346
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,664
You do.

347
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,917
One more.

348
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,959
One, two.

349
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,505
Gosh.

350
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,174
HAPPY BARBECUE

351
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,511
Let's go inside.

352
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,024
Let's eat.

353
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,109
Your dad won't want you to starve.

354
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,612
The rain stopped.

355
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,325
I enjoyed the meal, sir.

356
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,743
So did I.

357
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,496
If I were you,

358
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,166
I might have tried to go farther away.

359
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,211
Somewhere farther than Madagascar.

360
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,548
I might have never returned.

361
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,135
That's a huge compliment.

362
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,346
It means I'm better than you.

363
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,724
No, I complimented myself.

364
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,185
I'm glad I prevented you
from running away.

365
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,159
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

366
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,423
-Which department are you looking for?
-Where's the ICU?

367
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll show you. Come with me.

368
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,385
Thank you.

369
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,726
Going up. Sixth floor.

370
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,978
Wait, wait!

371
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,521
The door is opening.

372
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,066
Going up.

373
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,197
Third floor. The door is closing.

374
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,370
Get off at the third floor.
It's on your right.

375
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,038
Thank you.

376
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,124
I've been here for days
and I still get confused.

377
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,335
Thanks to you, I didn't get lost.

378
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,171
Are you a guardian?

379
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:49,676
Yes. My husband's heart
suddenly started acting up.

380
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,846
-Thank you.
-Going up.

381
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,183
Eat regularly.

382
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,978
You can't collapse too.

383
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,897
Food is energy.

384
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,900
Okay. Thank you.

385
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,200
Hey.

386
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,078
I might be talking too much about food,

387
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
but did you feed the cat yesterday?

388
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,377
-Yes.
-How?

389
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,879
Doesn't the food get soggy when it rains?

390
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,007
Bagged food.

391
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,842
What food?

392
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,261
You put the dry food in a plastic bag.

393
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,763
It stays dry and the cats know how to eat.

394
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,184
That's a good idea. I'll feed it today.

395
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,686
If you don't mind.

396
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,065
I feel bad for asking silly questions.

397
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,653
See you later.

398
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,492
Dr. Heo?

399
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,247
It's huge. Really huge news.

400
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,292
Hurry, hurry.

401
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,170
Guys, guys.

402
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,588
Dr. Cha.

403
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,800
-It's huge.
-What is it?

404
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,428
What's huge?

405
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,891
What is it?

406
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,518
Dr. Cha's now a famed doctor.

407
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,568
-He's in the news.
-Our professor?

408
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,320
DOCTOR WHO SAVED JOO HYUNG-WOO

409
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,529
His future's bright.

410
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,116
-He's famous now.
-Look at that.

411
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,035
I OWE DR. CHA MY HOPE FOR THE FUTURE

412
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,205
Joo Hyung-woo said
amazing things in the interview.

413
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,248
That there's a doctor of miracles

414
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,002
who cures cripples and heals the blind.

415
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,546
IN A RECENT INTERVIEW,
JOO HYUNG-WOO SAID...

416
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,506
He got really lucky.

417
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,675
How did he land a famous patient
like Joo Hyung-woo

418
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,262
and go from Grim Reaper
to a savior in a day?

419
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,515
-Hallelujah.
-Amen.

420
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,850
So what if he becomes famous?

421
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,480
Our center will be empty
and quiet again today.

422
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,440
Basement one.

423
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,446
Are the protesters here?

424
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,990
-Is this our floor?
-I think so.

425
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,762
-Is this our floor?
-Can we not go home today?

426
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,847
I have to go home.

427
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,723
What's this?

428
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,268
-I have to go home.
-What's this?

429
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,605
Heo Jun?

430
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,316
Are you Dr. Heo Jun?

431
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,901
Yes, I am.

432
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,320
My gosh. It must be you.

433
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,114
The famous doctor.

434
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,034
Gosh. It's you.

435
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,996
His name is Heo Jun.
Like the legendary doctor.

436
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,914
Dr. Heo.

437
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,542
Is he that professor?

438
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,170
Now, now, please be quiet!

439
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,007
Look over there. Go that way.

440
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:20,553
-Where are you going?
-What? What? What's the matter?

441
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,264
No, no, sir. What are you doing?

442
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,642
No, no. Leave me alone.

443
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,854
Ma'am. Sir. Ma'am, let go of me.

444
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,063
Let go.

445
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,358
No, no, you can't do this.

446
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,402
Sir, please.

447
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,321
What's wrong?

448
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,531
Relax.

449
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,666
Please wait over there.

450
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,547
What was that called? Myasthenia gravis.

451
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,258
I think I have that.

452
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,221
Can you write down your name
and social security number?

453
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,680
I said I'm in pain.

454
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,308
It's killing me.

455
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,645
When do you start seeing patients?

456
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,105
I'm here with a sore leg.
Must I stand and wait forever?

457
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,067
You can't come in.
We're getting ready. Please wait.

458
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,445
Dr. Cha.

459
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,616
Today, all residents and fellows
will do preliminary examinations.

460
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,119
Many people seem to think
they have myasthenia gravis.

461
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,163
As you know, symptoms are sporadic

462
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,122
and hard to diagnose.

463
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,709
Check the symptoms thoroughly
and transfer to Neurology if necessary.

464
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,629
Sort patients by symptoms and brief me.

465
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,797
-Okay.
-Okay.

466
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,049
Dr. Lee, prepare the operating room.

467
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,634
-Got it.
-Also,

468
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,095
most of our patients
would have been to many hospitals

469
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,472
and departments and
failed to get a diagnosis.

470
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,641
But remember.
There's no pain without cause.

471
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,977
There's only pain with an unknown cause.

472
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,105
My gosh.

473
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,858
Let's get to work.

474
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,278
Gather round for a group cheer.

475
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,237
No pain without cause.

476
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,699
AP cheer. Gather round.

477
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,701
AP cheer? What's that?

478
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,247
We came up with a cheer for our team,
for Anesthesiology and Pain Management.

479
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,456
"AP."

480
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,005
Let's all do it.

481
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,591
Gather round, everyone.

482
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,635
One, two, three.

483
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,429
AP, AP, let's go!

484
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,139
Down, not up.

485
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,058
We're ready.

486
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,693
-When did the pain start?
-About a month ago?

487
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,196
When did it hurt most recently?

488
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,532
I think it's been about a week.

489
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,159
Did it ever hurt before?

490
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,202
This might hurt a bit.

491
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,580
A sore knee.

492
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,082
-Your knee hurts?
-Yes.

493
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,709
It has been about two years.

494
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:03,674
Here's the pain spectrum.
It goes from 0 to 10.

495
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,675
Where are you?

496
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,927
Zero means it doesn't hurt at all.

497
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,389
Ten means it hurts to death.

498
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:12,975
Pick a number.

499
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,356
This one.

500
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,317
THE WORST PAIN

501
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,320
This isn't the look on your face.

502
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,490
What? The pain's killing me.

503
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,658
Don't push!

504
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,452
I didn't push.

505
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,080
-You pushed me!
-This is so upsetting.

506
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,043
Will you please excuse me?

507
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,920
What?

508
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,964
But...

509
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,718
I only nudged you
because my legs are weak.

510
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,095
Do you have to yell?

511
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,888
I'm dying here and you keep touching me.

512
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,891
Forget about it.

513
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,144
You're dying? You look just fine.

514
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,021
I look fine? Are you a doctor?

515
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,357
Will you both calm down now?

516
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,900
Let's be orderly and civilized.

517
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,653
How can you tell me to calm down?
Do you know what I have?

518
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,446
What do you have, sir?

519
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,491
Me? I have CRPS. CRPS!

520
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:11,826
CRPS?

521
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,120
-What's CRPS?
-It's bad.

522
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,873
Where's Cha Yo-han? Get him right now!

523
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,250
Will you keep it down?

524
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,459
-Get him!
-Please...

525
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,795
Who wants to see me so urgently?

526
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,005
-Dr. Cha.
-Which patient is it?

527
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,799
Dr. Cha?

528
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,261
Yes. But if you scream so loud,
you'll disrupt us at work.

529
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,764
Save me, Dr. Cha.

530
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,142
Or kill me.

531
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,770
I don't know what's wrong, but if you--

532
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,439
It's CRPS!

533
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,528
Someone help my son! Help my son!

534
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,783
The ER is on the first floor.
This is the Pain Management Center.

535
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,330
I'm okay now.

536
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,332
Let's go.

537
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,460
Wait.

538
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,669
-Dr. Lee.
-Yes?

539
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:48,881
Have his bed ready.

540
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,218
What? You're not
going to send him to the ER?

541
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,845
No, he's our patient.

542
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,734
Can't he feel anything?

543
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,236
I guess not.

544
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,993
He's not under local anesthesia.

545
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,787
But... But he's not...

546
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,875
Look.

547
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,130
What's going on?

548
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,051
Why did you do this?

549
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,471
So you can prove your illness?

550
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,890
How did you know that, Dr. Cha?

551
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,976
Cut.

552
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,896
His brother got beaten up by his friends.

553
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,482
-My gosh.
-What is that?

554
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,858
So he ran outside

555
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,820
and told them to beat him up instead
since he feels no pain.

556
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,905
But they didn't believe him.

557
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,827
-So he cut himself...
-Mom.

558
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,955
He's a famous doctor.

559
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,959
-He might be able to treat you.
-Forget it. I'm not going to get treated.

560
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,919
We were told that it's incurable.

561
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,757
Check if he can sense temperature.
And get ready to check his symptoms.

562
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,343
And check for secondary symptoms
due to analgesia and anhidrosis.

563
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,722
Dr. Cha, that can't be.

564
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,557
I'm sure of it.

565
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,642
That's a 0.0000001 probability.

566
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,186
And there aren't
that many materials about it either.

567
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,147
No one in our country has ever
been diagnosed....

568
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,358
No, wait. I think there was one.

569
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,404
-What are you talking about?
-Cut.

570
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,826
He can get cut, get stitches
without anesthetics,

571
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,912
break his bones, and rupture his organs.
But he still won't feel any pain.

572
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,666
It's congenital insensitivity
to pain with anhidrosis.

573
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,088
He's a CIPA patient.

574
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:57,343
CIPA: CAUSES INSENSITIVITY
TO PAIN OR TEMPERATURE

575
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,436
You're going to carry out the exam
in teams.

576
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,104
Lee Yoo-joon, Heo Jun, and Kim Won-hee.

577
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,439
You're in charge of Lee Gi-seok,

578
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,107
-the possible CIPA patient.
-Yes, doctor.

579
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,359
Kang Mi-rae and Kang Si-young.

580
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,819
You're in charge of Choi Seung-won,
the possible CRPS patient.

581
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,321
CRPS: COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME

582
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,117
-Yes.
-CIPA and CRPS

583
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,036
are completely the opposite.

584
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,996
When you have CRPS,
even the slightest touch

585
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,373
could make you feel pain.

586
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,084
But when you have CIPA, you don't
feel any kind of pain whatsoever.

587
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,672
Dr. Cha.
Does this patient really have CIPA…

588
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,637
-Dr. Heo, watch how you say the word.
-Gosh, come on.

589
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,306
Does he really have CIPA?

590
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,768
That legendary illness we read
in textbooks where the patient

591
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,189
can't sense any pain or temperature?

592
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,655
We'll find out
once we carry out the exams.

593
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,697
Let's begin.

594
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,756
-Regurgitate.
-Regurgitating.

595
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,762
If you're unable to feel pain,
it's most important

596
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,180
not to get infected.

597
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,975
You need to think of your body
as being made of glass. If you don't--

598
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,102
I heard it's like a ticking bomb.

599
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,521
That's what a doctor told me.

600
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,983
He said I'm like a ticking bomb
that could blow up at any minute.

601
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,234
Bang.

602
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,113
Even if my appendix bursts,
I won't be able to feel any pain.

603
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,532
So he said I'll know
once my insides all rot.

604
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,742
Then I'll just end up dying.

605
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,958
So do you want to die early?

606
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,668
I won't be able to live for long anyway.

607
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,545
I heard I'll die before I turn 20.

608
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,256
Whether you'll live a long life
or die early all depends on you.

609
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,175
I don't want to live a long life.

610
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,386
I can't control my body temperature,
so I can't even run.

611
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,723
I need to check my bowel movements,
so I can't go to an internet cafe.

612
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,184
I can't do anything
that other people do so easily.

613
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,311
So what's the point of living a long life?

614
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,192
You can wrap it up.

615
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,235
Monitor the analgesia nociception index.

616
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,112
And check his ability
to sense temperature.

617
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,198
ANI: TO CHECK ONE'S PAIN LEVEL
THROUGH CHANGES OF ECG

618
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,042
-Please don't move.
-You're going to inject that?

619
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,045
We need to run a test
in order to diagnose you.

620
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,340
I told you I feel excruciating pain
even when the wind blows.

621
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,759
I keep telling you that it hurts.

622
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:45,969
Why won't you believe me?

623
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,264
We do believe you.

624
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,559
We believe you, and that's why
we're trying to find the cause.

625
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,228
But what if you fail to find it

626
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,857
-even after I go through all of this?
-Then we'll have to run a few other tests

627
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,150
until we find the cause.

628
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,486
And you just want me to feel
all that pain?

629
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,157
We'll treat and cure you
once we find the cause.

630
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,201
If you need surgery,
we'll put you through one.

631
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,578
And if you need medicine,
we'll prescribe them.

632
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,915
But what if everything
just ends up being useless?

633
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,920
If I still don't get better,
will you help me die in peace?

634
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,633
That's not part of our job.

635
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,009
Why not?

636
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,720
Your job is to relieve a patient
from feeling pain.

637
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,222
But

638
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,266
why do you turn away

639
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,102
when a patient would rather die

640
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,105
than to feel this much pain?

641
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,232
Why?

642
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,570
Don't worry.

643
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,156
We're not going to turn away

644
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,616
from your pain.

645
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,956
Dr. Kang, let's talk outside.

646
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,140
What did you mean by what you just said?

647
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,559
Are you saying you're going to do
what he asks?

648
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,312
-No, that's not...
-Stop responding to nonsense.

649
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,938
Just focus on running the exam.

650
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,524
He's scared.

651
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,405
He's not saying that
because he really wants to die.

652
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,240
He's just scared

653
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,159
that he might not recover.

654
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,788
Excessive empathy with your patients.

655
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,999
Do you still not understand
how harmful it can be?

656
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,544
Focus on his symptoms
rather than his emotions.

657
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,212
That's how we'll be able to cure him.

658
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,097
UNRESTRICTED AREA

659
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,683
SEMI-RESTRICTED AREA

660
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,734
Jun.

661
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:06,985
Yes?

662
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,447
-Aren't they done with the exam?
-I don't know.

663
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,784
What's wrong with him?

664
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,496
-Well...
-I don't feel pain.

665
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,750
-What?
-We're not done with his exam.

666
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,669
-Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

667
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,348
I'm sorry. We'll begin the exam.

668
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,475
Dr. Kang.

669
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,186
Here.

670
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:58,370
JUNE 11, 2018:
MY ELBOW HURT THIS MORNING

671
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,872
You kept a diary of your pain.

672
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,082
Can you promise me

673
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,669
that you'll read my diary

674
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,505
until the very end?

675
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,386
I promise.

676
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,892
Let's begin

677
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,687
the exam.

678
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,148
Choi Sung-hoon, 47 years old.

679
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,108
He broke his left arm a year ago.

680
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,444
And that's when he started
feeling pain in his left chest.

681
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,280
It felt as if his left chest
was being cut by a knife,

682
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,824
and he constantly felt a strong burn.

683
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,786
We ran an exam thinking it might be
a cardiac or lung disorder.

684
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,496
But everything came back normal.

685
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,170
He came to the hospital
saying he has CRPS.

686
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,172
But he didn't meet the criteria.

687
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,966
His symptoms are similar to those of CRPS,

688
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,259
but he doesn't suffer from it.

689
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,013
He's visited pretty much every department
to seek treatment.

690
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,434
Dr. Cha.

691
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,648
Transfer his information to Neurology

692
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,733
along with his diary.

693
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,444
Good work, everyone. You may go home now.

694
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,906
-Thank you, sir.
-Good work.

695
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,991
-Good work.
-Goodbye, Dr. Cha.

696
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,160
NAME: LEE GI-SEOK

697
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:25,290
Goodness, my back,
my feet, my legs, and my neck.

698
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,977
PATIENTS WITH CIPA
WHO HAVE DIED OF SEPTICEMIA

699
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,093
Dad.

700
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,804
Dad, what's wrong?

701
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,780
Yo-han.

702
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,740
Call 119.

703
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,326
-119?
-Yes.

704
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,833
Hello?

705
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,006
My dad is vomiting blood. Please hurry.

706
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,800
-What's your address?
-1003, Bangil-dong.

707
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,885
Help is on the way.

708
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,637
Could you ask him where it hurts?

709
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,767
Please hurry.

710
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,937
Please.

711
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,607
We're on our way,
so please ask him where it hurts.

712
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,151
I don't know.

713
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,528
What? Did you ask him?

714
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,447
Even if I ask, he doesn't know.

715
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,490
What do you mean?
We need to know that so that--

716
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,575
He doesn't know!

717
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,995
Even my dad doesn't know where it hurts!

718
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,939
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE,
LEE WON-GIL

719
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,551
I'm here, sir.

720
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,314
Welcome.

721
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,858
I've been waiting.

722
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,112
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

723
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,538
I'm sorry.

724
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,667
"Dr. Kang Si-young"?

725
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,836
That's me.

726
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,672
You're from the Pain Management Center.

727
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,011
Are you done receiving patients?

728
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,097
Yes, we are.

729
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,349
Oh, no.

730
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,352
If you schedule an appointment
beforehand...

731
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,312
Well, I'm not here to set an appointment.

732
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,525
I'm here to see Dr. Cha Yo-han.

733
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,295
If he's still here,
he's probably in his office.

734
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,547
It's over there.

735
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,424
All right. Thank you.

736
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,177
Does he know that you're coming?

737
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,763
No.

738
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,474
I haven't seen him

739
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,811
in three years.

740
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,148
Prosecutor Son is here?

741
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,691
Yes, he's here. By the way...

742
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,529
It's a bit of an ambiguous amount of time.

743
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,157
In three years,
one could completely change.

744
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,868
But for some, it may not be
enough time at all.

745
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,329
I thought Dr. Cha needed plenty of time,

746
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,374
so I asked for a 10-year sentence instead.

747
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,295
Yes, I'm the prosecutor

748
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,089
who was in charge of Dr. Cha's case.

749
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,178
Why Si-young?

750
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,762
I'm not sure.

751
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,557
He might be aware of what happened
to Chairman Kang.

752
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,518
He might be here for either you or her.

753
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,146
But in any case,
I doubt it's a coincidence

754
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,898
that those two are together.

755
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,406
Doctors are so admirable.

756
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,451
It's an incredible feat to save lives.

757
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,497
But I don't trust them completely either.

758
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,874
Because although they can save lives,

759
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,627
they can also take them.

760
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,256
I consider their hands
double-edged swords.

761
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,926
They could be the deity's hands

762
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,345
or the deity of death's.

763
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,847
Just like Dr. Cha three years ago.

764
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,687
Why are you telling me this?

765
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,984
Dr. Cha from three years ago
is someone I'm very familiar with.

766
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,320
I believe the present Dr. Cha is someone

767
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,948
you know very well
since you're his trainee.

768
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,537
What do you say?

769
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,916
Has he changed much
over the past three years?

770
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,556
If he hasn't,

771
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,891
what would you do?

772
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,144
What do you mean?

773
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,604
If...

774
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,359
he attempted to repeat
what he did three years ago,

775
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,281
would you report it?

776
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,324
Or

777
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,369
would you turn a blind eye?

778
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,205
If it's neither,

779
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,750
would you

780
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,298
agree with him?

781
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,101
DR. CHA YO-HAN

782
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,319
Hello?

783
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,366
Yes, it has been a while, Dr. Cha.

784
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,495
It has been, Prosecutor Son.

785
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,998
Are you here to see me?

786
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,085
I guess you could say that. By the way...

787
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,631
What did you say?

788
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,938
Step away right now.

789
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,483
From my trainee.

790
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,461
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN

791
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,895
I never asked for society's
forgiveness for what I did.

792
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,481
Time doesn't erase your criminal record.

793
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,901
If Dr. Cha keeps doing what he does,
he can help us when we need him.

794
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,486
What do you mean by that?

795
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,699
The daughters of these two
currently work under Dr. Cha.

796
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,867
-Mi-rae.
-I feel

797
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,328
even more anxious that
you're close to someone like him.

798
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,789
If there were a case
identical to that one...

799
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,249
Would I make the same choice?

800
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,338
I can only say that
some things are impossible.
