1
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,243
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,164
You feel pain because you're alive.
Without life, there's no pain.

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,750
A fighter without sight and limbs
is better off dead

4
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,169
than staying alive relying on machines.

5
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:50,592
Was there no way you could save him?
Except stopping his pain?

6
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,428
Is that why you did that?

7
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,222
Did you stop his pain?

8
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,436
Can any of you be sure that he's
a terminal patient who can't recover?

9
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,647
No doctor in this world can
or should be allowed to say

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,816
he did his duty after killing a patient.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,360
Even if it was
because of a disease, malpractice,

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,363
or euthanasia.

13
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,948
Dr. Cha!

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,035
Cha Yo-han! Dr. Cha!

15
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,955
Despite his will to live,
Dr. Cha euthanized him.

16
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,293
That was murder.

17
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,753
Dr. Cha.

18
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,548
What kind of doctor are you?

19
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,180
I came back, thanks to you.

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,642
And I trusted you.

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,353
-But?
-But…

22
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,480
Yoon Seong-kyu…

23
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,692
-If he wanted to live, why did you--
-Do you want to know?

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,070
Yes.

25
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,493
Too bad.

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,870
Right now,

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,583
I'm Joo Hyung-woo's doctor,
not Yoon Seong-kyu's.

28
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,046
My patient is lying in bed
without a diagnosis.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,008
If you're confused about what I am,
stop caring about me.

30
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,679
If I were you,

31
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,599
I'd focus on Joo Hyung-woo, not me.

32
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,273
Dr. Cha, there's a problem.

33
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,109
Joo Hyung-woo wants to be taken
off the ventilator.

34
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,864
He wants to be taken off the ventilator?
Does he want to die?

35
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,284
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
Who requested that?

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,036
His attorney did.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,039
He even has a recording
of the patient's request.

38
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,877
The patient had asked to be discharged
if he ended up relying on a ventilator.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,462
What if we take him off the ventilator
and he dies?

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,007
Mr. Han, will we be responsible for that?

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,969
Yes. We're not sure if the patient
has no chance of recovering.

42
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,723
If he is discharged and dies,
and his family sues the hospital,

43
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,893
the hospital can be indicted
for aiding a murder.

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,813
By the way, since when is Mr. Joo
our department's responsibility?

45
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,398
What do you think?

46
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,443
It's since Dr. Cha started nosing around.

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,737
Everywhere from Ophthalmology
to Orthopedics.

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,032
Neither Ophthalmology nor Orthopedics
has made any diagnosis yet.

49
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,784
The biggest problem is not
which department is responsible,

50
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,495
but the fact
that there's still no diagnosis.

51
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,547
You don't know what his disease is yet?

52
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,052
No. We also don't know if he can recover.

53
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,179
There's nothing we can say
for sure right now.

54
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,514
Please do everything you can.

55
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,809
I don't care how much it costs
or how long it takes.

56
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,355
I can't let my son go like this.

57
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,066
Father, do you only care

58
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,068
about what you want?

59
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,488
Do you mean
your opinion matters more than mine?

60
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
You want to give up on my son!

61
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,325
Not my opinion.

62
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,620
Not yours.

63
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,998
What about his opinion?

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,338
Shouldn't his opinion matter more
than what his family wants?

65
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,511
As far as I know,
Hyung-woo would want to live.

66
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,388
Hyung-woo is a champion.

67
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,349
He'd never want to spend
the rest of his life bedridden.

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,810
You're the one who can't handle it.

69
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,522
You're saying this is Hyung-woo's opinion
because you don't want to deal with it.

70
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,067
He even signed a DNR
to make it clear that it's his wish.

71
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,902
That was the whole point.

72
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,780
I never gave my consent.

73
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,660
Doctors.

74
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,662
I beg you.

75
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,414
Please save my son.

76
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,503
No matter what it takes,
please save my son. I beg you.

77
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,299
That's what we're going to do.

78
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,759
He can't be discharged like this.

79
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,177
Thank you, Director.

80
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,016
I trust you all.

81
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:25,700
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

82
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,371
It's illegal to suspend
life-prolonging treatment right now.

83
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,124
Let me get his family's consent
for treatment.

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,920
But I want you to keep Dr. Cha
off this case.

85
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,424
He already performed a procedure
against the patient's will.

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,551
I'm considering taking legal action too.

87
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,595
Yesterday's procedure is not illegal.

88
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,346
If the doctors had complied,

89
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,932
they would have ended up aiding a murder.

90
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,560
Mr. Han has a point.

91
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,189
But we will keep Dr. Cha off the case.

92
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,774
Don't worry.

93
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,703
DR. CHA YO-HAN

94
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,664
Mr. Joo will be tested.

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,125
You're off the case.

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,420
It's Chief Min's order, so stay out of it.

97
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,532
Is Dad going to die?

98
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,494
Take your sister over there, okay?

99
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,912
Okay.

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,548
Will Joo Hyung-woo be okay?

101
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,176
-We'll see.
-I'm a huge fan of his.

102
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,682
Let's go that way. Hurry up.

103
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,147
Whenever I see them,
I get an upset stomach.

104
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,191
How can Si-young live
under the same roof with her?

105
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,694
"Under the same roof"? Si-young?

106
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,778
You didn't know?

107
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,865
Chief Min is Si-young and Mi-rae's mom.

108
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
Mom? What do you mean?

109
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,452
Mom?

110
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,006
Chief Min is their mom,
and the director is their uncle.

111
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,716
Incredible, right?

112
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,969
I feel sorry for you.

113
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,599
You're a fellow, but you can't
boss your resident around.

114
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,059
I don't care.

115
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,229
I'm from an unknown university.

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,775
The rules of aristocrats at a major
hospital like this don't concern me.

117
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,115
Are you sure? You're not going
to boss me around either, are you?

118
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,451
I love you.

119
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,369
-Any new patients?
-No.

120
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,455
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

121
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,640
"Myasthenia gravis"?

122
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,476
AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE
WHICH CAUSES THE MUSCLES TO WEAKEN

123
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,978
You're a good artist.
Your last drawing was nice too.

124
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,856
-You're a total Picasso.
-It's nothing.

125
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,944
Right. Mr. Joo is being tested.

126
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,445
For what?

127
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,240
-How?
-His family gave consent.

128
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,625
Hello.

129
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,136
Come here.

130
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,347
Hello.

131
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,225
The test results are out.

132
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,601
What does it say?

133
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,854
According to the CT scan,
he seems to have pneumonia.

134
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,066
His pneumonia worsened
and caused a respiratory disturbance.

135
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,276
Is it curable?

136
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,320
The diagnosis is not complete.

137
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,031
We only found out
the cause of respiratory failure.

138
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,075
We'll put him on antibiotics

139
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,161
and take him off the ventilator
as soon as his condition improves.

140
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,504
-Hyung-woo.
-Dad!

141
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,131
-Honey.
-Dad!

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,675
Mr. Joo, do you know where you are?

143
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,386
Don't worry, Hyung-woo.

144
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,264
You'll be taken off the ventilator.

145
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:04,312
You have pneumonia,
but you can breathe. So hang in there.

146
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,401
Dad.

147
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,225
Mr. Joo's CT scan
shows signs of pneumonia.

148
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,437
-Are you coming from the ICU?
-Yes.

149
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,901
-You said you wouldn't do anything.
-He was tested with his family's consent.

150
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,612
It wasn't because of your order…

151
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,750
There are signs of pneumonia,
but no thymoma or thymic hyperplasia?

152
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,922
Pneumonia doesn't explain
his other symptoms.

153
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,259
Pneumonia? Has he been put on antibiotics?

154
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,470
-Yes.
-What kind?

155
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,347
No way.

156
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,982
"Levofloxacin"?

157
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,716
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

158
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,068
What is it?

159
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,446
If the patient has myasthenia gravis,

160
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,490
levofloxacin can worsen his condition.

161
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,452
That's why you want to test him
for myasthenia gravis

162
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,329
-with that drug, Tensilon.
-You studied hard. That's accurate.

163
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,251
If he turns out to have myasthenia gravis,
that means you're an amazing doctor.

164
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,128
Without any proper tests, you were able

165
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,672
to make that diagnosis
based on his symptoms.

166
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,633
However, it also means
we don't know anything for sure.

167
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,178
There's no definite diagnosis.

168
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,179
We don't need one.

169
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,514
We did an antibody test on him.

170
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,516
It came out negative.

171
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,478
That doesn't give you
a definite diagnosis.

172
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,105
Twenty-five percent of the patients
can test negative.

173
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,400
Still, what if you're wrong?

174
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,404
That drug can put the patient in danger.

175
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,115
Are you suggesting

176
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,578
that I'm only testing the patient
to see whether my judgment is right?

177
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,746
To be honest,

178
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,165
I'm not sure.

179
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,585
Is your treatment for the patient's sake

180
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,837
or your own sake?

181
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,176
Did you save Mr. Joo yesterday
because you couldn't let your patient die

182
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,762
or because your treatment
was not yet over?

183
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,681
Why did you save him?

184
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,393
For the patient's sake or your own sake?

185
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,480
Why are you asking that?
Is it for the patient or yourself?

186
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,943
If it's for the patient,
we don't have time for this.

187
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,252
Dr. Kim, give him 500 mg of levofloxacin
twice a day through an IV.

188
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,711
Slowly, over an hour.

189
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,048
How much levofloxacin
has Mr. Joo been given?

190
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,092
Who are you?

191
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
Myasthenia gravis is suspected.

192
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,221
If it turns out to be right,

193
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,890
levofloxacin can worsen him,
causing respiratory paralysis

194
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,310
-or even general paralysis--
-Hold on. Aren't you an anesthesiologist?

195
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,937
Yes, I am.

196
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,398
The patient has improved
since he takes antibiotics.

197
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,400
He is off the ventilator and stabilized.

198
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,820
If you're worried,
officially consult Neurology

199
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,863
and have him tested.

200
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,115
If he's taking the antibiotics,
there's no time.

201
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,158
-He has to be tested…
-What's going on?

202
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,290
This doctor is questioning my treatment.

203
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,000
I was telling him to request tests.

204
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,210
There's no time for discussion.

205
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,045
If my diagnosis turns out to be right,

206
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,256
-he should be taken off antibiotics.
-Dr. Cha.

207
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,508
Didn't you hear
that you were off the case?

208
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,428
Follow me.

209
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,555
Hyung-woo!

210
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,848
-Dad!
-Dad!

211
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,850
-Honey!
-Hyung-woo!

212
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,934
What happened?

213
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,477
He can't move his hand.

214
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,778
Mr. Joo, try to move your right leg.

215
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,242
Is his leg paralyzed too?

216
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,037
His pneumonia improved,
and he started breathing on his own.

217
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,122
How could his condition worsen so quickly?

218
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,584
-We should test him for brain lesions.
-We don't have time for that.

219
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,003
He might go back
into respiratory paralysis.

220
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,839
If my diagnosis is right,
he should be taken off antibiotics.

221
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,344
His blood pressure is unstable,
and his pulse is slow.

222
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,596
What if Tensilon puts him
into cardiac arrest?

223
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,476
Mr. Joo, I need to test if I'm right.
Do you give consent?

224
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,196
I told you, I've seen

225
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,531
many doctors like you.

226
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,160
That look on your face

227
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,622
as if you found out something.

228
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,874
Are you…

229
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,254
any different?

230
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,547
We can find that out

231
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,841
with this.

232
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,638
Will that help you diagnose?

233
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,935
Yes, it will.

234
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,649
Let's do this.

235
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,195
Honey!

236
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,780
-Hyung-woo!
-Dad!

237
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,739
Step back.

238
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,576
He might go into cardiac arrest.
Have atropine ready. Intubation too.

239
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,537
-Get atropine.
-Yes.

240
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,242
His heart rate is going down.

241
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,161
Give me atropine.

242
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,889
Dad!

243
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,315
The oxygen saturation is normal.
The heart rate too.

244
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,002
Hyung-woo.

245
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,506
Doctor, what happened?

246
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,342
This shot was only for diagnosis.

247
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,345
It temporarily reduces
myasthenia gravis symptoms.

248
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,138
But he still needs treatment.

249
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,891
Okay. We understand.

250
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,352
Thank you so much, Doctor.

251
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,397
When it comes to myasthenia gravis,
in addition to diagnosis,

252
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,734
continuous and professional
neurological care is very important.

253
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,152
Make sure to get treated.

254
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,280
Dr. Cha.

255
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,579
Thank you.

256
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,833
For ignoring what I said yesterday

257
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,960
and saving me.

258
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:53,382
It's not that I ignored what you said.
On the contrary, I got a hint from it.

259
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,302
A fighter without his sight and limbs.

260
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:03,767
What would have made the fighter
feel like he had lost his sight and limbs?

261
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,690
I considered every disease
that could give you those symptoms.

262
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,608
That's how I found the answer.

263
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,194
-Myasthenia gravis.
-You found my disease…

264
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,573
using my words?

265
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,450
You said you were in so much pain
that you would rather die.

266
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,079
What can I do?
You said that life would be pain.

267
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,665
I had to find it.

268
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,255
I'm not going to do it. I can't.

269
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,339
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,593
But you did it on that patient. Why?

271
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,014
Why not me?

272
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,018
Does pain matter
only in the face of death?

273
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,188
What if I'm in so much pain
that I would rather die?

274
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,524
What if I'm in so much pain
that I would rather die?

275
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,694
What if I'm in so much pain
that I would rather die?

276
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,657
Wouldn't you consider that a bigger pain?

277
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:05,204
I understand how you must feel
as a professional fighter.

278
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,122
But what about your family?

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,127
Why do they need to suffer?
Do you only care about your own life?

280
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,088
Is fighting the only important thing
in your life?

281
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,300
How would your family feel
if you just choose to die?

282
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,638
Advancing your death to ease yourself

283
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,932
and doing it
to take your life away is different.

284
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:25,974
I'm not…

285
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,396
a doctor who kills people.

286
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,535
I heard Joo Hyung-woo got better
after getting injected with Tensilon.

287
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,496
So it was MG.

288
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,082
There was a problem
with his nervous system.

289
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,256
I heard Joo Hyung-woo
got a definite diagnosis.

290
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,051
-Yes.
-See? What did I tell you?

291
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,720
He's a fearless doctor
who makes no mistakes.

292
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,474
Did you come to a conclusion?

293
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,395
-Yes.
-Let's hear it.

294
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,732
He's a doctor who does everything he can…

295
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,777
to get rid of pain.

296
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,572
And that's why he saves people

297
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,492
but sometimes also ends their lives
to do so?

298
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,036
Yes.

299
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,502
By the way, you're acting
completely different from before.

300
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,714
-From when?
-When you were at the provincial hospital.

301
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,845
You want to know why I'm suddenly
acting like Dr. Cha's spokesperson?

302
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,851
You see, I need to earn money.
And what do you do when you need money?

303
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,644
I need to learn everything I can here

304
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,646
-and open up my hospital one day.
-Right.

305
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,107
And I met him
right when I needed to get ready.

306
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,027
He's extremely unsociable and nuts.

307
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,903
But he's also…

308
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,075
a doctor who can teach me stuff
that I can't learn from anyone else.

309
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,057
Si-young, you should do it.

310
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,353
Ask the professor if we can go home.
Right now.

311
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,942
-Did he come back?
-Yes, not too long ago.

312
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,072
Kang Si-young. Kang Si-young.

313
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,698
-Kang Si-young.
-Kang Si-young.

314
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,909
Come on. You can do it.
Show us what you can do.

315
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,453
-Kang Si-young.
-Show us what a second-year can do.

316
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,539
You can do it, Si-young. You can do it.

317
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,818
Dr. Cha.

318
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,947
Dr. Cha.

319
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,890
CHA YO-HAN

320
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,449
What are you doing?

321
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,578
The doctors…

322
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,582
wanted me to ask if it's okay to go home.

323
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,587
Is it time to go home already?

324
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,763
Why are you guys waiting?

325
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,431
Go home.

326
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,392
It's okay, sir.
I still need to organize the charts.

327
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,437
Goodbye, everyone. I'll see you.

328
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,977
Do you feel better?

329
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,480
I should start getting treatment now.

330
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,942
-Where's Dr. Cha?
-He just went home.

331
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,530
-I guess I should thank him tomorrow.
-You need to get better first.

332
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,240
I hope you get better soon.

333
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,410
Dr. Kang.

334
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,121
I'll bring the kids.

335
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,419
Thank you.

336
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,631
Thank you for coming after me
and bugging me that day.

337
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,175
Don't mention it. I just did my job.

338
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,846
If you hadn't come after me that day,
I would've left the hospital.

339
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,558
I probably would've fainted somewhere
and ended up hooked to a ventilator again.

340
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,145
-Dad!
-Dad!

341
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,733
Let's go see your dad.

342
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,782
My daughter just turned five.

343
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,453
And she recently saw me faint
after I took my pills.

344
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,125
Dad.

345
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,169
Dad.

346
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,379
Dad, wake up.

347
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,382
-Mom!
-Yes?

348
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,889
Honey. Honey.

349
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,226
My wife saved me that day.

350
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:31,107
But I swore at her and resented her.
And I made her write a memorandum.

351
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,776
A memorandum?

352
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,988
I made her promise

353
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,784
to do what I asked
if I ended up fainting again.

354
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,080
I was so stupid and selfish.

355
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,670
Dr. Kang, I thought doctors
only saved patients.

356
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,924
But I was wrong.
You and the other doctors saved my family.

357
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,302
Thank you.

358
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,392
-Dad!
-Dad!

359
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,977
My babies.

360
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,147
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

361
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,192
-Let's say goodbye to the doctor.
-Okay.

362
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,986
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

363
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,321
Thank you.

364
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,740
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Dad.

365
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,870
Hurry up, Dad.

366
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,831
Okay, what should we eat?

367
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,832
Pork cutlets!

368
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,175
Let's eat pork cutlets.

369
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,207
Dad.

370
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,507
Dad.

371
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,721
Dad.

372
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,118
BUILDING C ELEVATOR

373
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,638
Hello.

374
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,686
All right. Congratulations on your return!

375
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,447
So? Have you saved many patients?

376
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,951
I got scolded by Mom.

377
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,953
You were scolded? Why?

378
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,538
I deserved it. You know me.

379
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,125
Your mom is so cold-hearted.

380
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,961
That's how a doctor should be.

381
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,546
A wishy-washy doctor like me
only gets in trouble.

382
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,549
You're not wishy-washy.
You're just kind-hearted.

383
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,551
By the way, did you know?

384
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,597
-What do you mean?
-Inmate 6238. He came to our hospital.

385
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,683
-Really?
-You didn't know?

386
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,809
Of course not.

387
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,062
Warden, don't you think
you're too indifferent?

388
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,774
Shouldn't you make sure your inmates
successfully get back into society?

389
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,942
That's unnecessary.

390
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,612
Buying them some food and drinks
will be enough.

391
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
Oh, there he comes.

392
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,123
You said you didn't know.
When did you invite him?

393
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,499
I didn't know.

394
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,418
I just called him to take him to dinner,

395
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,461
and he said he was working
at this hospital.

396
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,839
You told me not to even look at him
or talk to him.

397
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,841
Things have changed.

398
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,052
-Whatever, I'm leaving.
-Si-young!

399
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,637
Hey!

400
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,310
Hi, Dr. Cha.

401
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,522
This way, please.

402
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,489
Hi, Dr. Cha.

403
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,950
Welcome. Have a seat.

404
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,911
Why are you talking to me so politely?
Are you drunk?

405
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,414
No way. But I will be soon.

406
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,458
Well, Si-young, sit down.

407
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,919
Si-young, be polite to Dr. Cha.

408
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,963
Don't be rude like before.

409
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,967
"Rude"? What did I do?

410
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,722
You said, "That jerk.
Who does he think he is?"

411
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,348
Uncle!

412
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,850
What's with you?

413
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,227
Do you have a new medical officer?

414
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,812
Of course.

415
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,066
It's much better with a new one.

416
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,154
-Let me work there sometime.
-No, you can't. Stay away from that place!

417
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,281
If you hate to see me,
why did you call me?

418
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,159
I thought it was so interesting.

419
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,704
You met again as teacher and student.
Who would have known?

420
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,165
You two met through me.

421
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,127
I'm so happy
you can keep seeing each other.

422
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,380
That means I should be nice to her, right?

423
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,882
You're so smart.

424
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,845
Si-young, be polite to Dr. Cha, okay?

425
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,473
You already said that. Are you drunk?

426
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,891
I already said this.

427
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,852
I'm not drunk, but I will be soon.

428
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,604
Here.

429
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,232
Si-young.

430
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,278
All right.

431
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,157
Congratulations on your return, you two!

432
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,742
Cheers!

433
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,476
Pickled cucumbers.

434
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,562
Radish kimchi.

435
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,273
Green onion kimchi.

436
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,029
And this is rice.

437
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,826
Why would you give me rice?
I don't even have time to cook at home.

438
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,496
If you don't have time to cook at home,
cook at the hospital.

439
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,791
-Eating well is important.
-How can I cook at the hospital?

440
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,586
Anyway, take it while I'm being nice.

441
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,964
-Do you want more rice?
-I'm full.

442
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,799
Son.

443
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,845
How are things at the hospital?
Is it going well?

444
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,472
I'm so happy you're closer to me now.

445
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm still learning.

446
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,436
How are your feet?

447
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,438
They're better now.

448
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,981
-Your back?
-It's better.

449
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,234
-Your blood sugar level?
-It's normal.

450
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,572
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

451
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,616
I can't lie to a doctor.

452
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,537
Please don't overwork yourself.
You shouldn't get any worse than this.

453
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,081
I know. Stop nagging.

454
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,712
Why did you even make all this?
I'm not taking this. Never!

455
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,189
Oh, my.

456
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,489
Eating well is important. Did you eat?

457
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,207
Go ahead.

458
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,754
You shouldn't give that…

459
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,383
Dr. Lee?

460
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,220
Do you live in the employee apartment?

461
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,974
-Yes.
-You're thriftier than I thought.

462
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,726
Can't I live here just because
I'm the chief's daughter?

463
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,104
I'm not picking a fight.

464
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,313
I am.

465
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,234
You shouldn't give food
to a cat like this.

466
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,779
The edges are too sharp.
They might hurt the cat's tongue.

467
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,267
It's eating well.

468
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,521
I heard Dr. Kang is your sister.

469
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,357
Yes.

470
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,278
I saw you two say hi yesterday
in the conference room.

471
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,571
How do you know her?

472
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,991
When Dr. Kang was
a medical officer at the prison,

473
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,035
I worked at the hospital nearby.

474
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,828
She brought a patient over.

475
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,748
It's fascinating

476
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,834
how three people from the prison
were reunited.

477
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,753
Three people?

478
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,214
Dr. Cha. He was there too.

479
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,052
That's the prison Dr. Kang went to?

480
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,721
And she met Dr. Cha there?

481
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,723
Yes. You didn't know?

482
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,726
Are you two sisters not close?

483
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,650
Did Heo Jun tell you about my family?

484
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,111
-Yes.
-Then find that out too.

485
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,529
Why we aren't close.

486
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,333
They're alike.

487
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,669
-Yes.
-Watch your step.

488
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,297
We're just leaving. We won't be long.

489
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,885
She and I…

490
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,264
are not related by blood,
but she's my niece.

491
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,435
She's my best friend's daughter.

492
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,610
Dr. Cha.

493
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,031
Take good care of my Si-young for me.

494
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:10,950
What?

495
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,869
Why are you giving me that look?

496
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,166
You should know better than to say that.
I can barely fend for myself.

497
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,334
Let's go.

498
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,838
I know that, but why
do you think I'd say that?

499
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,259
She's not able to tell you everything,
but Si-young…

500
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,468
There's your taxi.

501
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,762
-Come on, Dr. Cha.
-Uncle.

502
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,432
Teach Si-young well, okay?

503
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,016
She is doing just fine.

504
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,185
Really? She is doing fine?

505
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,104
Your niece is doing great.

506
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,272
Uncle, get in.

507
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,107
-You're doing great.
-What?

508
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,109
Dr. Cha said you're doing great.

509
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,404
-Si-young, he praised you.
-Careful.

510
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,530
Si-young.

511
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,625
Go home.

512
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,120
What?

513
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,916
What did you do well?

514
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,045
You don't do as I say.

515
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,177
It was hard for you to do as I said
but not anymore.

516
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,766
You do things before I tell you to,
and sometimes you question my order.

517
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,191
If that's all, then bye. See you tomorrow.

518
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,528
My patient.

519
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,333
He isn't dead yet.

520
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,008
He's been in our hospital

521
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,844
for over a year.

522
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,348
In a vegetative state.

523
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,019
The patient whose heart I stopped.

524
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,146
My patient.

525
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,202
Today, I went to his room
for the first time.

526
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,923
Do you have any regrets?

527
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,012
Ever since that day, that moment.

528
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,557
For over three years.

529
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,061
Did you never regret what you did?

530
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,608
To reduce your patient's suffering,
if the only way out

531
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,068
is death,

532
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,280
could you kill a patient?

533
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,373
I was…

534
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,462
the doctor in charge
of managing the patient's pain.

535
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,648
Pain management meant

536
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,777
giving enough painkillers to knock him out

537
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,988
so he wouldn't feel pain,

538
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,495
then to reduce the dose
so he wouldn't die and feel pain again.

539
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,943
We fed nutrients into his body
even if he was rotting alive.

540
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,696
I had no choice
but to wait for his heart to stop.

541
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,910
Not providing nutrients is murder.

542
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,330
Giving a lethal dose
of painkillers is murder.

543
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,251
I feared becoming a murderer,

544
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:16,338
so for over two months, I kept
the patient barely alive and in pain.

545
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,259
In the name of pain management.

546
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:25,556
While hating myself for using the fact
that he'd killed two kids as an excuse.

547
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,667
Doctor…

548
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,587
Doctor.

549
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,223
Please…

550
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,561
I want to…

551
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,608
Please…

552
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:24,323
Over those two months,
he never once asked me to save him.

553
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,617
He never asked me to kill him either.

554
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,828
Then why…

555
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,373
You asked, "If it means the doctor
can rid the patient of suffering,

556
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,042
can I kill the patient?"

557
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,462
-Yes.
-You asked the wrong question.

558
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,089
You don't kill to end suffering.

559
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,759
You don't kill to avoid suffering.

560
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,802
Then what?

561
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,638
You solve the suffering.

562
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,182
Even if it results in death.

563
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,809
That's all it is.

564
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,272
My patient

565
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,651
asked me to end the pain.

566
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,363
Even if it meant he died.

567
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,078
The law says it's a crime
for a doctor to kill a patient at will.

568
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,081
But for a doctor to neglect
a patient's suffering.

569
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,209
To ignore a plea to end the pain.

570
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,669
That could be a crime.

571
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,674
What I did to Yoon Seong-kyu
for two months wasn't treatment.

572
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,675
It was torture.

573
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,722
Do I regret it?

574
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,433
No.

575
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,519
I was just…

576
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,815
afraid.

577
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,110
Were you afraid?

578
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,657
Yes. A lot.

579
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,538
I was…

580
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,667
afraid as well.

581
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,378
I'm so afraid.

582
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,547
Unlike you,

583
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,884
I'm not sure about what I did,

584
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,139
and I can't say for sure that
I have no regrets.

585
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,976
I don't dare say that.

586
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,355
Back then and even now,

587
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,275
I'm so afraid

588
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,155
of the fact that a patient's life
is in my hands.

589
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,407
That's natural.

590
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:36,830
Rather than a doctor
who doesn't fear himself,

591
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,875
a patient needs a doctor who does.

592
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,632
You're doing well, Si-young.

593
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,232
I need to walk.

594
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:06,943
See you tomorrow.

595
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:37,724
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

596
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,709
The sky's very clear.

597
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,796
Or have my eyes cleared up?

598
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,219
I heard you're much better. I'm glad.

599
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,354
You're right.

600
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:30,402
You don't take away a patient's life
or extend it either.

601
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,366
You let your patient live his full life.

602
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,204
Thank you.

603
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,932
I'd always wanted to do that.

604
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:06,271
An uppercut comes upward from down below.
Put your weight behind it.

605
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,124
I wasn't always an old fogey.

606
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,002
There was a time

607
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,173
when I wanted to heal people,
not their illnesses.

608
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,136
But I'm still not sure if that's best.

609
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,266
We're scientists
who find answers from illnesses,

610
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,310
but humans are an organism
with no answers.

611
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,905
Hello?

612
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,330
Hello?

613
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,091
What's wrong?

614
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,178
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

615
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,935
Hello.

616
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,312
-Hello.
-Hello.

617
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,453
Isn't there no hope
if it's a Code Blue in his state?

618
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,289
Hello, Dr. Cha.

619
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,626
Where are Si-young and Mi-rae?

620
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:57,966
What is it?

621
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,384
VIP ISOLATION WARD

622
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,803
He's in V-fib.

623
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,611
Dad! Dad.

624
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,532
No…

625
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,161
Dad…

626
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,205
Defibrillator. Defibrillator.

627
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,168
Charge to 200 joules.

628
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,755
-Charged.
-Get out of the way.

629
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,217
Shock.

630
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,476
Epinephrine.

631
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,394
Epi!

632
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,356
One ampoule in.

633
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,816
Dad…

634
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,401
Mi-rae, where's Si-young?

635
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,709
Si-young, please pick up.

636
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,420
Her father?

637
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,464
Yes.

638
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,676
It was a huge accident.

639
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,555
Si-young left the hospital after that.

640
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,769
My patient.

641
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,442
He isn't dead yet.

642
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,445
He's been in our hospital

643
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,114
for over a year.

644
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,241
In a vegetative state.

645
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,747
Yes, Dr. Min.

646
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,250
Si-young?

647
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,462
She's not here. Isn't she up there?

648
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,090
Okay, I'll look for her.

649
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,014
-She's not there?
-No. She won't pick up either.

650
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,598
It seems serious.

651
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,309
Where is she?

652
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,646
Keep calling her.

653
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,773
Yes, Dr. Cha.

654
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,848
Kang Si-young.

655
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,310
Kang Si-young.

656
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:03,943
Stand up.

657
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,370
How many times must I tell you?

658
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,499
There's a certain time limit
for each patient.

659
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,501
If it's not then,

660
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,754
it may be too late forever.

661
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,006
A doctor

662
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,759
must be ready to run.

663
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,848
Now is that time.

664
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,894
He's my father, not just a patient.

665
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,607
I'm not a doctor but a daughter.

666
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,944
You're a daughter and a doctor.

667
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,992
Right now, your father needs both.

668
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,377
Come on.

669
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,965
Come on.

670
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,246
It hurts.

671
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,799
It hurts…

672
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,093
so much.

673
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:42,810
Stop.

674
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,735
Dad is in pain.

675
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,014
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN,
JUNG IN-GI, AND JUNG KYUNG-SOON

676
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,403
-We will not ignore the patient's pain.
-Excessive empathy with your patients.

677
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,405
Don't you understand
how harmful it can be?

678
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,283
-Dr. Lee.
-Aren't we sending him to the ER?

679
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,034
No, we aren't.

680
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,327
He's our patient.

681
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,707
A death that involves Dr. Cha's student.
Prosecutor Son will not miss it.

682
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,625
How is he? Is he still the same?

683
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,296
A doctor can't be a deity.
He can only be a deity of death.

684
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:55,466
-What do you want from me?
-I want you to do nothing.

685
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:56,926
Nothing at all.
