1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:36,077
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,461
Yes.

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,713
Okay.

4
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,797
What did he say?

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,386
Dr. Kang is still unconscious.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,101
What should we do, Chief Min?

7
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,440
Give me a hazmat suit.

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,739
-Give me a hazmat suit. I'll go in.
-You can't.

9
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,699
No one can enter the center right now.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,660
The suspected patient was admitted
for headaches

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,496
that has been going on for a year.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,416
If the symptoms appeared recently,
it might not be the Nipah virus.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,587
In any case, no one can enter
until he gets cleared of the infection.

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,966
Also, there are already doctors inside.
Why do you have to go in?

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,303
The suspected patient is showing
new symptoms and they're getting worse.

16
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,555
In addition, one resident is unconscious.

17
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,060
-Give me a hazmat suit.
-No.

18
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,688
The director has ordered us
to follow the protocol by all means.

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,525
You can't solve anything
by going in there now.

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,653
No one can enter the center
under any circumstances. Ever!

21
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,448
Chief Min.

22
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,041
We'll follow the protocol.

23
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,793
Dr. Kwon is right.

24
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,296
You can't solve anything
by going in there.

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,589
Call Dr. Lee.

26
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,304
Right now.

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,181
Get off me!

28
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,768
What happened?

29
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,604
What's going on?

30
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,731
My kid is in there.

31
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,483
A patient might have Nipah virus.

32
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,902
What about my kid? Is she okay?

33
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,237
We'll find out.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,865
My kid has juvenile diabetes.

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,617
She skipped lunch.

36
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,788
If she doesn't eat something soon,
she'll go into hypoglycemic shock!

37
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,790
I have to go in there.

38
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,543
Please let me in. Right now!

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
So-jin! So-jin!

40
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,007
It seems like we have
a situation in there.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,012
Give me glucagon and a hazmat suit.

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,810
Someone must go in. No matter what.

43
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,359
Coming through. Sorry, please step back.

44
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,451
Can we go out now?

45
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,536
-Can we go out?
-Can we go out?

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,497
Step back. No one can go out yet.

47
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,959
Then why are you opening the doors?

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
We're not going out.

49
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,005
Someone is coming in.

50
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,175
KCDC, DO NOT ENTER

51
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,343
Dr. Kang.

52
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,638
Dr. Kang!

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,349
Dr. Kang!

54
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,312
Dr. Kang! Dr. Kang!

55
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,421
How's the patient?

56
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,506
The seizures stopped.

57
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,885
-Check his condition.
-Okay.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,514
Kang Si-young.

59
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,975
Are you awake?

60
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,560
Dr. Cha.

61
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,783
It's okay.

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,754
Good girl.

63
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,674
-I'll come back in ten minutes.
-Okay.

64
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,635
You'll be fine.

65
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,723
-How are things in there?
-I'm not sure.

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,016
But why are you here?

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,731
You want to go inside?

68
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,816
I have to go inside.

69
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,737
If I don't, I'll regret it forever.

70
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,625
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm so sorry.

72
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,093
Why did you come in here?

73
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,055
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,229
How's your vision? Can you see properly?

75
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,398
I asked you why you're here.

76
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,944
You seem a little swollen.
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

77
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,947
How about your sensory nerves?

78
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,949
-Can you feel this?
-Dr. Cha.

79
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,034
Answer me.

80
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,373
I'm okay.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,628
Okay, then. I want you to slowly get up.

82
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,555
Why did you come in here?

83
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,766
I'm not here because of you.

84
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,838
Get up.

85
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,344
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

86
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,764
How's the patient? He fainted earlier.

87
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,810
His pulse is faster than normal,
but it's becoming stable again.

88
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,145
Palpitation.

89
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,480
PALPITATION: AN INCREASE IN PULSE RATE

90
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,524
OR AWARENESS
OF CARDIAC MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS

91
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,784
His entire body is showing symptoms.

92
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,746
The nerves in his respiratory
and circulatory systems are dying.

93
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,123
From now on,

94
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,418
we need to find the name of this disease
before his condition gets worse.

95
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,796
Of course, it should be based
on the premise that it's not Nipah virus.

96
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,032
COUGH, FEVER

97
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,751
Are you really gonna do this?

98
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,589
This virus is highly contagious
with a high fatality rate.

99
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,759
Plus, you're part of the high-risk group.

100
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,184
Think of this as a hostage situation.

101
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,270
Something in his body is the culprit.

102
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,940
It's holding us
and the other patients as hostages.

103
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,858
And I'm the negotiator.

104
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,861
-Are you having fun?
-Do you think I'm having fun?

105
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,325
Like you said, I should get out of here
faster than anyone,

106
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,327
and I want to do that,
so I need your help.

107
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,579
Help me catch the culprit
as fast as possible

108
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,206
so that everyone here can leave.

109
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,799
MOM

110
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,718
It's the chief.

111
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,514
-Hello?
-How are you? How's your head?

112
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,141
I'm okay.

113
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,146
The results will come back in a few hours.
Be careful until then.

114
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,275
Tell Dr. Cha
to keep the medical team in check

115
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,319
until we get the final results
and to call me immediately

116
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,113
-if there's an emergency.
-Yes, ma'am.

117
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,656
Butâ€¦

118
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,493
the patient might not have
the Nipah virus.

119
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,788
Dr. Cha went inside?

120
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,541
Isn't it common sense
to stick to the instructions

121
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,209
in this kind of situation?

122
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,838
He does not know how to follow the rules.

123
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,882
I know he was always like this,
but he's seriously out of control!

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,263
If Dr. Cha hadn't gone inside,
the patient would've been in danger.

125
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,725
Dr. Cha keeps saying he might not have
the Nipah virus.

126
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,144
But how is he going to prove that?

127
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,480
The fact is that we currently have
a suspected patient.

128
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,942
Don't make any rash decisions
until we get the results.

129
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,112
Regardless of the result,
Dr. Cha entered the center

130
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,531
and he must be punished for it.

131
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,879
I've been thinking this for a while.
You're really bad at drawing.

132
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,158
Don't take off
any of your protection equipment

133
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,244
until you get out of here.

134
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,877
You give up very quickly.

135
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,171
It's not like you'll leave
if I tell you to.

136
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,840
And you're obviously not
going to stay still either.

137
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,217
-It'll be a waste of energy.

138
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,968
You shouldn't have fallen down.

139
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,809
-Dr. Lee.
-Yes?

140
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,398
I want you guys to concentrate.

141
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,691
As you can see, the disease

142
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,693
-could be anywhere in his body.
-Dr. Cha.

143
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,823
We got a call earlier from the KCDC
about that friend who came back from India

144
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,991
-whom he met last week.
-How is that person doing?

145
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,993
A slight fever right after
he came back to Korea.

146
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,830
It lasted for about two days,
and he's fine right now.

147
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,124
But they say it could be
a slight infection

148
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,334
or an infection that's asymptomatic.

149
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,088
-We can't rule out Nipah virus.
-Of course.

150
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,134
But there are symptoms
that are irrelevant to Nipah virus.

151
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,095
We can't take a CT or an MRI here.

152
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,013
-How can we diagnose him?
-Try what we can.

153
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,558
Doctors need to become
the examination equipment.

154
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,810
We need to become
the examination equipment?

155
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,940
Can you all hear me?

156
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,692
-Yes.
-Yes.

157
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,237
A 68-year-old man.

158
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,197
He came to the hospital
because of headaches,

159
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,658
a loss of appetite,
and fatigue for about a year.

160
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,952
Recently started vomiting, headaches,
and chest pains.

161
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,038
And now, he's showing new symptoms
such as increased heart rate,

162
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
disorientation, seizures, and palpitation.

163
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,252
Dr. Cha thinks the patient
might not have the Nipah virus.

164
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,422
I want each of you to be in charge
of each system and find a disease

165
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,299
that could turn into systemic disease.

166
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,302
-Won-hee, you're in charge of the lungs.
-Okay.

167
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,264
-Si-young, you're in charge of the heart.
-Okay.

168
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,100
-Mi-rae, metabolic system.
-Okay.

169
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,602
Jun, the brain.

170
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,812
Okay.

171
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,564
Dr. Lee, digestive system.

172
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,941
-Okay.
-I'll make the overall diagnosis.

173
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,859
Begin.

174
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,152
-Okay.
-Okay.

175
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,621
Dr. Cha, could it be
a chronic lung disease?

176
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,166
It's associated with chest pains,
fatigue, and palpitation.

177
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,794
-What about his heart?
-Blood pressure normal, not obese,

178
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,004
non-smoker, not diabetic.

179
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,173
Nothing in particular
that could affect his heart.

180
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,343
Never had myocardial infarction,
angina, or cardiac insufficiency.

181
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,094
How's his X-ray?

182
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,266
I can see a hint
of pneumonic infiltration.

183
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,685
Pneumonic infiltration? Next.

184
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,229
The arteriovenous malformation

185
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,106
that occurred in his brain and spinal cord
could affect his entire body.

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,443
It also explains his headaches, seizure,
and dysaesthesia.

187
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,862
Is the patient's name Yu Deok-kyu?

188
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,781
Yes. Why do you ask?

189
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,033
Does he have white hair?

190
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
Are you in the security office?
How'd you know that?

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,831
-You didn't even see him.
-Do you know him?

192
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,212
Yes. I think so.

193
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,339
It's the best thing I heard so far.

194
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
-Do you know him well?
-I met only him a few times

195
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
during my volunteer medical service,
I don't know him well.

196
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,596
-But I do know his job.
-What is it?

197
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,474
He's a priest.

198
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,773
-He's wearing a rosary ring.
-A priest?

199
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,608
What was he like?

200
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,111
Tell me what kind of priest
or person he was.

201
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,740
He was an honest man
both in and outside of the church.

202
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,702
He did a lot of volunteer work
and good deeds.

203
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,121
Really gets me thinking sometimes.

204
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,707
I'm an atheist,
but I really do wonder sometimes.

205
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,458
If there really is a deity,

206
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,837
why does such a religious
and kind person have to suffer?

207
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,007
That's religion.

208
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,718
Does religion make people suffer?

209
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,263
How is his build now? Is he thin?

210
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,973
Yes. Why?

211
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,601
BODY WEIGHT: 67KG

212
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,977
One more symptom.

213
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,979
Rapid weight loss.

214
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,734
He's lost at least 20kg
since half a year ago.

215
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,986
At that time, he was pretty well-built.

216
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,655
Any disease that might have caused
the weight loss?

217
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,950
No. He doesn't have diabetes
or thyroid diseases.

218
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,037
We don't know about cancer
or infection yet, though.

219
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,708
Before, he didn't even have
any common geriatric diseases.

220
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,461
Why did he suddenly start getting
all these symptoms a year ago?

221
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,934
Are you okay?

222
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,478
What's wrong?

223
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,939
My arm hurts so much.

224
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,193
Dr. Cha, Ms. Lee Da-hae
has pain in her arm.

225
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,572
-Please calm her down.
-Ms. Lee, are you okay?

226
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,158
Dr. Heo.

227
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,953
Jun.

228
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,922
Pull yourself together, Dr. Heo.

229
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,883
Jun.

230
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,012
Yes, Dr. Cha. I'm here.

231
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,722
Solve it.

232
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
You promised me you'd solve it.

233
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,354
The longer you wait, the harder
it'll get for both you and her.

234
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,737
-Dr. Cha.
-I'm listening.

235
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,616
I'll reduce her pain first.

236
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,994
She's suffering too much.

237
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,162
Inject an analgesic.

238
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,873
Ms. Lee, you'll be injected
with an analgesic.

239
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,229
What's the reason?

240
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,107
What made you want to tell the truth?

241
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,113
If it's phantom limb pain,
it might not be your fault.

242
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,741
PHANTOM LIMB PAIN: PAIN IN A LIMB
THAT HAS BEEN CUT OFF

243
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,035
Her pain might not be my fault.

244
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,288
But if I keep hiding the truth,

245
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,834
it might make it harder to diagnose her.

246
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,963
Get ready.

247
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,675
-Can I go inside?
-I like your answer.

248
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,973
It wasn't to feel less guilty
or because you felt sorry for the patient.

249
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,017
You just wanted an accurate diagnosis.

250
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,449
Sir.

251
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,702
Mr. Yu, are you awake?

252
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,997
Mr. Yu.

253
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,542
I'm anesthesiologist Cha Yo-han.

254
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,629
-Do you hear me?
-Yes.

255
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,589
Let me ask you a few things.

256
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,967
Have you been losing weight rapidly
over the past few months?

257
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,513
-Yes.
-Why is that?

258
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,015
I haven't had much of an appetite.

259
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:24,353
Your weight loss has been too rapid
to be explained by a decreased appetite.

260
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,938
There must be other reasons.

261
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,065
In fact,

262
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,361
I started taking sleeping pills
a few months ago.

263
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:38,075
That's when I also started vomiting
and losing weight.

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,912
But we didn't find any prescription
of sleeping pills in your charts.

265
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,085
Were the pills not from a hospital?

266
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,671
Mr. Yu.

267
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,139
GROUP CALL

268
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,349
THE CALL HAS ENDED

269
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,934
Why did the call end?

270
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,727
Try calling again.

271
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
KCDC, DO NOT ENTER

272
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,440
Mr. Yu.

273
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,652
Everything you say in here
will be kept a secret.

274
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,740
We have an obligation
to protect your personal information.

275
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,869
So please tell us.

276
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,163
Why have you been taking sleeping pills?

277
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,498
And why is there no record
of the prescription?

278
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,261
I didn't get a prescription.

279
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,139
I collected the pills

280
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,433
over decades.

281
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,816
So one thing is solved.

282
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,237
An overdose of sleeping pills
would have led to vomiting.

283
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,115
But that still doesn't explain
why he lost so much weight.

284
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,074
I willâ€¦

285
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,161
probably never get better.

286
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
You'll never be able to find
the cause either.

287
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,708
Why?

288
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,503
-Aren't you here to get better?
-I want to get better.

289
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,339
Butâ€¦

290
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,729
Mr. Yu.

291
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,857
You have a religion, right?

292
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,736
Why does the deity make people suffer?

293
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:43,450
You're only human,
so you've probably asked this question.

294
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,288
"Why do you make me suffer
when I'm so faithful?"

295
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,255
What is the answer you found?

296
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,215
Myâ€¦

297
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,050
sins.

298
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm paying for my sins.

299
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,973
-Your sins?
-Yes.

300
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,559
Iâ€¦

301
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,647
killed people.

302
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,151
I killed countless people.

303
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,532
No matter how much I repent
and try to put things right,

304
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,201
my sins will never be forgiven.

305
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,341
What's that? What did you say?

306
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,885
Mr. Yu, are you okay?

307
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,856
Dr. Kang, try making a sound.

308
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,735
It's a nerve problem.

309
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,407
-Oxygen saturation and BP are dropping.
-Give him oxygen and 12g of ephedrine.

310
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,284
-Maximize the fluid flow.
-Yes.

311
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,916
-What happened?
-What's that sound?

312
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,836
-What's going on?
-No idea.

313
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,130
KCDC, DO NOT ENTER

314
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,718
Are you okay?

315
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,054
Just a second.

316
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,683
Dr. Heo, Ms. Lee Da-hae woke up.

317
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,445
How are you feeling?

318
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,617
You think I'm crazy, right?

319
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,077
Pardon?

320
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,003
I keep saying I have pain
in my arm that doesn't exist.

321
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,257
Everyone seems to think I'm crazy.

322
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,637
My parents, friendsâ€¦

323
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,517
You're not crazy.
It's not a psychological problem.

324
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,185
Then what is it?

325
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:20,148
We still need to run a few tests,
but the pain you feel in your arm

326
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,110
that has been cut off
is probably phantom limb pain.

327
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,402
Phantom limb pain?

328
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,199
It's a condition where you feel pain
in a body part that has been cut off.

329
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,369
What causes a condition like that?

330
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,672
The first possible cause is a problem

331
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,424
in the sensory neurotransmission
to the brain.

332
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,136
The second isâ€¦

333
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,104
What is it? Tell me.

334
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,241
-What's going on?
-What is he doing?

335
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,659
What happened?

336
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,747
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,001
I'm really sorry.

338
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,462
Stop the bleeding.

339
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,469
CAUSE OF ADMISSION

340
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,054
X-RAY

341
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,433
During the amputation surgeryâ€¦

342
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,030
due to my mistake,
you awoke during surgery.

343
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,574
BIS: BISPECTRAL INDEX,
40-60 FOR GENERAL ANESTHESIA

344
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,585
I woke up?

345
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,173
It's when you come around
during anesthesia and feel stimuli.

346
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,010
Because you'd been given
a muscle relaxant,

347
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,014
you wouldn't have been able to move,

348
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,726
but you'd have felt the pain.

349
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,230
Then the second reason for this

350
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,315
is that?

351
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,945
We don't know the exact reason
for phantom limb painâ€¦

352
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,659
But my mistake

353
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,536
will have contributed.

354
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm very sorry.

355
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,711
Go away.

356
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,756
Go away!

357
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,175
I don't want you near me!

358
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,136
Get lost!

359
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,349
-Calm down.
-Go!

360
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,606
Did thatâ€¦

361
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,609
really happen?

362
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,811
Dr. Cha, the patient's chin
is swollen under the jaw.

363
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,649
It's lymphadenia.

364
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,985
LYMPHADENIA: ENLARGEMENT
OF THE LYMPH NODES

365
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,071
HEARING LOSS, LYMPHADENIA

366
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,365
That indicates an infection or tumor.

367
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,535
There's no way to confirm
if there's a tumor in here.

368
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,080
Lymphadenia, disorientation,
and loss of hearing.

369
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,125
He could have an infection.

370
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,464
What could it be?

371
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,300
His medical records were clean
until a year ago.

372
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,802
Without any signs or key symptoms,

373
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,388
why is he suddenly having
all these problems?

374
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,017
The incubation period.

375
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,937
What if an illness with a long
incubation period is showing signs?

376
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,109
Aren't most of them from overseas?
He's never been abroad, right?

377
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,112
Right. He said he hadn't been on a plane
in more than 40 years.

378
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,405
Forty years?

379
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,450
Then he was abroad 40 years ago?

380
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,452
I'm not sure.

381
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,416
He could have been.

382
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,630
War.

383
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,258
-War.
-What?

384
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,010
He said "war."

385
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,388
Right before he had trouble breathing.

386
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,642
Then when he said he'd killed many people,
did he mean during a war?

387
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,815
He took sleeping pills for a long time
because of those memories.

388
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,401
What if that war happened overseas?

389
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,865
Yu Deok-kyu.

390
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,744
He's 68 years old.
Then he was born in 1950.

391
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,581
That means the war
had to have happened after 1970.

392
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,627
GROUP CALL

393
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,045
INCOMING CALL

394
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,301
We have to identify all overseas battles
our patient could've been in.

395
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,389
If we're right, he was exposed to a virus
that's causing all this.

396
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,725
The war took place after 1970.

397
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,395
An overseas war a Korean who was born
in 1950 could've participated in.

398
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,189
The Vietnam War.

399
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,149
That's right.

400
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,444
During my volunteer work,
we met with veterans from the Vietnam War.

401
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,445
MED VOLUNTEER SERVICE

402
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,613
-Are you doing well?
-Yes.

403
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,785
VIETNAM WAR

404
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,919
VIETNAM WAR

405
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:30,977
Melioidosis.

406
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,438
MELIOIDOSIS: CAUSED BY EXPOSURE
TO CONTAMINATED SOIL OR WATER

407
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,773
It has a long incubation period.

408
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,901
-If it was Vietnam, it'll be melioidosis.
-By melioidosis,

409
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,986
do you mean Whitmore's disease?

410
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,698
-Yes, Whitmore's disease.
-That bacteria lay dormant for 44 years?

411
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,742
In one patient,
it appeared after 63 years.

412
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,162
That patient had contracted it
during the Second World War.

413
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,080
Dr. Cha's right.

414
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,626
It lies dormant for a long time,
but symptoms appear all over,

415
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,960
making it hard to diagnose.

416
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,463
Most patients aren't diagnosed
until they turn septic.

417
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,007
It's almost non-contagious,

418
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,218
but the fatality rate is high,
at 40 percent.

419
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,480
What is it?

420
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,192
We need a definite diagnosis.

421
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,153
If we can identify an infection,
then it's definitely melioidosis.

422
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,562
His ears.

423
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,106
That could explain
the sudden hearing loss.

424
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,776
It's suppurative otitis media
caused by generalized infection.

425
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,612
There's already infection,
we need to make a definite diagnosis

426
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,905
and start treatment right away.

427
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,283
We can't do a diagnostic test here.

428
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,035
But we need to hurry
before it develops into sepsis.

429
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,918
Time is running out. Time

430
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,975
This afternoon, another suspected
Nipah virus patient was reported.

431
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,935
The patient is said to be
a 68-year-old man.

432
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,813
The hospital requested
a diagnostic test immediately.

433
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,816
According to the KCDC,
the result will be out by midnight,

434
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,443
which will attract much attention.

435
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,701
Yes. Is the result out?

436
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,997
-Are you okay?
-Coming through!

437
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,892
Father.

438
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,481
Yes, it's Kang Mi-rae.

439
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,777
You'll be fine after the tests
and the treatment.

440
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,327
-Please take good care of him.
-Sure.

441
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,120
Let's go.

442
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,926
Good work, everyone.
Thanks for your cooperation.

443
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,761
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

444
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,513
Thank you.

445
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,473
Dr. Kang Mi-rae.

446
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,393
You played the biggest role today.

447
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,149
The only role I played today
was being the priest's acquaintance.

448
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,778
Sometimes, rather than us who see
the patient with machines,

449
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,740
a friend who saw the life
the patient lived

450
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,492
is a better doctor.

451
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,373
Do you thinkâ€¦

452
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,168
Jun will be okay?

453
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,678
A penalty or lawsuit.

454
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,722
I'll accept anything.

455
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:40,018
And most importantly,
your phantom limb painâ€¦

456
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,731
I'll do my best to cure it.

457
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,316
Can it be cured?

458
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,281
Ms. Lee.

459
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,324
Do you see the holes?

460
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,953
Put your arms in them.

461
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,087
I'll open the box.

462
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,772
You said your amputated
right arm feels paralyzed.

463
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,149
Yes.

464
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:35,114
-It's as if it's clenched.
-You'll open up that fist now.

465
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,411
First, clench your left hand into a fist.

466
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,837
Look into the mirror and open the fist.

467
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,097
It's open.

468
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,143
How is this possible?

469
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,481
I opened the hand I don't have.

470
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,569
Now fold your fingers one by one.

471
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,573
Yes. Well done.

472
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,574
Melioidosis?

473
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,492
Yes.

474
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,205
Any delay and he'd have turned septic
and would've likely died.

475
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,751
What would've happened
if Dr. Cha wasn't there?

476
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,089
-Director?
-Exactly.

477
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:38,928
Dr. Cha diagnosed him
without any machines,

478
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,513
just by looking over the patient?

479
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,017
Yes.

480
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,019
What?

481
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,188
Right now?

482
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,190
Okay.

483
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,776
Reporters are at Pain Management.

484
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,446
They want to know what the man had
if it wasn't the Nipah virus.

485
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,377
Prepare for a briefing and call Dr. Cha.

486
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,005
-Pardon?
-A doctor who risked his life

487
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,631
by entering a quarantined area

488
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,385
and identified a virus that
had been dormant for over 40 years.

489
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,472
How can we not take advantage
of this rare situation?

490
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,360
What are you doing?

491
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,780
-The patient--
-Keep quiet and come with me.

492
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,381
Sit down.

493
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,642
I said sit down.

494
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,051
No fever.

495
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,179
-I'll check your BP.
-I'll do it.

496
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,598
I'll do it. Lift your arm.

497
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,088
It's normal.

498
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,385
I'll check your pulse.

499
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,388
-I'll do it after seeing the patient.
-I'll do it, so stay still!

500
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,025
What's the problem?

501
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,953
I couldn't do anything.

502
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,748
You were next to an infected patient.

503
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,500
I was worried sick,

504
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,253
but what made me feel worse
was that I was afraid,

505
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,421
but you seemed happy.

506
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,426
I know that you'll never change.

507
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,931
That you'll think only about your patient
until your fingers are bruised.

508
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,434
So I plan to change.

509
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,856
I'll try to understand you.

510
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,735
You said I can't understand you.

511
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,071
No.

512
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,740
I can.

513
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,789
What is it about?

514
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
You got it.

515
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,551
You look great. That's good, isn't it?

516
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,188
Keep looking.

517
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,072
-What will you do?
-What do you mean?

518
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,200
You couldn't have brought it
just to show me.

519
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,870
-If you let it go with its cast--
-It'll stay at my place

520
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,831
-until the cast comes off.
-Really?

521
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,708
Yes, really. Why? Don't you believe me?

522
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,671
You don't seem like the type
to foster a stray cat.

523
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,214
My gosh.

524
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,886
Since when did you offer
free medical services?

525
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,596
Since I was in medical school.

526
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,598
I followed the chief around.

527
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,976
She volunteers too?

528
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,603
She went to Africa many times.

529
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,649
So she is the kind of person
I made her out to be.

530
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,443
-What kind is that?
-The warrior type.

531
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,487
Capable and charismatic.

532
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,947
And a humanitarian too.

533
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,869
-Are you teasing me?
-Teasing you?

534
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,706
None of the staff like her much.

535
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,459
Why not? I think she's
a rare and admirable type.

536
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,295
-Do you really?
-Really.

537
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,513
How?

538
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,641
Like you.

539
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,688
You don't feel pain,
but you understand a patient's suffering.

540
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,773
I'll do the same.

541
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,859
Just like you,

542
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,570
I'll try to understand you.

543
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,661
Why did you laugh?

544
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,748
Sorry. I'm not laughing at you.

545
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:54,094
I can't understand a patient's suffering.

546
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,892
All I do is analyze and study like crazy.

547
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,854
I imagine as best I can
and I think about it.

548
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,775
You'll do the same, butâ€¦

549
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,112
to know and to understand are different.

550
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:19,870
I monitor myself with security cameras
and check my body like this.

551
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,041
The pain of having to do that
every single day without fail,

552
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,002
you can't understand that.

553
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,882
Why would you do something so hard?
Why would you do what's impossible?

554
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,342
You can't do it.

555
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,929
Don't bother.

556
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,473
You'll only exhaust yourself.

557
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:44,937
See you.

558
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,281
See you tomorrow.

559
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,021
Not long ago, Dr. Cha made headlines

560
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,273
by diagnosing
Joo Hyung-woo's myasthenia gravis.

561
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,359
And for the first time in history,

562
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,862
he identified
a CIPA patient's central sensitization.

563
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,574
And today, despite everyone's dissuasion,

564
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:42,786
he entered a quarantined area
without any medical devices

565
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,541
and identified the melioidosis bacteria
that had been dormant for 44 years.

566
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,128
Can you explain what melioidosis is?

567
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,839
I'd like to know
how it's contracted and treated.

568
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:58,469
We asked Dr. Cha Yo-han to be here,
so he can tell you.

569
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,157
-He can't come? Why not?
-He's in the ICU.

570
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,534
-What for?
-To see the melioidosis patient.

571
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,161
Right now?

572
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,916
Is he crazy? Where are his priorities?
Get him right now.

573
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,633
Dr. Cha needs a little more time.
Please bear with us.

574
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,260
Yes? Go ahead.

575
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:45,057
Isn't Cha Yo-han the anesthesiologist
who was imprisoned

576
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,267
for euthanizing a patient three years ago?

577
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,770
I thought he just had the same name,

578
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,480
but he's in the same field.

579
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,774
Is it the same person?

580
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,077
Doctor.

581
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,747
-How do you feel?
-It's so quiet.

582
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:14,086
The pounding sound that came from my head
is gone now,

583
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,756
and the confusion I felt for over 40 years

584
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,050
has settled too.

585
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,927
Good.

586
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,263
You'll be fine now.

587
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,348
The deity.

588
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,477
He did give us life.

589
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,524
And He is also the being that punishes us.

590
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,778
But what you said is right.

591
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,365
He doesn't abandon us

592
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,659
when we're in pain.

593
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:58,839
Yes.

594
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,384
Dr. Cha Yo-han is the doctor
from three years ago.

595
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,596
-Wasn't his license revoked?
-Was he penalized?

596
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,181
Was he given any special favors?

597
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,266
How did he end up working here?

598
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,435
There are no irregularities
with his appointment.

599
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,731
Seoul Hanse Medical Center hired Dr. Cha
because of his great skills as a doctor.

600
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,984
There were no biases or prejudicesâ€¦

601
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,195
I guess Cha Yo-han won't be showing up.

602
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,034
-Say hello.
-Hello.

603
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,494
-Hello.
-Hello.

604
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,245
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

605
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,165
Sir. This is the friend I told you about.

606
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,834
-Oh, I see. How are you?
-Hello.

607
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,295
-Go ahead.
-I'll wait for you.

608
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:39,963
I won't be long.

609
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,799
-Oh, that must be her.
-Hello.

610
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,643
VOLUNTEER WORKER

611
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,729
Hello. Welcome. We were waiting for you.

612
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,274
-How was the drive here?
-I'm glad you came.

613
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,071
Let's go inside.

614
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,963
DEATH TALKS,
DEATH ENDS EVERY LIFE

615
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,841
Hello. It's nice to see you all.

616
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,886
Let's introduce ourselves.

617
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,975
Hello. My ID is Oasis74.

618
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,812
I have stage four breast cancer
and I'm a mom of two.

619
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:41,567
The cancer spread to my bones
and it's unlikely I'll recover.

620
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,445
I lost all my hair
after 36 cycles of chemo,

621
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,698
so I'm wearing a wig.

622
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,952
Hello.

623
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,289
My ID is Scissorhands.
I have stage three colon cancer.

624
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,832
Just todayâ€¦

625
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,128
I was told it spread to my liver.

626
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,714
I threw my phone in rage.

627
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,592
Look at it now.

628
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,345
Would you like to say hello?

629
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,145
Hello, Iâ€¦

630
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,523
found out about this gathering today.

631
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,360
-I don't have an ID.
-That's okay.

632
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,406
What illness do you have?

633
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,996
I have stage three stomach cancer.

634
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,042
You were at Seoul Hanse Medical Center,
weren't you?

635
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,421
I'm glad you're here.

636
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,384
One of our guests
made an arduous trip to join us.

637
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,761
Will you say hello?

638
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,640
Hello.

639
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,850
I haveâ€¦

640
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,064
something called olfactory neuroblastoma.

641
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,484
It's malignant, and in my case,
it's terminal.

642
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
In two months

643
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,780
or maybeâ€¦

644
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,033
in a month, I'll be dead.

645
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,204
I heard that people here talk about death

646
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,082
to get over the fear.

647
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,168
To tell you the truth, dyingâ€¦

648
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,129
doesn't scare me.

649
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:33,303
Then is there any other kind
of assistance you want from us?

650
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,555
I heard one of your members

651
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:40,977
went to Switzerland not long ago.

652
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:45,565
I heard about the assisted suicide.

653
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,363
I came here todayâ€¦

654
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,493
-to hear about thatâ€¦
-Just a moment.

655
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,579
That's a touchy subject.

656
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,999
Where and how did you hear aboutâ€¦

657
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,421
Miss?

658
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,258
Miss?

659
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,845
-Can someone call 119?
-Is she okay?

660
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,472
-I'll call for help.
-Wake up.

661
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,141
578 HYDRANGEA, LEE X EUN

662
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,893
NURSE IN CHARGE: CHAE EUN-JEONG

663
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,188
I gave you more painkillers.
Sleep well tonight.

664
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,276
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

665
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,486
Sleep well.

666
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,545
Did you see the news?

667
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,549
Yes. Dr. Cha scored again.

668
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,677
We must put a stop to him.

669
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,512
Have you forgotten?

670
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,390
Even the deity
wanted to punish Yoon Seong-kyu,

671
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,934
and Cha Yo-han, a mere human,
saved him from suffering.

672
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,062
Yoon Seong-kyu should've died

673
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,815
suffering more
with the hope of a clinical trial.

674
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,443
You wouldn't know

675
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,989
how I got him to sign the consent form.

676
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,200
There was somethingâ€¦

677
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,078
I needed to hear from Yoon Seong-kyu.

678
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:30,670
Why he'd done something that dreadful
to my Jeong-in and Seung-yoo.

679
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,256
What those kids did wrong.

680
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,550
Do you remember how you asked me

681
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,680
to get Yoon Seong-kyu the death penalty?

682
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,016
"I could ask for the death penalty

683
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,312
or I could stab him myself,
but I won't becauseâ€¦

684
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,357
murder is illegal

685
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,902
and there can be no exceptions."

686
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,986
That still stands.

687
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,242
I do this work because I think it's right.
I don't do it for personal reasons.

688
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,410
You're a parent before a prosecutor.

689
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,497
Do principles come before
a criminal who killed children

690
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,626
and have you no personal feelings
for Cha Yo-han who gave him an easy death?

691
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,712
Stabbing Yoon Seong-kyu
and revoking Cha Yo-han's license

692
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,589
won't change the world.

693
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,341
The law that stops them,

694
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,802
the law that punishes themâ€¦

695
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,807
that is what changes the world.

696
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,315
Cha Yo-han

697
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,277
will stop himself.

698
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,699
We just need to wait
for him to meet a patient

699
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,952
who only has pain and death left.

700
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,765
I'll try to understand you.

701
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:11,479
You don't feel pain,
but you understand a patient's suffering.

702
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,273
Just like you,

703
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,401
I'll try to understand you.

704
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,041
You'll do the same.

705
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,419
You'll study and analyze
my disease as much as you can.

706
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,254
Butâ€¦

707
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,883
to know and to understand are different.

708
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,097
Mommy.

709
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,660
Are you okay, honey? Does it hurt?

710
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,827
It hurts too much.

711
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,542
-Gosh. It hurts.
-Why?

712
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,505
What's wrong, Mom?
Are you not feeling well?

713
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,094
-I'm okay.
-Should I call a nurse?

714
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,811
You can't understand that.

715
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,192
Why would you do something so hard?
Why would you do what's impossible?

716
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,780
You can't do it.

717
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,954
Parents can't suffer
in their children's stead.

718
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,541
Husbands can't suffer
in their wives' stead.

719
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,086
Children can't suffer
in their parents' stead.

720
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,215
No matter how desperately
they pray for that.

721
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,469
It's not just you.

722
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:12,225
No human being can feel
others' pain like their own.

723
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,604
All they can ever do is try to understand.

724
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,359
To understand a person's pain

725
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,696
is to understand that person.

726
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,702
What I'm trying to understand
is not your disease.

727
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,457
The person who has been suffering
because of the disease,

728
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,000
Cha Yo-han.

729
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,086
That's who I'm trying to understand.

730
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,153
Dr. Cha.

731
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,389
-Don't worry too much.
-Okay.

732
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,682
-See you.
-Bye.

733
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,646
We all need that person.

734
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,399
Even though no one can
suffer in our stead,

735
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,111
we need a person who can understand
and share our suffering.

736
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,574
You have been that person to your patients

737
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,245
while you have been suffering all alone.

738
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,458
So?

739
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,586
Do you feel sorry for me?

740
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,338
No.

741
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,842
Like you always feel excessive empathy
with patients,

742
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,386
is this also a sense
of responsibility as a doctor

743
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,388
now that you found out about my disease?

744
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,265
No.

745
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,142
Then why?

746
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,186
If it's neither pity

747
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,564
nor a sense of responsibility, why?

748
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:07,942
I like you.

749
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,032
Iâ€¦

750
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,619
like you.

751
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,473
Please.

752
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,517
Oh, Dr. Cha.

753
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,688
Reporters, this is Dr. Cha Yo-han
of our Pain Management Department.

754
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,729
I'll keep an eye on Cha Yo-han
and Kang Si-young.

755
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,689
Okay.

756
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,483
Why aren't you saying anything
about yesterday?

757
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,903
Is it time now?

758
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,573
We'll discuss life-prolonging treatment
for Chairman Kang.

759
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,496
You're working late, Dr. Cha.
