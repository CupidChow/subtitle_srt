1
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,081
You can choose how much time
you have left.

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,128
Give up being a doctor
and you'll live longer.

4
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,175
Choose to be a doctor and you must risk
all the time you have left.

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,220
Is your career as a doctor
your whole life?

6
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,782
We have to pull ourselves together.

7
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,410
Coming through. Let us through.

8
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,375
-Coming through!
-Excuse me!

9
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,003
-This way. How is she?
-There's no breathing.

10
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,172
The oxygen saturation level is 78.

11
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,133
Because of the nasal bleeding,
intubation will be difficult.

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,638
You don't feel pain.

13
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,849
How do you feel about patients who do?

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,894
Do you feel pity?

15
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,231
Or is it curiosity?

16
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,486
Ri-hye. It's your sister. Ri-hye.

17
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm sorry, but you can't enter.

18
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,624
Now let's see your son.

19
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,854
Do you think we did the right thing?

20
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,607
She jumped from the rooftop
because she wanted to die.

21
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,776
Do you think it's right...

22
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,697
to save her like this?

23
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,031
We're not her friend.

24
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,451
We're in no position to consider
whether she wants to live or not.

25
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,328
We're doctors.

26
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,539
But I'm also a little worried.

27
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,626
If, by any chance, she wrote
an advance directive beforehand,

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,503
the intubation might end up
becoming a problem.

29
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,715
Are you saying
we shouldn't have done anything?

30
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,633
No, that's not what I mean.

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,554
-I don't know what's right.
-Let's report this to Dr. Cha.

32
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,079
Yoo Ri-hye?

33
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,540
How's her condition?

34
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,295
Take her to the ICU.

35
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,130
Okay, I'll be right there.

36
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,093
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

37
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,947
PROSECUTOR SON SEOK-KI

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,580
I heard the patient has a son.

39
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,167
No mother would think of dying
when she has a son.

40
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,004
That means something motivated her
to jump from the rooftop.

41
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,132
I have a feeling

42
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,302
that this will not end here.

43
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,695
We have a problem. Yoo Ri-hye.

44
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,780
What is it now?

45
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,741
Someone turned off her ventilator.

46
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,869
What? Who?

47
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,915
Who did that?

48
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,625
Well…

49
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,461
Right when the nurse discovered
that her ventilator was turned off,

50
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:00,300
there was someone standing
right next to her in the ICU.

51
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,467
Who are you?

52
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,194
-Dr. Cha?
-Yes.

53
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,824
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,871
-What are you talking about?
-The entire ICU is a mess.

55
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,081
Someone called the police,
so they're on their way here.

56
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,875
How could that happen?

57
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,546
Who did it?

58
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,924
Who do you think? Isn't it obvious?

59
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,469
Dr. Kwon,
please don't jump to conclusions.

60
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,347
We should hold an investigation,
not just guess who it was.

61
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,599
Yes, you're right.
The police are already on their way.

62
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,934
The police are on their way here.
The police!

63
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,811
Director Kang, please calm down.

64
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,313
How do you expect me to calm down

65
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,273
when someone turned off
a patient's ventilator?

66
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,069
This is clearly attempted murder.

67
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,280
We should be thankful
that she was still breathing.

68
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,949
This could've turned into a murder case.

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,369
The professor in charge
of this patient is Cha Yo-han.

70
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,955
And the doctor in charge is Kang Si-young.
You all know that, right?

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,750
I want you to order everyone
to cooperate with the investigation.

72
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm going to pay close attention

73
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,588
to the investigation results.

74
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,302
I knew something like this
was going to happen one day.

75
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,847
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,976
Should I call Si-young and Mi-rae?
Should I ask them if they know anything?

77
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,814
Things will become a lot more serious
if they actually do know something.

78
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,360
Send Dr. Cha to the legal team.
Hurry up before the cops get here.

79
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,058
You can't go inside.

80
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,609
-Si-young.
-Aunt Joo-kyung.

81
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,784
Dr. Cha is with the legal team.

82
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,536
The legal team?

83
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,330
Chief Min sent him to Mr. Han.

84
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,459
You guys don't know anything about this,
right?

85
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,504
What about Yoo Ri-hye?

86
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,298
We moved her to the general ward for now.

87
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,924
Thanks, Aunt.

88
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,931
MICU, RESTRICTED AREA

89
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,109
PATIENT: YOO RI X,
DOCTORS: CHA YO-HAN, KANG SI-YOUNG

90
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,573
-Is this the ventilator?
-Yes.

91
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm Min Tae-kyung,
the chief of Anesthesiology.

92
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,498
Hello, chief.

93
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,334
I'm Lieutenant Kim Jung-rok
from Gangnam Police Station.

94
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,130
We moved Yoo Ri-hye to the general ward.

95
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,966
-How's her condition?
-She's breathing on her own,

96
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,510
and she's unconscious.

97
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,846
Can you explain to us
what happened in detail?

98
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,972
Well…

99
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,434
It happened right when
visiting hours were over in the ICU.

100
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,686
What time are people allowed to visit?

101
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,439
At our hospital,
it's from 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.

102
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,359
But Yoo Ri-hye didn't get any visitors
in the afternoon.

103
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,819
But it's when other people
were allowed inside.

104
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,822
So please continue
to explain everything in detail.

105
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,159
Who are you here to visit?

106
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,204
The nurses let the visitors inside
after we ask who they're visiting

107
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,623
-and how they're related to the patient.
-You may go inside.

108
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,542
-You don't keep a record?
-No.

109
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,671
That's when things get really hectic
in the ICU.

110
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,258
And earlier today, as soon as we let
the visitors inside…

111
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,884
-Mom.
-Mom, what's wrong?

112
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,386
-Mom.
-Things were even more hectic

113
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,263
because there was a code blue.

114
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,977
Yoo Ri-hye was in Room 2

115
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,104
which is right in front of the station,

116
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,065
but it's hard to look inside
because the table's a little high.

117
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,778
Even so, how could you not notice
that her ventilator was turned off?

118
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,613
Isn't there an alarm for that?

119
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,781
I'll answer that question.

120
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,075
An alarm goes off
when there's a problem with her vitals.

121
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,869
But the patient was able to breathe
without a ventilator,

122
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,747
so the machine didn't detect any symptoms,
and that's probably why

123
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,709
-the alarm didn't go off.
Yes, she's right.

124
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,336
Then how did you find out
that the ventilator was turned off?

125
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,257
Like I told you,
visiting hours end at 5 p.m.

126
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,301
So I went inside her room

127
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,804
to replace the antibiotics
after all the visitors had left.

128
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,354
And that's when I saw Dr. Cha
from Pain Management

129
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,608
standing next to the ventilator
that was turned off.

130
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,197
Are there no CCTVs
inside the hospital rooms?

131
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,449
No.

132
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,077
It's against the rules to install CCTVs
in hospital rooms.

133
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,833
Go to the security room
and check all the CCTV footage.

134
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,794
Check all the doctors and visitors
that entered the ICU.

135
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,630
-Yes, sir.
-Officer Park, follow me.

136
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,797
-Yes.
-Let's go.

137
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,677
You won't even tell me?

138
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,721
The police are here.

139
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,390
You wouldn't have done it
without a guardian's consent,

140
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,434
but why can't you say you didn't do it?

141
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,813
-You know something, don't you?
-Can I leave?

142
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,274
You'll stay silent?

143
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,527
There must be a reason you won't speak.

144
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,322
Okay, then. Until the truth is out,
don't say anything.

145
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,239
No.

146
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,035
I'll answer all questions honestly
like I did three years ago.

147
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,830
Dr. Cha. Dr. Cha.

148
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,249
Dr. Cha.

149
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,716
Dr. Cha.

150
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,349
Kang Si-young.

151
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,151
I promise.

152
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,325
We meet again, Dr. Cha Yo-han.

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,252
Guess what.

154
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,714
After I investigated you three years ago,

155
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,884
all medical accidents and incidents
end up on my desk.

156
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,387
Take a seat.

157
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,558
I'm halfway to being a doctor.

158
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:11,147
Whenever anyone in my station feels sick,
they come to me first.

159
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,110
Are you expecting someone else?

160
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,779
Who'd you say is in charge
of the investigation?

161
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,449
It's getting more complicated
than I thought.

162
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,872
As of now, all questioning
and gathering of information

163
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,959
will be headed and done
by Prosecutor Son Seok-ki.

164
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,018
Take care of it.

165
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,936
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,524
POLICE

167
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,700
You should've listened to me.

168
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,953
I warned you.

169
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,081
Don't you remember?

170
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,668
What I want is only one thing.

171
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,881
For you to do nothing.

172
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,843
Do not do anything.

173
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,056
If a doctor does nothing,

174
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,934
two things happen to a patient.

175
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,936
They suffer dreadful pain,

176
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,605
or suffer and then die.

177
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,527
So today, you did something.

178
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,078
Shall we begin then?

179
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,333
This investigation is about
the attempted murder of Yoo Ri-hye.

180
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,838
Cha Yo-han has a right to refuse to speak,
and any statement he gives

181
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,965
can become proof of guilt.

182
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,178
Is there anything you wish to say
before we start?

183
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,267
-No.
-I want to ask you something.

184
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,770
From about noon
to the time of the incident,

185
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,189
for about four hours, you were absent.

186
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,858
I was on sick leave.

187
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,776
Are you sick?

188
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
I don't want to answer.

189
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,072
You are sick. What a pity.

190
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,868
It's a pity that I'm not sick enough
for you to worry about.

191
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:37,334
Anyway, it's true that you were away
until right before the incident.

192
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,170
-Is that it?
-That's correct.

193
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,717
It reminds me of that day,
three years ago.

194
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,137
The first time I sat across from you.

195
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,725
If anything is different
from that day, today,

196
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,728
your team members

197
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,355
will be questioned as witnesses.

198
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,862
Yes. This is how terrifying contagion is.

199
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,160
Kang Si-young.

200
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,997
If anything happens to me,
you'll be the first to hear.

201
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,043
Because you're the one I'll contact first.

202
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,086
I promise.

203
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,798
Don't worry, Dr. Cha.

204
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,967
I trust you.

205
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,264
What will you do?

206
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,646
"Do you think Dr. Cha
turned off the ventilator?"

207
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,523
If the police ask,

208
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,400
what will you say?

209
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,990
Do we have to tell them that too?

210
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,118
That we offered to grant
Yoo Ri-hye a wish.

211
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,036
What about it?

212
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,080
Because of what we said,

213
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,499
she had hope that she'd see her son.

214
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,250
When that fell through...

215
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,711
she jumped.

216
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,758
That's unrelated
to this ventilator incident.

217
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,719
None of us turned it off.

218
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,687
We're keeping an eye on her.
For now, her vitals are stable.

219
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,940
You don't know
when she'll regain consciousness?

220
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,484
No. We must wait and see.

221
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,711
HANSE WISH CLUB

222
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,468
HANSE WISH CLUB

223
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,264
Hello.

224
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,606
At around 5:05 p.m., you were at the scene
right after the suspected time

225
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,983
of the incident.

226
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,068
-In Yoo Ri-hye's room.
-Yes.

227
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,739
-Why were you there?
-To see the patient.

228
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,199
I'd heard she had jumped
and was concerned.

229
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,244
When and whom
did you get that report from?

230
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,206
I informed Dr. Cha about it
around 4:45 p.m.

231
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,000
There's the call history.

232
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,085
DR. CHA YO-HAN

233
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,129
You were told around 4:45 p.m.

234
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,090
and arrived at the hospital
around 4:50 p.m. Is that right?

235
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,967
Yes.

236
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,094
Did you go straight to the ICU?

237
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,305
No.

238
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,932
Then?

239
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,061
Upon my arrival,

240
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,646
I saw the site where she'd landed.

241
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,236
POLICE

242
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,908
I went straight up to the roof.

243
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,326
The roof?

244
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,496
You came out of concern for the patient,

245
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,124
so why did you first go to the roof
instead of the ICU?

246
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,753
He's not a fool.

247
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,590
-Me?
-Dr. Cha.

248
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,926
Who do you think
people would suspect the most?

249
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,221
Even if he wasn't at the scene,

250
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,724
he has euthanized his patient before.

251
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,227
He knows he'd be suspected,

252
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,395
so he turned it off then denied it?

253
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,231
Do you think he's a fool?

254
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,442
I don't think

255
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
he turned it off...

256
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,696
-It's not him.
-Then who is it?

257
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,740
Do you suspect someone?

258
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,909
No, but…

259
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,036
HANSE WISH CLUB

260
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,623
Answer.

261
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,252
Why did you go to the roof
and what did you do?

262
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,184
I looked up at the sky.

263
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,984
DANGER OF FALLING

264
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,170
And then…

265
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,881
I looked at the ground.

266
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,342
You looked at the sky and the ground?

267
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,600
-What was there?
-The patient.

268
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
Right before she jumped.

269
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,771
You're saying that
you stood where she stood

270
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,525
and empathized with the patient?

271
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,236
After you did that,

272
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,991
you must've wanted to do what she wanted.

273
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,995
What did the patient want?

274
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,915
You agreed to grant her wish.

275
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,417
Her son.

276
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,586
She wanted to see her son.

277
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,506
When she was unable to see her son,
she decided to jump,

278
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,469
and then her next wish
was that you help her die?

279
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,058
How badly did she want to die
that she jumped from this height?

280
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,019
Once you had empathized with that,

281
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,897
you went to the ICU?

282
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,025
It's true that I headed there
from the rooftop.

283
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,360
And the time was

284
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,071
-5--
-5:05 p.m.

285
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,865
That's the exact time when
her ventilator was turned off.

286
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,369
It's also the time when someone
attempted to murder her.

287
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,922
For the first time,
I was truly impressed with Dr. Cha.

288
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,008
When we were performing intubation on her,

289
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,511
I didn't know whether or not…

290
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,265
we should do it.

291
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,684
-But?
-But Dr. Cha

292
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,397
endured everything three years ago
and allowed the patient to die.

293
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,110
Just so you know,
I'm definitely not saying

294
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,320
that Dr. Cha was the one
who turned off the ventilator.

295
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,908
When you had arrived there,
the ventilator was already off?

296
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,618
Yes.

297
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,413
And it was a coincidence
that you arrived there

298
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,457
at the exact time and place
where the crime was committed?

299
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,751
Yes.

300
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,630
All right, then.
Let's say that you're right.

301
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,007
I have one more question.

302
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,342
That will be the last question
I'll receive for today.

303
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,262
Says who?

304
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,639
I'm a bit tired.

305
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,143
This isn't a formal interrogation.

306
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,811
Would you like it to be?

307
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,356
Be my guest, but do bring a warrant.

308
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,909
Fine. This will be the last time
you'll give an answer.

309
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,162
But it's not because you're tired.

310
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,956
It's because there is only one more thing

311
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,584
that I am curious about.

312
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,090
-It's murder.
-Sorry?

313
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,177
My father is bedridden in this hospital.

314
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,637
He's also on a ventilator.

315
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,807
But if someone

316
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,769
were to turn it off
without my family's approval,

317
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,937
that would be downright murder.

318
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,108
We didn't have Yoo Ri-hye's
guardian's consent,

319
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,694
although there was more than
enough time to get it.

320
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,366
I believe that there is no reason
for Dr. Cha to turn it off

321
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,618
behind her guardian's back.

322
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,585
She was in extreme pain
and didn't have much time left.

323
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,215
The ventilator was connected to her
despite her refusal to prolong her life.

324
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,510
Let's say

325
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,221
that when you had arrived there,
the ventilator was still on.

326
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,516
Then what would you…

327
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,894
have done?

328
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,357
What did you just say?

329
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,984
All of this happened…

330
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,738
because of me.

331
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,241
What do you mean?

332
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
To tell you the truth…

333
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,128
Hello? Did you check it?

334
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,756
Okay.

335
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
We can confirm it ourselves.

336
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,681
We can find out if the truth
you're hesitant to reveal

337
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,891
is recorded on the CCTV cameras or not.

338
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:15,245
They finished checking the CCTV footage.
We'll continue after checking it.

339
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,805
Are you okay?

340
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,683
What did you tell them?

341
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,811
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,106
What are you sorry about?

343
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,735
This all happened because of me.

344
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,321
That's not true.

345
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,908
How may I help you?

346
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,826
We're not receiving any patients today.

347
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,162
I came to meet the doctors.

348
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:08,215
Ri-hye is easily frightened.

349
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,219
To think that someone like her
jumped off the building…

350
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,597
I'm not sure if I should…

351
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,185
hold on to her
when she is so desperate to let go.

352
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,400
I know…

353
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,532
that she already signed a DNR.

DOCUMENT EXPRESSING PATIENT'S DESIRE
NOT TO PROLONG THEIR LIFE

355
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,703
If her condition worsens...

356
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,624
I'd like…

357
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,920
to just let her go.

358
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,883
We understand.

359
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,930
We'll make sure
she doesn't suffer anymore.

360
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,480
Is her son not coming after all?

361
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,985
I didn't know it'd be this difficult…

362
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,530
to hold her one and only son's hand
just once.

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,409
I can't believe she won't be able

364
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,287
to see him before she leaves.

365
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,053
This is her being moved to the ICU
after falling.

366
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,390
This is the estimated time
of the crime, around 5 p.m.

367
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,018
Cha Yo-han is heading toward the ICU.

368
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,981
-After that…
-Hold on.

369
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,400
Could you go back?

370
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,450
Why…

371
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,202
is he running?

372
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,122
-Sorry?
-Why is he running if he is

373
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,374
on his way to turn off the ventilator?

374
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,502
It's as if he's on his way
to rescue a critical patient.

375
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,300
I'd like to see all the previous footage.

376
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,802
I want to know from when,
and why he's running.

377
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,563
If you wish for us not to intervene

378
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,232
by performing CPR or intubation

379
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,360
the next time she is distressed,

380
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,446
you must sign an agreement.

381
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,157
Please come with me.

382
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,871
-Doctor.
-What is it?

383
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,790
Yoo Ri-hye is having an arrest.

384
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,833
CARDIAC ARREST: LOSS OF HEART FUNCTION

385
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,257
Doctor, please…

386
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,592
Okay.

387
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,390
Yoo Ri-hye is experiencing code blue.

388
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,070
Her heart rate is dropping
and so is her saturation.

389
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,083
She signed a DNR.

390

DOCUMENT EXPRESSING THE PATIENT'S
DESIRE NOT TO PROLONG THEIR LIFE

391
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,056
Dr. Cha.

392
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,517
Please stop.

393
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,103
She signed a DNR.

394
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,272
Her guardian gave her consent as well.
You must stop.

395
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,742
YOO NA-YEON, I GIVE MY CONSENT
TO YOO RI-HYE'S DNR

396
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,211
May I see…

397
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,881
her last moments?

398
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,550
Of course. This way, ma'am.

399
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,513
MIN-SEONG'S DAD

400
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,391
Excuse me for a minute.

401
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,226
Hello?

402
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,189
What? What happened to him?

403
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,570
What are you saying?
Are you saying that you lied?

404
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,366
He's at the hospital?

405
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,578
I'm bringing in the emergency kit.
Please make way.

406
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,038
Excuse me.

407
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,624
Dr. Cha, you can't do this.

408
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,459
Get the intubation ready.

409
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,920
Increase the amount of epinephrine
every three minutes.

410
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,093
Ambu bag.

411
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,972
Please prepare the Ambu bag.

412
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,078
It wasn't that

413
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,163
-the kid didn't want to come.
-Then?

414
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,958
Her ex-husband refused to send him,
claiming that he'd be shocked.

415
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,379
After she jumped off the rooftop,
I called him in a fit of rage.

416
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,131
Her son heard everything.

417
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,760
He even heard that his mom was
about to die in the ICU.

418
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,387
Let's go.

419
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,472
He didn't return home after his lesson.

420
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,724
His father thinks he came to the hospital.

421
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,351
Where in the world could he be?

422
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,441
WAITING ROOM

423
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,002
Have you seen this boy?

424
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,753
No, I haven't.

425
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,214
-Have you?
-No, I haven't.

426
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,219
Have you seen this boy?

427
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,679
No, I haven't.

428
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,489
Are you Min-seong?

429
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,663
Min-seong.

430
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,750
Are you here to see your mom?

431
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,840
Let's go.

432
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,384
I think we should hurry.

433
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,978
Don't just stand there. Intubate, now!

434
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,775
What are you doing? Let her go.

435
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,819
Not like this.

436
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,698
There's something she and I must do.

437
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,991
She can't go yet.

438
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,290
That's him.

439
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,542
That's the boy.

440
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,087
On the camera, with Cha Yo-han.

441
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,756
-What's the matter?
-That boy.

442
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,466
Is he Yoo Ri-hye's son?

443
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,803
Yes. What is this about?

444
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,931
I must check something.

445
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,648
Please.

446
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,409
Not yet.

447
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,329
Please.

448
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,728
Kid. What are you doing here?

449
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,522
Saying goodbye to Mom.

450
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,274
Your mom?

451
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:32,278
My mom went to the afterlife.

452
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,989
A short while ago.

453
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,704
Do you know what place it's like?

454
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,791
No.

455
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,127
I don't know yet.

456
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,754
Then,

457
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,590
do you know what death is?

458
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,260
Not really.

459
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,014
"When do you think someone dies?

460
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,684
When a bullet pierces their heart?"

461
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,770
"No."

462
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,023
"When they have an incurable illness?"

463
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,109
"No."

464
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,070
"When they eat toadstool soup?"

465
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,280
"No."

466
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,993
Then when does someone die?

467
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,331
When they're forgotten
by their loved ones.

468
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,043
That's what they said in the movie Coco.

469
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,968
So I won't ever forget her.

470
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,731
My mom.

471
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,610
The prettiest person in the world.

472
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,030
Isn't she pretty?

473
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,876
Are you…

474
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,628
Yoo Ri-hye's son?

475
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,591
Yes. Do you know my mom?

476
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,218
I do.

477
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,975
What do you mean that
she went to the afterlife?

478
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,811
The afterlife…

479
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,690
is where people you love go.

480
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,693
My grandmother.

481
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,737
My grandfather.

482
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,282
And my mom.

483
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,994
But…

484
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,623
-your mom hasn't--
-A while ago,

485
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,335
she crossed over.

486
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,430
Come this way.

487
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,584
-Mother!
-Mom!

488
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,336
-What's wrong?
-Mom.

489
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,754
-Mom.
-Wake up.

490
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,049
-Mom!
-Do you hear me?

491
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,634
Wake up. Mom!

492
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,928
-Mother. Mother!
-Mom!

493
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,555
We can administer CPR,

494
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,307
or we can give medication.

495
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,017
If we give her medication,

496
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,187
how much longer can my mom survive?

497
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,482
I can't say for sure,

498
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,568
but she won't last for too long.

499
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,614
Mom.

500
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,491
Do you hear me?

501
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,789
My mom…

502
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,543
I don't want her to die
attached to machines…

503
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,463
or drugged out of her mind.

504
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,305
I'd like to give her peace.

505
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,142
Mom. Mom.

506
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,979
You fought hard.

507
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
Mom.

508
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,488
I love you, Mom.

509
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:47,950
Mom.

510
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,286
We should let her go.

511
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,176
Mom.

512
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,641
Mom.

513
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,436
Goodbye.

514
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,953
My mom was very sick.

515
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,654
Her face looked…

516
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,532
-bad.
-Mom.

517
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,243
It looked very bad.

518
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,702
Mom.

519
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,583
Mom. Mom.

520
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,588
Aunt said to Dad

521
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,508
that Mom was in too much pain.

522
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,719
She suffered so much

523
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,390
that she jumped off the roof.

524
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,732
That's why I…

525
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,962
Min-seong, do you want to see Mom?

526
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,424
I'm sure she wants to see you too.

527
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,384
She'd love to give you a hug.

528
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,681
For one last time

529
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,516
before she leaves.

530
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,771
Let's go to Mom.

531
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,447
Stay here. I'll come get you.

532
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,305
Who are you?

533
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,404
Mom.

534
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,784
No way.

535
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,663
Mom.

536
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,209
Please open your eyes.

537
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,546
Please.

538
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,549
Please.

539
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,186
Defibrillator and intubation!

540
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,111
Here's the defibrillator.

541
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,406
I'll take care of the Ambu bag.

542
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,070
-How's the rhythm?
-She's in V-fib.

543
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,864
V-FIB: VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION

544
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,823
Defibrillator.

545
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,910
Charge 200 joules.

546
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,954
Charged.

547
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,248
Step back.

548
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,083
Shock.

549
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,467
Check the rhythm.

550
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,761
She's still in V-fib.

551
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
Charge 200 joules.

552
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,974
-Charged.
-Step back.

553
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,018
Shock.

554
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,277
Please.

555
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,738
-Check the rhythm.
-It's back.

556
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,274
Do you want to see Mom?

557
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,320
Go to her.

558
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,746
Mom.

559
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,136
Mom.

560
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,609
Mom.

561
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,617
Mom.

562
00:45:55,794 --> 00:46:01,175
You didn't turn off her ventilator,
but you rushed to turn it back on.

563
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,058
Why didn't you say that
from the beginning?

564
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,483
I didn't think the first thing
she'd find out when she woke up

565
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,404
should be that her son
was being investigated by the police

566
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,658
for turning off her ventilator.

567
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,667
Mom!

568
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,061
Mom.

569
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,158
You also didn't think

570
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,245
that the son should feel guilty
about his mom's death

571
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,747
for the rest of his life?

572
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,377
Is that why you stalled for time
until the patient woke up?

573
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,294
Yes.

574
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,632
You would never let even a child
get away with doing this.

575
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,679
I am, of course, ready to be punished
for obstruction of justice.

576
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,556
I'm clearly at fault there.

577
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,114
I read a book yesterday.

578
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,117
It said something like this.

579
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,371
"The ultimate goal of medicine
is to make people happy.

580
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,418
And simply reducing pain
or prolonging life through medicine

581
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,503
does not guarantee people's happiness."

582
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,005
Do you agree?

583
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,219
What do you think is the role of doctors?

584
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,560
The continuous development of medicine

585
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:21,648
lets a person stay alive
without being actually alive.

586
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,276
The line between life and death
becomes blurrier and blurrier.

587
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,114
More than ever, we need people
who make a righteous decision on life.

588
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,827
We need people who determine
what is most beneficial to patients.

589
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,455
I believe that's a doctor's duty.

590
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,042
A righteous decision on life?

591
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,252
Is euthanasia a part of it?

592
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,253
Of course.

593
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,089
Are you saying death
could be a righteous option?

594
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,008
In this day and age,

595
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,260
death could be a righteous option.

596
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,472
Like you said, there's a thin line
between life and death these days.

597
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,974
If someone is given the right
to decide on that,

598
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,768
that right will become an authority,

599
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,269
and that authority

600
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,981
will become corrupt and abused.

601
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,067
With people's lives on the line, at that.

602
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,569
After that,

603
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,155
a life

604
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,741
that has been sacrificed…

605
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,913
will never be able to return.

606
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:29,758
Death isn't always the righteous option.

607
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:34,930
All that I'm doing is striving
to determine what's best for the patient

608
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,014
until the end,

609
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,601
when the decision between
life and death must be made.

610
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,272
And the law determines whether or not
your decision is righteous.

611
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,608
No law can satisfy everyone.

612
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,403
Just like how no medical treatment
can satisfy all patients.

613
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,030
When it comes to both the law
and medical treatment,

614
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,325
we need to determine what's the most
valuable thing during that time.

615
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,484
-Sir.
-Yes?

616
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,946
This is regarding Dr. Kang Si-young.

617
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,031
Right.

618
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,533
This is her testimony on Dr. Cha.

619
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,327
She mentioned her father.

620
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,166
I see. Thank you.

621
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,919
-Oh, right. Could I see that notebook?
-Sure.

622
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,900
Could you look into what this means?

623
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,401
Sure.

624
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,819
-Thank you.
-No problem.

625
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,207
If that was the case,
he should've told them sooner.

626
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,917
Why did he have to make matters worse?

627
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,043
On top of that…

628
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,090
we're in a sensitive situation
regarding Chairman Kang.

629
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,592
This shouldn't have happened.

630
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,015
We should convene
a disciplinary committee.

631
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,935
A hospital has its own order and rules.

632
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,730
Dr. Cha's actions weren't suitable
as the patient's doctor

633
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,274
or as the trainees' professor.

634
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,985
He stirred up trouble.

635
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,114
Are you planning to make him
leave the hospital for the time being

636
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,533
-by convening the disciplinary committee?
-Yes.

637
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,411
I think that's the best solution for now.

638
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,087
That boy won't be punished, will he?

639
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,548
He's only eight,

640
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,591
so I doubt he will be.

641
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,263
There were extenuating circumstances.

642
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,516
It was only possible since he was eight.

643
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,812
He had no idea that he could've been
punished for doing so.

644
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,249
Thank you, everyone.

645
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,628
Thank you for not giving up on her.

646
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,842
Dr. Cha is the one
who didn't give up on her.

647
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,094
-But he's not here right now.
-I see.

648
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,513
I'm going to thank him myself.

649
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,599
I heard she regained consciousness.

650
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,184
How is she doing?

651
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:13,231
She told me that she'd like to move
to a hospice once she recovers.

652
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,986
She'd like to spend her last days there.

653
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,340
HANSE WISH CLUB

654
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,076
You said I didn't feel any pain.

655
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,913
You were curious about my feelings
toward my patients.

656
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,544
You wondered if it was curiosity

657
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,297
or pity.

658
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,261
Today,

659
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,805
I found my answer.

660
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,939
It's neither pity nor curiosity.

661
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,278
It's empathy.

662
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,959
Everyone is afraid of death,

663
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,712
whether they can feel pain

664
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,340
or not.

665
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,136
During those fearful last moments,

666
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,474
I'd like to be next to them.

667
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,820
Dr. Cha.

668
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,837
Tell me.

669
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,299
Tell me how you are doing.

670
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,679
I know it wasn't just because
of Yoo Ri-hye.

671
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,895
Wait.

672
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,110
If you're okay,

673
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,946
and it's nothing serious…

674
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,533
please nod.

675
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,752
If you're not okay

676
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,714
but it will get better soon,

677
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,051
please nod.

678
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,437
If you're not okay...

679
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,234
and won't get better either…

680
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,283
Then what should I do?

681
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,424
Comfort me.

682
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,304
I'm the one

683
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,639
who should be comforted.

684
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,645
But I'm the one who will be losing you.

685
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,854
Why is your pulse so fast?
Do you feel dizzy?

686
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,607
My heart is pounding fast.

687
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,783
If this gets out,
no hospital will take Cha Yo-han.

688
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,660
What did you hear?

689
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,329
One of Death Talks' members
was reported missing.

690
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,831
She's missing?

691
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,585
Do you think they can work with us?
