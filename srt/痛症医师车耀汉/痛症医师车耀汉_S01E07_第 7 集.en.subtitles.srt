1
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,160
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,664
Yoo-joon.

3
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,668
Why is your professor
and everyone else so good-looking?

4
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,838
I thought you were the only charming one.

5
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,215
Thank you for today.
You should go home and rest.

6
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,675
Don't mention it.

7
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,095
-Tell them to visit often.
-I will.

8
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,787
Are you going home well?

9
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,371
Yes.

10
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,043
You're right.
The guardians go through the most.

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,463
But people don't know that. Goodness.

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,257
DUMPLINGS AND PORK TROTTERS

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,803
My father collapsed due to a stroke
in his 40s.

14
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,972
He was bedridden for more
than a decade before passing away.

15
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,685
Because of that, I don't have
much recollection of him.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,147
I only remember the scent of a patient.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,361
I left home because I didn't want
to smell that.

18
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,739
But I'm now working at a place
that's full of that smell.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,119
Did I become a doctor
because of him, you ask?

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,747
-Not at all.
-Then?

21
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,458
Because of a guardian

22
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,961
like my mother.

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,381
I want to lessen

24
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,883
the guardians' burdens.

25
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,055
I know how tough it is.

26
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,938
Hang in there, okay?

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,731
You can do this.

28
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,986
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,531
For what?

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,992
I didn't

31
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,829
get to thank your mother for the food.

32
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,960
All right. Food is energy!

33
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,546
I'll thank her for you.

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,089
Get home safely.

35
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,828
"Cha Yo-han"?

36
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,791
He can break his bones
and rupture his organs.

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,418
But he still won't feel any pain.

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,255
It's congenital insensitivity
to pain with anhidrosis.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,759
He's a CIPA patient.

40
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,139
I have a ticking bomb inside me.

41
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,975
And patients like me rarely
live longer than 20 years.

42
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,853
You have no idea
what it's like to feel nothing.

43
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,649
That's why you can tell me
to go back to that life so easily!

44
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,819
He doesn't have to freeze,
but he feels no warmth either.

45
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,947
That's what living without senses is like.

46
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,407
Neither cold nor hot.

47
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,118
Not only ice cream

48
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,497
but his whole life would be that way.

49
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,240
It's not true, is it?

50
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,452
Tell me it's not true, Dr. Cha.

51
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,426
When I was 12,

52
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,472
my dad suddenly collapsed
after vomiting blood.

53
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,976
I called 119.

54
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,230
They asked where the pain was.

55
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,732
I don't know.

56
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,275
I told them I didn't know.

57
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,152
Even if I do ask, he doesn't know.

58
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,820
He doesn't know!

59
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,240
Even my dad doesn't know where it hurts!

60
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,663
My dad could not feel
the pain in his body.

61
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,083
I…

62
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,462
have the same condition as him.

63
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,299
Is this

64
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,343
a record of your body condition?

65
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,054
It's a survival method.

66
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,432
I constantly monitor my body
that does not speak.

67
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,978
-You have no fever.
-Can you chart it?

68
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,147
I said you have no fever.
Why would I chart it?

69
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,024
Can you check my pulse too?

70
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,359
Do you have hypochondria?

71
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,695
Temperature, pulse, respiration,
blood pressure…

72
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,697
Why do you check them every day?

73
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,324
Is that

74
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,163
also why you were checking
your vital signs every day?

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,086
You're the first person
to find out about my condition.

76
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,132
In other words, my condition
has been a secret until now,

77
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,095
and you're the first one to uncover it.

78
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,726
Can you…

79
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,938
keep the secret?

80
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,358
Why is it a secret?

81
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,236
A ticking bomb.

82
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,825
A doctor who has
a ticking bomb inside him.

83
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,328
What kind of hospital
would want to hire him?

84
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,624
Once my condition gets revealed,
I can't treat patients anymore.

85
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,667
Ever.

86
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,676
Think about if you can handle it
and let me know.

87
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,055
There are three kinds of people
in this world.

88
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,478
Those who are sick,
those who are going to be sick,

89
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,855
and…

90
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,316
the third kind is people like me.

91
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,070
Those who can't feel any pain.

92
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,553
SECRETS AND LIES

PAIN MEDICINE

00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,558
CONGENITAL INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN
WITH ANHIDROSIS

95
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,879
Introduce sample now.

96
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,673
Remove sample now.

97
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,550
Closed down.

98
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,177
CLOSE SAMPLE COVER

99
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,721
ANALYSIS COMPLETE

100
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
You shouldn't move.

101
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,963
Come here. No, no, it's okay.

102
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,551
It's okay. Come here.

103
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,803
No, don't move. It's okay.

104
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,642
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

105
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,684
Let me see.

106
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,607
It's not deep, but it must be
cleaned and dressed.

107
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Let's go.

108
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,778
No.

109
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,323
-You go ahead.
-Why?

110
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,784
-It's hurt.
-So let's go.

111
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,578
Not me. The kitten.

112
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,750
Its leg's broken.

113
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,210
If I leave it here,

114
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,629
other cats or people will harm it.

115
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,717
Okay.

116
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,594
It's coming too.

117
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,977
Take this.

118
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,819
Watch out.

119
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,828
A cold? Oh, dear.

120
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,583
Are you allergic to cat fur?

121
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,254
Then why are you looking after a cat?

122
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,882
Why are you yelling at me?

123
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,926
You should know better. I don't get it.

124
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,637
If it gets serious, your airways…

125
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,101
MALGEUN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

126
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,769
Hand it over.

127
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,855
I'll see you at work.

128
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,357
Why? I'll come along.

129
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,153
A lot of hospital staff live around here.

130
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,572
I don't want them to get ideas.

131
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,741
Who would get ideas? What kind of?

132
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,660
Anyway, don't tell anyone about today.

133
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,834
Dr. Cha?

134
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,212
Thank you. For everything.

135
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,470
MALGEUN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

136
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,223
Hello, Doctor.

137
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,529
What are you doing?

138
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,493
Your clothes are the same.
Did you not go home?

139
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,411
Well…

140
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,791
-Are you waiting for someone?
-What?

141
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,502
No. Who would I wait for?

142
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,046
Dr. Cha?

143
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,881
Hello, Dr. Cha.

144
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,345
Bingo. You're waiting for him.

145
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,556
Why are you teasing me? Is it fun?

146
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,102
What? If you're waiting for Dr. Cha,
I was just going to tell you

147
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,270
not to bother. He's not coming in.

148
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,439
Why not? Why isn't he coming in?

149
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,693
He called in sick.
He'll come in the afternoon.

150
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
He called in sick?

151
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,532
Please leave a message after the beep.

152
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,785
DR. CHA YO-HAN

153
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,838
The conference is about to start.
Where are you?

154
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,185
Doctor.

155
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,312
Hello, ma'am.

156
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,815
I brought some snacks for your team.

157
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,111
-Share it among yourselves.
-No, ma'am. We can't accept such gifts.

158
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,863
Thanks for the thought.

159
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,699
There's nothing I can do for you but this.

160
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,578
I especially don't know
how to thank Dr. Cha.

161
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,539
He'll think he did his duty.

162
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,756
Would you call this part of your duty?

163
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,432
AS SOON AS YOU FIND THIS PATIENT,

Whenever I hear that sound,

167
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,153
my heart starts to pound.
I wonder if my son's inside.

-What are you doing here?
-Doctor.

178
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,189
You're sick. What's the matter?

179
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,109
Are you hurt? Is it an external injury?

180
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,694
Do you have a fever too?

181
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,487
What's this about?

182
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,032
You called in sick.
I thought something was wrong.

183
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,701
I'm perfectly fine.

184
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,037
Then why did you call in sick?

185
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,747
I had a regular checkup.

186
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,418
Why didn't you answer your phone?

187
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,795
I called and texted you so many times!

188
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,880
You called?

189
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,675
33 MISSED CALLS FROM KANG SI-YOUNG

190
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,552
What's this? 33 calls?

191
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,264
Don't put your phone on vibrate!

192
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,725
What's the point of having a phone?

193
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,518
You suddenly called in sick,

194
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,228
didn't answer your phone

195
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,521
or reply to my texts.

196
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,481
-How am I not to worry?
-Hello.

197
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,360
Kang Si-young. You're going overboard.

198
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,030
Overboard? You call this going overboard?

199
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,826
Come inside, unless
you want to start a rumor.

200
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,746
Oh, dear.

201
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,233
Put these on.

202
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,742
Wait while I get changed.

203
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,561
Go on inside.

204
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,665
-Do you want tea?
-No.

205
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,294
-I'll do it.
-But…

206
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,629
Don't touch anything hot. Be careful.

207
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,299
Where's the kettle?

208
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,010
It's not in there.

209
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,762
No, up there.

210
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,015
In here?

211
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,939
Where's the tea?

212
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,317
In the top drawer.

213
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,618
Where's the water?

214
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,871
Down there.

215
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,587
What about the conference?

216
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,839
The conference isn't a problem.

217
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,841
Then what is?

218
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,555
I read about it for the first time
in medical school.

219
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,769
Usually, patients like you die
from high fever before three.

220
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,981
Those who have survived die before 25.

221
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,610
Due to infections, poisoning,
and external injuries,

222
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,529
their everyday lives put them
in great danger.

223
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,783
It wouldn't be odd for you
to collapse right now.

224
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,160
So am I still overreacting?

225
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,122
How did you

226
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,000
live up until now?

227
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,129
How are you currently living?

228
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,408
Follow me.

229
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,313
I keep my vitals

230
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,358
and oxygen saturation in check
while I go to bed.

231
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,903
I maintain the room temperature
at 18 degrees Celsius.

232
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,408
And this.

233
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,495
This helps me know what
I've been doing while sleeping.

234
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,376
I could rub my eyes until I rip my cornea

235
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,045
or bite too hard on my tongue.

236
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,091
Even if such incidents happen,
I wouldn't know.

237
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,017
This is how I've been living all my life.

238
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,395
But for me, this is normal.

239
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,398
Just like how it's normal

240
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,484
for you to brush your teeth
and wash your face before going to bed.

241
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,112
So don't worry too much.

242
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,575
If anyone finds out about this
because of your excessive concern,

243
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,161
this will all fall apart.

244
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,414
It will put an end to all that I've done

245
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,209
in order to save myself and my patients.

246
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,759
PROSECUTOR SON SEOK-KI

247
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,352
You were in charge of Dr. Cha's case?

248
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,686
Sorry? Oh, yes.

249
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,564
I should've told you sooner.

250
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,274
Are you here to see him?

251
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,569
You are quite incredible.

252
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,198
Ever since Dr. Cha came to this hospital,

253
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,824
he's been doing excellent.

254
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,077
I bet it's all thanks to you,

255
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,120
who had a keen eye and hired him.

256
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,125
He didn't suddenly acquire
such skills after coming here.

257
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,669
He was always that competent.

258
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,129
Someone recommended him to me,
so I hired him.

259
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,674
Lee Won-gil, the former
Minister of Health and Welfare.

260
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,467
Were you aware of that?

261
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,886
No, I just found out.

262
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,520
You have amazing observation skills.

263
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,065
But does it matter who recommended him?

264
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,817
Of course.

265
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,070
For you, Dr. Cha may just be

266
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,281
a competent doctor. But for me,

267
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,908
he's someone I had indicted myself.

268
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,619
He's a potential criminal
who is more than capable

269
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,914
of repeating his crime.

270
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,386
I can keep

271
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,265
your secret for as long as possible.

272
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,269
But don't you know what a hospital is?

273
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,690
It's where patients gather
and where contagious diseases are.

274
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,942
It's the most dangerous place for you.

275
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,403
-So?
-Sure, you've been to a place

276
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,030
that was more dangerous.

277
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,989
The penitentiary.

278
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,825
It's a miracle that you spent
the past three years in a place

279
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,494
where you couldn't receive
proper checkups.

280
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,954
So?

281
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,623
But you will never stop.

282
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,877
I can't fathom how far you'll go or do.

283
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,004
You're unpredictable.

284
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,255
So?

285
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,717
I'm afraid.

286
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,221
You're surrounded by danger,

287
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,141
yet you refuse to be selfish.

288
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,394
That's why I'm afraid.

289
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,688
I'm scared

290
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,484
that you'll be gone forever

291
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,403
from the hospital,

292
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,781
the patients,

293
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,950
-and…
-Why does that matter?

294
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,953
There are many other doctors.

295
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,747
Fine.

296
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,709
I get that you see me
as both a doctor and a patient.

297
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,296
That's why you're getting
emotionally attached.

298
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,550
-But don't do that.
-You said I should.

299
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,428
You said being emotionally attached
to my patients wasn't bad.

300
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,973
You told me to hear them out
and sense their feelings.

301
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,642
Am I your patient?

302
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,318
DR. SHIM

303
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,029
Speak of the devil.
It's my doctor in charge.

304
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,157
Hello?

305
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,246
You should leave.
I need to receive my checkup.

306
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,455
Dr. Cha.

307
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,127
Don't try to understand me.

308
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,503
You won't be able to.

309
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,630
Not now. Not ever.

310
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,843
Go. I'll see you at the hospital.

ANESTHESIOLOGY AND PAIN MANAGEMENT

314
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,886
He must be famous to appear on TV.

315
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,222
He is, indeed.

316
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,990
Is that so?

317
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,743
But seeing how you're still seeing him,

318
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,538
I guess you trust him.

319
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,460
For those who are against it,
I'm sure he's not trustworthy.

320
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,714
But I'm not against it.
If anything, I'm all for it.

321
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,639
By the way, are you ill?

322
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,600
I can see it.

323
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,565
I've been ill for a long time,

324
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,150
so I know one when I see one.

325
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,241

326
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,201
Here.

327
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,829
Visit this place.

328
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,373
It's worth it.

Are you ill?

332
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,647
You've been coming here often.

333
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,150
Yes, apparently, I am.

334
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,823
Thanks for your concern.

335
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,075
It's over already.

336
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,833
I'd appreciate it if you stopped
visiting his workplace.

337
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,421
And please don't treat him
like a potential criminal.

338
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,258
Everyone says it's over.

339
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,762
But what is over, really?

340
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,558
Do you think Yoon Seong-kyu
was the only patient of his kind?

341
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,394
If Dr. Cha met another patient like him,

342
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,730
would he make a different choice?

343
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,609
I beg to differ.

344
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,618
Why do you think
death was born into this world?

345
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,413
To hurt me.

346
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,125
That's right. To scare me.

347
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,962
To steal my sibling from me.

348
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,548
To take me

349
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,719
and make my mom sad.

350
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,485
Bye.

362
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,077
Don't die as you wish.

363
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,122
You have no right

364
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,042
to die.

GYEONGSEO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

366
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,061
You see,

367
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,397
when I look at your scans,

368
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,401
I feel like they're the scans
of all the patients you've tended to.

369
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,239
It looks like your patients ate up
your body one by one.

370
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,826
-Is my condition that bad today?
-The results aren't out yet.

371
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,412
I'll contact you once they come out,
so you can go home.

372
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,501
Go on. My patients are waiting.

373
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,004
Fine, I'll go.

374
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,050
What about a guardian?

375
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,970
Do you still not have one?

376
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,976
Find one. You need someone by your side.

377
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,104
Why would I put someone through that?

378

DEPARTMENT OF NEUROLOGY

379
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,545
Don't try to understand me.

380
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,797
You won't be able to.

381
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,467
Not now. Not ever.

382
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,846
Am I your patient?

383
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,063
No.

384
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,024
You're not my patient.

SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

386
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,045
We have a newsflash.

387
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,546
Doctors have confirmed

388
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,091
the first Nipah virus patient in Korea.

389
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,343
The Nipah virus can infect

390
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,011
both animals and humans.

391
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,640
In India last month,
out of 13 confirmed patients,

392
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,934
ten patients died.

393
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,145
Since the first Nipah virus patient
was confirmed, health authorities

394
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,231
will carry out a large-scale
investigation.

395
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,025
The Nipah virus causes
high fevers of over 38 degrees Celsius,

396
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,194
headaches, and nausea.

397
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,531
It can be spread through secretions
or bodily fluids.

398
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,701
Korea Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention are investigating people

399
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,119
who had contact with the patient.

400
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,956
If you show symptoms
within two weeks of visiting India,

401
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,875
visit your nearest health center.

402
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,253
This is next.

SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

409
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,228
What's this?

410
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,483
"Warning of Nipah virus infection"?

411
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,737
Hello.

412
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,912
-Have some snacks.
-My goodness.

413
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,332
Homemade avocado sandwiches?

414
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,919
Avocados aren't fattening, right?

415
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,838
Of course not. Avocados aren't fattening.

416
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,800
It'll fatten you up, though.

417
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,554
It's fine. Just eat.

418
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,392
What's that? The Nipah virus?

419
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,061
Oh, did you see this?
There's an announcement.

420
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,021
No. Not yet.

421
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,193
What is this?

422
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,696
"The country's first confirmed
Nipah virus patient"?

423
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,867
Dr. Lee.

424
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,162
The operation just ended.

425
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,165
It must have gone well.

426
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,167
The cat just woke up from anesthesia.

427
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,086
Can I go take a look?

428
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,588
I'll be back
before the outpatient clinic starts.

429
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,137
Fine. But this is the last time
you'll visit the vet.

430
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,181
-From now on, it'll be my job.
-Why?

431
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,268
You're allergic.
You can't keep going to the vet.

432
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,894
Forget about it.

433
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,109
Don't get the wrong idea though.

434
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,783
Me?

435
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,785
Why are you blushing?

436
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,705
Don't tell anyone that I let you go.

437
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,165
Wait.

438
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,048
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

439
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:10,968
Hello.

440
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,237
Let me check something.

441
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,489
Okay.

442
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,658
LEE DA-HAE, PAIN IN THE RIGHT ARM

443
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,581

PAIN MANAGEMENT-
PAIN IN THE RIGHT ARM AFTER SURGERY

445
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,341
No way.

446
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,518
Patients keep coming in,
and we're short-handed.

447
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,270
Let's do preliminary exams
before Dr. Cha arrives.

448
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:07,066
Dr. Kim and Dr. Kang, you can start.
Dr. Heo, prepare the treatment room…

449
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,068
Dr. Heo.

450
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,362
Let's go prepare the treatment room.

451
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,363
Okay.

452
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,952
Ms. Lee Da-hae and Ms. Lee Ji-yeon.

453
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,411
Please come in.

454
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,257
Hello. You're Ms. Lee Da-hae, right?

455
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,299
Yes.

456
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,927
How are you feeling?

457
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,848
I had surgery on my right arm
at this hospital last year.

458
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,530
The surgery went well.

459
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,658
And the test results seem fine.

460
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,244
This might sound strange,

461
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,456
but I have a terrible pain
in my right arm which doesn't exist.

462
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,458
Could you describe your pain?

463
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,338
It feels as if I'm clenching
my right hand all the time.

464
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,384
It's like I'm getting cramps.

465
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,096
The pain would stop
if I opened my right hand,

466
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,016
but as you can see, I can't do that.

467
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,137
Could it have happened then?

468
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,363
Do you want to eat something?

469
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,701
Let me go get some food. Stay here.

470
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,496
Where's my purse?

471
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,250
So-jin, stay here for a second.

472
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,592
Mr. Yu Deok-kyu, please come in.

473
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,138
Mr. Yu Deok-kyu!

474
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,473
Yes.

475
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,816
Hello.

476
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,153
How are you feeling?

477
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,572
Since about a year ago…

478
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,830
I've had bad headaches.

479
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:13,919
-Can you describe your pain?
-It feels like my head is about to split.

480
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,004
Some days,

481
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,967
it almost feels like someone is hammering

482
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,261
a nail into my head.

483
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:27,433
Sometimes, it feels like
someone is drilling into my head.

484
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,687
You must be getting poor sleep.

485
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,689
Yes, exactly.

486
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,065
PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST,
BRAIN CT, BRAIN MRI

487
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,069
These days, even if I get
the slightest sign of a headache,

488
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,655
I become terrified.

489
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,243
NO ABNORMALITIES IN BRAIN PARENCHYMA,
VENTRICLE, OR CALVARIUM

490
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,539
NO ABRNOMAL ENHANCEMENT
AFTER INJECTION

491
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,917
The MRI and CT scans of your brain
show no abnormalities.

492
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,381
-You've visited many hospitals.
-Yes.

493
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,092
Eight in total.

494
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,304
But none of them

495
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,973
were able to find

496
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,767
the cause of my headaches.

497
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,523
-When did the coughing start?
-A few days ago.

498
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,943
Whenever I cough,

499
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,404
I feel a pain in my chest.

500
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,032
Let's see if you have a fever.

501
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:30,370
My breath feels so hot.

502
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,084
It's 39.5 degrees, Doctor.

503
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,924
I think I have a fever too.

504
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,550
Let me check.

505
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,229
It's 38.6 degrees.

506
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,900
I sat next to that man
on the shuttle bus here.

507
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,278
After that, I started running a fever.

508
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,159
Are there any other symptoms
apart from that?

509
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,038
I've been vomiting for several days.

510
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,333
Have you been abroad recently?

511
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,668
No.

512
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,046
I haven't been on a plane
in more than 40 years.

513
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,091
But last week,

514
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,054
I did have a meal with someone
who had recently been

515
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,681
on a business trip abroad.

516
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,891
-Where did he go?
-India.

517
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:35,769
Just a second.

518
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,357
Dr. Kang, just a second.

519
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,279
A high fever, headaches, and vomiting.

520
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,655
Could it be…

521
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,035
-No way.
-There has been

522
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,037
a confirmed Nipah virus patient.

523
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,000
Doctor.

524
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,712
This kid's mother is away for a moment,
and she's running a high fever.

525
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,342
She's burning up.

526
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,345
She was on the same shuttle bus earlier.

527
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,849
Has it already spread?

528
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,350
That's impossible.

529
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,979
It's supposed to be latent for more
than five days. This is too fast.

530
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,609
Are you okay?

531
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,626
What happened?

532
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,671
Dr. Kang.

533
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,567
The center has to be shut down.

534
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,777
Shut down?

535
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,529
We'll follow the hospital's own protocol.

536
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,617
First, we'll isolate the suspected patient
in the treatment room.

537
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,118
Okay.

538
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,163
And then we'll ask Chief Min
to prepare protection gear.

539
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,876
Also, the suspected patient met someone
last week who had visited India.

540
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,463
We have to check his symptoms as well.
Ask the KCDC for help.

541
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:38,892
Shouldn't we wait for Dr. Cha
before shutting down the center?

542
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,143
Dr. Cha?

543
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,229
We have to get moving right now. Go.

544
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,689
Hurry.

545
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,315
No.

546
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,610
Dr. Cha should never come in here.

547
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,084
DR. KANG SI-YOUNG

548
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,928
-No, no, no.
-What are you doing?

549
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,514
What are you doing? I have to leave.

550
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,560
-Why did you lock the door?
-Just a moment, please.

551
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,146
-Dr. Cha. You can't come in.
-What?

552
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,440
-Why?
-What's going on?

553
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,108
What are you doing?

554
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,985
As of this moment,

555
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,945
none of you can leave.

556
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,280
-What?
-Why not?

557
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,740
I have to go.

558
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,033
Kim Won-hee. What's going on?

559
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,411
What's going on?

560
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,498
ISOLATED WARD, DO NOT ENTER

561
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,791
Cure us first.

562
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,960
What do you know?

563
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,632
We must check the facilities.
Please cooperate.

564
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,593
What's the matter?

565
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,303
I can't stay here.

566
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,555
Don't worry and come on inside.

567
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,140
Are we okay?

568
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,350
They're being rude.

569
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,894
Excuse us.

570
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,354
Please go over there.

571
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,731
Thank you.

572
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,983
Go over there.

573
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,410
What's wrong?

574
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,413
What's going on?

575
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,379
There are 19 patients
in the Pain Management Center.

576
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,091
There's a fellow, two residents,
and two nurses. A total of five staff.

577
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,220
We sent in hazmat suits
and safety equipment.

578
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,264
The KDCA will send over an investigator.

579
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,060
-How will you confirm the diagnosis?
-Through blood tests and throat swabs.

580
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,022
-The results take less than six hours.
-It takes that long?

581
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,399
That won't do. Dr. Kwon, go in there.

582
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,777
What? Why should I go in there?

583
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,696
There is only one fellow
and two residents.

584
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,198
There's a suspected patient.

585
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,034
-What if there's an emergency?
-Don't tell me that.

586
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,787
If you're that worried,
go in there yourself.

587
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,205
No one can go inside.

588
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,042
The Nipah virus has no cure,

589
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,962
and it is highly lethal and contagious.

590
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,465
Until everyone's confirmed negative
and isolation's unnecessary,

591
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,801
no one can go into the center

592
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,469
or come out.

593
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,139
-What's going on?
-I was told to leave.

594
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,558
How's the suspected patient?

595
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,977
He's quarantined in the treatment room.

596
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,316
-Dr. Kang, are you all right?
-Yes.

597
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,152
Dr. Kang? Which Dr. Kang are you…

598
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,160
Did something happen to Kang Si-young?

599
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,000
The suspected patient
coughed up blood onto her face.

600
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,381
What's the matter?

601
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,722
Is something wrong?

602
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,183
A suspected Nipah virus patient is inside.

603
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,477
The center's on lockdown.

604
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,078
FREE FROM ILLNESSES, KCDC

605
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,247
Get all the equipment.

612
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,515
-Did you leave Korea?
-No.

613
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:44,406

KCDC, DO NOT ENTER

616
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,014
The Nipah virus?

617
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,851
The symptoms are similar to those of the
flu or enteritis. We have to run tests.

618
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,562
I'll draw some blood and swab your throat.

619
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,646
Okay.

620
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,735
DR. CHA YO-HAN

621
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,199
-Dr. Cha.
-Are you with the patient?

622
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,827
Yes. Where are you?

623
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,496
You're not inside, are you?

624
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,373
I'm outside the door.

625
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,125
You can't come in.

626
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,753
Don't even stay outside.

627
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,339
-Stay as far away as you can.
-How are you?

628
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,257
Pardon?

629
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,967
You got blood on your face.

630
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,804
I'm fine.

631
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,060
The hazmat suit. Are you wearing one?

632
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,020
Yes, I am.

633
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,481
How's the patient?

634
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,818
He's stable now
but having trouble breathing.

635
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,280
And Doctor, a few other patients here

636
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,407
have fevers and nausea.

637
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,202
They were on the same bus as my patient.

638
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,912
Can it spread this quickly?

639
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,207
If so, then the other patients will soon--

640
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,124
Kang Si-young.

641
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:20,919
Yes?

642
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,546
You're with a suspected patient.

643
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,384
The others are at high risk
with struggling immune systems.

644
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,763
The worst-case scenario here
is that this patient's confirmed

645
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,390
and spreads the virus
to the other patients.

646
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,727
But we don't know for sure
until the results come back.

647
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,355
Until then, don't think about the worst.

648
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,650
Instead, think about
the less serious outcomes.

649
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,193
The less serious outcomes?

650
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,446
For example, what if this patient
shows the Nipah virus symptoms

651
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,949
but has an illness that isn't contagious?

652
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,951
Is that possible?

653
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,373
Do you remember the patient
with a 0.00001 percent probability?

654
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,084
-Yes.
-Let's do what we did then.

655
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,465
You can do it. You and I, together.

656
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,886
Okay. Yes, doctor.

657
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,931
Good, then start over.

658
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,683
Why did the patient come in?

659
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,395
He had chronic headaches, fatigue,
and lack of appetite for over a year.

660
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,397
After meeting a friend
who'd been to India,

661
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,649
he started to cough,
vomit, and run a fever.

662
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,318
Headaches, coughing, vomiting, and fever
are Nipah virus symptoms,

663
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,237
but not the loss of appetite.

664
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,323
If he had headaches
and fatigue for over a year,

665
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,075
it could be something else.

666
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,910
Let's run some tests.

667
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,705
Okay. I'll ask the KCDC to run a PCR test

668
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,748
and do basic tests including CBC.

00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,083
Good. Did you listen to his breathing?

673
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,252
Yes. It didn't sound good.

674
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,630
-Do a chest X-ray.
-Okay.

675
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,051
Sir.

676
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,096
Dr. Cha. His pulse went up to 200.

677
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,182
-Inject Brevibloc.
-Okay.

679
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,575
How is he?

680
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,330
It's dropping.

681
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,041
Sir, what's wrong?

682
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,084
My chest.

683
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,505
My chest. It feels like
something's crushing it.

684
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,176
Dr. Cha, he feels pressure on his chest.

685
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,844
I'll take an X-ray.

686
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,681
Sir. Can you get up slowly?

687
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,479
We'll take a chest X-ray.

688
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,731
-Move over here slowly.
-Okay.

689
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,250
-Sir.
-What's wrong?

690
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,962
-The patient's acting strange.
-How so?

691
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,173
It's like he lost his sense of direction.

692
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,760
Check him quickly.
What other symptoms does he have?

693
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,637
Sir, sit over here.

694
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
Is he paralyzed?

695
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,600
How are your arms? Do you feel this?

696
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,934
Yes.

697
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,146
Do you feel this?

698
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,898
He hasn't gone numb.

699
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,818
Is it disorientation?

700
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,946
-Then check if…
-My gosh. Sir!

701
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,491
Sir.

702
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,833
What's that noise?

703
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,586
Kang Si-young.

704
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,837
What's wrong, Doctor?

705
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,091
Kang Si-young? Kang Si-young.

706
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,053
Answer me, Si-young.

707
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,686
Call Dr. Lee now.

708
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,165
I apologize.

709
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,043
I'm Dr. Cha Yo-han from Pain Management.

710
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:17,382
I'd like to see what's going on
in the treatment room that's on lockdown.

711
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,724
Dr. Kang!

712
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,518
What's the matter?

713
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,269
What is it?

714
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:33,314
Dr. Kang is in the treatment room
with one of the patients.

715
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,775
-We suddenly lost contact.
-What?

716
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,446
Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang!

717
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,783
-Dr. Kang Mi-rae?
-Yes?

718
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,620
Dr. Kang Si-young's unconscious.

719
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,663
Dr. Kang!

720
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,967
DR. KANG MI-RAE

721
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,385
Sir. Sir!

722
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,304
Sir.

723
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,432
Sir. Sir!

724
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:08,933
Sir!

725
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:15,064
DR. CHA YO-HAN

726
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,566
Doctor. Sir!

727
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,942
Inject 10cc of thiopental.

728
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,026
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANT

729
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,111
Sorry?

730
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,990
I'm in the security office. I have
you on the camera. Inject it now.

731
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,305
I'll inject it.

732
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,611
Please.

733
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,237
Well?

734
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,072
He's stabilizing.

735
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,825
Okay. How is Dr. Kang?

736
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,957
Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang.

737
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,424
Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang.

738
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,135
She's still unconscious.

739
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,181
Okay.

740
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,809
Doctor. Doctor?

741
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,562
Thank you.

742
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,243
Dr. Kang.

743
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,080
Dr. Kang.

744
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,041
Dr. Kang!

745
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,586
Dr. Kang.

746
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,306
KCDC

747
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,409
How's the patient?

748
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,744
The seizures stopped.

749
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,290
-Check his condition.
-Okay.

750
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:40,877
Kang Si-young.

751
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:44,714
Are you awake?

752
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,384
Dr. Cha.

753
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,640
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG KYUNG-SOON

754
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:12,617
Regardless of the result, Dr. Cha entered
the center and he must be punished for it.

755
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,243
What we must do now is…

756
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,496
Before his condition gets worse,
diagnose him.

757
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,373
Is his name Yu Deok-kyu?

758
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,710
-Do you know him?
-I killed a person.

759
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,213
My arm hurts so much.

760
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,299
You're a parent before a prosecutor.

761
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,468
Do you have no feelings
towards Cha Yo-han?

762
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,969
What's the problem?

763
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,554
I couldn't do anything.

764
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:37,475
You were right next to an infected patient
and I was worried sick.
