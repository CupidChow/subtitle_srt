JOO HYUNG-WOO VERSUS YULDASHEV ALISHER

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,177
-Punch him!
-Yes!

4
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,973
Good job!

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,698
Come on! Come on!

6
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,160
Nice!

7
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,946
-Hey! Hyung-woo!
-Hyung-woo!

8
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,157
-No!
-Hey!

9
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,419
Medic!

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,761
I can't see.

11
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,851
-I can't see.
-What?

12
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,478
I can't see.

13
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,856
It's over, then.

14
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,609
If you don't draw the blood,
you'll go blind.

15
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,238
-Who are you? A doctor?
-Yes, but not an eye doctor.

16
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,325
You're still a doctor, right?
Draw my blood.

17
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,411
Do it right now.

18
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:46,875
-Are you insane? You don't even know him.
-This match isn't over.

19
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,843
Please prepare disinfectant, betadine,
forceps, lidocaine

20
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,970
-and surgical instruments.
-Okay.

21
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,265
-I thought you weren't an eye doctor.
-I'm not.

22
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,183
-Are you a surgeon?
-No.

23
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,019
Then how will you manage?

24
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,022
I recently got out of prison.

25
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,901
It'll be beyond your imagination.

26
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,820
I performed all sorts
of medical practices there.

27
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,533
All right. Shall we start the anesthesia?

28
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,100
It's my first day back at the hospital.
I'm sorry it took so long.

29
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,688
Once I become physically and mentally
stronger, I'll make sure to visit you.

30
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,855
Please watch over me.

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,610
-I'd like a hot Americano that isn't hot.
-Sorry?

32
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,698
-One hot Americano, please.
-Okay.

33
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,295
BASIC INFORMATION

34
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,880
This isn't right. He's a murderer.

35
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,635
On top of that, medical students
conduct clinical training at our hospital.

36
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,180
How could you allow a man like him
to teach those students?

37
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,100
Wasn't his license revoked as well?

38
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,393
It was regranted.

39
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,729
-He got a new license?
-He sure did.

40
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,981
Even those who sexually assaulted
their patients

41
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,151
or performed malpractice
were quickly regranted their licenses.

42
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,155
You can't compare his crime to those.
He committed a murder.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,949
In my point of view, he is not a doctor.

44
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,493
-He is a doctor.
-He killed someone!

45
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,787
In this country, a doctor is someone

46
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,166
who passed the state examination
and acquired a certified license.

47
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,501
Does anyone wish to object to that?

48
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,919
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

49
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,340
This man is a doctor.
A very competent one.

50
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,552
Have you all forgotten?

51
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,013
Before the incident three years ago,

52
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,683
he was renowned in Pain Management
for his competence.

53
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,520
You're right. He was a TV star as well.

54
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,939
He was the talk of the town here.

55
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,567
He also had a nickname.

56
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,445
Dr. Ten Seconds.

57
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,623
"Dr. Ten Seconds"?

58
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,792
What does that mean?

59
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,883
He finishes scanning patients
in 10 seconds.

60
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,969
HERPES ZOSTER: A DISEASE THAT
CAUSES PAIN ALONG WITH A SKIN RASH

61
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,390
He finds out why they're in pain

62
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,226
and what causes it

63
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,436
in just 10 seconds.

64
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,231
His competence isn't the issue.

65
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,566
I guess it might be more convincing

66
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,402
to tell you the reason why
he was hired as a professor

67
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,071
for the Pain Management Center.

68
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,617
That's exactly what I want to know.
Why did you hire someone like him?

69
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,538
-I received a recommendation.
-A recommendation? From whom?

70
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,377
He was recommended by Lee Won-gil,
the former Minister of Health and Welfare.

71
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,296
That's why I couldn't say no
when we discussed his recruitment.

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,884
-He was Chief Min's teacher, right?
-A teacher? He's like a deity to her.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,970
She thinks of him as a deity.

74
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,807
And he's also very close
with my brother-in-law.

75
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,101
I wonder why the minister recommended

76
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
a guy like him.

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,816
I'm also very curious about that.
It's obvious that he'll cause a stir.

78
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,944
But the minister recommended him,
so we can't just fire him.

79
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,446
Exactly.

80
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,658
But sir…

81
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,412
If this recruitment ends up
causing a problem,

82
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,040
wouldn't people start questioning
Chief Min's decision?

83
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,294
Are you saying we should sit back
and enjoy the ride?

84
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,972
Excuse us, everyone.

85
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,391
-Isn't that Joo Hyung-woo?
-Excuse us.

86
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,060
RESTRICTED AREA

87
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,771
He rolled down a stairway
and hurt his ankle.

88
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,483
We'll take an X-ray.
Is there anything else?

89
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,067
-How do you feel?
-My eye.

90
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,402
Your eye hurts?

91
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,071
Can you take off your sunglasses?

92
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,659
Call an eye doctor
and an anesthesiologist.

93
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,036
An anesthesiologist?

94
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,080
Call the anesthesiologist
named Cha Yo-han.

95
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,467
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER
CHA YO-HAN

96
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,864
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER
CHA YO-HAN

97
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,081
Did you get hired as a professor
here in our department?

98
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,708
Yes.

99
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,503
I guess you're a resident
in Anesthesiology.

100
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,339
Yes.

101
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,301
We meet again.

102
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,726
Are you Dr. Cha?

103
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,228
-Yes.
-I'm Kim Jung-woo, a third-year resident

104
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,813
in Ophthalmology.

105
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,106
-Ophthalmology?
-Yes.

106
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,318
A professor in our department
wishes to see you.

107
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,487
-Right now?
-Why isn't anyone coming

108
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,406
from the Anesthesiology Department?

109
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,907
-Call him again.
-Okay.

110
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,576
My gosh.

111
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,464
Dr. Cha?

112
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Yes, that's me.

113
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,385
Excuse me.

114
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,975
Do you have trouble seeing things?

115
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,394
Ever since this morning,
I couldn't open my eyes,

116
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,230
things looked blurry, and I felt dizzy.

117
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,690
Then I fell.

118
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,943
That's why you shouldn't have
made an incision.

119
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,528
You're just an anesthesiologist.

120
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,531
Do you have the results?
His intraocular pressure,

121
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,034
consensual pupillary reaction,
and VEP are all normal?

122
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,285
Well, yes.

123
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,872
So his eyes are fine,
but things seem out of focus?

124
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,924
Does he seriously eat all that?
No wonder he does eating shows.

125
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,928
ANESTHESIOLOGIST CHA GOT SENTENCED
TO JAIL FOR EUTHANIZING A PATIENT

126
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,889
Hey, hey.

127
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,641
It's him, right?

128
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,936
-Cha Yo-han.
-Yes, that's him.

129
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,937
Unbelievable.

130
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,899
An ex-convict who committed murder
is going to be our professor?

131
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,526
This is so upsetting.

132
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,037
But then again,

133
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,207
you guys have nothing
to worry about unlike me.

134
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,711
She's Chief Min's daughter.
And he's the son of a financier.

135
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,756
-I hope we get along.
-Me too.

136
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,307
-Dr. Lee.
-I thought it was you.

137
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,435
Your hair.

138
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,898
Did you also apply to this hospital?

139
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,359
I applied and got accepted.
That's why I'm here.

140
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,404
But you just said "also."
Did you meet him already?

141
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,823
Inmate 6238.

142
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:21,991
You knew?

143
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,480
There are two people
I'd like to introduce to you today.

144
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,734
But one of them is going to be late,
so let's start with you, Dr. Lee.

145
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,695
Look at that.

146
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,240
-Look at what?
-His broad shoulders.

147
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,457
My gosh, how did a handsome man
like him end up working here?

148
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm Lee Yoo-joon, a second-year fellow.
I look forward to working with you.

149
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,508
Welcome.

150
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,222
Aren't you going to welcome him?

151
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,009
A 38-year-old male.
He had a canthotomy two days ago

152
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,053
due to an emergency incident.

153
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,474
I used forceps to hold the ligaments
on his lateral canthus.

154
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,851
Then I cut off the outer tissue

155
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:19,608
and got rid of the hematoma
that was pressuring his optic nerve.

156
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:31,704
The patient is currently suffering
from dizziness, diplopia, and ptosis.

157
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,708
However, his test results
came back normal.

158
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,631
By any chance, is that patient
Joo Hyung-woo?

159
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,676
-Joo Hyung-woo?
-The mixed martial arts fighter?

160
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,387
-Joo Hyung-woo?
-My gosh, that's incredible.

161
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,181
I mean…

162
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,645
Let me rephrase that.
The canthotomy went well,

163
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,316
but he's suddenly suffering
from dizziness and diplopia.

164
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,109
So you're saying there must be

165
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,154
another reason to his symptoms other
than that he injured his eye.

166
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,363
Yes, that's right.

167
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,992
He recently had a slight fever
that seemed like a flu symptom,

168
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,244
and he's also suffering from diabetes.

169
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,914
But he only had a slight numbness
in his hands and feet.

170
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,918
-He never had a problem with his sight.
-Why are you suddenly telling us that?

171
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,545
I'm sure you're not asking
to find the cause.

172
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,758
-That's exactly what I'm asking.
-Why? He's not our patient.

173
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,843
And we're not the ones
who caused a problem

174
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,721
by treating someone who wasn't
our patient in the first place.

175
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,099
Whose phone is that?

176
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,606
Excuse me.

177
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,816
Cha Yo-han speaking.

178
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay.

179
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,451
Apparently,

180
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,748
the patient's vision
just came back to normal.

181
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,250
That's good. We no longer have a problem.

182
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,377
No.

183
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,296
We do have a problem.

184
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,592
I managed to stop the bleeding
that pressured his optic nerve.

185
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,429
I couldn't open my eyes,
things looked blurry, and I felt dizzy.

186
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,390
-What's going on?
-Then I fell.

187
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,101
The dizziness and diplopia
suddenly occurred out of nowhere

188
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,894
due to an unknown cause.

189
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,897
Then he just naturally recovered.

190
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,066
Is this normal?

191
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
Can you think of anything?

192
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,783
Could it be a neurological disorder
regarding the eyes

193
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,286
that had nothing to do with the accident?

194
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,123
If so, that's Neurology's concern.

195
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,666
Not Anesthesiology's.

196
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,752
Regardless of department,
isn't it our job to look after the sick?

197
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,463
So what if it is? What do you want to do?

198
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,924
It can be anyone.

199
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,427
Professor, fellow, or resident.

200
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,472
If any of you here have an opinion,
call me at any time.

201
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,393
I am

202
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,981
in charge of Pain Surgery.
My name is Cha Yo-han.

203
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,824
"Regardless of department,
isn't it our job to look after the sick?"

204
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,410
He acts as if he's Albert Schweitzer.

205
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,997
He got flustered that the patient
deteriorated. He's all talk.

206
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,083
The patient recovered.
How is that deteriorating?

207
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,420
He wants to look after
his patient to the end.

208
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,131
It's his sense of calling,
duty, and responsibility.

209
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,966
That's being irresponsible!

210
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,219
Operating on a patient
when it's not his specialty!

211
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,098
Why is he doing this to me?

212
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:43,979
Si-young.

213
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,607
It's your first day back.

214
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,443
-Good luck.
-Thanks, Aunt.

215
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,088
Do you have about 10 licenses?

216
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,133
Or do you plan to get it revoked,
reapply, get it revoked,

217
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,885
and reapply again?

218
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,763
Fine. That's up to you.

219
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,058
Remember this.

220
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,477
You may get another license,

221
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,439
but this is your only opportunity to
work at Hanse Medical Center.

222
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,149
This opportunity.

223
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,487
Who do I owe it to?
Is that the only reason I'm here?

224
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,160
The case three years ago. You said

225
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,539
that you didn't commit a crime.
You just broke the law.

226
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,918
I agree with that.
You were punished for breaking the law.

227
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,420
You did your time, so come back to work.

228
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,174
Harder than anyone,
quietly, under the radar.

229
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,484
I go first. I'm a fellow

230
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,362
and you're a second-year resident. Okay?

231
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,042
Yes, that's right. It's me, Inmate 6238.

232
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,214
-Who…
-I'm Lee Yoo-joon.

233
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,301
I worked at the hospital
near where you were.

234
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,846
Who occasionally misdiagnosed people?

235
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,183
Not occasionally. It was just twice.

236
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,479
Is this meant to be
or is it just a coincidence?

237
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,941
It's destiny. I applied
just to come and beat you.

238
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,195
-Did you lose to me?
-In the previous hospital,

239
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,739
I had a huge advantage.

240
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,533
I could see and test the patients

241
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,619
while you had to eavesdrop
from behind bars,

242
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,579
and you were always right.

243
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,750
-How do you think I felt?
-I wouldn't know.

244
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,919
I've never felt that.

245
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,506
Now you're a professor and I'm a fellow.

246
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,427
It may seem nonsensical that a fellow
is challenging a professor,

247
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:26,058
but I swear that one day,
I will get to correct your misdiagnosis.

248
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,561
I doubt that. But before you do…

249
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,855
-Lee what?
-Lee Yoo-joon.

250
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,025
Yes, Dr. Lee, you must remember this.

251
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,319
First, diagnosing isn't a competition.

252
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,323
Second, a change in style
doesn't mean an upgrade in skill.

253
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,117
What's this? Fashion?

254
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,039
Diagnosing isn't a competition?

255
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,709
How can he be so cool?

256
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,470
I didn't get to greet you
properly earlier.

257
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,097
KANG SI-YOUNG

258
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,142
Are you allowed to show you know me?

259
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,312
-What?
-Should you let others know what you did?

260
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,772
What's so bad about…

261
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,486
-If it makes you feel uncomfortable…
-Weren't you away for a while?

262
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,323
-I was.
-People will see how you do.

263
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,910
-Right.
-Stay under the radar.

264
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,329
That's what Chief Min told me.

265
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,418
I'm glad to see you again.

266
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,382
It was just for a day back then,

267
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,219
but a man came back from death's door.

268
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
It's also the day I decided

269
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,311
to stop running away and try again.

270
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,690
Teach me a lot, Dr. Cha.

271
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,692
I'll study hard.

272
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,404
-You're still the same.
-Sorry?

273
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,823
Your shoelaces.

274
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,819
Dr. Kim Young-mi from Pediatrics.

275
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,989
Dr. Kim Young-mi,
please come to the emergency room.

276
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,784
Dr. Kim Young-mi from Pediatrics.

277
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,870
Dr. Kim Young-mi,
please come to the emergency room.

278
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,876
AIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

279
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,261
P

280
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,119
PAIN

281
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,040
Why am I down in the semi-basement?

282
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,417
You can't afford to be picky.

283
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,169
Be glad you got accepted.

284
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,840
The legal team is on the 12th floor.

285
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,593
Shall we have lunch together later?

286
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,429
I'm not sure. I plan to be
very busy today.

287
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,474
Let's talk later.

288
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,437
RECEPTION

289
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,779
DISINFECTING GEL

290
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,455
-Are you Dr. Cha Yo-han?
-Yes.

291
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,419
I am Hong Yeon-jin.

292
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,796
Yeon-jin, not engine.

293
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,177
I'm Na Kyung-ah, a nurse.

294
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,636
I hope we get along.

295
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,139
Where are all the residents?

296
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,224
In the meeting room.

297
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,937
Nurse Na Kyung-ah.

298
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,356
-Nurse Hong Yeon-jin.
-Hong.

299
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:50,822
This is just so, so upsetting.

300
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,783
Why must I suffer in my final term?

301
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,536
-Are you that upset?
-I hate the guy.

302
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,664
Did you read about the case
from three years ago?

303
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,003
He didn't take off a helpless patient's
ventilator or discontinue the medication.

304
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,088
He injected a lethal dose
of an anesthetic.

305
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,716
And not to an old man
but to a 20-year-old.

306
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,302
That's how young he was.

307
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,055
He had terminal cancer.

308
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,891
The cancer would've spread fast
and he'd have suffered more.

309
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,561
He'd have died soon anyway
if he was left in that condition.

310
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,605
I read up on the case.

311
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,649
It looked like he had

312
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,693
a little too much time
to just wait and die.

313
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,862
What time does
a terminal cancer patient have?

314
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,113
He was only 20…

315
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,033
-years old.
-Right.

316
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,452
His heart was still young and healthy.

317
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,371
Instead of expiring…

318
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,086
He'd have been left
with excruciating pain.

319
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,297
That patient was an abductor.

320
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,133
That's right. He killed two kids.

321
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,386
It was a really famous case.

322
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,722
-What was his name?
-Yoon Seong-kyu.

323
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,307
Yes, Yoon Seong-kyu.

324
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,685
But that's not the issue here.

325
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,479
Why does the professor
I have to study under

326
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,606
have to be an ex-convict?

327
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,066
Why?

328
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,242
Hello, Professor.

329
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,077
Hello.

330
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,306
Does anyone want to share
their thoughts on Joo Hyung-woo?

331
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,807
-Can we ask questions?
-Sure.

332
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:45,520
-Will you continue monitoring him?
-Is there a reason why I shouldn't?

333
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,857
Because this is Pain Management,
not Ophthalmology or Neurology.

334
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,693
-There's nothing we can do.
-Give me your hand.

335
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,159
-That hurts!
-And so does the patient.

336
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,246
In addition, he doesn't even know
why he's hurting.

337
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,792
Isn't this enough reason for us
to be more attentive to him?

338
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,669
PRESCRIBED MEDICINE FOR DISCHARGE

339
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,464
Dr. Cha, I looked at the patient's chart,

340
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,008
and he's getting ready for his discharge.

341
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,052
I'll take it now.

342
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,807
-Good work.
-Please maintain good condition.

343
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,893
-I hope you win.
-Thank you, sir.

344
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,730
-You must be busy. You should go.
-You can't leave.

345
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,153
We've examined him thoroughly.

346
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,654
He's fine.

347
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,201
You should stay here for a few days
and get several more tests done.

348
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,412
I have an important match next week,
so I must leave.

349
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,040
You can't compete in this state.

350
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,294
Why are you saying that
when we said he's fine?

351
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,253
Exactly.

352
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,423
When I woke up this morning
to find my eye like this,

353
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,593
I thought you made a mistake
a couple of days ago.

354
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,055
But they said I'm fine.
Then shouldn't I be content with that?

355
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,849
Are you sure you weren't disappointed?

356
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:10,105
You came to the hospital this morning
because your eye felt strange.

357
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,692
If I had made a mistake,
you were going to let them fix it.

358
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,155
I'm sure you were also ready to sue me
or demand that I take responsibility.

359
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,950
However, my canthotomy was conducted

360
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,285
without any mistakes.

361
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,539
That means my operation was a success,

362
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,792
but your eye felt strange because of
some other issue with your body.

363
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,255
What do you think other patients
would do in your situation?

364
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,966
They would've received checkups,
not requested a discharge.

365
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,723
What are you trying to say?

366
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,268
You already knew that something
was wrong with your body, right?

367
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,270
You just hoped you were wrong.

368
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,652
If there is something wrong, indeed,

369
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,573
that means
I don't have much time to fight.

370
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,118
If that's the case,
I'm running out of time. Goodbye.

371
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,804
Gosh, Joo Hyung-woo is really well-built.

372
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,142
Kick, kick. Counterattack. That's it.

373
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,606
He's fighting so well.
There's nothing wrong with him.

374
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,569
Since we have no patients,

375
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,030
we will continue with our follow-up
of Joo Hyung-woo.

376
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,407
-Hasn't he been discharged?
-They're working on it.

377
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,284
-But he'll be back soon.
-Why?

378
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,286
-He left his watch.
-He means that his eye

379
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,788
felt uncomfortable, was dizzy.

380
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,582
If he suddenly recovered
due to some issues with the nerves,

381
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,418
he'd be experiencing other symptoms
as well and will be back.

382
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,219
Who wants to guess the first symptom?

383
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,681
Heo Jun, tell me. I hope you won't
dishonor Physician Heo Jun.

384
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,685
If we successfully diagnose him…

385
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,896
-Yes?
-Then wouldn't the other departments

386
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,439
such as Ophthalmology

387
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,901
or Neurology feel bitter about it?
I truly love Joo Hyung-woo,

388
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,320
but I'm worried about you.

389
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,074
-Does anyone else have opinions?
-Tell me.

390
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,702
-Do you watch his matches often?
-What's your name?

391
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,830
-Kim Won-hee, first-year.
-Go on.

392
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:36,584
I wonder why people are against violence
but willingly watch such violent fights.

393
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,710
I'm not sure.

394
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,714
Do you think they go there
just to observe violence?

395
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,052
-What else do you see at those stadiums?
-Pretty grid girls?

396
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,347
-More importantly, the fighters.
-What else?

397
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,767
That's your homework.

398
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,269
Second-year.

399
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,397
-Yes?
-Didn't you have something to say?

400
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,439
I do.

401
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,362
Recently, Joo Hyung-woo went to
South America to film a variety show.

402
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,739
It's rare, but if he got
vaccinated beforehand,

403
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,950
the antigens in the vaccine
could've damaged--

404
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,912
And caused Guillain-Barre syndrome
or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis?

405
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,624
It's possible that the syndrome
could've hindered his eye movements,

406
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,210
but it has nothing to do
with the recovery.

407
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,171
I suspect brain issues such as
a stroke, ophthalmoneuromyelitis,

408
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,464
or multiple sclerosis.

409
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,759
But since he's not showing
any neurologic symptoms…

410
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,603
The patient experienced
tingling sensations in his hands and feet.

411
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,814
It could've been mistaken
as a symptom of diabetes.

412
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,567
However, that's a symptom
of multiple sclerosis

413
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,652
or ophthalmoneuromyelitis.

414
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,574
Should I contact the patient
and tell him to get a checkup?

415
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,535
Tell him there could be issues
with his brain and that he should

416
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,580
-get checked up at Neurology.
-Okay.

417
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,957
We'll be back.

418
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,340
Dr. Cha, what if he already left
the hospital?

419
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
I told you. He left his watch.

420
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,530
I'm Kang Si-young,
a resident of Anesthesiology.

421
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
Hello, I'm Heo Jun, also a resident.

422
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,993
I'm a big fan.

423
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,707
Dr. Cha said that your brain,
not your eye,

424
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,294
might be the problem.
He wanted you to receive a checkup.

425
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,175
You should visit Neurology
for a thorough checkup.

426
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,386
I advise you to listen to him and--

427
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,720
Doctor.

428
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,848
Do you know what a DNR is?

429
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,393
DOCUMENT STATING TO NOT
PROLONG YOUR LIFE MEDICALLY

430
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,352
I do.

431
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,895
Recently, I signed one.

432
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,775
If I ever come here
during an emergency situation,

433
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,945
please tell him
not to prolong my life uselessly

434
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,155
through medical appliances.

435
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,074
-Please.
-Why would you say that

436
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,119
-when you haven't been diagnosed yet?
-I'll be leaving for now.

437
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,537
But…

438
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,622
You're afraid, aren't you?

439
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,503
You're scared that you may have
an incurable or critical disease,

440
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,587
aren't you?

441
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,175
Regular people like us

442
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,595
are frightened when something
doesn't seem right about our bodies.

443
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,516
But you're a fighter. Your body is just
as precious as your life.

444
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,685
I'm sure you're more frightened.

445
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,023
But while you hesitate,
it may only worsen.

446
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,775
-It's not too late--
-Thank you.

447
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
I am scared.

448
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,408
Knowing that someone understands me
is comforting.

449
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,705
-Wait a minute!
-Hey, Si-young…

450
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,624
This is upsetting.

451
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,626
Sir.

452
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Sir.

453
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,137
Sir.

454
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,058
Sir, you can't leave.

455
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,393
Sir.

456
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,576
Sir! Sir!

457
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,830
There's a slight fracture
in your left leg.

458
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,000
Your brain CT and everything else is fine.

459
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,627
But your back MRI shows

460
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,130
a possibility of a herniated disc due to
your left nerve being pressed down.

461
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,633
I will transfer you to Orthopedics.

462
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,593
We will treat you.

463
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,096
No, transfer him to Neurology.

464
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,141
Have your limbs ever felt weird or hot?

465
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,727
-Why do you ask?
-This could be neurologic.

466
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,521
You should receive a checkup.

467
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,316
It's important to treat
neurologic diseases as soon as possible.

468
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,277
Suffering from a herniated disc

469
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,947
can't explain why you'd suddenly
feel dizzy or lose focus.

470
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,075
-You should transfer to Neuro--
-No, thank you.

471
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,540
-Please fix my leg as soon as possible.
-Do you not have a guardian?

472
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,960
How about your family?

473
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,006
Is your family aware
of your current situation?

474
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,801
-Is there really no one who can come here?
-No, there isn't.

475
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,392
Sort out my leg.

476
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,063
It was just a fall.

477
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,861
How can you manage to…

478
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,405
Be nice and share.

479
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,991
I must eat the exact amount
or I'll lose muscle.

480
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,284
You're so heartless.

481
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:09,417
What should we do?
We can't leave when the professor's away.

482
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,877
-Dr. Heo.
-Yes?

483
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,046
It's not the right time to discuss lunch.

484
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,590
I apologize.

485
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,926
But we can't all starve.

486
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,970
We must eat to work.

487
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,662
Hello? You can all go and eat.

488
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,840
I'm hungry. Where's the cafeteria?

489
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,605
The stir-fried pork here is good.

490
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,567
-Why won't you eat any?
-I don't eat greasy food.

491
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,281
The spicy beef soup is good too.

492
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,703
-I don't eat spicy food either.
-You're quite a picky eater.

493
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,208
Carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
It's a perfectly balanced meal.

494
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,588
There's a free table. Let's hurry.

495
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,649
What?

496
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,485
-What?
-Why do you keep looking at me?

497
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,156
Just because it feels so strange.

498
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,786
I didn't think I'd get to see you again.

499
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,081
Let alone work at the same hospital.

500
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,418
But we're even eating together
in the cafeteria.

501
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,044
Do you like it?

502
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,922
What?

503
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,342
Like what?

504
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,680
What do you mean?

505
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,807
What do I like?

506
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,520
You're not saying
what I think you are, are you?

507
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,023
I like it too.

508
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,823
Being able to work
and eat at a hospital again.

509
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,932
I heard you were upset. I apologize.

510
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,394
If anything bothers you,
don't hesitate to say so.

511
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,063
There's something…

512
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,400
you can do for me.

513
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,529
About Joo Hyung-woo.
Right before he fell down the stairs,

514
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,198
he paused for a while.

515
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,451
He stopped so abruptly that…

516
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,369
Sir.

517
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,412
I thought he'd changed his mind.

518
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,999
-But?
-He continued to go downstairs.

519
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,250
Then he fell.

520
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,213
If the pause and fall were

521
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,007
due to a pain in his leg
or weakening muscles…

522
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,551
And yet the patient insists he just fell?

523
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,389
Yes. To be honest, he acted strange
even when he was in his room.

524
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:55,851
-What do you mean?
-He suddenly mentioned he'd signed a DNR.

525
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,649
A fighter who has a match next week
signed a DNR?

526
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,115
-Let's go.
-Sorry?

527
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,449
Something's going on.

528
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,793
I'll talk to Dr. Cha and Si-young.

529
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,213
You don't have to call them.

530
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,426
Let's talk.

531
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,099
Should I follow them?

532
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,359
I told you clearly not to cause trouble.

533
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,779
Why did you cause a problem
stopping a patient from leaving?

534
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,157
It didn't happen because she stopped him.

535
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,033
-The patient's sick--
-How so?

536
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,124
I suspect multiple sclerosis
or ophthalmoneuromyelitis.

537
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,960
He must be transferred to Neurology
for testing.

538
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,296
The patient refused
all testing and treatment.

539
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,465
He asked us to ban you from seeing him.

540
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,426
Why did you cross the line
and cause such trouble?

541
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,052
I'll persuade him.

542
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,805
Dr. Cha, don't you think
you're going too far?

543
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,893
This is along the same lines
as the case three years ago.

544
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,978
What do you mean?

545
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,316
Doctors tend to take an incurable disease
or death as a failure.

546
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,318
Skilled doctors such as yourself

547
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,612
take pride in being able to

548
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,655
diagnose and treat any illness.

549
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,909
Do you act so dogmatically
because you don't want to fail?

550
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,204
That's a new interpretation that
not even the judges came up with.

551
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,875
-On what grounds do you say that?
-You say you're helping the patient,

552
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,504
but you're making decisions
not caring what the patient wants.

553
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,090
If you end up making
life or death decisions on your own,

554
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,219
the same could always happen again.

555
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,804
Just like three years ago.

556
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,351
So what then?

557
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,480
If you're so worried about
what happened three years ago,

558
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,357
you should've prevented my appointment.

559
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,860
Or summon me
to the ethics commission right now.

560
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,695
Of course, there's no reason

561
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,073
for me to go that far to stay here.

562
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,449
Is there?

563
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,047
Are you going to see Joo Hyung-woo?
I'll come with you.

564
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,215
Stay out of it.

565
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,096
-Don't come with me. Didn't you hear?
-The patient refused treatment.

566
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,681
If something happens when you--

567
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,809
So stay out of it
before you get into trouble too.

568
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,902
Do you want to learn from me?

569
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,738
Don't learn this.

570
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,166
Resign! Resign!

571
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,168
-Resign! Resign!
-Resign! Resign!

572
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,254
Say no to euthanasia!

573
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,006
-Say no! Say no!
-Say no! Say no!

574
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,258
-Resign! Resign!
-Resign! Resign!

575
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,010
Say no to euthanasia!

576
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,387
-Say no! Say no!
-Say no! Say no!

577
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,431
SAY NO

578
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,308
What…

579
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,392
Say no! Say no!

580
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,310
Is that?

581
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,395
Cha Yo-han! Resign!

582
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,730
Resign! Resign!

583
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,441
Say no to euthanasia!

584
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,401
Say no! Say no!

585
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,821
A doctor here killed a patient!

586
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,074
-Sign a petition against euthanasia.
-Say no! Say no!

587
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,701
Please sign.

588
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,787
A doctor here killed a patient!

589
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,705
Say no!

590
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,582
Sign a petition against euthanasia.

591
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,584
Say no! Say no!

592
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,712
A doctor here killed a patient!

593
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,714
Sign a petition.

594
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,467
A doctor here killed a patient.

595
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,885
Sign a petition.

596
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,678
Say no! Say no!

597
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,597
Cha Yo-han! Resign!

598
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,307
Resign! Resign!

599
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,100
Say no to euthanasia!

600
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,935
Say no! Say no!

601
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,231
A doctor here killed a patient.

602
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,359
Sign a petition against euthanasia.

603
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,152
NO TO CHA YO-HAN'S APPOINTMENT

604
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,363
A doctor here killed a patient.

605
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,450
I think it's about his brain, not his eye.

606
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,286
He could have MS
or ophthalmoneuromyelitis.

607
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,038
You must take a brain MRI to check.

608
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,332
Do you think we didn't do anything?

609
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,293
We persuaded him to get a brain MRI.

610
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,629
-What were the results?
-We just got it back.

611
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,963
There are no lesions.

612
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,594
If you're satisfied now,
go see the patient.

613
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,098
-Can I see him?
-He wants to see you.

614
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,392
-He has something to tell you.
-Me?

615
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,559
Yes.

616
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,287
You wanted to see me?

617
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,665
-Say no! Say no!
-Say no! Say no!

618
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,504
-Say no to euthanasia!
-Say no! Say no!

619
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,631
Mr. Joo.

620
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,134
Do you often

621
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,096
-come see my matches?
-Yes.

622
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,141
That's my only hobby.

623
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,027
Violence is definitely addictive.

624
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,531
Both for the fighters and viewers.

625
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,243
I'm sorry, but I don't attend
matches to see violence.

626
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,872
-Then what do you see?
-What accompanies violence?

627
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,748
Spectators.

628
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,626
Enthusiasm. Shouting.

629
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,836
And me.

630
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:56,879
That's right.

631
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,174
And then there is

632
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,384
your pain.

633
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,682
Even if you get broken bones,
torn muscles,

634
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,101
or damaged central nerves,

635
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,188
you have to continue fighting.

636
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,899
I go there to see that pain.

637
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,277
It's the best place for observing pain.

638
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,949
We have something in common.

639
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,118
I want to inflict pain,

640
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,871
and you want to reduce pain.

641
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,041
But we both think about pain all the time.

642
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:38,587
Yes. I'd like to stop your pain.

643
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,298
And you'd do anything to do that.

644
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,800
Pardon?

645
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,554
I fainted during a recent shoot
in South America.

646
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,891
I woke up in a hospital

647
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,354
and realized I was relying
on a machine to breathe.

648
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,981
My sight was dim, and my limbs felt weak.

649
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,943
My whole body was fixed to machines.

650
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,488
I'd had full control over my body
all my life.

651
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:08,825
That horror of being helplessly locked up
was immense.

652
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,455
Why are you telling me this?

653
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,832
I heard

654
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,878
you performed euthanasia three years ago.

655
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,175
If I stop breathing or moving
on my own again

656
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,471
and have to stay that way
for the rest of my life,

657
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,975
can you kill me too?

658
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,689
A fighter without sight and limbs

659
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:42,150
is better off dead than
staying alive relying on machines.

660
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,822
What I can stop is the patients' pain,

661
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,284
not the hardships in their lives.

662
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,412
That kind of life is sheer pain.
You can't even call that life.

663
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,747
You feel pain because you're alive.

664
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,251
-Without life, there's no pain.
-To me, pain is…

665
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,713
something I put up with.

666
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,968
Whatever is torn, broken, or burst,
I put up with it.

667
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,930
That's what a fight is all about.

668
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,768
I've been putting up with my pain
to be able to keep fighting.

669
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,522
If I can't fight anymore,

670
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,944
there's no reason for me
to put up with my pain either.

671
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,678
Dismiss the euthanizer!

672
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,180
Dismiss the euthanizer!

673
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,767
-Say no to euthanasia!
-Say no! Say no!

674
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,102
-Say no! Say no!
-Say no! Say no!

675
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,105
Dismiss the euthanizer!

676
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,366
DIAGNOSING ISN'T A COMPETITION

677
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,912
Did you see the protesters?
The protesters.

678
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,789
What if they come in here?

679
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:24,002
This is just so, so upsetting.

680
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,548
Why isn't Dr. Cha here yet?
It's time to go home.

681
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,258
It's such a shame.

682
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,478
What's with her?

683
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,067
-Mr. Joo went into respiratory arrest.
-What?

684
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,736
He said he'd signed a DNR.

685
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,863
-Mr. Joo?
-Yes.

686
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,157
Goodness. Can we even intubate him?

687
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,328
-We should. He's not a terminal patient.
-We don't know that yet.

688
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,792
That's why we should intubate him.
He hasn't been diagnosed yet.

689
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,594
Is Cha Yo-han in?

690
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,138
Cha Yo-han! Resign!

691
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,223
Resign! Resign!

692
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,100
Say no to euthanasia!

693
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,269
Say no! Say no!

694
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,898
No, he's not.

695
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,654
Are you a resident here?

696
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,449
-Yes.
-Then…

697
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,119
-you must be under Cha Yo-han.
-What about it?

698
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,749
Are the residents here

699
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,961
aware that Cha Yo-han
performed euthanasia?

700
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,089
Yes, we are.

701
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,510
But not all of it, I guess.

702
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,978
-My goodness.
-His respiratory rate is dropping.

703
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,147
-Get ready for intubation.
-Yes.

704
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,857
Pull the bed a little.

705
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,239
Is he okay?

706
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,825
-What happened?
-Respiratory arrest.

707
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,454
Here's the intubation kit. Excuse me.

708
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,626
I haven't done this in a long time.

709
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,257
Also, he has malocclusion and
a short lower jaw. It won't be easy.

710
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,385
Take a look.

711
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,471
He's your patient.

712
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,724
-Why? He was admitted for his eye injury.
-So what?

713
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,519
I've never done an intubation
even during my internship.

714
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,980
-They called the ER. Wait just a second.
-He can't last that long.

715
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,734
Are you telling me to take
responsibility for this whole thing?

716
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,780
Right. According to the ER,

717
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,241
this patient signed a DNR.

718
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,410
He wanted the doctors
to be notified in an emergency.

719
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,920
Excuse me.

720
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,051
-Excuse me.
-What's going on?

721
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,762
-Give me a laryngoscope.
-What are you doing?

722
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,560
What are you doing?

723
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,479
He signed a DNR.

724
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,318
-Tube.
-Who says you can do this?

725
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,946
He's not a terminal patient,
so the DNR doesn't count.

726
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,030
Legally speaking, no.

727
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,241
But as soon as he's intubated,

728
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,452
he might be tied to machines
for the rest of his life.

729
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,079
Ambu bag.

730
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,540
Hold on. Dr. Cha,

731
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,668
will you take full responsibility
for this?

732
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,222
Is he alive?

733
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,809
According to the law,
for the patient's DNR to work,

734
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,271
the patient must have no chance of
recovering and show no improvement.

735
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,524
Also, the patient must deteriorate
rapidly and be facing death,

736
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,985
which has to be medically judged

737
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,821
by the attending doctor and a specialist.

738
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,742
We don't know what his disease is
and how bad it is yet.

739
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,745
What if his disease has progressed so much

740
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,999
-that he's facing death?
-Can you be sure that he's facing death?

741
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,085
Can any of you be sure

742
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,173
that he's a terminal patient
who can't recover?

743
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,220
Until we can be sure of that,
every patient has the right to be treated,

744
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,557
and the medical staff is obligated
to provide the best treatment.

745
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,895
Three years ago, Yoon Seong-kyu…

746
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,106
wanted to live.

747
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,697
He was determined to live
to the day he died.

748
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,955
What do you mean?

749
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,917
A new drug for anal cancer
had just been developed.

750
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,878
Yoon Seong-kyu even signed a consent form

751
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,632
-to participate in the clinical trial.
-Yoon Seong-kyu did?

752
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,259
Yes.

753
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,428
I was

754
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,098
his nurse when he signed it.

755
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,602
THREE YEARS AGO

756
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,187
YOON SEONG-KYU

757
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,744
The day he signed it,

758
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,955
he was found…

759
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,584
dead.

760
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,638
Despite his will to live,
Dr. Cha euthanized him.

761
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,640
That was…

762
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,060
murder.

763
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,985
He killed a patient who wanted to live.

764
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,071
He saved a patient who wanted to die.

765
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,788
Dr. Cha.

766
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,958
What kind of doctor…

767
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,419
are you?

768
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,419
A PATIENT WHO WANTED TO LIVE,
A DOCTOR WHO EUTHANIZED HIM

769
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,339
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

770
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,092
WHO BENEFITTED FROM THIS DEATH?

771
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,858
A PATIENT WHO WANTED TO LIVE,
A DOCTOR WHO EUTHANIZED HIM

772
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,361
WHO BENEFITTED FROM THIS DEATH?

773
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,619
WHO BENEFITTED FROM THIS DEATH?

774
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,625
-Are you getting off work?
-Yes.

775
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,090
"A patient who wanted to live".

776
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,051
Do you know what she means?

777
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,054
I have a guess.

778
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,266
Is it about that?

779
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,102
The clinical trial consent form.

780
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,155
Your first day at work was hectic.

781
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:34,492
-Is that a compliment or a criticism?
-I heard about Joo Hyung-woo.

782
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,912
The Chief of Anesthesiology
called the legal team

783
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,249
and asked if it was okay.
You need to be careful.

784
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,419
If you're the lawyer of the legal team,
you should react differently.

785
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,338
-Did I do something against the law?
-No, you didn't.

786
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,424
But there's no need to cause a scene.

787
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,260
You made a comeback after three years.
I wanted to ask you.

788
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,262
Who recommended me to this hospital?

789
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,307
It's me.

790
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,268
Who's the man responsible for
creating big changes in your life?

791
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,478
It's me.

792
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,771
You were willing to receive
any punishment.

793
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,274
I volunteered to defend you
and reduced your sentence.

794
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,444
Hospitals were hesitant to hire you,
yet here we are.

795
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,323
Haven't we become closer
through these hardships?

796
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,577
Of course, I did ask someone
more powerful for help.

797
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,121
But connections can only do so much.

798
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,249
It's all up to you how long
you can manage here.

799
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,959
Do you get me?

800
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,796
Gosh.

801
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,134
I became curious

802
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,222
about Cha Yo-han, so I looked
through his trial records.

803
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,684
That's when I found out
about the consent form.

804
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,270
I can guess your thoughts.

805
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,940
"Was he aware of that or not?"

806
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,278
I wasn't aware of it.

807
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,240
I became aware of the consent form

808
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,118
the day after the patient had died.

809
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,287
The great Cha Yo-han

810
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,832
made a mistake by overlooking
the patient's information.

811
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,709
He made a mistake?

812
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,757
-I doubt it was a mistake, though.
-Then?

813
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,260
Are you saying he did that knowingly?

814
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,886
He probably trusted his judgment.

815
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,348
He probably believed that for a patient
who was experiencing too much pain,

816
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:24,602
it was better to end his life than to give
him useless hope through clinical trials.

817
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,063
What's important is that
he put his personal judgment

818
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,523
before the patient's wishes.

819
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,401
Do you want to believe
that it was a mistake?

820
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:36,281
Or do you think he punished
the victim for being an abductor?

821
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,867
Cha Yo-han isn't the type
who's lax about vocational ethics.

822
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,747
Let go.

823
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,551
What if he was terrified?

824
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,889
If the victim writhed in pain
and begged him to end him,

825
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,143
even if it was him,

826
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,645
I'm sure he was terrified.

827
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,150
When you're terrified, you feel fear.

828
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,901
So he did that in a hurry?

829
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,195
Cha Yo-han?

830
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,074
The Cha Yo-han I saw at the jail

831
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,368
performed surgeries
outside of the operating room

832
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,079
and didn't hesitate to perform
surgeries from other fields.

833
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,582
Why do you think he's so reckless?

834
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,377
It's because he's fearless.

835
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,214
That's the kind of doctor he is.

836
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,508
He's fearless and thorough.

837
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,390
If you can't cure pain,
you should stop it.

838
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,353
If the doctor does nothing,
the patient's torment doesn't stop.

839
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,940
Even in this moment,

840
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,028
the patient feels pain.

841
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:04,035
DO DOCTORS HAVE THE RIGHT
TO DECIDE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES?

842
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,664
DO DOCTORS HAVE THE RIGHT
TO DECIDE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES?

843
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:14,045
Can any of you be sure that he's
a terminal patient who can't recover?

844
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,549
Dr. Cha, don't you think
you're going too far?

845
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:22,345
This is along the same lines
as the case three years ago.

846
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,431
You say you're helping the patient,
but you're making decisions

847
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,517
not caring what the patient wants.

848
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,726
ARBITRARY DECISION

849
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,062
DOCTOR'S ARROGANCE

850
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,981
Do you want to learn from me?

851
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,776
Don't learn this.

852
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,585
I heard Joo Hyung-woo hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

853
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,921
-Has he been diagnosed?
-Not yet.

854
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,715
Have any of you seen Dr. Cha?

855
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,594
I didn't see him at the conference.
Did he not come to work?

856
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,244
It's not that he didn't come to work.
He didn't leave yesterday.

857
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,538
-Did he pull an all-nighter?
-No way.

858
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:38,421
Joo Hyung-woo's
spinal scans from the ICU turned out fine.

859
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,466
His spinal fluids weren't infected either.

860
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,970
The most likely illness that he has
is myasthenia gravis.

861
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,638
What do you think?

862
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,729
No one?

863
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,692
-You're right.
-Are you bragging?

864
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,361
Not something to be ashamed about.
This isn't Neurology.

865
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,363
We should hand him over to them.

866
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,119
-Get ready to see our patients.
-Yes, sir.

867
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,997
Second-year.

868
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:14,999
Yes?

869
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:20,087
Go get his blood from the ICU
and conduct an antibody test.

870
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,302
He's still unconscious.

871
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,935
He banned you from approaching him.

872
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,189
I don't think it's right to do
any tests without his consent.

873
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,905
You may leave.

874
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:47,782
Yes, sir.

875
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,094
I came back, thanks to you.

876
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,726
I believed I had no right
to treat patients anymore.

877
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:20,523
I was overcome with shame.
But you told me to save that patient.

878
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,109
You trusted me.

879
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,945
And I trusted you.

880
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,030
But?

881
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,036
About Yoon Seong-kyu…

882
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,085
I heard he wanted to live
until the moment he died.

883
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,590
You euthanized that patient.

884
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,510
Yesterday, you saved a man
who wanted to die.

885
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,012
I believed…

886
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,807
that you put your patient before anything.

887
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,186
But Yoon Seong-kyu…

888
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,273
If he really wanted to live, why did you--

889
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,316
Do you want to know?

890
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,193
Yes.

891
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,575
Too bad.

892
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,911
Right now,

893
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,582
I'm Joo Hyung-woo's doctor,
not Yoon Seong-kyu's.

894
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,047
My patient is lying in bed
without a diagnosis.

895
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:30,092
If you're confused about what I am,
stop caring about me.

896
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,233
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN

897
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:05,002
I thought Dr. Cha needed plenty of time
and demanded 10 years in prison, not 3.

898
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,506
-Does he want to be killed?
-He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

899
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,467
Test him and if I'm right,
take him off the antibiotics.

900
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,303
Dr. Cha, haven't you heard
you're off his case?

901
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,889
I can't confirm anything.
There's no definite diagnosis.

902
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,433
-We don't need one.
-That drug could put him in danger.

903
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,269
Mr. Joo. I'll test if I'm right.
Do you give consent?

904
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,481
Sometimes he solves the problem
leading to death?

905
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,275
-Dad.
-I am…

906
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,404
not a doctor that takes lives.
