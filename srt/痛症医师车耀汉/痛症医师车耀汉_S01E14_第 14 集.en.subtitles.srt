3
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,446
Please...

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,156
Please...

5
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,993
The number you called cannot be reached.

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,129
The address is Seongjin-ro 144-2.

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,382
I think a man has collapsed. Please hurry.

8
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,553
Seongjin-ro 144-2? We're on our way.

9
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,555
How is the man's condition?

10
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,476
-I don't know.
-Sorry? What did you say?

11
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,687
I said I don't know!

12
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,608
He doesn't know if he's in pain
even when he is!

13
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,902
KANG SI-YOUNG

14
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,370
He's a CIPA patient.

15
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,790
The high temperature
might have given him a fever,

16
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,500
so please bring ice packs.

17
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,794
Take his temperature
as soon as you find him.

18
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,554
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,399
Where is Dr. Cha--

20
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,026
-I mean, where is Cha Yo-han?
-This way, please.

21
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,655
He's here.

22
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,453
Dr. Cha, are you okay?

23
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,790
I'm fine.

24
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,127
-What happened?
-I fell.

25
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,505
Anything else? Do you have a fever?

26
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,515
You have a fever.

27
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,310
Anything else? Have you done any tests?

28
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,521
Everything else is fine.
It's nothing serious.

29
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,524
Are Gi-seok's test results out?

30
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,568
Like you predicted, an abscess was found,

31
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,403
so we put him on antibiotics.

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
I see.

33
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,741
Dr. Kang called you to tell you that.

34
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,492
You never picked up,
so she called 911.

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,494
We were so scared.

36
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,749
How is Gi-seok doing?

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,461
No. Let's go back to the hospital.
We can talk on our way there.

38
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:33,963
No.

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,217
You're staying here until your fever goes.

40
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,637
Don't think you can escape like this.

41
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,161
A CERTAIN CHOICE

42
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,175
Just a second.

43
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,313
How is he?

44
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,067
We need his phlegm test result
to be certain.

45
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,903
But the abscess found on his MRI

46
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,990
is consistent with nocardiosis,
so he's been put on antibiotics.

47
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,993
NOCARDIOSIS: LUNG INFECTION COMMON IN
THOSE WITH A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM

48
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,832
Where is Dr. Cha?

49
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
He's not in the hospital.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,710
He's been excluded from medical duties.

51
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,841
The diagnosis was made by Dr. Cha, right?

52
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,635
Is that right?

53
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,015
That's right.

54
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,183
He sure is incredible.

55
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,316
Yes?

56
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,610
The ethics commission has made a decision.

57
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,738
Let's deal with Dr. Cha first,

58
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,490
and then you suspend
the life-prolonging treatment for Kang.

59
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,454
ETHICS COMMISSION'S DECISION

60
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,956
THERE ARE VALID REASONS ENDING
THE TREATMENT FOR THIS PATIENT

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,042
TO LEGITIMATELY SUSPEND
LIFE-PROLONGING TREATMENT...

62
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,464
Losing Dr. Cha...

63
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,550
would be a great loss for us.

64
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,512
Even after leaving the hospital,
he focused on diagnosing Lee Gi-seok.

65
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
So?

66
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:52,935
Chairman Kang...

67
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,522
was devoted to producing great doctors.

68
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm wondering
if we're going against his will.

69
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,238
To me, Dr. Cha is a ticking bomb.

70
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,491
We've had problems
ever since he joined us.

71
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,660
Also, do you want this turmoil to go on?

72
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
We need to be done with him

73
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,707
before we can move on to other matters.

74
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,723
Let's go.

75
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,933
I feel completely fine now.

76
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,934
Let's go, Si-young.

77
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,359
Why hasn't he called yet?

78
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,154
It's him.

79
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,280
Hold on.

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,291
You want to look fine, don't you?

81
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,964
Dr. Cha.

82
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,507
Can you see me?

83
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,592
Yes, I can see you.

84
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,599
Gi-seok. It's Dr. Cha. Can you see him?

85
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,562
Gi-seok.

86
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,773
How do you feel?

87
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,609
If you feel okay, blink your eyes once.

88
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,367
You'll recover little by little.

89
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,786
Once your pneumonia gets better,

90
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,414
it'll be easier to breathe.

91
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,583
Then you'll be taken off the ventilator.

92
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,295
After that, you'll be able
to move your hands and feet.

93
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,091
You'll be able to turn your head, too.

94
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,766
Thanks, Gi-seok.

95
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,606
You must have been frightened,
but you pulled through.

96
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,117
Hang in there.

97
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,498
Next time we meet,
I want you to be healthy.

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,708
Okay?

99
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,174
You can do this, Gi-seok.

100
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,384
Stay strong.

101
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,446
Are you wondering why he isn't here?

102
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,286
He'll be here.

103
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,871
He will be.

104
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,707
He just needs a little time.

105
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,985
Doesn't it hurt?

106
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,990
Why would it hurt?

107
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,576
You know it doesn't.

108
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,453
It looks like it hurts a lot.

109
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,664
Does it?

110
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,709
You can say that it hurts.

111
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,587
Please say that it hurts.

112
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,213
You always say you're okay.

113
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,384
It must be hard.

114
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,972
You're always concerned about me.

115
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,182
You're always anxious.

116
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,477
I'm your guardian, you know.

117
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,981
That's my job.

118
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,445
Let's go in.

119
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,575
Si-young.

120
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,372
Thanks.

121
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,841
You once told me

122
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,218
you have no idea what you would do...

123
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,555
if you ever quit being a doctor.

124
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,642
I just realized

125
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,727
that you should treat patients
all your life.

126
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,689
Nothing else would suit you.

127
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,025
So, please don't get sick.

128
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,685
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

129
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,273
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

130
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,442
Don't you ever get sick.

131
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:23,010
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

132
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,929
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

133
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,847
It's absurd.

134
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,016
How can he treat patients
if he can't feel pain?

135
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,560
-A CIPA patient?
-He has a disease.

136
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,229
He's a CIPA patient.

137
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,939
Oh, my. I can't believe it.

138
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,816
I saw it on Our Famous Doctors.

139
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,194
-It's unbelievable.
-He can't feel pain?

140
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,706
Gi-seok's phlegm culture
test results just came back.

141
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
It's a definite diagnosis. Did you hear?

142
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,252
Yes.

143
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,421
Is Dr. Cha doing okay?

144
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,675
He's going to stay home and get some rest.

145
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,720
Isn't Dr. Cha working today?

146
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,974
No, he won't be treating
any patients for a while.

147
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,016
Why all of a sudden?

148
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,603
I came all the way here
from outside the city.

149
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,148
I heard Dr. Cha is sick.
Is that really true?

150
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,526
What's wrong with him?

151
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,653
He has that illness
where he isn't able to feel pain.

152
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,989
Something called
congenital insensitivity...

153
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,782
-It's something like that.
-You're done now.

154
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,992
-What?
-We'll call you

155
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,034
if you wait outside.

156
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,245
-We're all done here.
-Okay.

157
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,081
Please get changed into your patient gown.

158
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,082
You may go now.

159
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,834
Here you go.

160
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,263
What's up?

161
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,224
They're gathering a disciplinary
committee for Dr. Cha tomorrow.

162
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,853
What? It's tomorrow?

163
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,187
That's so fast.

164
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,691
I know. I think they're going to be
pretty tough on him.

165
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,902
Is it normally this easy to fire someone?

166
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,071
They'll fire him if he damaged
the hospital's reputation.

167
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,574
All they care about
is the hospital's image.

168
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,576
Then what should we do?

169
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,203
Are we just going to watch
Dr. Cha get fired?

170
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,833
Dr. Cha, did you get the summons?

171
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,169
-It's tomorrow.
-I don't need to go, right?

172
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,254
Committee's going to gather
even if you don't attend.

173
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,132
If you don't come, you won't get
a chance to explain.

174
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,384
-Is that okay with you?
-Yes, it's fine.

175
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,304
Okay, I'll call you.

176
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,097
By the way...

177
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,393
do you have time today?

178
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,103
Today?

179
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,356
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

180
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,944
Do you remember asking me
who recommended you to this hospital?

181
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,820
I want you to meet that person.

182
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,413
Hello, how do you feel now?

183
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,915
Is it true?

184
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,294
Is Dr. Cha really unable to feel pain?

185
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,922
-Yes.
-My goodness.

186
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,507
That's unbelievable.

187
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:11,303
I really didn't know that about him.

188
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,513
Yes.

189
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,974
Dr. Cha has CIPA.

190
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,686
But don't you remember
who treated your neuralgia?

191
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,145
It was Dr. Cha.

192
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,605
He's a very competent doctor--

193
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,482
Yes, exactly.

194
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,443
I couldn't even open my mouth properly.

195
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,613
And because of that,
I couldn't eat or talk.

196
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,408
I went through such a hard time.

197
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,202
But how could someone who knows
nothing about pain

198
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,204
treat me so well?

199
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,916
He deserves an award for that.

200
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,545
When is he planning to return?

201
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,465
I'd love to thank him myself.

202
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,218
I should thank you.

203
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,637
Thank you so much, sir.

204
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,266
I want everyone to come inside. Hurry.

205
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,611
-I think I know how we can help Dr. Cha.
-How?

206
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,530
-Really?
-How can we help?

207
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,868
I'm going to divide you into two teams.

208
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,374
-Here you go.
-Please fill in the form.

209
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,376
You know Dr. Cha, right?

210
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,343
Can you please give this a read?

211
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,804
Once you're done reading it,
there's a survey...

212
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,224
Really? Okay, thank you.

213
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,310
Okay, bye.

214
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,887
Sir, Dr. Cha is here.

215
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,692
Hello, my name is Cha Yo-han.

216
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,195
I've always wanted to meet you.

217
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,572
Take a seat.

218
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,450
Sit down.

219
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,428
Why did you want to see me, sir?

220
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,974
At first, you probably wanted
to become a doctor

221
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,685
so you could find out more
about your own illness,

222
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,645
not because you wanted to treat patients.

223
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,191
I felt the same way.

224
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,320
I wanted to know more
about this illness I had,

225
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,490
which caused my muscles
and organs to get stiff.

226
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,452
And I wanted to find a way to cure it.

227
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,873
However, I failed.

228
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,168
Instead, I was able to come across
another method.

229
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,963
I found a way...

230
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,758
to get rid of the pain
instead of the illness itself.

231
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,307
Don't you want to know what that is?

232
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,477
Show him.

233
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,988
Hello.

234
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,618
Nurse.

235
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,703
May I help you?

236
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,832
Is there a clinical trial for people
who have terminal cancer?

237
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,630
The thing is, my sister
got this text yesterday.

238
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,301
There's going to be a presentation

239
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,678
regarding clinical trials
for patients with terminal cancer.

240
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,097
I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.
at Death Talks.

241
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,599
DEATH TALKS

242
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,559
Death Talks.

243
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,811
Isn't this the gathering
you attended yesterday?

244
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,521
Death Talks?

245
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,737
THE BRAIN WAVES STARTED AT BETA
AND DISPLAYED THETA

246
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,621
IT FLATLINED AND MS. PARK HYUN-SOOK
PASSED AWAY PEACEFULLY

247
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,416
CHERUBIM PROMISES YOU A PAINLESS ENDING

248
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,754
What do you think?

249
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,989
Is this the police?

250
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,993
There's a murderer here.

251
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,579
Not only did he conspire to murder,

252
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,123
but he also committed murder.

253
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,128
What if I reported you to the police
for having killed my patient?

254
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,922
Why are you showing this to me?

255
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,302
"Murder"?

256
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,595
If this isn't murder,
do you think this is salvation?

257
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,764
"Salvation"?

258
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,186
What's the big deal about death?

259
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,273
Everyone dies.

260
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:02,904
But not everyone can die in peace.

261
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,656
No one in this world...

262
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,534
can avoid death.

263
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,831
So, why is it so bad
to want to die in peace?

264
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,215
If you're put in charge
of a patient who's in severe pain...

265
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,636
and you happened to have this drug...

266
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,476
what kind of choice would you make?

267
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,110
PROSECUTOR SON SEOK-KI

268
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,779
PROSECUTOR SON, YOO RI-HYE
GOT THE TEXT

269
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,447
THERE'S A PRESENTATION REGARDING...

270
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,618
CHAE EUN-JEONG

271
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,374
-Someone sent this to Yoo Ri-hye?
-Yes.

272
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,750
Isn't it weird?

273
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,003
This isn't a common method
to gather volunteers for a clinical trial.

274
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,838
-When did she get the text?
-Yesterday.

275
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,590
Then it's today.

276
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,263
Dr. Cha, don't go.
I still have a lot more to say.

277
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,181
Dr. Cha.

278
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,267
This is what you wanted to do?

279
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,769
You'll use me to legalize euthanasia

280
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,771
-so you could sell the drug?
-I have the illness.

281
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,858
I have the same illness as the minister.

282
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,113
The illness that gets
me trapped in my own body.

283
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,323
Illness that kills my body
even if my mind's healthy.

284
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,244
For patients like me...

285
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,413
that drug is our only hope.

286
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,624
Myung-oh.

287
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,338
Myung-oh, listen to me. Okay?

288
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,007
This causes new issues
unrelated to euthanasia.

289
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,595
Will that drug only go
to the doctors and patients who need it?

290
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,181
Anyone can die
and anyone can kill with it.

291
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,392
People won't want
to save or cure patients anymore.

292
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,645
I wanted to help...

293
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,566
patients like me.

294
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,445
I'm sorry that you're sick.

295
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,239
But you...

296
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,658
don't want to help patients.

297
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,829
You wanted to help yourself.

298
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,519
Dr. Cha! Dr. Cha!

299
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,439
-It's Gi-seok. Save him.
-Dad.

300
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,648
No.

301
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,360
What's the big deal about death?

302
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,988
Mom. You fought hard.

303
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,239
I love you, Mom.

304
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,867
It hurts.

305
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,785
It hurts so much.

306
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,037
Stop.

307
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,332
Dad's in too much pain.

308
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,336
Speeding up death to bring comfort
is different from doing so to take a life!

309
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,670
I'm...

310
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,590
not a doctor who kills.

311
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,384
Save me.

312
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,471
Doctor, I want to live.

313
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,308
Do you know what death is?

314
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,814
When they're forgotten
by their loved ones.

315
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,433
Sir.

316
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,231
Let's set things up.

317
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,194
Call the doctor.

318
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,990
Yes, sir. I will.

319
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,410
At Death Talks?

320
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,121
If something like the Cherubim
video happens, Death Talks

321
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,456
could become a murder site.

322
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,002
Shall we set off? There's not much time.

323
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,591
NEW MESSAGE CHA YO-HAN

324
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,842
127 SEONGBUK-DONG, SEONGBUK-GU

325
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,720
"127 Seongbuk-dong, Seongbuk-gu"?

326
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,223
It's ex-minister Lee Won-gil's address.

327
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,197
-What is this?
-I said

328
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,907
it's ex-minister Lee Won-gil's address.

329
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,118
Why did you send me...

330
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,161
Do you know something?

331
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,788
You once told me about a drug.

332
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,711
What if there's a drug that allows you
to die comfortably in happiness?

333
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,379
-Cherubim.
-Cherubim.

334
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,965
Did you see the video?

335
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:14,966
Yes.

336
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,510
-You knew about the drug.
-Yes.

337
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,640
So what? What connection does
Cherubim have with ex-minister Lee?

338
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,060
Ex-minister Lee showed me that video...

339
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,647
and the location he did so was his house.

340
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,150
Isn't that enough?

341
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,362
-Arrest him quickly.
-Why me?

342
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,282
Why are you telling me this?

343
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,993
Considering who you're up against,

344
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:46,206
I need someone to investigate obsessively
without giving into suppression.

345
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,583
Your obsessiveness.

346
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,628
Use it in this case, not against me.

347
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,930
We must leave immediately in two teams.

348
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,100
Someone saw the Cherubim video
at ex-minister Lee Won-gil's home.

349
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,851
We'll go there. You go to Death Talks.

350
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,187
-Call the local precinct for help.
-Okay.

351
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,440
Sir. Where did you get the tip?

352
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,568
-That's a secret.
-Pardon?

353
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,446
I must protect my source. Let's go.

354
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,955
I understand.

355
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,252
Take care of the rest for me,

356
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,753
doctor.

357
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,922
DOCTOR

358
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,017
CHERUBIM

359
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,571
Death...

360
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,032
is a majestic grace that relieves us...

361
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,161
from all pain and sadness.

362
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,751
Goodbye, my friend.

363
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,811
CHERUBIM

364
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,916
No one is answering.

365
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,431
-Wait here until I call for you.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,421
He's dead.

367
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,801
CHERUBIM

368
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,057
Hi. How are things over there?

369
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,060
They sent a mass text
canceling the gathering.

370
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,895
But one of the members is gone.

371
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,313
Is he missing?

372
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,190
It's too early to say,

373
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,609
but he was here with the others

374
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,486
and disappeared right before we arrived.

375
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,571
We can't reach him.

376
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,369
Track his phone, identify him,
and go to his home and his relatives'.

377
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,620
Yes, sir.

378
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,805
Doctor.

379
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,775
Thank you...

380
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,157
for letting me die peacefully.

381
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,453
This drug, Cherubim,

382
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,623
is different from
all other euthanasia drugs.

383
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,750
To the very end...

384
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,836
this will make you feel happy.

385
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,268
-Hello.
-Doctor. Have some water.

386
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm Jung Chan-seok,
Zinmu Rijund's sales manager.

387
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,814
Hanse's Pain Management Center
will change completely.

388
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,487
Was that the doctor who just left?

389
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,405
If...

390
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,035
the euthanasia law isn't passed,

391
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,997
this drug will be of no use.

392
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,500
Our mission...

393
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:46,631
is to provide the drug the patient needs
when they need it.

394
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,844
Let's wait for that time to come, doctor.

395
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,931
Yes, sir.

396
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,690
CHERUBIM

397
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,385
-Yes?
-Ex-minister Lee Won-gil.

398
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,678
He's dead.

399
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,307
We must check, but I think
the cause of death is Cherubim.

400
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,935
What about Han Myung-oh?

401
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,395
We're looking for him.

402
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,148
I need to get your statement.

403
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,316
-Come to my office tomorrow.
-Sure.

404
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,238
I have a question.

405
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,781
Cherubim.

406
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,535
Why did you reject it?

407
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,415
If I were to obtain such a drug,

408
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,334
I wouldn't cling to find answers,

409
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,878
think, or worry endlessly.

410
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,882
About what?

411
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,800
What I can do for a patient

412
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,178
whose hope is fading.

413
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,805
I wouldn't care to think anymore.

414
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,310
Most doctors would end up like that.

415
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,896
So would most patient's families...

416
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,981
and patients.

417
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,734
Sir.

418
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,239
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

419
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,825
About...

420
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,244
the post on your hospital's website.

421
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,163
That doesn't matter.

422
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,014
I found this.

423
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,726
A research team at Clevlend Clinic

424
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,355
is studying pain management
with the CIPA gene.

425
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,774
Kang Si-young.

426
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,402
Thank you.

427
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,698
Next time we meet,

428
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,283
I want you to be healthy.

429
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,121
DEAR PROF. CHA YO-HAN

430
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,623
FIRST, THANKS FOR THE INTEREST
IN OUR RESEARCH AND FOR APPLYING

431
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,000
I REVIEWED YOUR CAREER AND RESEARCH
ACHIEVEMENTS THOROUGHLY,

432
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,254
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE RESEARCH WE'RE DOING
AND YOUR BACKGROUND ARE A GOOD FIT

433
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:35,550
SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN OUR RESEARCH LAB

434
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,970
I'D LIKE A DISCUSSION WITH YOU
TO JOIN IN FUTURE RESEARCH

435
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,104
KANG SI-YOUNG

436
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,784
Hello?

437
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,244
How are you?

438
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,371
I'm fine.

439
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,040
The disciplinary committee hasn't met yet.

440
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,458
No one knows the result.

441
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,211
That's important,

442
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,547
but your health is even more important.

443
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,340
Let's exercise together from now on.

444
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,848
Dr. Cha.

445
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,725
Si-young.

446
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,855
-Yes?
-I told you before...

447
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,984
That I'd try not to make you worry.

448
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,986
Yes.

449
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,867
Don't worry about me too much.

450
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,913
Don't talk as if I do nothing but worry.

451
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,539
You do.

452
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,125
I'm being hopeful, not worrying.

453
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,795
I want to live...

454
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,050
a long, healthy life
with the person I like.

455
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,641
-I know.
-You don't know.

456
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,975
You don't know anything.

457
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,983
I apologize.

458
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,276
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

459
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,071
Why should you apologize?

460
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,577
Go to bed.

461
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,496
It's late.

462
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,417
Sleep well.

463
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,711
Sweet dreams.

464
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,505
You too.

465
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,457
STATEMENT, CHA YO-HAN

466
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,644
We searched ex-minister Lee's home
and Zinmu Rijund.

467
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,480
We found nothing on Cherubim.

468
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,608
They made the drug,
so there must be a chemical formula.

469
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,402
In someone's head.

470
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,325
Han Myung-oh left Korea yesterday
with Jung Chan-seok.

471
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,869
-Jung Chan-seok?
-Yes.

472
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,454
Zinmu Rijund's sales manager.

473
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,165
He used to be a doctor in the Netherlands.

474
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,209
He got interested in
the euthanasia law, came here,

475
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,420
and helped develop Cherubim.

476
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,672
We asked Interpol to get them both.

477
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,885
What?

478
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,595
Do you have something to say?

479
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,102
Last night, I got these text messages.

480
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,023
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,
THAT I TRIED TO HELP MYSELF

481
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,900
I thought about what you said.

482
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,610
That I tried to help myself.

483
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,783
The ex-minister and I had other options
if it were just about us.

484
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,329
We could just go to a country
that allows euthanasia.

485
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,000
But there are many people...

486
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,087
who can't afford to go
or don't have the opportunity to.

487
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,632
To them, Cherubim is their only hope.

488
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,219
I'll leave that hope intact...

489
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,346
INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

490
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,474
...until the day comes
when I can help them.

491
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,143
I'll take a photo.

492
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,105
As evidence.

493
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,152
Also...

494
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,074
one of Death Talks' members

495
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,119
was found dead
in Gyeonggi Province's mountain.

496
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,468
CHERUBIM

497
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,180
The moment he died,

498
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,641
did he really feel at ease?

499
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,145
It may seem like a peaceful death,

500
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,938
but I think...

501
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,107
he felt lonely.

502
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,154
He was alone, without family...

503
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,824
in a place that became a crime scene.

504
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,538
I'd like to go if we're done.

505
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,166
Thank you.

506
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,093
I kept my options open.

507
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,013
Be careful.

508
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,933
You're in no condition...

509
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,894
to work too hard.

510
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,199
SUBJECT OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

511
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,619
We'll start the disciplinary committee

512
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,954
against Cha Yo-han
of Anesthesiology and Pain Management.

513
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,415
Dr. Cha will not be present.

514
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,252
Half of those present
must vote to pass a verdict.

515
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,295
If it's a tie,

516
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,797
the director has the deciding vote.

517
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,966
Let's begin.

518
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,186
YES

519
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,896
NO

520
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,022
YES

521
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,275
VOTE ON DISCIPLINARY ACTION

522
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,860
NO

523
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,663
They started.

524
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,166
What now?
We have to go in before it's over.

525
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,753
We're ready.

526
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:29,964
Good job.

527
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,884
Isn't that them?

528
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,982
We have an unexpected result.

529
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,735
The number of votes...

530
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,820
AGREE: 8, DISAGREE: 8

531
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,238
...is equally divided.

532
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,992
That means you have the final call.

533
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,702
Yes.

534
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,204
Here's my decision.

535
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,208
Cha Yo-han of Anesthesiology and
Pain Management shall be dismissed--

536
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,544
Wait!

537
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,839
What's going on?
How dare you come in here?

538
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:13,966
Excuse us.

539
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,344
But...

540
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,223
it's not just us here.

541
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,933
What?

542
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,953
Hello, Mr. Choi.

543
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,248
I'm Kang Si-young
at Hanse's Pain Management Center.

544
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,168
Hello, Father Yu. It's Kang Mi-rae.

545
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,085
How are you?

546
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,630
I'd like to speak to Mr. Joo Hyung-woo.

547
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,342
I called to ask for a favor
regarding Dr. Cha Yo-han.

548
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,093
I called to ask for a favor.

549
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,928
Really?

550
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,306
He's overseas right now?

551
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,600
When does he return?

552
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,485
Hello.

553
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,405
I'm Joo Hyung-woo. Dr. Cha diagnosed me

554
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,532
with myasthenia gravis
and I'm in recovery.

555
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,662
I'm Yu Deok-kyu.
Dr. Cha diagnosed me with melioidosis

556
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,622
and I'm fully recovered.

557
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:30,417
I'm Choi Seung-won. Dr. Cha diagnosed me

558
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,921
with zoster sine herpete
and freed me from pain.

559
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,256
I'm Choi Seung-won's daughter,
Choi Seul-ah.

560
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,802
I'm the mother of Lee Gi-seok,
a patient here

561
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,596
who suffers from
the same illness as Dr. Cha.

562
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,308
My son was unconscious.

563
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:50,145
Thanks to Dr. Cha, he was diagnosed
and is now being treated.

564
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,026
This committee
didn't gather to hear you speak.

565
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,445
There are hospital rules to be followed.

566
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,197
What is a hospital?

567
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,367
Isn't it where doctors cure patients?

568
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,162
How can you say
the patients' voices don't count?

569
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,791
On behalf of the patients,

570
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,211
we demand that Dr. Cha
be allowed to return.

571
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,608
We gave an interview
before coming in here.

572
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,239
Why did you gather to do this?

573
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,743
We're here because
we heard Hanse Medical Center

574
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,036
banned a skilled doctor
who really cares for his patients

575
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,914
from treating them
just because he has CIPA.

576
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:55,085
Is that skilled doctor
the one who diagnosed you last time?

577
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,337
-Dr. Cha Yo-han?
-Yes.

578
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,508
He's a doctor that patients truly need.

579
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,761
JOO HYUNG-WOO GIVES INTERVIEW,
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

580
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,683
When a hospital fires a doctor
the patients want...

581
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,478
what do you think will happen?

582
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,064
-Time will tell.
-The patients want him?

583
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,276
You're just a few, and it's not your call.

584
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,903
There aren't just a few.

585
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,625
These are petitions
requesting Dr. Cha's return,

586
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,376
signed by our patients.

587
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,378
If you agree, please sign it.

588
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,755
Can you sign this?

589
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,716
Please sign and say yes.

590
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

591
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,303
PETITION

592
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,722
-I signed mine.
-Did you? Thanks.

593
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,015
Thank you.

594
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,476
PETITION

595
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,811
KWON SEO-JIN

596
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,236
PETITION

597
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,613
KIM HO-JUN

598
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,220
Well done, everyone.

599
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,185
Thank you so much for coming over to help.

600
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,855
Don't thank me. I had to come.

601
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,024
He's right. Thank you
for asking me to come.

602
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:47,030
I'll pray that Gi-seok gets better soon.

603
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,323
Thank you.

604
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,701
Well done.

605
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,452
Good job.

606
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:01,169
The most-searched keyword right now
is Hanse Medical Center.

607
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,463
The second is Joo Hyung-woo.

608
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,883
The third is CIPA.

609
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,303
"Lee Gi-seok has
the same illness as Dr. Cha.

610
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,889
Shouldn't Dr. Cha be allowed to
treat him until he recovers?"

611
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,892
That's the public sentiment.

612
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,440
Director Kang cares most about
what people think.

613
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,986
He'll vote to bring Dr. Cha back,

614
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,987
don't you think?

615
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,864
Let's wait and see.

616
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,285
Hello?

617
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:34,912
What?

618
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,788
Lee Gi-seok?

619
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,629
Wait here, ma'am.

620
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,089
RESTRICTED AREA

621
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,270
You aren't responding
to the current treatment.

622
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,981
The only other option

623
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,817
is a high-dosage pulse therapy.

624
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,654
If it further weakens your immune system,

625
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,031
you won't be able to take it.

626
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,872
Why did you gather to do this?

627
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,792
We're here because
we heard Hanse Medical Center

628
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,294
banned a skilled doctor
who really cares for his patients

629
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,755
from treating them
just because he has CIPA.

630
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,259
Is that skilled doctor
the one who diagnosed you last time?

631
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,553
-Dr. Cha Yo-han?
-Yes.

632
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,100
He's a doctor that patients truly need.

633
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,479
Not just me, but many patients think so.

634
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,648
We plan to tell the hospital staff.

635
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,359
You did so much.

636
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,486
I went to so many hospitals.

637
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,114
No one could help and the pain worsened.

638
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,199
-No doctor or family...
-Yes?

639
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,244
Dr. Cha? Gi-seok can't open his eyes.

640
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,579
Pupillary reflex is slow.

641
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,498
Vitals stable,
so we took him off medication,

642
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,958
but he developed bradycardia

643
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,127
-and his BP is rising. It's 160--
-In relaxation phase?

644
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,796
Seventy-six.
I think the brain pressure's rising.

645
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,965
Raise his breathing
and put him on mannitol.

646
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,091
MANNITOL FOR BRAIN PRESSURE

647
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,551
I'll come right over.

648
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,059
GYEONGSEO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

649
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,940
Hanse Medical Center, please.

650
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,387
-Doctor.
-How is he?

651
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,973
His pupils are fully dilated.

652
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,017
SIGN OF BRAIN DAMAGE

653
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,894
Drain the abscess or he'll lose his brain.

654
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,521
Call Neurosurgery and book an OR.

655
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,190
And...

656
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,068
get his mother's consent.

657
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,990
RESTRICTED AREA

658
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,911
We can insert a tube to drain
the abscess and reduce the pressure.

659
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,871
But the pus has spread
throughout the brain,

660
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,456
and we can't get it all.

661
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,750
The brain stem is too risky to touch.

662
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,170
We can't guarantee his brain
will fully function after the surgery.

663
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,173
You know we can't control
the pressure with medication alone.

664
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,092
Surgery is the only option.

665
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,100
Will the operation...

666
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,019
make him better?

667
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,773
He has serious neurological issues.

668
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,402
Whether he'll go back to being
the Gi-seok you knew,

669
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,238
we can't say for sure.

670
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,699
If he doesn't have surgery now,

671
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,244
he might become brain-dead.

672
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,555
The surgery requested by
Anesthesiology has no point.

673
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,854
Hello.

674
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,816
OPERATING ROOM STATUS

675
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,486
-Dr. Cha.
-Why don't we have an OR ready?

676
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,029
I just got a call.

677
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,573
Department is still discussing it.

678
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,996
Ma'am.

679
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,873
-You signed a surgery consent form?
-Yes.

680
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,583
Gi-seok will have surgery now.

681
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,170
What are you doing? Move him now.

682
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,212
Dr. Cha.

683
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,922
The location is really bad.

684
00:52:56,006 --> 00:53:00,010
You have to think rationally
about how dangerous it is

685
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,428
and how likely he is to recover.

686
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,387
"How dangerous it is"?

687
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,805
Without surgery, he'll die.

688
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,143
Switch to an Ambu bag.

689
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,775
What are you doing?

690
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,903
Rapid increase of brain pressure's
damaging his brain.

691
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,864
-He needs surgery before he's brain-dead.
-I saw his charts.

692
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,991
You know he's unlikely
to recover from surgery.

693
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,284
If he doesn't get surgery,

694
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,661
instead of being unlikely to recover,
he won't recover.

695
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,998
Even if he recovers,
he won't go back to being normal.

696
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,124
In the worst-case scenario,

697
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,668
he'll have to spend
the rest of his life in that state.

698
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,755
Is the Ambu bag ready?

699
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,924
-Move.
-Dr. Cha.

700
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,884
I said move. If we don't do it, he'll die!

701
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,802
You might inflict even more pain.

702
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,482
Are you really doing this for the patient?

703
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,322
Is this really consistent with
the judgments you've made so far

704
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,032
as a doctor?

705
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,830
Move.

706
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,583
His guardian gave her consent.

707
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,336
So move.

708
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,924
Gi-seok.

709
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,968
Gi-seok.

710
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,221
It's bradycardia.

711
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,889
His blood pressure is 65 over 20.

712
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,848
His SpO2 is 80.

713
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,725
Give him one ampoule of atropine.

714
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,436
Gi-seok.

715
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,649
He's not responding. Epinephrine.

716
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,865
Gi-seok.

717
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,083
Ma'am, you can't enter.

718
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,293
Please wait here.

719
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,210
Let's go in!

720
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,714
RESTRICTED AREA

721
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,424
Gi-seok.

722
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,437
Let me do it.

723
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,994
Dr. Cha, let me take over.

724
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,298
Gi-seok's guardian wants to talk to you.

725
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,994
Doctor.

726
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,795
Live.

727
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,465
Live, Gi-seok.

728
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,967
Please live.

729
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,388
Gi-seok.

730
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,111
Dr. Cha.

731
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:47,946
Stop.

732
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,200
Gi-seok's mother wants you to stop.

733
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,707
She doesn't want him to have surgery.

734
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,792
Gi-seok.

735
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,129
Live. Live, Gi-seok.

736
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,096
Gi-seok.

737
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,765
Hang in there.

738
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,645
Next time we meet,

739
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,355
I want you to be healthy.

740
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,566
Do you...

741
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,026
have the same disease as me?

742
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,196
Just like you.

743
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,532
All right. Just like me.

744
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,568
Let him go now.

745
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,495
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

746
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,399
Aren't you going to ask me
why I chose you?

747
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,903
Yes?

748
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,365
Why don't you ask him directly?

749
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,326
Why would I? He's not going to stay
at our hospital anyway.

750
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,411
Si-young!

751
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,371
Wake up.

752
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,998
Why would I go there?

753
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,541
If you don't, you'll regret it later.

754
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,752
I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier.
