NOVEMBER 10TH VITALS

4
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,129
SENDER: CHA YO-HAN
RECIPIENT: KANG SI-YOUNG

5
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,433
TEMPERATURE, PULSE, SATURATION, BP

6
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,691
Be like this every day.

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,323
There she goes again.

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,991
She's always here at 7 a.m., right?

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,118
That's right. She's been like that
for months now,

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,662
checking Dr. Cha's vitals.

11
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,164
What's wrong with that?

12
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,374
I'm saying they're cool.

13
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,627
Dr. Cha, who sends them daily
without fail,

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,337
and Si-young, who checks them daily.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,130
-Did it come?
-Hold on.

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,054
NO NEW MAIL

17
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,432
It didn't come in?

18
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,061
I wonder what happened.

19
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,615
It didn't come in?

20
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,867
DR. CHA YO-HAN

21
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,007
How long has it been
since you spoke to him?

22
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,761
A few days.

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,139
He seemed busy.

24
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,851
Let's wait for a bit.

25
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,103
Yes, let's wait.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,069
Dr. Cha, is something wrong?

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,990
You didn't e-mail me today.
Please get back to me.

28
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,368
YOU DIDN'T E-MAIL ME TODAY
PLEASE GET BACK TO ME

WISHING TO MEET SOMEDAY

31
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,182
A woman aged 52.

32
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,934
She was admitted for hiccups
that went on for nearly 48 hours.

33
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,937
Hiccups might seem harmless,
but what's important here is…

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,151
that it went on for 48 hours.

35
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,237
What can cause hiccups that last
longer than 48 hours,

36
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
-Dr. Heo?
-Pardon?

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,535
Normally, hiccups are caused
by irritated phrenic nerves

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,081
from abdominal inflation
or acid reflux disease.

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,084
But hiccups that last
for a long time are caused…

40
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,004
-by the brain…
-And?

41
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,424
Myocardial infarction, pneumonia,
bronchitis, asthma, and so on.

42
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,968
Gosh.

43
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,886
Dr. Kim.

44
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,724
DR. YO-HAN'S NOTEBOOK

45
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,310
Diagnosis is not a competition.

46
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,105
-What else?
-Goiters, throat tumors, gastritis,

47
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,983
gastric cancer, pancreatitis,
pancreatic cancer, and liver diseases.

48
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,319
Excellent.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,659
I'm sorry I'm late.

50
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,079
Anyway, this is a real emergency.
Request tests immediately

51
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,039
and consult Neurology and Pulmonology.

52
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,415
-Yes!
-Yes, we will.

53
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,964
What happened? Have you heard from him?

54
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,341
No.

55
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,552
No calls, texts, or e-mails?

56
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,972
Nothing.

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,309
It must have slipped his mind
because he's busy.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,728
He never forgot once
in the past three months.

59
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,772
There's no way it slipped his mind.

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,325
Are you going to call his lab?

61
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,101
DR. LEE YOO-JOON

62
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,145
Dr. Cha has been out of reach?

63
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,522
All day.

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,066
I have to go.

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,111
-Where are you going?
-To Dr. Cha? Right now?

66
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,405
He's never been out of reach
like this before.

67
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,324
He's at least been sending
an e-mail every day.

68
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,284
Something must have happened.

69
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,684
TERMINAL 2, DEPARTURES 3RD FLOOR

70
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,532
-Hello?
-Hello?

71
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,089
Dr. Cha, I was worried about you.

72
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,676
Call me as soon as you're
finished with your project.

73
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,344
Please.

74
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,849
CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU'RE FINISHED
WITH YOUR PROJECT, PLEASE

75
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,938
You're the only person

76
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,442
that ever understood me.

77
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,279
My illness

78
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,448
and me as a person.

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,454
My world that was neither hot nor cold

80
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,416
turned warm after I met you.

81
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,503
Why didn't you give me an answer

82
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,172
when you had such a great one?

83
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
Because it means…

84
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,597
I love you.

85
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,560
How can someone who's leaving
confess his love?

86
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,686
You can.

87
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,690
You can talk about love at any time.

88
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,567
Even more so
if you don't know your tomorrow.

89
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,406
I love you.

90
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,076
I love you too.

91
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,083
Hey, Dr. Cha. You're doing well, right?

92
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,336
It's been a month
since I couldn't reach you.

93
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,506
I heard you're busy.

94
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,842
But I'm worried,
and I want to know how you're doing.

95
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,886
Please reply once you read my e-mail.

96
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,930
HEY, DR. CHA. YOU'RE DOING WELL, RIGHT?

97
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,682
PLEASE REPLY ONCE YOU READ MY E-MAIL

98
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,890
6 MONTHS LATER

99
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,642
MAIL LOGIN

100
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,936
NO NEW MAIL

101
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,657
I have big news.

102
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,411
What's the big news?

103
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,249
What is it?

104
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,795
What is it about?

105
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,639
My gosh, it's Dr. Cha!

106
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,766
-What?
-My gosh, seriously.

107
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,727
-What is it?
-It's about Dr. Cha.

108
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,189
DR. CHA'S NEW CHALLENGE,

109
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,316
"Dr. Cha, who's known to have
a mutated version

110
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,860
of the ntrk1 gene which is
the cause of CIPA,

111
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,071
joined the medical research team

112
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,240
and helped accelerate
the research of medication

113
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,826
that's been showing strong signs
of pain-relieving effects."

114
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,871
I guess Dr. Cha is doing very well.

115
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,459
Judging by how much
he's achieved in just one year,

116
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,379
it's pretty obvious
that he must be really busy.

117
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,798
Yes, you're right.
No wonder he's been out of touch.

118
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
-Yes, of course.
-Let me see him again.

119
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,431
Dr. Cha has lost so much weight.

120
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,765
You're right.

121
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,309
He's participating
both as a patient and a researcher.

122
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,937
So he's probably twice as busy.

123
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,402
Let's go have a drink.

124
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,279
-Yes, let's go have a drink.
-Okay.

125
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,282
-Let's go. Where should we go?
-Come on.

126
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,389
Dr. Kang, you should understand him.

127
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,434
Guys have trouble
doing multiple things at once.

128
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,352
He's right.

129
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,605
On top of that,
he's working on a huge project.

130
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,441
-It won't be easy for him to contact you.
-Yes, of course.

131
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,277
-That's practically impossible.
-Exactly.

132
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,488
That's enough.

133
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,740
Don't stop me.

134
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,506
I personally think men and women

135
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,592
need to be like cats
when it comes to love.

136
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,970
Cats know how to make you feel desperate.

137
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,640
They're different from puppies
who are always just focused on you.

138
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,391
Are you calling my sister a puppy?

139
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,519
Did you just compare her to a dog?

140
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,021
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Are you saying she's wrong

141
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,191
-for giving him unconditional attention?
-Why are you taking it out on me?

142
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,777
-I like puppies too.
-Forget it.

143
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,404
I don't want to hear
another word from you men.

144
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,073
Let's drink, Si-young.

145
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,890
I guess I'll never be number one

146
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,143
to Dr. Cha.

147
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,023
Stop crying. Don't cry.

148
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,570
His patients always came first.

149
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,573
And now, he's more focused
on his research.

150
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,035
That mean jerk.

151
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:35,416
Yes, he's a mean jerk. What a mean jerk.

152
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,714
Don't cry.

153
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,842
Si-young, just forget about him.

154
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,304
How can I forget about him?

155
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,764
I can't forget about him.

156
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,795
Si-young, let's go.

157
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,828
3 YEARS LATER

158
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,792
"Suspected to have acute appendicitis."

159
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,586
Who did this?

160
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
Me.

161
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,260
You tried your best.

162
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,599
You should either be able
to diagnose or treat a patient.

163
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,643
At least have some experience
for goodness' sake.

164
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,395
You're a second-year resident.

165
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,605
The best you could think
of was acute appendicitis?

166
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,275
I told you that you're not
in school anymore.

167
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,152
The patients aren't here
so you could practice.

168
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,320
"You did a great job for a resident."

169
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,657
If that's the kind of compliment
you want to hear,

170
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,783
just go back to school!

171
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,993
Respond to her.

172
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,994
We'll try harder!

173
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,163
This is so frustrating!

174
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,665
You guys are unbelievable.
Get out of my way.

175
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,007
Hey. What was her nickname again?

176
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,302
-Crazy Kang.
-"Crazy Kang"?

177
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,345
Crazy Kang Si-young.

178
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,619
Excuse me.

179
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,543
It's been a while.

180
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,390
Have you been well?

181
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,062
Yes.

182
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,407
ANESTHESIOLOGIST KANG SI-YOUNG

183
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,659
Are you a first-year fellow now?

184
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,829
Yes.

185
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,252
Congratulations.

186
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,255
I saw your research results.

187
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,466
It passed the first round
of clinical trials, right?

188
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,092
Thanks.

189
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,304
How is your health?

190
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,098
It's become a lot better.

191
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,809
I'm fine now.

192
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,148
I'm relieved.

193
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,735
When did you get back to Korea?

194
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,570
About a year ago.

195
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,994
Why are you here, by the way?

196
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,006
What are you doing here at this hospital?

197
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,808
Hello?

198
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,145
Okay. I'll be right there.

199
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,193
I have to go see a patient.

200
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,654
Sure, go ahead.

201
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,437
HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE CENTER
MANAGEMENT PLANS

202
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,147
OBJECTIVES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CENTER

203
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,858
-Hospice care?
-Yes.

204
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,362
We have only 20 beds
for hospice care at the moment.

205
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,239
I'd like to expand it
into a hospice and palliative care center

206
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,449
for terminal patients.

207
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,327
Terminal patients cannot be cured.
We can only sustain their state.

208
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,079
And?

209
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,456
We're not a nursing hospital.

210
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,999
It won't help the finances either.

211
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:00,337
Do we really need to provide
hospice care for terminal patients?

212
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,966
Our goal as doctors and as a hospital
should not just be to cure diseases.

213
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,677
We should try to improve the quality
of life of our patients as well.

214
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,848
Death does not happen in a moment.
It is a process.

215
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,727
It is also our task

216
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,146
to help patients in their dying process.

217
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,403
I completely agree with Chairwoman Min.

218
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,697
So far, we've been sending
patients home when we feel

219
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,658
there's nothing more we can do.

220
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,412
Now we'll be able to feel less guilty.

221
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,543
I think it's a good idea.

222
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
It's a difficult
and unprofitable business.

223
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,630
Why is she pushing ahead with it?

224
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,173
Exactly.

225
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,385
Chairwoman Min tends to be too reckless.

226
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,852
Tae-kyung, Dr. Cha is here.

227
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,896
-Is he? Tell him to come see me.
-Okay.

228
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,781
What's wrong?

229
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,618
I'm sorry I'm late.

230
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,371
What's the problem?

231
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,416
She was treated by me, and she's
suddenly having bad abdominal pain.

232
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,376
Analgesics won't work.

233
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,259
The pain is gone now.

234
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,095
-Pardon?
-Why?

235
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,058
Are you okay now?

236
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,936
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

237
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,190
One moment the pain is killing me,
the next I'm fine.

238
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,031
Big news! You're not going to believe it!

239
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,621
Sorry.

240
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,461
Dr. Lee. There's no family history
of convulsive disease.

241
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,922
Her echocardiogram,
lung and abdomen X-rays,

242
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,965
and CT scans show no abnormalities either.

243
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,300
-Well…
-We're doing

244
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,719
a gastroscopy and a colonoscopy
this afternoon.

245
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,388
As we found no abnormalities last time,

246
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:19,017
we'll do a fecal immunochemical test
and also a stool culture this time.

247
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,937
What is it, Dr. Heo?
What have you been trying to say?

248
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,440
The thing is, Dr. Cha is
in our hospital right now.

249
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,778
Dr. Cha? Right now?

250
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,364
Yes. Someone saw him.

251
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,700
Unbelievable.
When did he get back from the US?

252
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,953
Will he work here again?

253
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,206
I'm not sure about that.
But from what I heard, he looks amazing.

254
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,125
He was always handsome,
but he's become a lot fitter now.

255
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,586
Anyway,
he looks absolutely charismatic now.

256
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,255
I'm not even surprised.

257
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,424
His research became such a huge success.

258
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,637
His drug won an exclusive contract
with a big American company.

259
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,438
-Let me take this patient.
-She's my patient.

260
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,440
Please let me take her.

261
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,110
I want to keep myself busy today.

262
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,240
Are you okay?

263
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,075
Do you hear me?

264
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,160
-Ma'am.
-Are you okay?

265
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,245
-Ma'am.
-Sorry.

266
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,914
Ma'am, how is your pain?

267
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,292
She complained of sudden nausea.

268
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,420
Yes. Now she has convulsive stomach pain.

269
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,589
Let me take a look.

270
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,399
Did she fall asleep?

271
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,534
What could it be?

272
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,578
-Well…
-Do you have an idea?

273
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,875
I don't. But why don't we ask
Dr. Cha's opinion?

274
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,710
-Dr. Cha's opinion?
-Yes.

275
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,589
I'm sorry to interrupt,

276
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,341
but who is this Dr. Cha?

277
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,184
You guys might not know,
but he is a true legend.

278
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,311
His nickname was Dr. Ten Seconds.

279
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,979
He could diagnose any patient right away.

280
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,398
That brings back memories.

281
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,401
In those days, I couldn't even
eat chicken breast freely.

282
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,779
Now that he's been brought up,
should we really try?

283
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,032
Try what? Can't we do anything on our own?

284
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,408
We did fine until now!

285
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,535
Right, Doctor?

286
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,954
What? Yes, we did fine.

287
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,340
What got into her?

288
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,635
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

289
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,305
Did you see Dr. Cha?

290
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,686
You did.

291
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,480
What did he say? When did he come back?

292
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,443
-A year ago.
-A year ago?

293
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,825
Why did he show up after years of silence?

294
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,223
-It's been a while.
-It has, Chairwoman Min.

295
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,018
I heard you passed the first round
of the FDA's screening.

296
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,771
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

297
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,777
ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT PLANS

298
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,446
OBJECTIVES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CENTER

299
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,595
You want to put together
a palliative care team?

300
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,805
Yes. I'll put together a team

301
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,893
that can manage pain and
the psychological aspects of care.

302
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,936
Unfortunately,

303
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,023
us, doctors can't cure death.

304
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,399
But

305
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,277
we can do something greater.

306
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,156
We can soothe the minds and bodies

307
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,033
of dying patients.

308
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,539
I'd like you to head
the pain-management side.

309
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,753
What do you think?

310
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,300
Hello?

311
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,885
-Dr. Cha?
-Yes.

312
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,387
Did you see Dr. Kang?

313
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,891
Yes, finally.

314
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,311
Briefly, a while ago.

315
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,069
Dr. Cha. We're trying to
diagnose this patient.

316
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,155
Really?

317
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,161
She woke up.

318
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
You woke up.

319
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,672
-How are you feeling?
-How long did I sleep?

320
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,758
For about an hour.

321
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,096
That's nothing.
I once slept for 12 hours straight.

322
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,931
-Twelve hours straight?
-Yes.

323
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,810
By the way, when can I eat?

324
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,442
Eat slowly.

325
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,528
Thank you, Doctor.

326
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,949
You've been like this
for more than 10 years now?

327
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,160
You feel stomach pain
about five times a day.

328
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,955
The pain can last anywhere
from one minute to five minutes.

329
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,709
But it is not accompanied
by vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.

330
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,169
After the symptoms appear,
you fall asleep.

331
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,880
But you've never lost consciousness.

332
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,215
Lately, various symptoms such as

333
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,467
mild stomach pain and
abdominal inflation have appeared.

334
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,512
Sometimes, you experience severe
stomach pain along with nausea.

335
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,307
-That's right.
-The test results are out.

336
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,396
They're normal, right?

337
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,773
Yes.

338
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,985
Both the CBC and chemistry
came back normal.

339
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,154
Let me see.

340
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,493
Her digestive enzyme levels are
all normal too.

341
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,038
I told you.

342
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,124
All the tests I've done so far
came back normal.

343
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,128
Do you believe what I say?

344
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,342
Every hospital says

345
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,094
it must be irritable bowel syndrome
or psychosomatic illness.

346
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,931
Some doctors even suspected
Munchausen syndrome.

347
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,476
A MENTAL DISORDER WHERE THE PATIENT
FAKES ILLNESS TO GAIN SYMPATHY

348
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,564
It must be because
most test results came back normal.

349
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,107
Exactly.

350
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,153
So do you think I'm lying or not?

351
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,956
There's something
one of our professors said.

352
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,290
"Remember this.

353
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,002
The cause might be unknown,
but no pain is without a cause."

354
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,847
I never know when my pain will come back.

355
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,517
So I feel anxious all the time.

356
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,813
"Not now.

357
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,942
Please let me suffer in a little while."

358
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,819
That's what I pray.

359
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,738
Doctor.

360
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,536
Please set me free.

361
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,455
I beg you.

362
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,462
We'll do everything we can.

363
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,756
Please hang in there.

364
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,220
When you're done eating,
let's go do some more tests.

365
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,222
Okay.

366
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,027
What is it?

367
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,739
It's all in English.
Are you good at English?

368
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,534
It's from my friend, and I was going
to skip it because it's in English.

369
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,705
But then I saw Dr. Cha's name right here.

370
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,332
What is it even about?

371
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,628
What is it?

372
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,021
Come with me for a second.

373
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,366
Three months into his research in the US,

374
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,993
Dr. Cha almost died from PCP.

375
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,495
A LUNG INFECTION CAUSED BY A FUNGUS

376
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,622
That's exactly
when you lost contact with him.

377
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,878
-So?
-He almost died.

378
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,338
That's why he couldn't talk to you.

379
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,757
After he recovered,
he focused on his research.

380
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,886
He might not have much time left,
so he wanted to give it his all.

381
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,056
That's very like him. I know that.

382
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,768
Still, isn't it understandable that
he was out of reach at that time?

383
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,395
At that time, yes.
But what about after he recovered?

384
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,607
He's been in Korea for a year now.
How could he never…

385
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,820
Forget it. There's no point now.

386
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,335
HAVE YOU DONE A BRAINWAVE TEST ON HER?

387
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,090
Have you done a brainwave test on her?

388
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,271
Hello?

389
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,399
Dr. Cha, is this you?

390
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,944
Both the CBC and chemistry
came back normal.

391
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,320
Let me see.

392
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,201
Her digestive enzyme levels are
all normal too.

393
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,831
What do you mean?

394
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,000
Did you do a general brainwave test?

395
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,253
Or did she take it before?

396
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,634
Last year, another hospital did
a brain MRI and brainwave test.

397
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,845
And the result?

398
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,853
They found nothing amiss.

399
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,355
-Was it a general brainwave test?
-Yes.

400
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,774
It was a general brainwave test.

401
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,068
Monitor her brainwaves for 24 hours.

402
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,952
Why'd you do that?

403
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,498
I told you to tell me if you're sick.

404
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,710
You were so sick that you almost died.

405
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,420
Didn't you think of me?

406
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,924
You could've died.

407
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,176
How could you not even tell me?

408
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,597
For three years, I was sure of nothing.

409
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,393
My health,

410
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,563
or the time I had left.

411
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,024
But…

412
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,652
I was sure of only one thing.

413
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:22,365
I believed that our love
wouldn't end so easily.

414
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,036
I didn't want to repeat that.

415
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,750
When I recovered my health
and when I could convince you too,

416
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,463
I wanted to return then.

417
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,425
Sorry, Si-young.

418
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,054
I'm sorry.

419
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,701
But…

420
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,621
I don't think you have time to shed tears.

421
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,623
Go to your patient.

422
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,959
Go and do as I suggested.

423
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,669
Monitor her brainwaves for 24 hours.

424
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,628
Why…

425
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,298
do you want me to do that?

426
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,633
She complained of a sudden stomachache,

427
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,218
which then suddenly went away.

428
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,929
After that, although
she remains conscious,

429
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,098
she suddenly falls asleep.

430
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,183
If no painkillers work on her,

431
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,519
and yet all her test results
come back normal…

432
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,479
On the 24-hour brainwave monitor,

433
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,565
if we see epileptic waves
when her stomach aches,

434
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,818
it's abdominal epilepsy.

435
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,486
It's a possibility.

436
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,531
All the symptoms make sense.

437
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,867
We never thought it could be epilepsy.

438
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,953
That's why painkillers and
digestive medicines didn't work.

439
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,873
An anti-seizure drug
will work dramatically on her.

440
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,417
It would.

441
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,057
-Dr. Cha!
-Dr. Cha!

442
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,391
-Dr. Cha!
-Dr. Cha!

443
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,646
How long has it been?
I missed you so much.

444
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,983
Why didn't you call us?
We waited for you to call.

445
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,862
I missed you two a lot too.

446
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,323
I missed you so much.

447
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,991
Dr. Cha.

448
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,494
You looked so frail in the photo.

449
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,205
I missed you so much, Dr. Cha.

450
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,251
-Okay.
-I missed you.

451
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,466
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

452
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,318
-Abdominal epilepsy?
-Yes.

453
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,319
I asked her,

454
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,613
and no one monitored
her brainwaves for 24 hours.

455
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,950
Shall we contact Neurology?

456
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,911
Yes, let's do it now.

457
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,372
Dr. Lee.

458
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,041
-What is it?
-We met Dr. Cha.

459
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,252
Where? Is he really back?

460
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,294
He is.

461
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,547
He'll join us for dinner.

462
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,923
We should get together.

463
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,883
-AP, AP.
-AP.

464
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,722
What's the matter?

465
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm so pleased.

466
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,811
I missed Dr. Cha so much.

467
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,107
-Me too.
-Me too.

468
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,610
My gosh…

469
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,321
-I'll call Neurology.
-Okay.

470
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,244
Doctor.

471
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,592
Good luck.

472
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,094
We'll check the results in 24 hours.

473
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,934
We want to see
if you show signs of epilepsy.

474
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,311
It can be uncomfortable.

475
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,564
I can do anything if it's for a diagnosis.

476
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,651
See you later.

477
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,490
-AP, AP, let's go!
-AP, AP, let's go!

478
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,704
Our dear Dr. Cha.

479
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,706
Tell us the truth.

480
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,042
Did you not miss us?

481
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,670
Why wouldn't he have?
That's against the rules.

482
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,172
There's no team like ours.

483
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,507
Exactly.

484
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,761
You coldly left us when we tried
so hard to make you stay.

485
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,054
He wasn't cold.

486
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,098
He left to do some amazing research.

487
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,643
And how beautiful are the results?

488
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,395
That's right. Using his own rare genes,

489
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,689
he developed a painkiller.

490
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,150
Come on, Dr. Heo.

491
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,654
So,

492
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,783
I get that you were really busy.

493
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,578
Why didn't you drop us a text?

494
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,707
You'd been back for a year
and we had no idea.

495
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,459
What?

496
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,838
Excuse me.

497
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,761
Don't stop me. Why do you
always ruin our team dinners?

498
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,638
-Don't stop me.
-Dr. Heo.

499
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,597
Jun.

500
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,810
Okay. See you tomorrow.

501
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,769
And…

502
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,606
I missed you.

503
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,235
Bye.

504
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,425
Good.

505
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,719
I should get going.

506
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,554
Right now?

507
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,014
-Yes.
-Wait, Dr. Cha.

508
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,849
Tell us just one thing.

509
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,268
Are you coming back?

510
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,980
You'll work with us, won't you?

511
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,690
Not really.

512
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,484
Then what? Will we not see you again?

513
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,111
Why not?

514
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,488
Must we work together to meet up?

515
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,492
It was good to see you all.
I'll see you again.

516
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,702
I'll take you home.

517
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,497
My car is at the hospital.

518
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,335
Bye. See you.

519
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,836
Don't get up. Stay.

520
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
Drink up.

521
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,330
Drink up.

522
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,207
Someone like him

523
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,709
must get a lot of offers.

524
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,505
I guess there's no going back.

525
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,464
Whatever the reality,

526
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,676
it's about how we feel.

527
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,474
Dr. Cha watched all along.

528
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,937
He watched you for the whole year.

529
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,979
Dr. Cha did?

530
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,315
What?

531
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,473
Was this photoshopped?

532
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,392
By whom?

533
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,269
Dr. Heo did.

534
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,916
PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER

535
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,443
What?

536
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,361
You've known all along?

537
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,032
Do you think he wouldn't have called me
for the whole year?

538
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,408
I knew everything.

539
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,453
-You did?
-Then was the crying an act?

540
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,748
Gosh, I got goosebumps.
You could be an actor.

541
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,000
Why didn't you tell us?

542
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,836
He was still being treated,

543
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,630
and he exercised so hard.

544
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,257
He only recently regained his health.

545
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,427
But he always had you on his mind!

546
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,133
Dr. Cha.

547
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:36,061
I just couldn't forget you.

548
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,567
I couldn't find anyone like you.

549
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,246
Don't leave anymore.

550
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,790
Don't go anywhere.

551
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,585
Stay by my side.

552
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:12,806
I will.

553
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,477
Kang Si-young,

554
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,688
I love you.

555
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,195
No cucumbers, please.

556
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,829
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

557
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,388
KANG SI-YOUNG

558
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,389
I'm so late!

559
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:40,852
Stay strong.

560
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,147
KANG SI-YOUNG

561
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,124
Hello?

562
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,918
I'm nearby.

563
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,628
I'll be right there.

564
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,886
Hello.

565
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,854
-It has been a while.
-It has.

566
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,866
Under the current law,

567
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,243
we can put a stop to unnecessary
life-prolonging treatment.

568
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,955
Since the law regards life,
rather than permitting,

569
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
the focus should be on limiting.

570
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,294
That limiting could obstruct
the right not to be in pain.

571
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,089
Supplying nutrients and drugs
sometimes even postpones death.

572
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,216
An increase in the scope of those rights

573
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,469
could turn society into one
that forces death.

574
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:59,181
Before hasty and drastic changes,
our society must first

575
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,559
gain a more mature awareness
of death itself.

576
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,562
Everyone here respects life,

577
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,774
which is why no one should give up easily,

578
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,861
or left to suffer in pain for too long.

579
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:17,532
I believe that hospice and
palliative care is neutral ground.

580
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:22,788
Yes. What terminal cancer patients
need the most is not treatment,

581
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,665
but care. Being looked after.

582
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,418
Yes. I agree with that.

583
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,172
For terminally ill patients,
the end of their lives

584
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,174
isn't dying.

585
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,553
It must be to live while death approaches.

586
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,605
Are you back for good?

587
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,440
Yes.

588
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,652
The painkiller you developed.

589
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,529
Will I be able to use it one day?

590
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,155
Our center is waiting for it too.

591
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,366
I hope it helps.

592
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,994
How are you?

593
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,832
I don't know how much time I have left,

594
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,793
but I'm living just fine.

595
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,843
See you again.

596
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,845
Sure.

597
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,680
We will.

598
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,308
Dr. Cha said no?

599
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,061
Why?

600
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,315
He doesn't think
he must remain at our center.

601
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,234
Many other doctors can do that.

602
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,157
If the drug he developed
is commercialized,

603
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,825
we'll be able to use it.

604
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,705
If that were to happen,

605
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,249
I wouldn't envy having 100 doctors
like him.

606
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,964
The doctors are on their way.
Hang in there.

607
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,970
-Help her up.
-Okay.

608
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,851
Take this medicine.

609
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,654
What is this?

610
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,698
The 24-hour brainwave test showed

611
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,700
clear epileptic waves
when your stomach hurt.

612
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,411
You have abdominal epilepsy.

613
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,664
The anti-seizure medicine
will dull the pain.

614
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,543
We'll have to see,
but the serious symptoms will go away.

615
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,338
Then am I free now?

616
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,217
The medicine will help you
go about your everyday life.

617
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,638
Thank you, Doctor.

618
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,765
Thank you.

619
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,902
Did you talk to Dr. Cha yesterday?

620
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,279
Yes.

621
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,115
Sorry for not telling you for a year.

622
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,868
Mi-rae told me off real bad.

623
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,205
You said Dr. Cha asked.

624
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,249
I understand.

625
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,167
Thank you.

626
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,004
If he didn't have you to talk to,

627
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,131
he'd have been so lonely.

628
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,637
Did you hear where he works now?

629
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,473
-Yes.
-Shall we all visit one day?

630
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,767
After you.

631
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,644
Let's go.

632
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,048
We're almost there.

633
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,800
WE'RE ALMOST THERE

634
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:16,104
HEALING CLINIC

635
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,153
I told you not to,
but you smoke in secret.

636
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,574
When will you quit?

637
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,118
You always complain about pain. Lie down.

638
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,911
Did you pee well?

639
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,913
-Yes.
-Good.

640
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,626
What?

641
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,297
WE'RE ALMOST THERE

642
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,174
I'm a doctor.

643
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,176
What did you say?

644
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,013
To those awaiting death
at the end of their lives,

645
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,559
what they need more than
painkillers that no longer work…

646
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,311
I see your nipples.

647
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,689
is someone who
understands their suffering.

648
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,943
Don't skip your meals
and exercise is a must, okay?

649
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,653
Goodbye, sir.

650
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,654
And…

651
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,239
No smoking.

652
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,951
The comfort that their pain is
shared by someone.

653
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,370
HEALING CLINIC

654
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,163
His cancer has spread to his larynx,

655
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,665
so his voice is damaged.
How can you understand him so well?

656
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,125
-Hi.
-Hi.

657
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,711
I can't understand him well either,

658
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,922
but I just try my best.

659
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,426
Who knows if what he said today
could be his last words?

660
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,472
-Dr. Cha!
-Dr. Cha!

661
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,598
Guys!

662
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,477
Welcome.

663
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,901
Where should we start?
I'm sure there's a lot to do around here.

664
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,820
In Hanse Wish Club,

665
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,531
we've been getting many certificates
and receiving a lot of training.

666
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,199
We're good at cleaning and doing laundry.

667
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,660
Can I go around the ward
and take wishes from the patients?

668
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,079
You can do whatever you want.
I won't stop you.

669
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,372
Start!

670
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,331
Let's go!

671
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,306
Let's go this way.

672
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,812
Sir, you look so stiff.

673
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,313
Try to put on a big smile.

674
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,357
Here we go.

675
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,734
One, two, three.

676
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,652
One more.

677
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,737
What's your name?

678
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,823
Relax.

679
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,619
This might sting a little.

680
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,123
Let me check your blood-sugar level.
Give me your hand.

681
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,970
Are you okay?

682
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,638
It hurts.

683
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,188
Let me play a song on the piano for you.

684
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,731
I'm not that good, but please listen.

685
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,774
It's a fun song.

686
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,818
All right.

687
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,326
Pain is the proof of life.

688
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,746
Pain lives inside us.

689
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,333
Our lives come to an end with pain.

690
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,715
Having someone next to you
to share your pain with

691
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,926
reduces your pain

692
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,888
and gives you the courage
to embrace your pain.

693
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,780
Recognizing and sharing
someone else's pain.

694
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,910
That is my last prescription
for our pain that stays with us

695
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,705
for as long as we live.

696
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:23,911
