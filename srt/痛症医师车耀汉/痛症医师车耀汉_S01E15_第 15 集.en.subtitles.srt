1
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,118
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES,
ASSOCIATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,537
Gi-seok.

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,498
Live. Live, Gi-seok.

4
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,631
-Move.
-Dr. Cha!

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,592
I said move. Or he'll die!

6
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,343
You could be causing him more pain.

7
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,306
Are you doing this for him?

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,561
As a doctor, are you following
the decisions you've made?

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,627
Let Gi-seok go in peace.

10
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,895
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

11
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,667
Gi-seok...

12
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,087
You'll see him again soon, ma'am.

13
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,051
Thank you.

14
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,346
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,308
No.

16
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,943
Tell me if you need help with anything.

17
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,947
The kids who took Gi-seok
to the warehouse and hurt him...

18
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,869
We must hold them responsible
so that they're punished.

19
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes.

20
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,793
We'll help as best we can

21
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,545
to prove that medically.

22
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,177
Be strong.

23
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,179
Gi-seok.

24
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,891
What should I do now, Gi-seok?

25
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:24,305
RESTRICTED AREA

26
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,658
DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK

27
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,839
Is your hand okay?

28
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,552
Let me see.

29
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,932
Don't.

30
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,356
Stop acting like my guardian.

31
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,903
Even if there's nothing wrong now,

32
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,489
anything could happen.

33
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,784
That's the fate of patients
like me and Gi-seok.

34
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,831
I'm already broken.

35
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,794
I might only go downhill from here.

36
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,548
There's no future.

37
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,800
-Dr. Cha.
-Don't hang around me

38
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,094
and dream of a non-existent future.

39
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,181
Don't ruin your life.

40
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,354
Gi-seok isn't you.

41
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,733
You're not Gi-seok.

42
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,863
You couldn't save Gi-seok,
but right now you're alive.

43
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,866
You're not the only one
with an unknown future.

44
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,535
We all live not knowing when we'll die.

45
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,708
Do you hear this? The sound of a ticking
bomb that can go off at any moment.

46
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:21,464
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

47
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,757
Boom!

48
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,429
What can you do
if you're holding a ticking bomb?

49
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,725
What do you want me to do?

50
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,560
You never said that to the patients.

51
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,648
Even if there's no tomorrow,
you said you wouldn't speed up death.

52
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,441
So why won't you

53
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,444
allow yourself any hope or dreams?

54
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,448
You want to live as well.

55
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,369
If there's no tomorrow, live today.

56
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,705
That's what I did. I lived today
as if there's no tomorrow.

57
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,209
That's how I could do so much
despite being reckless.

58
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,212
I didn't fear tomorrow.

59
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,380
But now...

60
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,342
I constantly find myself
dreaming of tomorrow.

61
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,557
I keep dreaming and worrying about
something that might not come.

62
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,851
It stops me from living in the moment.

63
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,270
-Is it because of me?
-Yes, it's because of you.

64
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:21,983
Thanks to you,

65
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,446
I was able to dream for the first time
and that made me happy.

66
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,198
But...

67
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,827
I'm going to go back

68
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,665
to being the person who was reckless to
do many things, who didn't fear tomorrow.

69
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,283
I like you.

70
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,288
I like you, Dr. Cha.

71
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,260
-That means you like me, right?
-What?

72
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,221
Please go this way.

73
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,890
How about a fever? Do you have a fever?

74
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,835
Please console me.

75
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,674
I'm the one who'll be losing you.

76
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,067
THE HEART OF THE ONE WHO LEAVES

77
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,945
Two days ago, the former Minister
of Health and Welfare,

78
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,031
Lee Won-gil, was found dead in his house.

79
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,243
The prosecution will soon be
updating us on the investigation.

80
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,453
The prosecution carried out
an investigation

81
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,081
after having received a report
regarding an illegal drug,

82
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,208
and his death was confirmed
during the investigation.

83
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,461
They will be making an announcement
regarding the specific drug as well.

84
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,338
We've confirmed
two additional victims died

85
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,132
due to the abuse of the same illegal drug.

86
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,925
And including former minister,
Lee Won-gil,

87
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,511
we're convinced that they were
all euthanized by a third party

88
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,471
or received some aid
in order to commit suicide.

89
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,640
And that's the focus of our investigation.

90
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,019
Additionally, in order to obtain
evidence regarding the illegal drug,

91
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,979
we've carried out
a seize and search operation.

92
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,025
We also found out that the two prime
suspects have already fled abroad.

93
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,319
We asked Interpol for help
and listed them as wanted men.

94
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,613
We're also investigating
whether or not Zinmu Rijund

95
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,783
took part in the manufacture
and distribution of the illegal drug.

96
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,411
My goodness, Zinmu Rijund
must also be involved in this.

97
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,495
How is this possible?

98
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,458
I heard the prosecution searched
our Legal Team's office as well.

99
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,253
They also told me that I'll be
getting investigated as a witness.

100
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,131
I wonder why Han Myung-oh
did something like that.

101
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,216
Now, everything's
finally falling into place.

102
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,344
A lawyer defended the doctor
who euthanized a patient.

103
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,180
A former Minister of Health and Welfare
who made a pill for euthanizing.

104
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,973
What do you think they both wanted?

105
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,518
They probably wanted our country
to legalize euthanasia.

106
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,062
Didn't you know anything?

107
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,607
Didn't you hear anything
from the minister?

108
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,818
Do you really think I would've
acted like I didn't know anything?

109
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,156
I guess Dr. Cha
had nothing to do with this.

110
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,950
The prosecution didn't come
to investigate him.

111
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,244
Why don't you check with him yourself?

112
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,372
Why bother?

113
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,374
He's not going to stay
at our hospital anyway.

114
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,710
If you're so curious,
why don't you ask him yourself?

115
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,028
Hello?

116
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,448
I saw the news.
I'm so shocked by what happened.

117
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,659
It must've been tough.

118
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,495
It wasn't that tough.

119
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,081
You told me about the Death Talks text.

120
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,125
And someone sent me a crucial report.

121
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,502
Cha Yo-han?

122
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,796
Yes.

123
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,799
What did he say about the online post?

124
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,553
He told me that it doesn't matter.

125
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,390
He told you that it doesn't matter?

126
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,571
Here you go.

127
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,662
Dr. Cha isn't going to return?

128
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,498
What? Why not? Why isn't he coming back?

129
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,960
Was it the hospital's choice or Dr. Cha's?

130
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,298
The hospital was going to follow
the patients' opinions.

131
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,759
But Dr. Cha didn't accept it.

132
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,095
He's going to leave after he's done
treating a few of his patients.

133
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,724
This is so upsetting.
Why is he choosing to leave?

134
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,685
Do you think he got shocked
because of Gi-seok?

135
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,861
I'm going to go back

136
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,490
to being the person who was reckless to
do many things, who didn't fear tomorrow.

137
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,126
You all did well.

138
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,588
Thank you.

139
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,549
And I'm sorry for this.

140
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,093
By any chance,

141
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,638
did you get hired by another hospital?

142
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,139
-No.
-Then why are you leaving?

143
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,225
Where are you going to go?

144
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,691
We have patients waiting,
so let's get to work.

145
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,402
I'll clear everything up.

146
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
Dr. Lee, you can take over my work.

147
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,072
Okay.

148
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,254
My gosh, come on.

149
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,506
Hey!

150
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,385
Hey! What is your problem?

151
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,681
Hey, are you okay?

152
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
Hey!

153
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,896
Hello? 119?

154
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,316
Someone just fainted.

155
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,454
What did you just say?

156
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,707
Please take me to Hanse Medical Center.

157
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,797
Where is the patient named Son Seok-ki?

158
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,131
Over there.

159
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,554
What happened?

160
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,892
I started feeling severe pain
while I was driving

161
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,102
and losing consciousness.

162
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
I got some pain relievers,
so I feel better now.

163
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,108
But the pain is getting worse,

164
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,528
so it's getting harder
to live a normal life.

165
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,702
You need to get hospitalized.
I'll try to find a way.

166
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,165
Admit Son Seok-ki.
Then show me his medical chart.

167
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,542
Okay, thank you.

168
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,086
A patient asked for Dr. Cha?

169
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,964
Yes. He ran over to the ER
after he got a call.

170
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,012
I'll treat my next patient

171
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,055
in about 10 minutes.

172
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,057
-Okay.
-Okay.

173
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,309
Here's the medical chart.

174
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,319
SON SEOK-KI

175
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,571
Son Seok-ki?

176
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,750
CHA YO-HAN EXAMINED
AND DECIDED TO ADMIT HIM

177
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,108
How do you feel?

178
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,360
It got better briefly...

179
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,115
but got bad again.

180
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,660
I reviewed your chart.

181
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,998
You've already received
a lot of narcotic analgesics,

182
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,543
so you'll need to get
an intrathecal pump insertion.

183
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,630
It has fewer side effects
than oral medicine

184
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,882
and would be more effective
in controlling the pain.

185
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,384
Okay, I'll get it.

186
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,930
I'll schedule the procedure for tomorrow.

187
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,642
Aren't you going to ask?

188
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,648
Why I chose you
when there are many hospitals

189
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,399
and many doctors.

190
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,070
Because I'm tenacious?

191
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,781
Yes, that's right.

192
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,535
That tenacity toward patients...

193
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,329
is what I needed

194
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,331
desperately.

195
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,214
Please be tenacious toward me too.

196
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,274
Male patient, age 38.
Stage-three stomach cancer.

197
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,486
An intrathecal pump insertion
will be performed tomorrow.

198
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,364
Good work today. See you tomorrow.

199
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,616
-You too.
-You too.

200
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,016
Are you...

201
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,102
going to do that research?

202
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,023
The research to find a substance
to suppress pain

203
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,317
using the DNA of people with CIPA.

204
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,153
That's right.

205
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,200
I knew that as someone with those genes

206
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,328
and as a scholar,
you'd want to participate.

207
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,332
Is that your choice?

208
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,668
Yes.

209
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,298
What about me?

210
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,471
My life changed completely
after meeting you.

211
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,390
Did it not change for you?

212
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,144
You said I made you dream
and that you were happy.

213
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,605
What did you dream and why were you happy?

214
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,024
Answer me.

215
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,403
Go when you must...

216
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,489
but answer me first.

217
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,492
Si-young.

218
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,122
Snap out of it.

219
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,251
Snap out of it and face reality.

220
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,630
I don't want to talk about
these things with you anymore.

221
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,343
Don't wait for my answer.

222
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,316
We'll begin the procedure.

223
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,363
Shall we get ready?

224
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,156
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

225
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,912
Here we go.

226
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,009
You need to move to the other bed.
Can you do it?

227
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,938
Please extend your arms upward.

228
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,442
Please take this out.

229
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,805
It's been a while, Cha Yo-han.

230
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,436
I poured all my rage
and resentment into you

231
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,023
for letting Yoon Seong-kyu die peacefully.

232
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,610
But you carried on
as if everything was fine.

233
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,740
You need to be as miserable
as I was because of his death

234
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,953
for me to finally feel better,

235
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,040
but you didn't respond at all.

236
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,375
Why not?

237
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,669
Tell me.

238
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,797
Why didn't you tell everyone

239
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,133
that all of it was done by a nurse
who had a grudge against a patient?

240
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,053
I didn't know.

241
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,640
I found out about the consent form

242
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,896
the day after he had died.

243
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,981
Yoon Seong-kyu!

244
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,067
Sign this.

245
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,946
You can't die as you please.

246
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,783
You have no right...

247
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,119
to die.

248
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,998
YOON SEONG-KYU

249
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,210
You could've told them. So why? Why?

250
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,138
YOON SEONG-KYU

251
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,561
Here you go.

252
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,771
Are you okay?

253
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,148
Thank you.

254
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,235
I thought it was very strange
that he had signed

255
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,904
the consent form.

256
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,324
Then I realized

257
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,493
you may be the family of his victim.

258
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,667
Once I found out,
I had no reason to mention the form.

259
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,342
I thought it was only natural
that you were angry with

260
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,676
what I'd done.

261
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,221
You'd lost your child.

262
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,433
Without venting your anger at me, how else

263
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,270
could you have survived the reality?

264
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,315
I understand.

265
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,693
And...

266
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,655
I'm sorry for...

267
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,532
causing such pain.

268
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,830
I apologize.

269
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,922
I hope that now

270
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,383
you can be at peace.

271
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,592
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

272
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,684
Hello?

273
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,942
Last week, his BP started to fluctuate.

274
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,237
Three days ago,
his cerebral oximeter dropped too.

275
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,700
Neurology did an EEG

276
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,162
and results show he's almost brain dead.

277
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,666
AUNT

278
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,751
MOM

279
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,925
-Hello?
-Hello?

280
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,429
I'll be right there.

281
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,530
STEPPING STONE TO SHARING LIFE

282
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,871
I'm so scared.

283
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,377
Let's go, Mi-rae.

284
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,671
Let's see Dad.

285
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,709
The hospital's ethics
commission deliberated.

286
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,672
They decided to...

287
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,885
take him off the ventilator.

288
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,682
We wanted to tell you two

289
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,310
after the decision was made.

290
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,564
His BP started to fluctuate
a few days ago,

291
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,692
and now his cerebral oximeter's falling.

292
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,197
Yesterday, his EEG was negative.

293
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,717
Dad. You fought well.

294
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,013
Well done.

295
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,850
I'll miss you a lot.

296
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,229
Now rest in peace.

297
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,748
Thank you, Doctor.

298
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,959
Sure. Take care.

299
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,048
Doctor.

300
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,060
The day of the accident,
I found an organ-donor card

301
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,980
in Dad's wallet.

302
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,610
He won't be able to donate many...

303
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,115
but I think that it's his final wish.

304
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,826
We had them made together.

305
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,956
We should do it.

306
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,460
It's something...

307
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,047
only someone who is brain dead can do.

308
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,771
OPERATING ROOM

309
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,634
Dad.

310
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,846
Don't worry about us.

311
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,765
Rest in peace.

312
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,103
We'll meet again.

313
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,864
Dad.

314
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,784
Goodbye.

315
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,949
Let's have a moment of silence.

316
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,578
The donor has been loved

317
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,082
and will be missed by many.

318
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,292
He left us today,

319
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,836
after spreading flowers of love
around the world.

320
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,548
May the love shared by the deceased

321
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,009
spread far and wide.

322
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:46,889
May the deceased rest in peace.

323
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,498
KANG YI-SOO

324
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,951
I was always afraid

325
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,788
of saying goodbye to you.

326
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,626
But now I'm more afraid
of being left alone.

327
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,307
Dad.

328
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,145
How many more goodbyes
will I have to say in my life?

329
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,400
How afraid

330
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,403
will I be every time?

331
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,588
CHA YOUNG-HOON

332
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,872
Mi-rae and Si-young are taking
this week off,

333
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,789
just so you know.

334
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,624
By the way,

335
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,544
have you heard anything from Dr. Cha?

336
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,714
He never showed up at the funeral either.

337
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,841
I was expecting him.

338
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,681
Actually...

339
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,146
He's leaving today.

340
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,739
KANG SI-YOUNG

341
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,453
KANG SI-YOUNG

342
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,012
Mi-rae.

343
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,348
I want to move back here.

344
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,228
Can I do that?

345
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,736
Of course.

346
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,449
Welcome back.

347
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,578
I'm sorry, Si-young.

348
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,123
I'm so sorry.

349
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,251
No. I'm sorry.

350
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,964
I'm sorry.

351
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,135
I'm so sorry.

352
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,513
I'm sorry, Si-young.

353
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,739
DR. LEE

354
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,074
Take it.

355
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,079
Hi.

356
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,790
I'm at my sister's place.

357
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,501
Right now?

358
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,298
Okay.

359
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,969
Si-young, let's go out and eat.

360
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,763
Dr. Lee wants to eat with us.

361
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,099
-You go ahead.
-Come with me.

362
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,310
You haven't eaten much in days.

363
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,271
Do you know how you look right now?

364
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,523
I'll stay home. I want to rest.

365
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:18,030
I don't think I can eat anything.
Get up. Go out and eat. Hurry.

366
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,329
He did a lot for us today.
Please thank him for me.

367
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,373
I'll bring something back.

368
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,960
By the way...

369
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,924
Get some rest then.

370
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,444
You feel weak after a funeral.

371
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,364
You should eat a lot.

372
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,034
Eat.

373
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,288
I'm more worried about Si-young.

374
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,165
She looks haggard.

375
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,585
I heard Dr. Cha is leaving today.

376
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,087
Is he really leaving like this?

377
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,261
I'm sure something happened
between the two,

378
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,388
but I can't bring myself to ask her.

379
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,975
I can't believe Dr. Cha.

380
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,227
How can he be so cold to Si-young?

381
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,813
She's letting both Dad and Dr. Cha go.

382
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,944
He's leaving like this
because it's too much for her.

383
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,905
Without a word? Without seeing Si-young?

384
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,992
You're so frustrating.

385
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,035
How so?

386
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,996
Are you siding with Dr. Cha?

387
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,373
Why would I take sides?

388
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,966
Is there something you didn't tell me?

389
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,928
There is. What is it?

390
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,223
Lee Yoo-joon!

391
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,066
Si-young.

392
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,822
Get up.

393
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,742
-What is it?
-Look at me.

394
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,702
What's going on?

395
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,664
Dr. Cha will board very soon.

396
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,916
You have to go.

397
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,172
-I won't go.
-You must go.

398
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,008
I won't. Why should I go to the airport?

399
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,261
If you don't go,
you might regret it later.

400
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,138
There's a reason you must go.

401
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,860
Sorry. I should've told you sooner.

402
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,487
Dr. Cha told me not to.

403
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,824
The day Dad died,

404
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,702
Dr. Cha was next to you.

405
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,140
Then...

406
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,310
the person who was with Dad until the end

407
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,979
was Dr. Cha?

408
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,960

KANG SI-YOUNG

412
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,652
You made me happy.

413
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,989
And because of you, I learned to love.

414
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,786
My life, the work I do...

415
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,915
and you, Cha Yo-han.

416
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,087
I wanted to tell you that.

417
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,386
You're the only person

418
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,472
that ever understood me.

419
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,309
My illness

420
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,520
and me as a person.

421
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,526
My world that was neither hot nor cold...

422
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,446
turned warm after I met you.

423
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,161
Why didn't you give me an answer
when you had such a great one?

424
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,873
Because it means...

425
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,627
I love you.

426
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,925
How can someone who's leaving
confess his love?

427
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,010
You can.

428
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,056
You can talk about love at any time.

429
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,101
Even more so
if you don't know your tomorrow.

430
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,496
I love you.

431
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,374
I love you too.

Be like this every day.

442
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,284
BE LIKE THIS EVERY DAY

443
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:39,002
Once the board votes,
which is just a formality,

444
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,296
this office will officially become yours.

445
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,840
I'm finally dropping the "acting"
in "acting chairman."

446
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,009
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

447
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,930
Now, we must prepare to open
a bespoke medical center for VIP clients.

448
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:55,226
We should attract foreigners as well,
befitting of these global times.

449
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,480
Of course.
We'll start making the preparations.

450
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,734
Are there more candidates by any chance?

451
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,403
Then we would've noticed
someone meeting board members

452
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,822
to try to win over their votes.

453
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,908
But we haven't seen any of that.

454
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,957
-Run for chairman?
-Yes.

455
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,336
Many people are worried
that if the acting chairman

456
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,670
becomes the chairman,

457
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:27,425
the hospital won't be managed properly

458
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,135
in line with Yi-soo's wishes.

459
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,228
Tae-kyung.

460
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,108
I think they want you
to be the new chairman.

461
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,819
What do you think?

462
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,559
-Hey.
-Did you pull an all-nighter?

463
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,783
There she goes again.

464
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,494
She's always here at 7 a.m., right?

465
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,955
That's right. She's been like that
for months now,

466
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,291
checking Dr. Cha's vitals.

467
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,917
What's wrong with that?

468
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,253
I'm saying they're cool.

469
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,422
Dr. Cha, who sends them daily
without fail,

470
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,299
and Si-young, who checks them daily.

471
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,426
How romantic.

472
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,594
True love.

473
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,639
I'm jealous.

474
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,433
How is he today? Did it come in?

475
00:57:59,058 --> 00:57:59,893
Hold on.

I wonder what happened.

481
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,561
It didn't come in?

482
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,855
DR. CHA YO-HAN

483
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,834
How long has it been
since you spoke to him?

484
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,339
A few days.

485
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,466
He seemed busy.

486
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:24,310
-Let's wait for a bit.
-Yes, let's wait.

487
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,813
-Let's go.
-Okay.

488
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,660
Dr. Cha, is something wrong?

489
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:44,581
You didn't email me today.
Please get back to me.

490
