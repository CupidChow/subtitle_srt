1
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,618
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,166
-What's wrong?
-He must not be feeling well.

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,092
Dr. Cha, are you okay?

4
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,950
Dr. Cha.

5
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,751
I'm here.

6
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,965
Let me take over.

7
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,386
You are seeing me for real.

8
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,238
Let me do it.

9
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,365
You can trust me.

10
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,836
I apologize...

11
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,171
for the unexpected situation.

12
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,009
This is the second-year resident
in our department

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,470
who I just talked about.

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,972
She is more ambitious...

15
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,516
than you might think.

16
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,685
As she gave me the crucial hint,

17
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,936
she must...

18
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,856
want to explain it herself.

19
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,359
Let's hear it.

20
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,026
I'm a second-year resident...

21
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,404
at Seoul Hanse Medical Center's
Anesthesiology Department.

22
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,739
My name is Kang Si-young.

23
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,158
I can explain this part for you...

24
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,787
because I got a hint
from a patient I once treated.

25
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,045
The patient complained

26
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,339
of stinging and burning pains

27
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,924
across a large part of his body

28
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,343
including his chest, shoulders, and arms.

29
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,555
In the end, he was diagnosed
with zoster sine herpete.

30
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,932
Let me help you.

31
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,644
You monitor
your unresponsive body endlessly,

32
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,271
and even have to hide the fact
that you're doing so.

33
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,689
Let me help you.

34
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,067
I'll do everything that I can.

35
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,197
I got a hint during that process.

36
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,034
Dr. Cha just mentioned...

37
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,453
that he felt pain
because there was no pain.

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,664
And the hint is related to that.

39
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
ZINMU RIJUND

40
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,921
May I help you?

41
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,840
HAN MIN-JU
ZINMU RIJUND SALES TEAM

42
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,676
Death Talks.

43
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,553
-Pardon?
-I'm a patient member there.

44
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,851
This.

45
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,147
I thought it looked familiar.
I think I saw it at Death Talks.

46
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,774
That's right.

47
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,945
Zinmu Rijund runs Dalbit Foundation,
which supports patients

48
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,489
with rare and incurable diseases,
and terminal patients.

49
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,867
DALBIT FOUNDATION

50
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,371
It proved to be
a case of central sensitization.

51
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,418
My impudent explanation is over now.

52
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,753
Thank you for listening.

53
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,548
Lastly,

54
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
even though we are introducing CIPA

55
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,553
as a rare and incurable disease
here today,

56
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,179
I actually...

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,476
don't think this disease
is special or unique in any way.

58
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,398
That's because most patients
who come to Pain Management...

59
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,609
suffer from pain which is invisible.

60
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,237
I learned the best way to find the problem

61
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,741
in those patients' bodies from Dr. Cha.

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,411
"Don't look at the symptoms."

63
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,997
"Look at the people
who suffer from those symptoms."

64
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,918
"What doctors treat is not a disease,
but a person."

65
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,715
That's all I have to say. Thank you.

66
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,402
Our sales manager will
explain to you in detail.

67
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,570
Just a second.

68
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,781
Give the brochures to the professors.

69
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,324
Go to your positions right now.

70
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,575
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

71
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,160
This man...

72
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,248
Thank you. Here.

73
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,875
Thank you. Thank you.

74
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,798
Si-young, that was impressive.

75
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,132
Didn't know you and Dr. Cha

76
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,301
had planned that you'd take over
in the middle.

77
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,888
Si-young, good job.

78
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,225
-Aunt.
-Your presentation was amazing.

79
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,726
I was so surprised.

80
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,187
By the way, is Dr. Cha sick?

81
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,982
He probably felt dizzy for a moment.

82
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,692
He looks fine now.

83
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,320
Let me introduce you to them later.

84
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,446
Thank you.

85
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,990
Does he have stage fright or something?

86
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,871
Why can't he stop finding fault?

87
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,165
Thank you all for today.

88
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,292
-See you.
-See you.

89
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,589
Is Dr. Cha really not feeling well?

90
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,009
Something definitely didn't feel right.
He looked pale.

91
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,846
All right. You can all wait outside.

92
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,515
I'll come with Dr. Cha later
when we're done in here.

93
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,808
-Okay.
-Okay.

94
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,233
Si-young.

95
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,153
Come here for a moment.

96
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,165
The professors here are curious about you.

97
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,624
Say hello.

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,252
Hello, I'm...

99
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,588
You don't need to introduce
yourself again.

100
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,591
It's just that we've never seen
a competent resident like you,

101
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,301
so we wanted to meet you in person.

102
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,637
Thank you for your kind words.

103
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,973
I'll see you at the next symposium.

104
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,266
See you.

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,143
-See you.
-Thank you.

106
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,062
See you again.

107
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,398
Thank you.

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,927
-Thank you for today.
-Jeez.

109
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,348
I'm sorry. I'm Jung Chan-seok,
sales manager at Zinmu Rijund.

110
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,641
I see.

111
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,143
Here, doctor.

112
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,022
I'll see you again.

113
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,652
What is this?

114
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,530
Where are Dr. Cha and Si-young?

115
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,240
They told us to leave first.

116
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,325
-Let's go.
-Okay.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,743
Let's go.

118
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,131
I should probably listen to you.

119
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,300
I need to see a doctor.

120
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,511
Did you hear a ringing
in your ears earlier?

121
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,596
Yes.

122
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,808
What about now? Are you running a fever?

123
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,900
I don't know.

124
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,696
Even if I touch my forehead,
I can't tell...

125
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,198
whether it's hot or cold.

126
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,145
You don't seem to have a fever,
so that's good.

127
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,189
-Still, you should see a doctor--
-When I saw you earlier,...

128
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,527
I couldn't tell whether or not
you were actually there.

129
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,030
"I'm here."

130
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,285
I thought I heard you say that,
but I wasn't sure.

131
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,582
But I just believed it.

132
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,961
I believed you'd be there.

133
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,131
I believed...

134
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,343
you'd say that to me.

135
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,014
I'll admit it.

136
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,725
I need your help.

137
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,730
Thank you in advance.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,655
My pleasure.

139
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
I think I should call it a day.

140
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,210
Are you going to see a doctor?

141
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,003
Yes.

142
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,422
See you.

143
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,345
Dr. Cha.

144
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,391
Everything will be all right.

145
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,269
Call me after seeing the doctor.

GYEONGSEO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

148
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,465
HEARING TEST ROOM

149
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,432
How does it look?

150
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,019
I'd like to run a few more tests.

151
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,064
An MRI, a brain CT,
a cerebrovascular CT, and so on.

152
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,235
Do you see what I mean?

153
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,864
Let's do everything that we can.

154
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,578
How much time do I have left...

155
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,372
to live as a doctor?

FOREBODING ON A CRISP AFTERNOON

157
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,820
You're checking your phone
every 30 seconds.

158
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,447
What are you looking at?

159
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,158
Great work today.

160
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,952
Dr. Cha has left.
Is there something wrong with him?

161
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,039
I don't know exactly.

162
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,333
He just said it was something personal.

163
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,086
All right. To wrap up today,
should we go for a drink?

164
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,256
-What do you think?
-That sounds good.

165
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,135
You're busted.
You're seeing someone, right?

166
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,428
Who's the guy? Who is he?

167
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,764
I have to go. I'll see you all tomorrow.

168
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,185
-What is she...
-She's definitely seeing someone.

169
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,103
Right? I have to follow her.

170
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,772
Dr. Heo.

171
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,274
Let's go grab some beers.

172
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,567
Let's go!

173
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,735
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

174
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,819
Let's go.

Let's eat. I'm hungry.

177
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,540
Dr. Cha, I just got out.

178
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,209
Where should we meet?

179
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,184
This tastes fantastic.

180
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,396
How long are you planning
to work at this hospital?

181
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,438
I'm not sure.

182
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,774
I'll stay until
they make me assistant professor.

183
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,528
An assistant professor? I didn't
know you were the academic type.

184
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,821
You don't look like one.

185
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,072
Then what do I look like?

186
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,448
Well...

187
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,451
Maybe the type that starts a clinic
and becomes filthy rich?

188
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,329
The population is aging.

189
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,376
If you start a clinic,
elderly people will line up like...

190
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,961
Please remember me then.

191
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,839
Didn't you want to focus
on anesthesiology, not pain?

192
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,925
Exactly. You said patients in pain
made you depressed.

193
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
Well, since Dr. Cha came,

194
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,097
our Pain Department
has become more dynamic.

195
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,016
It's rewarding and fun to learn and grow,

196
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,309
if you ask me. Oh, my.

197
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,354
"It feels rewarding and fun"? That's nice.

198
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,981
I really don't know.

199
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,191
What are you looking at the whole time?

200
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,526
You dating someone too?

201
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,446
You'd better not date anyone.
Especially your colleagues.

202
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,573
Who would want to date
within our department?

203
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,451
I'm not dating anyone.
You guys should take a look at this.

204
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,413
There's this organization called

205
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,582
The Ambulance Wish Foundation
in Netherlands.

206
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,459
They grant wishes for terminal patients.

207
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,294
I also saw that video.

208
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,754
There's this terminal patient

209
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,506
who applied because he had
something he wanted to do.

210
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,841
And?

211
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,137
And his wish was to go to the beach
and eat ice cream.

212
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,805
Yes, it's him.

213
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,393
That's kind of sad.

214
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,063
I feel like people would
ask for something big

215
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,272
before they die.

216
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,191
But that's such a simple wish.

217
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,737
Patient wanted to go to an art gallery.

218
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,740
This patient wanted to watch

219
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,533
his favorite player play soccer.

220
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,494
This patient wanted to visit his hometown.

221
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,080
They all wished for simple things.

222
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,374
Yes, they just missed
the days when they were healthy.

223
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,545
So I've been thinking...

224
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,840
We should do this as well.

225
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,592
-Do what?
-For whom?

226
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,719
-For Ms. Yoo Ri-hye.
-What?

227
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,846
I was a huge fan.

228
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,057
She really made me happy.

229
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,727
But she's sick now,
and she's going to die soon.

230
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,689
Meanwhile, I'm a doctor,
but there's nothing I can do.

231
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,317
This is so touching.

232
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,779
Do you guys really mean it?

233
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,198
Why not?

234
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,243
Who knows? There might
be something we can do.

235
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,452
-Really?
-Yes.

236
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,912
-I'm all for it.
-Me too.

237
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,539
-Deal.
-We're doing this now?

238
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,333
-One, two, three. Deal.
-Deal.

239
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,210
I'd like one egg salad sandwich...

240
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,671
and one barbecue chicken sandwich.

241
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,807
Lettuce, tomatoes,...

242
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,518
and onions.

243
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,970
-Thank you.
-Bye.

244
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,902
Where are we going?

245
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,117
How about the park nearby?

246
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,578
Let's go.

247
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,138
My gosh, it's beautiful.

248
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,141
Bye. I'm going to beat you.

249
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,685
-No.
-You guys can go that way.

250
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,605
Wait for me.

251
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,749
-You're overreacting.
-No, I'm not. I'm being careful.

252
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,584
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

253
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,462
Don't you remember saying,
"Do you have hypochondria?"

254
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,588
Well...

255
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,008
I didn't know anything back then.

256
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,845
And I didn't sound that mean.

257
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,810
What did the doctor say?

258
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,564
Dr. Cha.

259
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,109
I took a few tests.

260
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,278
He's going to call me
once he gets the results

261
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,779
for a comprehensive checkup.

262
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,698
You got a comprehensive checkup?

263
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,409
Yes, just in case.

264
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,911
-Is that all?
-Yes.

265
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,625
We should sit down and eat.

266
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,711
You said you wanted to eat this.

267
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,512
Have you wanted to be a doctor
since you were young?

268
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,681
No.

269
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,933
Then what did you want to become?

270
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,855
I wanted to own a comic book store.

271
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,816
A comic book store?

272
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,446
We used to have an attic in our old house.

273
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,197
And?

274
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,867
Every time I read comic books there,

275
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
I felt really comfortable.
It felt like I was in another world.

276
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,874
That suits you.

277
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,461
What do you think would've suited me?

278
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,715
I can't really imagine anything else.

279
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,259
I can't really imagine you...

280
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,679
as anything other than a doctor.

281
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,098
Really?

282
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,101
But why do you ask?

283
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,812
No reason.

284
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,901
I figured I might have to quit
being a doctor one day.

285
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,114
But I've never really thought about
what I should do after I quit.

286
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,949
You're going to quit?

287
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,702
You're not going to quit, right?

288
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,454
I'm just saying.

289
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,166
You have to tell me if anything happens.

290
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,418
Okay?

291
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,587
Okay, I promise.

292
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,846
But I really don't think you'll be
able to have any other job.

293
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,139
Why not?

294
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,642
I feel like you might not
get paid properly

295
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,477
if you get an office job.

296
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,563
You might get fooled
if you run your own business.

297
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,817
And you might go bankrupt
if you open a restaurant.

298
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,945
-You insulting me or complimenting me?
-You caught me.

299
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,247
Here's the book you asked for.

300
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,290
-Thank you.
-No problem.

-Did you go to the symposium?
-Yes.

307
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,696
-You must be outside.
-It's the weekend.

308
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,157
I'm spending my day
doing cultural activities.

309
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,035
Would you like to join me?
I'm going to go enjoy some art now.

310
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,414
Art?

DALBIT FOUNDATION

314
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,605
What kind of exhibition is this?

315
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,983
Zinmu Rijund runs a foundation.

316
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,236
It's a foundation that executes
social contribution

317
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,447
for terminal patients
and patients with rare illnesses.

318
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,451
Is the gathering also funded
by the same company?

319
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,662
I think so.

320
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,708
By the way...

321
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,711
I wonder why I feel...

322
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,380
so agitated by this painting.

323
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,801
The painting looks similar
to the company logo.

324
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,056
But the title of the painting
looks like a weird code.

Can't you just come back another day?

335
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,780
Yes.

336
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,200
He finally has the output.

337
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,160
Does he?

338
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:48,625
Humans think pain is their worst enemy
and fear in life.

339
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,420
But the pain is what makes us
fight and achieve.

340
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,130
Right.

341
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,884
At the end of the dreadful pain,
I found it.

342
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,222
The medication that's
perfect in every way. Kerobim.

343
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,693
-Go on inside.
-Get home safely.

344
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,573
I'll try too.

345
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,160
To not make you worry.

346
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,083
Okay.

00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,121

We'll do this?

352
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,039
We want to do this for her.

353
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,541
If she wants.

354
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,170
I'm very grateful,
but will my sister want anything?

355
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,297
She's lost her will.

356
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,424
Anything small will do.

357
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,927
Is there anything she wants to eat?

358
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,095
Just tell us.

359
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,472
We'll do anything. Ask her for us.

360
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,852
She told me not to visit
and won't even let me see her.

361
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,565
Can't you ask her instead?

362
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,733
Me?

363
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,819
You are her doctor.

364
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,737
Go on inside.

365
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,365
-Please.
-Go on.

366
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,872
Excuse me...

367
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,250
I'm resident Kang Si-young
from Pain Management.

368
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,004
Is everything okay?

369
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,548
Yes.

370
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,469
This might sound strange...

371
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,974
but a doctor in my department
is a huge fan of yours.

372
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,064
He wanted to do something for you,

373
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,774
whatever it is.

374
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,445
So my team decided to grant you a wish.

375
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,457
Is there anything...

376
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,127
you need or want?

377
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,424
Let us know...

378
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,344
anytime.

379
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,539
Thank you...

380
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,709
for coming up with this anyway.

381
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,165
PATIENT: YOO RI-X
DOCTORS: CHA YO-HAN, KANG SI-YOUNG

382
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,107
I wanted...

383
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,859
to try everything.

384
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,781
I made you have surgeries,
gave you medication...

385
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,450
and hooked you up to machines.

386
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,995
I thought that was the right way
to fight for you.

387
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,374
But...

388
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,085
it's not.

389
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,304
I was...

390
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,224
afraid.

391
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,105
To admit that there was
nothing I could do for you...

392
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,442
and just let you go.

393
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,377
I'm here.

394
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,718
When will you tell the girls?

395
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,720
Soon.

396
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,890
Si-young might understand,
but what about Mi-rae?

397
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,766
I'm still thinking.

398
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,063
I have to get it right the first time
or she'll only resist.

399
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,485
I'll tell her.

400
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,823
It might be better coming from me.

401
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,877
I want the ethics commission
closed to the public.

402
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,922
Consult Mr. Han on the legal details.

403
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,718
Okay. I'll prepare everything
without fail.

404
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,430
We'll have to call a board meeting...

405
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,351
to select a new chairman of the board.

406
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,190
Yes. We should do that too.

407
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,959
The test results are in.
Come in as soon as possible.

408
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,930
THE TEST RESULTS ARE IN
COME IN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

409
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,057
Come outside, Dr. Cha.

410
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,148
Dr. Cha!

411
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,616
I drove here.

412
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,661
You can't drive yet,
so I'll take you to work.

413
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,626
It's been sitting for a few years.

414
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,170
There were no problems on the way here.

415
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,464
Are you sure there were no problems?

416
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,555
No wonder everything was blurry.

417
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,316
Dr. Cha.

418
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,151
Dr. Cha.

419
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,656
Dr. Cha!

420
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,616
Dr. Cha.

421
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,620
Help me!

422
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,548
There. We can go now.

423
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,551
-Okay.
-To Gyeongseo University Hospital.

424
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,886
My test results are in.

425
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,100
I haven't heard them yet.

426
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,685
Will you keep giving me that look?

427
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,646
Let's get going.

428
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,194
Chopin in the morning. Nice.

429
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,329
-Watch the curve.
-I'm a good driver.

430
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,424
Dr. Lee's in charge
of the outpatients this morning.

431
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,801
Work hard.

432
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,177
Can I come with you?

433
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,595
No.

434
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,434
See you later. Drive safely.

435
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,353
Don't turn on wipers
instead of the blinkers.

436
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,672
-What's this for?
-Take it.

437
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,632
You called me over this early
to give me this?

438
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,427
I called you to feed you breakfast.

439
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,720
Who keeps a talisman these days?

440
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,724
I've been having weird dreams lately.

441
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,728
Keep it safe
and be extra cautious at all times.

442
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,897
You're helpless.

443
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,941
-Are you done?
-Yes. I'm leaving.

444
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,445
Hey, you have to be careful, okay?

445
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,405
Bye.

446
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,740
DUMPLINGS AND PORK TROTTERS

447
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,288
Don't just smile
and look after your son, will you?

448
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,957
-Son?
-This morning,

449
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,126
Yoo Ri-hye's sister called.

450
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,086
She wants to see her son.

451
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,630
And? He'll visit?

452
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,923
Yes, soon.

453
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,050
We have to get ready.

454
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,218
Get ready for what?

455
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,140
With this.

456
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,517
What's inside? It feels ominous.

457
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
Kids are scared of hospitals.

458
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,773
We should look friendly.

459
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,863
Good choice.

460
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,618
There.

461
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,954
It suits you.

462
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,915
Why are you doing this to me?

463
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,208
Dr. Heo!

464
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,503
Yes?

465
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,838
I'll keep the center under control.

466
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,174
You do what you can do.

467
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,772
What should we do then?

468
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,620
Hello, I'm Kang Si-young, a resident
in Pain Management.

469
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,829
I'm Kang Mi-rae.

470
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,790
We brought some flowers.

471
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,418
We thought your room seemed a little bare.

472
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,296
They're fake flowers,
since we don't allow real ones.

473
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,589
We brought a teddy bear too.

474
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,383
We'll put it at your bedside.

HANSE WISH CLUB

476
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,814
Thank you, doctors.

477
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,153
If you don't mind, can I ask for a favor?

478
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,782
-Sure you can.
-Would you mind?

479
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,660
If I wear lipstick,

480
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,663
maybe I'll look a little less scary.

481
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,957
I'll put it on for you.

482
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,712
I feel nervous.

483
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,986
I thought it would be best if my son

484
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,071
doesn't see what I look like.

485
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,782
But...

486
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,827
I miss him so much.

487
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,674
All finished.

488
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,177
Now let's see your son.

489
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,353
What?

490
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,938
What do you mean, he's not coming?

491
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,191
I just got a call.

492
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,695
He said he won't go because
he's too scared to see his mom.

493
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,489
So he really won't come?

494
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,324
He might never get to see her again.

495
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,700
I don't know...

496
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,958
Ri-hye. Let me explain what happened.

497
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,086
Ri-hye. Ri-hye.

498
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,045
Ri-hye!

499
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,465
Ri-hye. Ri-hye.

500
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,302
Ri-hye. Ri-hye.

501
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,137
Oh, no

502
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,893

00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,449
Hey. What are you doing?

505
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,660
I shouldn't have done anything.

506
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,413
Either way, I'm of no help at all.

507
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,791
I shouldn't have done anything.

508
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,046
You didn't do it on purpose.
You had good intentions.

509
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,550
Who cares about my intentions
when the results are rotten?

510
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,179
I just made her feel worse.

511
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,807
Still, you made me realize...

512
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,896
that there are still things
we can do for terminal patients

513
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,230
who don't have much time left.

514
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,321
I'd never thought about that before.

515
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,156
That's right. Me neither.

516
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,910
Me neither.

519
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,364
Sir, stick your arm farther in.

520
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,367
That's it. And pull up closer.

521
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,372
Now, wait and don't move.

522
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,629
-Mr. Cha Yo-han.
-Yes?

523
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,132
It's done.

524
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,973
It's normal.

525
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,810
Look after yourself.

526
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,691
-Can I go in?
-Thank you, sir.

527
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,737
Hello.

528
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,075
There's a long line. I waited for ages.

529
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,493
Sit down.

530
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,000
Will you look at your patient?

531
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,085
Be quiet. You're just a patient.

532
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,683
Check this once more.

533
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,853
It can be dangerous to drive
after the procedure,

534
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,938
so get someone to drive you.

535
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,148
The atmosphere's heavy.

536
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,358
It's heavy.

537
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,528
Like right before a storm.

538
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,031
No!

539
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,328
Hello, Pain Management Center.

540
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,205
What?

541
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,084
What's the matter?

542
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,755
-What should we do?
-About what?

543
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,341
It's Ms. Yoo Ri-hye.

544
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,217
What about her?

545
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,559
You asked how much longer...

546
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,520
you can be a doctor for.

547
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,983
You don't have...

548
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,611
much time left.

549
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,385
CRIMINAL DEPARTMENT 3 PROSECUTOR

550
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,140
CHAE EUN-JEONG

551
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,312
Hello?

552
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,025
Prosecutor Son. My hunch was right.

553
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,237
I had a bad feeling,
so I came to Hanse Medical Center.

554
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,572
What's she doing?

555
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,032
Don't get closer.

556
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,507
Today's the day.

557
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,136
The day you talked about.

558
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,810
Viral labyrinthitis?

559
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,479
30-30-30.

560
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,400
The 30-percent likelihood
that your hearing will never return.

561
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,653
The 30-percent likelihood that
we'll never know if it will.

562
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,947
The 30-percent likelihood
that I'll make a full recovery.

563
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,449
My option is...

564
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,160
a heavy dose of steroids.

565
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,787
You can never take steroids.

566
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,626
It'll weaken your immune system
and you'll be prone to infections.

567
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,087
Don't you know how lethal
that can be to you?

568
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,715
The ticking bomb could go off...

569
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,842
at any time.

570
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,680
I'm saying your life could be in danger.

571
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,766
I won't get better if I don't get treated.

572
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,435
And I can no longer be a doctor.

573
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:04,978
So what?

574
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,397
Will you put your life on the line?

575
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,276
Ms. Yoo.

576
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,864
Our whole team is right by your side.

577
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,668
You said...

578
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,214
you'd help me with anything.

579
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,218
Yes. We'll help with anything.
Just tell us what you want.

580
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,232
You can choose
how much time you have left.

581
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,366
Give up on being a doctor
and you'll live longer.

582
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,577
Choose to be a doctor...

583
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,664
and you must risk
all the time you have left.

584
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,168
Is your career as a doctor
your whole life?

585
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,215
Coming through.

586
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,050
Let us through.

587
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,261
You don't feel pain.

588
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,973
How do you feel about patients who do?

589
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,016
Do you feel pity?

590
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,185
Or is it curiosity?

591
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,780
How can we help you?

592
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,242
We can give you more medicine
to reduce the pain.

593
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,412
We can operate on you a few more times.

594
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,958
None of that will cure me.

595
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,128
My face...

596
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,382
won't come back to normal.

597
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,468
Doctor.

598
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,555
I didn't want to...

599
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,017
have this illness.

600
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,687
Yes. I know that.

601
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,064
Then at least...

602
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,151
can't you let me...

603
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,653
choose to...

604
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,616
free myself from it?

605
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,619
My son...

606
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,580
told me...

607
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,127
that I was the prettiest in the world.

608
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,380
I want him...

609
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,468
to remember me that way.

610
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,473
So, doctor...

611
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,226
Help me.

612
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,770
Help me...

613
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,398
end this pain...

614
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,944
without having to jump.

615
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,372
PROSECUTOR SON SEOK-KI

616
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,185
I guess you can't.

617
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,610
Don't die.

618
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,698
Not this kind of wish.

619
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,410
How can we grant something like that?

620
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,037
How?

621
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,833
Please don't do this.

622
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,222
Doctors.

623
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,891
Sometimes,

624
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,311
telling one not to die...

625
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,399
is even worse...

626
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,070
than telling them to die.

627
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,774
We have to pull ourselves together.

628
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,166
Move!

629
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,168
Coming through!

630
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,588
This way. How is she?

631
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,672
There's no breathing.

632
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,679
The oxygen saturation level is 78.

633
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,890
Because of nasal bleeding,
intubation will be difficult.

634
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,892
Laryngeal mask.

635
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,235
Ambu bag.

636
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,161
Hold on. How is she?

637
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,247
Bleeding from nasal tumor
caused respiratory failure.

638
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,172
Move her to the emergency room.

639
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,092
Coming through.

640
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,022
That way.

641
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,449
Ri-hye. Ri-hye.

642
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,201
It's your sister, Ri-hye.

643
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,288
Ri-hye.

644
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,710
I'm sorry, but you can't enter.

645
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,516
We have a problem.

646
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,519
-Yoo Ri-hye.
-What is it now?

647
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,648
Someone turned off her ventilator.

648
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,692
What?

649
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,321
Who?

650
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,034
Who are you?

651
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,528
-Dr. Cha?
-Dr. Cha?

652
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,076
Find the culprit through
an investigation, not guesses.

653
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,287
The police are on their way here.
The police!

654
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,289
This is clearly attempted murder.

655
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,374
Lieutenant Kim Jung-rok
from Gangnam Police Station.

656
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,251
Don't say anything
until the truth is revealed.

657
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,545
No. I will cooperate
with the investigation

658
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,838
like I did three years ago.

659
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,715
The investigation will be conducted
by who?

660
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,675
All interrogations and interviews
will be done...

661
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,677
by Prosecutor Son Seok-ki.
