1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,243
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES,
ASSOCIATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,079
I like you.

3
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,542
I…

4
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,295
like you.

5
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,063
You can trust us.

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,733
Oh, Dr. Cha.

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,445
Reporters, this is Dr. Cha Yo-han
of our Pain Management Department.

8
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,416
Don't get off.

9
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,422
Dr. Cha, I have a question.
How's the patient doing right now?

10
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,299
What was the process
of making the diagnosis?

11
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
How do you feel about
discovering such a rare disease?

12
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,597
First of all, I cannot reveal
any personal information.

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,683
So I cannot go into detail
about the patient.

14
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,560
He's right.

15
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,605
Instead, tell them about melioidosis.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,316
I think it'd be better to ask

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,319
the doctors in Infectious Diseases
about that.

18
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,821
Bye, then.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,367
How do you feel about being reinstated
after the euthanasia incident?

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,244
I'm sure it's a sensitive issue
to patients.

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,037
Has anyone refused to get treated by you?

22
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,498
No, not really.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,876
I don't go around telling people
that I euthanized a patient.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,713
Don't you think you should inform patients
since they also have a right to know?

25
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,551
-What do you think, Director Kang?
-Well…

26
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,387
Well, regarding that issue--

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,266
We won't be answering any questions
regarding that specific issue.

28
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,102
I'm Han Myung-oh, the hospital's attorney.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,688
Today's briefing
is about a melioidosis patient.

30
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,607
So you can email us
regarding any additional questions.

31
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,320
Excuse me. Please make way.

32
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,489
He's right.

33
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,200
Today is about
how Dr. Cha found melioidosis.

34
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,662
The articles you write today
should be focused on that.

35
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,247
How haughty of him.

36
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,294
Must I really run away like this?

37
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,754
It's not something
you should talk about right now.

38
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,633
Prosecutor Son came by this afternoon.

39
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,179
He even visited Chief Min.

40
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,932
Why? Did he come to give her a warning?

41
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,269
Yes, he even mentioned the fact
that her daughters are learning from you.

42
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,648
"A student who's learning from
someone who euthanized a patient

43
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,817
is trying to make her father
die with dignity."

44
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,905
He can easily create that scenario.
It won't even take much effort.

45
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,763
Get in.

46
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,848
-What?
-Dr. Cha asked me

47
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,767
to drive you home since it's late.

48
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,560
Get in.

49
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,273
You had a rough day, didn't you?

50
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,485
Dr. Cha had it worse.

51
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,404
He really is obstinate.

52
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,784
I know he's competent and confident.

53
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,787
But he really worries
the people around him.

54
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,123
I'm scared he might make a mistake
and end up ruining his life.

55
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,502
I hope you understand.

56
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,004
I'm only saying this
because he put me through a lot.

57
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,381
He really is obstinate.

58
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,386
When he's focused on something,
that's the only thing he cares about.

59
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,014
Once he makes a decision,
he makes sure he gets it done.

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
If someone tries to stop him…

61
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,310
-He tells you not to overreact.
-Exactly.

62
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,563
I've heard him say that to me
so many times.

63
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
He always tells me I'm overreacting

64
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,942
when he's the one
who's actually overreacting.

65
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,861
It's because he's so old-fashioned.

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,823
I mean, who puts in
that much effort these days?

67
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,492
He really should have a limit.

68
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,744
You seem to know him very well.

69
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,249
I've known him for over three years,

70
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,086
but he rarely talks about himself
or lets me help him out.

71
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,673
So it's very hard to predict
what's on his mind.

72
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,937
Get home safely.

73
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,900
Thank you for the ride.

74
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,652
No problem. Rest up.

75
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,903
Okay.

76
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,043
Mission accomplished.
Where are you? Are you home?

77
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,880
I'll check the articles,
so you should get some rest.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
And…

79
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,093
don't forget that everyone
needs to be careful right now.

80
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,721
That includes you, Chief Min,

81
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,181
and Dr. Kang.

82
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,119
CALL LOG

83
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,417
I like you.

84
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,003
I…

85
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,629
like you.

REPORTER AHN SEUNG-HYUN

87
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,417
I GUESS CHA YO-HAN WON'T SHOW

88
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,256
REPORTER AHN SEUNG-HYUN

89
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,342
Hello?

90
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,387
I took the photo on my way out
after the press conference.

91
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,306
They showed up
in front of the press together?

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,641
It was by chance.

93
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,811
I wanted to ask more questions
about what happened three years ago.

94
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,896
The hospital attorney stopped me.

95
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,358
I want you to release an article tomorrow.

96
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,569
-Okay.
-And…

97
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,199
I'll keep an eye on Cha Yo-han
and Kang Si-young for a while.

98
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,184
It seems like what they have
is a lot deeper

99
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,020
than just
a professor-student relationship.

100
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
We can't show any flaws

101
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,651
to those who are against
what we're trying to do.

102
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,822
We can't let an unnecessary scandal
tarnish our ultimate goal.

103
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,033
I'm also worried,
so I'm keeping an eye on them.

104
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,661
I guess it's about time now…

105
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,915
since I heard he's fully ready.

106
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,835
Is everything finally ready, sir?

107
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,471
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

108
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,312
Okay, you may enter now.

109
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,983
Make sure you install the monitor
in the right place.

110
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,818
BUSINESS AGREEMENT SIGNING CEREMONY

111
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,278
"Zinmu Rijund"?

112
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,864
It's unbelievable.

113
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,660
Are we finally getting managed
by Zinmu Rijund?

114
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,245
Come on. Please hurry.

115
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,915
They're number one in domestic sales,
patented medical devices,

116
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,751
and are known for supporting
clinical trials and research.

117
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,796
-Are you talking about Zinmu Rijund?
-Wow.

118
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,132
Dr. Cha really brought about
a huge change here.

119
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,386
This is all so amazing.

120
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,054
-Let's take a photo.
-Okay.

121
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,263
-Let's go.
-Gosh, unnecessary.

122
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,848
Hurry.

123
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,600
Our faces aren't that important.

124
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,977
What's important is Zinmu Rijund's logo.

125
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,272
Here we go. One, two, three.

126
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,192
Hello!

127
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,778
-Hello.
-Hello.

128
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,243
Please stand next to each other.

129
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
Great. Please pose for the camera.

130
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,747
Heart. Thumbs up.

131
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,541
We can do it!

132
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,710
Could the two in the middle shake hands?

133
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,628
Please applaud.

134
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,964
Where's Dr. Cha
when he should be the star?

135
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,048
Exactly.

136
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,135
I can understand the director
and chief being here,

137
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,595
but why is Dr. Kwon here?

138
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,931
-Exactly.
-My goodness.

139
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,853
This morning, Chief Min
asked Dr. Cha to come,

140
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,604
but he rejected the offer.

141
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,691
He's so antisocial.

142
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,653
I know, right? You should be
sociable at work like them.

143
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,196
All right.

144
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,865
It's a masterpiece!

145
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,200
You're so handsome!

146
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,702
I look so nice.

147
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,079
Not only that. We're receiving
support from Zinmu Rijund.

148
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,540
Well, things are going quite well, Chief.

149
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,544
You're right. The media is doing
its best to sugarcoat him.

150
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,795
"Sugarcoat"?

151
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,089
His patients
are extremely content with him.

152
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,842
It's natural for them to think
he's competent.

153
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,512
Yes, you are totally right.

154
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,766
I heard my dear Dr. Cha
will be presenting at a symposium.

155
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,060
-"My dear Dr. Cha"?
-I heard it's about analgesia.

156
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,646
Yes. It's not common.

157
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,149
I thought it'd be helpful
for other doctors as well,

158
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,066
so I said to do it.

159
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,570
That was a wise decision.
I'll tell the PR team about it.

160
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,071
I should go now.

161
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,128
By the way, did you see the article?

162
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,298
-Which article?
-You didn't?

163
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
Exactly which article?

164
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,056
Hello.

165
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,976
Did you not sleep well?

166
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,896
I should be asking you that.

167
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,482
Don't get me started.

168
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,318
My kitten was crying all night long.

169
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,903
You have a kitten?

170
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,822
Well…

171
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,324
It just happened.

172
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,202
Hello, Dr. Cha.

173
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,666
Please don't joke around with me today.

174
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,251
I'm not in the mood.

175
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,711
-That's not it.
-Why do you keep teasing me?

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,463
-Wait.
-What about Dr. Cha?

177
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,091
-He's behind--
-He has nothing to do with me.

178
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,314
-Going up.
-Aren't you getting in?

179
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,566
Well…

180
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,443
Coffee. You should go first.

181
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,403
Door closing.

182
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,882
Let's buy coffee.

183
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,258
What?

184
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,181
Did you get home safely?

185
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,434
Yes.

186
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,313
Why…

187
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,734
Why aren't you saying anything
about what happened yesterday?

188
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,904
Not saying anything is my answer…

189
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,408
to yesterday's incident.

190
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,457
Door opening.

191
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,841
Thank you…

192
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,969
for what you said.

193
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,140
I'm grateful to hear that.

194
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,171
Here's your coffee.

195
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,798
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

196
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,928
What's all this?

197
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,389
Cats go crazy over them.

198
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,141
One a day should be enough.

199
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,893
And this is for the joints.

200
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,565
This is a brush.

201
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,191
What's this?

202
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,444
It's a toy.

203
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,154
They like it when you shake it.

204
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,322
When did you prepare all this?

205
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,950
Everything's great…

206
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,245
but there's something more important.

207
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,997
You meet someone.

208
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,584
There was a rough patch at first,

209
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,502
but we started to like each other.

210
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,298
What's the next step, then?

211
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,847
Do you not know?

212
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,855
We should give it a name.

213
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,444
How pretty.

214
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,534
Isn't it adorable?

215
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,856
Dad...

216
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
can you call my name at least once?

217
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,531
Say, "Si-young."

218
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,203
I miss your voice.

219
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,089
What is that?

220
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,276
It was you.

221
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,574
No wonder.

222
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,827
He always had a clean shave.

223
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,299
Hello, I'm Jung Chan-seok
from Zinmu Rijund.

224
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,468
I see.

225
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,389
Your hospital's Pain Management Center
will get a makeover.

226
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,767
We will be supporting you
with whatever you need.

227
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,021
Thank you. We were in need
of a lot of equipment anyway.

228
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,774
Feel free to tell me
when you need anything.

229
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,318
I'll see you at the symposium tomorrow.

230
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,319
Goodbye.

231
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,329
This morning…

232
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,832
I found this article.

233
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,506
EUTHANASIA DOCTOR RETURNS
AFTER THREE YEARS

234
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
What did I say, director?

235
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,554
However successful he is,

236
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,724
Dr. Cha won't do us any good
by becoming a public figure.

237
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,350
-Stop it.
-Okay.

238
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,230
That reporter. What's his name,
and where does he work?

239
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,362
Soon, we'll discuss whether to take
Chairman Kang off the ventilator.

240
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,489
Officially and publicly.

241
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,619
Based on his current condition,

242
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,664
it will be very controversial.

243
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,002
I don't want you to influence
this discussion in any way,

244
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
wittingly or unwittingly.

245
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,924
Keep that in mind
whenever you speak or act,

246
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,218
and be very cautious.

247
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,349
Okay. I understand what you mean.

248
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,937
Go and see your new equipment.

249
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,442
-Be very careful.
-This is amazing.

250
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,489
Come along, everyone.

251
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,368
Isn't it awesome?

252
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,496
Gosh.

253
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,416
I brought the drinks you ordered.

254
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,044
-Drinks?
-Who ordered these?

255
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,212
Who else could it be?

256
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,632
It's a special day, so it's my treat.

257
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,134
Enjoy yourselves!

258
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,429
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

259
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,098
Thank you.

260
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,141
Here.

261
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,687
Hello.

262
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,023
-Hello.
-Hello.

263
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,364
Dr. Cha. Congratulations.

264
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,491
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations!

265
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,246
It's nothing.

266
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,754
It's the new model.

267
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,357
It's nice.

268
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,697
AP, AP, let's go.

269
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,533
One, two, three.

270
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,910
AP, AP, let's go!

271
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,705
Time for a meeting.

272
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,961
Thirty-seven, female.

273
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,630
Pain on the left side of her face.

274
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,217
Wait. Her name is Yoo Ri-hye?

275
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,636
Is it the Yoo Ri-hye we know?

276
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,430
-Yes.
-What?

277
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,724
No way, no way.

278
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,058
I was a huge fan.

279
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,226
YOO RI-HYE

280
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,230
She's my ideal type.

281
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,484
Mine too. I cried when she announced
her marriage and retirement.

282
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,110
-Me too.
-Me too.

283
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,073
She got divorced
and came back not long after.

284
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,243
She was in many dramas
and films until two years ago.

285
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,206
Yes. Two years ago,
she got a rare cancer and stopped acting.

286
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,626
That's true. I heard she's still
being treated. What does she have?

287
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,628
Olfactory neuroblastoma.

288
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,463
Yes. It spread all over,

289
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,632
and she stopped additional treatment.

290
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,801
Do you mean there's nothing
that can be done?

291
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
That's right.

292
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,681
What kind of disease
is olfactory neuroblastoma?

293
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,353
CHAE EUN-JEONG, 11 MISSED CALLS

294
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
I was in court. Is something wrong?

295
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,403
Listen carefully.

296
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,533
I think the time you mentioned
came sooner than we thought.

297
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,184
Present her photo.

298
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,448
A caretaker at Hanse told me.

299
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,951
She was admitted today, and…

300
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,787
Cha Yo-han is her doctor.

301
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,334
Cha Yo-han will ruin himself.

302
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,420
We just need to wait...

303
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,966
for him to meet a patient who only has…

304
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,177
pain and death left.

305
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,223
Mom, she looks scary.

306
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,017
You can't say that.

307
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,518
Let's go.

308
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,029
Where did her eye go?

309
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,947
YOO RI-HYE SUFFERING FROM RARE CANCER

310
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,867
Inside her nose. Is that the tumor?

311
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,328
MRI and CT.

312
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,916
The MRI shows
the eye is being pushed outward.

313
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,044
Olfactory neuroblastoma is a disease

314
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,630
where a tumor in the nasal cavity
grows larger.

315
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,382
As her tumor grew,
her face became disfigured,

316
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,260
and she lost her sight,
sense of smell, and taste.

317
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,263
How long has her face been disfigured?

318
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,974
-About two years?
-In her case,

319
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,893
if chemo or radiation's of no use,

320
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,562
is pain relief all we can offer?

321
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,938
Yes.

322
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,107
Her pain must be immense.

323
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,653
This patient requires pain relief
urgently and desperately.

324
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,157
We have to block the semilunar ganglion.

325
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,786
Let's do that procedure
with the RF equipment

326
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,663
-that came in today.
-Okay.

327
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,248
Dr. Cha.

328
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,542
The patient's here.

329
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,090
Dr. Lee, have you done this before?

330
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,216
Stop.

331
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,968
No. I just observed it once.

332
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,053
It's really tough.

333
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,056
It takes a long time to find
the right ganglion.

334
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
Lie down here.

335
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,670
It's a little cold.

336
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,257
Hello.

337
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,390
Hello, I'm Cha Yo-han,
and I'm here to relieve your pain.

338
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,685
It's a sensitive procedure,
and you'll feel discomfort.

339
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,186
It could be painful.

340
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,816
We'll begin.

341
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,526
Drape.

342
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,028
TO SANITIZE THE SURGICAL AREA
AND COVER WITH CLEAN CLOTH

343
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,121
I'll cover with a sterile cloth.
Don't be alarmed.

344
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,923
Set to 33 degrees.

345
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,555
Adjust angle.

346
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,307
Five more degrees.

347
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,601
Okay, that's fine.

348
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,686
Tweezers.

349
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,148
Check.

350
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,026
Check.

351
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
Local anesthetic.

352
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,456
Needle.

353
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,711
I'll go through the foramen ovale
to the nerve.

354
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,129
Okay.

355
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,547
HOLE IN THE SPHENOID BONE

356
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,301
Check.

357
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,221
Check.

358
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,473
Lateral view.

359
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,937
That's fine.

360
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,568
Check.

361
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,780
Check.

362
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,367
Check.

363
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,913
Sensory check. RF.

364
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,374
SENSORY CHECK: TO CHECK FOR SENSES

365
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,126
-Will it work in one go?
-I don't know.

366
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,046
Can anyone do it on their first try?

367
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,807
We'll start at 50 hertz, 0.3 ampere.

368
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,018
I'll begin.

369
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,486
Do you feel the electricity
where your face hurts?

370
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,738
Yes.

371
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,122
Ganglion confirmed.

372
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,457
How's her pulse and BP? All normal?

373
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,501
-Yes, normal.
-Lidocaine.

374
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,047
I'll inject the anesthetic.

375
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,322
Ma'am, if you don't feel any pain,
please raise your right arm.

376
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,253
From 75 degrees for 60 seconds,

377
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,673
-start coagulation.
-The coagulation will begin now.

378
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,391
We'll keep an eye on you for a few days.

379
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,810
Let me know whenever you feel any pain.

380
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
Good work.

381
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,318
-Good work.
-Good work.

382
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,696
-He is truly amazing.
-He really is.

383
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,079
Good work, doctor.

384
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,207
Are you okay?

385
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,547
Yes. I'm fine. I was slightly dizzy.

386
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,636
That's why you should eat and sleep well.

387
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,055
Since you're always working late
and not eating well,

388
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,556
your body has become weak.

389
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,310
Should I show you
a really nice restaurant?

390
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,396
You'll feel better after eating.

391
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,816
I'm feeling fine now.

392
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,782
I don't think I can see patients

393
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,826
because I need to prepare
for the symposium.

394
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,286
-Please tell the others.
-Okay, I will.

395
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,263
Ri-hye.

396
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,518
I'll bring Min-seok over,
so why don't you meet him?

397
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,395
I'd like to go to my hospital room.

398
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,314
-Okay.
-Will you keep doing this?

399
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,942
Will you not see your one and only son?

400
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,485
Please hurry!

401
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,129
I refuse to have any visitors.

402
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,840
Please don't let anyone in.

403
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,759
Do you understand?

404
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,969
Okay.

405
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,446
May I go in?

406
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,366
She doesn't wish to see anyone.

407
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,579
Will she never see him again?

408
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,706
Are you talking about her son?

409
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,000
After the divorce,
her ex took care of him.

410
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,836
He didn't let her meet her own son,
so they've barely met.

411
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,381
Why do you think
she's refusing to meet him?

412
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,552
My sister's only source of joy
and way of communicating with him

413
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,347
was through texting.

414
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,473
WHILE FILMING

415
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,184
She sent him photos every day
so that he'd remember her face.

416
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,396
She never skipped a day.

417
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,944
Two years ago,
she was diagnosed with cancer.

418
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
And she couldn't tell him about it.

419
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,991
She kept postponing…

420
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,201
MOM, I GOT AN AWARD!

421
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,161
…and postponing.

422
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,788
I TRIED COOKING TODAY
IT WASN'T TASTY

423
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,207
Mom, did you not film today?

424
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:34,799
I LOVE…

425
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,261
She could neither tell him…

426
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,847
that she'd be dying soon…

427
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,308
nor show him her changing face.

428
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,828
Mom, why aren't you sending
photos of yourself these days?

429
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,954
I miss you.

430
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,708
Mom, come on.

431
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,174
MOM, WHY AREN'T YOU SENDING
PHOTOS OF YOURSELF THESE DAYS?

432
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,524
After being diagnosed with terminal cancer

433
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,402
and losing her vision,
she stopped contacting him altogether.

434
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,410
Then did he only recently find out
about his mom's illness?

435
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,829
Yes.

436
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,207
I told him about it

437
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,876
and finally persuaded his dad
to allow him to come.

438
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,377
But she's refusing to meet him.

439
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,673
She says he'll be shocked to see her face.

440
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,220
She doesn't want to be remembered
as a monster.

441
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,882
Did Yoo Ri-hye receive
any additional analgesics?

442
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,550
No, she just fell asleep.

443
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,637
If she feels pain, please administer PRN.

444
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,390
I'll be at the symposium tomorrow,
so let me know if anything happens.

445
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,557
Yes, doctor.

446
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,915
You're working so hard
late into the night.

447
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,181
I'm reporter Ahn Seung-hyun
from Social Times.

448
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,808
We met briefly yesterday. Do you remember?

449
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,769
How do you feel about
getting reinstated again

450
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,479
after the euthanasia incident
at Myeongwon?

451
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,694
Oh, yes. This is a restricted area.

452
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,112
How did you get in?

453
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,448
Is it?

454
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,617
I waited to ask you a question.

455
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,411
Could you spare me some time?

456
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,455
I only give official
and planned interviews.

457
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,666
The exit is that way.

458
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,338
Dr. Cha!

459
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,965
He's coming.

460
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,635
Dr. Cha.

461
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,223
-Dr. Cha.
-The reporter is coming.

462
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,642
The reporter… The reporter is coming.

463
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,852
-The reporter?
-He's coming here.

464
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,382
Dr. Cha. Dr. Cha!

465
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,265
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

466
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,851
Dr. Cha!

467
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,587
Doctor.

468
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,547
He has a high fever and is unconscious.

469
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,008
Any other symptoms?
Abdominal pain or vomiting?

470
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,094
We don't know. Please run some tests.

471
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,513
Okay. Show them to the waiting area.

472
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,056
-Start with a blood test.
-Yes.

473
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,474
Please do a brain CT too.

474
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,185
A brain CT?

475
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,813
He might have bumped his head
into something when he fell.

476
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,524
Okay. Let me show you
where you should wait.

477
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,734
Come this way.

478
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,072
INFLUENZA VACCINATION

479
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,920
He took sick leave recently too.
Is there something wrong with him?

480
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,508
But why did you bring him
to another hospital?

481
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,765
I didn't want people at ours
to start talking.

482
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,224
Makes sense.

483
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,940
The tests are over.
Please wait for the results.

484
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,442
Okay.

485
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,010
Let me go make a phone call.

486
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,846
-Sorry?
-I was on my way to my mom.

487
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,598
I should probably tell her I'll be late.

488
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,058
Okay.

489
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,310
Thank you.

490
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,605
For helping me.

491
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,482
You talk like you're the only one worried.

492
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,318
I'm worried about Dr. Cha too.

493
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,372
Dr. Cha.

494
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,132
We're in the emergency room.
How do you feel?

495
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,094
You collapsed in front of the exit
on the first floor.

496
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,888
Do you remember?

497
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,514
What about the reporter?

498
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,309
We hid in time, so he didn't see you.

499
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,940
Sir, you woke up.

500
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,484
How do you feel?

501
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,402
-I feel fine.
-Good.

502
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,988
The test results are in.

503
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,032
-Nothing--
-Excuse me.

504
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,118
Vitals.

505
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,289
Blood test.

506
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,835
CT?

507
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,964
Did you ask for a CT too?

508
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,555
Everything seems normal.

509
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,848
Pardon?

510
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,017
Well, yes.

511
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,520
You can go once you're done with that.

512
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,146
Thank you.

513
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,735
Why?

514
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,111
Let's go.

515
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,280
No. You need to rest.

516
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,449
Dr. Cha.

517
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,368
Are you okay?

518
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,537
Yes, I'm fine.

519
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,080
Why are you here?

520
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,458
Dr. Kang called me when you collapsed.

521
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,043
Are you leaving already?

522
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,882
Where's the car?

523
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,140
Are you sure you're okay?

524
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,102
You even have to give a presentation
at the symposium tomorrow.

525
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,270
I'm fine.

526
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,355
I'll do everything as planned.

527
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,504
Thank you for today. See you.

528
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,714
Will you be okay?

529
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,716
Pick you up tomorrow?

530
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,760
You don't have to.
I'll see you at the symposium.

531
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,930
I'm sorry I keep nagging,

532
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,224
but you shouldn't drive
for the time being, okay?

533
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,726
I know. I'll take a taxi.

534
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,695
Is he really okay? My goodness.

535
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,048
Are you okay?

536
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,476
I have something to tell you.

537
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,354
Come in.

538
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:54,950
Care for tea?

539
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,453
What is it?

540
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,290
There's something wrong
with your body. What is it?

541
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,043
I hear a ringing in my ears,
and I feel a bit dizzy too.

542
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,670
Ringing?

543
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,589
-Yes.
-Get a checkup.

544
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,300
-You have a doctor, right?
-Yes.

545
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,844
Then go to him tomorrow.

546
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,014
You should cancel the presentation
and go to the hospital.

547
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,559
-I'll take care of it.
-You'll go, right?

548
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,104
-You'll get a checkup, right?
-I'll take care of it.

549
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,064
What if you collapse again?

550
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,736
If it wasn't me who found you back there…

551
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,071
It shouldn't happen…

552
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,866
but if this incident repeats itself,

553
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,744
it'll be a problem if someone else
finds you in that state.

554
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,413
But if no one finds you,
that would be horrible.

555
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,831
Just thinking of that…

556
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,587
In the ER, the doctor was asking me
where you were hurting

557
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,464
and what the symptoms were…

558
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,967
but I couldn't answer.

559
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,346
Even if I had been conscious,
I wouldn't have been able to answer.

560
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,225
-That's my illness.
-My point exactly.

561
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,519
Let me help you.

562
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,690
You monitor
your unresponsive body endlessly

563
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,318
and even have to hide the fact
that you're doing so.

564
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,822
Let me help you.
I'll do everything that I can.

565
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,371
Hey.

566
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,251
You look too serious.

567
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,880
It's not that big of a deal.

568
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,466
I'm fine.

569
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,093
You're not fine.

570
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,763
-You need my help.
-Si-young.

571
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,479
My illness, what's happening
inside of my body…

572
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,274
isn't a curse.

573
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,238
Everyone gets sick in their lifetime.

574
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,781
I'm not an exception.

575
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,243
I'm not saying you're different.

576
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,496
But you won't be able to detect
any symptoms.

577
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,707
But for me, I know my body very well…

578
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,877
and I'm used to my illness.

579
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,466
Good work today. I'll see you tomorrow.

580
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,348
Is it because you feel uncomfortable
about my feelings for you?

581
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,728
I'll handle…

582
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,814
my own feelings.

583
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,569
Please don't refuse my help
just because of that.

584
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,032
You're helping me enough.

585
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,035
Keeping someone else's secret means…

586
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,913
that you're willing to put up
with many things.

587
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,459
You're already doing that,
and that's enough.

588
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,674
You should go. I need some rest.

589
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,464
A pain-relieving procedure?

590
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,050
Yes, she was admitted
to the hospital for that.

591
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,468
And Dr. Cha is in charge.

592
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,470
How bad is her condition?

593
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,098
I saw her face this afternoon.

594
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,810
I've never seen a patient
in such awful condition.

595
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,646
She was diagnosed
as terminally ill recently.

596
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,067
From what I know, they offered her to sign
the advance medical directive.

597
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,902
-Did she sign it?
-Not yet.

598
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,156
-How about going to a hospice?
-She refused that as well.

599
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,245
That beautiful lady was diagnosed
with such a terrible illness.

600
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,331
I doubt she wishes to fight through this.

601
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,000
She has a son.

602
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,545
-Bye.
-Bye.

603
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,923
He's only eight years old.

604
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,760
Imagine how heartbroken she must be.

605
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,563
Prosecutor Son, it's me.

606
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,319
The cancer cells have spread,
so she stopped receiving treatment.

607
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,070
She's refused to go to a hospice.

608
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,196
YOO RI-HYE HAS RARE CANCER

609
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,948
I heard one of your members…

610
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,952
went to Switzerland not long ago.

611
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,915
I heard about the assisted suicide.

612
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,961
This is all I have on her.

ZINMU RIJUND TO FUND SEOUL HANSE

614
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,424
Zinmu Rijund, a pharmaceutical company,

615
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,427
decided to support
Hanse's Pain Management Center.

616
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,930
They're currently bringing in
new medical equipment.

617
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,849
Wait a minute.

618
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,113
"Death Talks."

619
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,574
Isn't that the meeting
you went to yesterday?

620
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,493
Yes.

621
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:16,206
DEATH TALKS

622
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,290
It's the same logo.

623
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,251
Zinmu Rijund.

624
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,838
What do you think the relationship is
between the two?

625
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,966
They could get volunteers
for their clinical trials.

626
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,136
But seeing how they displayed
their logo like so,

627
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,680
there must be more to it.

628
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,732

642
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,900
This symposium is a hit.

643
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,069
It's teeming with people.

644
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,988
Things have been crazy the past few days,

645
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,739
so I'm sure that's gathered more people.

646
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,492
You're right.
So many people are interested.

647
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,041
You should add this.

648
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,044
You might upset your stomach.

649
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,475
There are so many people here.
This symposium is very popular.

Let's go inside.

651

Did you get in touch with Dr. Cha?

652
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,152
No. What about you?

653
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,321
I called him this morning,
but he didn't pick up.

654
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,616
He should be okay, yes?

LATEST VIEWS ON TREATING CIPA PATIENTS

657
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,030
I think

658
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,409
doctors share a similarity with
detectives of a Violent Crimes squad.

659
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,829
The culprits are illnesses
that attack our patients.

660
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,832
And we're the detectives
who need to find them.

661
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,795
One day, we meet a criminal
that's very hard to catch.

662
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,839
He doesn't say a word,

663
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,093
and something we haven't yet identified
slowly begins to attack from inside.

664
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,055
The illness I'll be discussing is…

665
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,601
the genetic transmission
of hereditary sensory

666
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,519
and autonomic neuropathy type IV, CIPA.

667
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,105
With this illness, the criminal is silent.

668
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,651
In other words, it numbs your senses
and ability to feel pain.

669
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,744
Patients keep biting their tongue
once they grow teeth.

670
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,539
Their hands and feet
are repeatedly injured and deformed.

671
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,753
They rub their eyes to the point
where they damage their corneas.

672
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,092
Despite losing bits of their tongue
and tearing their corneas,

673
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:42,221
they don't feel pain,
so they can't stop these actions.

674
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,224
They're also less able to secrete sweat

675
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,810
to lower their body temperature,

676
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,855
so more than 50 percent
die before age three of a fever.

677
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:56,194
In other words, a patient's
average life span is very short.

The case I'll present today

681
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,885
disrupted the definition of CIPA.

682
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:26,140
A patient who could feel no pain
started to feel pain.

683
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,769
It'll sound interesting,
but hard to understand.

684
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,189
So instead of explaining,
I'll take questions.

685
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,191

689
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,732
Yes. What's your question?

690
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,110
It must've been a mysterious case.

691
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,862
The cause.

692
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,614
Based on your analogy, it would be a lead.

693
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,118
You must've felt lost,
not having any clues or leads.

694
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,996
How did you grasp the problem first?

695
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,415
Thanks for using my analogy.

696
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,420
The starting point to solving the mystery…

697
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,174
was the phantom limb pain.

698
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,551
A real ghost pain. Phantom limb pain.

699
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,348
He felt pain when there was none.

700
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,809
My team flipped that hypothesis.

701
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,897
It's not that he didn't feel pain.
There was no pain.

702
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,232
Having no pain…

703
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,445
I don't understand what you just said.

704
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:07,408
There was no pain, so he felt pain?

705
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,419
I apologize. Could you say that again?

706
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,215
I'm sure you'll explain later,

707
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,343
but from what I know,
phantom limb pain, CIPA,

708
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,345
and central sensitization

709
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,181
are all related in some manner…

710
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,437
Yes. So, about that...

711
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:41,859
I was talking to
a second-year resident on my team

712
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,694
when I got the hint.

713
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,743
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

714
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:07,009
I'm sorry. I'll answer again.

715
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,457
Doctor.

716
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,668
Have some water.

717
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,851
ANESTHESIOLOGY AND PAIN MANAGEMENT
SYMPOSIUM

718
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,354
PRESENTER: CHA YO-HAN

719
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,071
Prosecutor. I think it's today.

720
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,823
The day you talked about.

721
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,035
What? Yoo Ri-hye…

722
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,954
What about her?

723
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,997
Please don't do this.

724
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,292
Shouldn't you let me do whatever I want

725
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,919
to free myself from my illness?

726
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,634
How much time do I have left

727
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,636
to live as a doctor?

728
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,348
I don't think you have long.
