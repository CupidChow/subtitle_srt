1
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,243
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,380
Save me.

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,633
Doctor, I want to live.

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,636
Save me.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,474
Save me.

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,315
Dr. Cha, please promise me…

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,609
that you'll...

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,570
help me recover...

9
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,449
from this illness.

10
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,870
I'll do my best.

11
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,084
I'll give it my best.

12
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,420
So you also...

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,216
need to stay strong.

14
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,470
Okay, I'll stay strong.

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,140
Help me.

16
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,493
I have CIPA.

17
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,663
Congenital insensitivity to pain
with anhidrosis.

18
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,540
He put on a show thus far.

19
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,669
How can someone who has CIPA
treat patients?

20
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,048
I will report him myself.

21
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,854
Lastly, do you have anything to say
to the patients out there

22
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,106
who are suffering from pain?

23
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,108
DR. CHA YO-HAN

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,361
I have nothing to say.

25
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,029
Pardon?

26
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,241
There's nothing I can say
to console their pain.

27
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,536
But I promise that
I'll do my best to get rid of,

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,789
and reduce the pain that they have.

29
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,020
Dr. Cha, we got the test results,

30
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,772
and the numbers are a little odd.

31
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,985
The galactomannan value needs to be
over 0.5 to be considered positive.

32
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,445
And he got 0.6.

33
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,903
Why did you want to see me?

34
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,614
Do you remember telling me that you'd

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,617
leave it to the patients
to judge what kind of doctor you are?

36
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,750
You can break your bones, cut your flesh,

37
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,463
get a burn, and suffer from frostbite.

38
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,802
But you still won't be able
to feel any pain.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,514
So how will it be possible for you
to understand your patients?

40
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,559
Is that why it was so easy for you
to euthanize someone?

41
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,189
Because you think of pain
as something you study...

42
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,484
rather than something you feel?

43
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,530
I know it's too late to hold a retrial,

44
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,117
but I'm going to question
your qualifications as a doctor

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,744
on whether or not you have the right

46
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,080
to care for the patients.

47
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,587
Are you done?

48
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,174
I'm busy.
I'll get going if you're finished.

49
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,759
Dr. Cha.

50
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,725
Why did you come see me
if you know about my illness

51
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,935
and that I don't deserve
to treat patients?

52
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,645
What did you want to see?

53
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,898
Did you want to see
if I was being honest or hypocritical?

54
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,861
I'm sorry, but as I told you before,
my patients are the only ones

55
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,322
who have the right to decide
whether I'm qualified or not.

56
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,490
Are you confident?

57
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,787
Are you confident that your patients
will continue to trust you

58
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,458
without feeling betrayed
even after they find out about you?

59
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,045
Even in this very moment, a patient
of mine is lying in bed unconscious.

60
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,672
Whether I can save that patient or not,

61
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,799
that's what's important to me.

62
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,022
How are you acquainted
with former Minister Lee Won-gil?

63
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,408
RESTRICTED AREA

64
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,261
Dr. Cha, you need to get over here.

65
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,776
I don't know if he's conscious
or if his eyes are just open.

66
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,821
I can't check because
he can't react to pain.

67
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,408
Gi-seok, can you hear me?

68
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,241
Gi-seok, I want you to follow my finger.

69
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,457
Gi-seok, try moving your hand.

70
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,254
Try moving your feet.

71
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,430
Gi-seok, I want you to blink
if you can hear me.

72
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,950
-Locked-in syndrome.
-Locked-in syndrome.

73
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,745
A CONDITION WHERE YOU'RE CONSCIOUS
BUT CAN'T REACT TO EXTERNAL STIMULUS

74
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,211
Lee Won-gil?

75
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,254
I don't know who he is.
Am I supposed to know him?

76
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
What if…

77
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,259
there's a drug that allows you
to die comfortably in happiness?

78
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,346
And what if...

79
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,683
someone was to allow you to use that drug?

80
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,519
Die in happiness?

81
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,022
How can there be a drug like that?

82
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,276
Life and death aren't that simple.

83
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,738
If you feel the urge to die
and you see that drug right next to you,

84
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,241
do you think you'll just take it and die?

85
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,621
And even if someone wishes to die,

86
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,250
all living beings have an instinct
to stay alive

87
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,169
up until the very moment
they breathe their last breath.

88
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,256
That's human nature,
and it doesn't change that easily.

89
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,007
And that's why every living being…

90
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,180
is very pitiful.

91
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,216
Hello?

92
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,802
-Did he admit to it?
-Yes.

93
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,598
All that's left for him
is to lose his license.

94
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,476
This isn't enough to make him
lose his medical license.

95
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,813
But we'll at least be able
to get him fired from that hospital.

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,191
Once people know they're being treated
by a doctor who can't feel pain,

97
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,570
many patients will start to question
his medical diagnosis.

98
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,990
I want you to calm down first.

99
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,742
Let's think about it.

100
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,827
What's to think about?

101
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,122
I have a lot on my mind
other than this issue.

102
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,082
Let's talk about this next time.

103
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,167
Prosecutor Son.

104
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,928
-Locked-in syndrome?
-Yes.

105
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,724
We must find out what caused it.

106
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,978
Depending on the cause,
the prognosis can be good or bad.

107
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,609
At least, now he can communicate with you
by blinking.

108
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,157
Do you know any of Gi-seok's friends

109
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,784
who could tell us what happened?

110
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,247
Yes. Someone called to ask how he's doing.

111
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,333
Could you ask that friend
to come to the hospital?

112
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,919
Yes. I'll ask him.

113
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,885
We can relax a bit now.

114
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,804
If we just identify the cause…

115
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,309
What is it?

116
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
It's nothing.

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,947
How much longer do I have

118
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,449
to live as a doctor?

119
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,827
-Dr. Cha.
-You're awake.

120
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,456
-I dozed off.
-You stayed all night?

121
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,086
Did you get some sleep?

122
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,256
Yes. You did a lot of studying.

123
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,302
I found this.

124
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,680
A research team at Clevlend Clinic

125
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,350
is studying pain management
with the CIPA gene.

126
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,813
They should have much more data
and material on CIPA cases.

127
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Shall I contact them?

128
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,530
What?

129
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,286
It's nothing. Can I take a look at this?

130
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,537
Yes.

131
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,759
You must stay strong

132
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,303
if Gi-seok's to have the energy to fight.

133
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,723
At least, now he can blink to communicate.
We made progress.

134
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,935
Right.

135
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,151
That's it. As my mom says, food is energy!

136
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,654
She says that.

137
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,781
Eat up.

138
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,369
Excuse me.

139
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,537
Yes, Dr. Cha.

140
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,418
Gi-seok, did you inject yourself
with steroids while working out?

141
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,463
This. If I'm right, blink once.

142
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,298
If not, blink twice.

143
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,136
Did you go to a new place
other than the gym?

144
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,310
-Where?
-Ask yes or no questions.

145
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,395
Oh, right.

146
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,438
Excuse me.

147
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,362
Just a moment.

148
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,544
Dr. Cha, I have something to tell you.

149
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,005
I met Gi-seok's friend.

150
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,384
Assault? He was assaulted?

151
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,220
Yes. A group of kids bullied Gi-seok.

152
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,973
He was dragged to a warehouse
and beaten up.

153
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,641
A warehouse?

154
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,645
Hey.

155
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,357
Hey, do you really not feel pain?

156
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,651
Hey, does this not hurt?

157
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,902
Stop it.

158
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,823
Hey. Get up.

159
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,702
Stab yourself. You did it before.

160
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,789
-Gi-seok.
-Gi-seok.

161
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,374
I don't do that anymore.

162
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,876
Move.

163
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,588
Is that so?

164
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,090
-I'll make you feel pain.
-Come here.

165
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,551
He hit his head?

166
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,636
Yes.

167
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,186
How about this?

168
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,189
That must've hurt. Oh, no.

169
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,940
Come on, Gi-seok.

170
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,902
-Where do you think you're going?
-Fight back, Gi-seok.

171
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,405
-Fight, Gi-seok.
-Where are you going?

172
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,627
Let's do a CTA.

173
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,795
CT ANGIOGRAPHY

174
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,379
Do you suspect something?

175
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,508
Vertebral artery dissection.

176
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,052
DECREASED BLOOD FLOW FROM INTERNAL RUPTURE
OF A VERTEBRAL ARTERY

177
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,011
Doctor.

178
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,055
The first CT didn't show anything.

179
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,599
If it's acute, cerebral infarctions
don't show up on CTs.

180
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,684
We'll test right away.

181
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,859
What's the matter?

182
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,403
If his vertebral artery is dissected,

183
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,405
his prognosis...

184
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,699
will be very bad.

185
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,036
We don't know the result yet.
Let's check first.

VOICE OF THE CUSTOMERS

187
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,223
NAME, EMAIL, MAKE PUBLIC, TITLE

188
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,212
Ma'am, your patient's here.

189
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,546
Okay, thanks.

190
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,570
This garden was made

191
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,073
by the volunteer workers at this hospice.

192
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,119
When they are indoors,
they only talk about being sick.

193
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,290
But out here, they can talk
about beautiful things

194
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,709
such as flowers and trees.

195
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,296
I can't smell the flowers,

196
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,674
but I can hear the birds singing,

197
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,051
and the breeze blowing

198
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,972
through the leaves.

199
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,139
Is that so?

200
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,642
Mom, come here.

201
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,031
-Hello.
-Mom.

202
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,575
Aren't they beautiful?

203
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,786
Yes, they are.

204
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,789
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, I am.

205
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,292
It may not be easy,
but you mustn't skip your meals.

206
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,127
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.

207
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,637
I'm really happy to see you.

208
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,974
Right.

209
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,517
Give me your hand.

210
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,987
Like this.

211
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,158
I caught you. I caught you.

212
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,496
Who's your most favorite person?

213
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
You.

214
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,376
You're my most favorite person
in the world, too, Jeong-in.

215
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,921
-It's so hot.
-Is it?

216
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,969
The morning breeze is cold

217
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,016
The wild goose is crying

218
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,603
Please send my teacher

219
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,522
My baby is in there! Jeong-in!

220
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,524
Jeong-in!

221
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,903
Mom!

222
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,869
No?

223
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,538
He had no symptoms.

224
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,876
Still, I'm glad it's not dissection
of the vertebral artery.

225
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,585
There's a footprint.

226
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,264
Do you think this is also
from the assault?

227
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,432
Find out...

228
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,018
-where that warehouse is.
-Okay.

229
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,868
-Director, we have a problem.
-What is it this time?

230
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,036
This was uploaded onto our bulletin board.

VOICE OF THE CUSTOMERS

232
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,084
HOW COULD SOMEONE WHO CAN'T FEEL PAIN
BE A RENOWNED DOCTOR?

233
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,419
What is this?

234
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,552
"How could someone who can't feel pain
be a renowned doctor?"

235
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,929
My goodness.

236
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,890
Who'd write such nonsense?

237
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,183
Does this make any sense?

238
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,977
Dr. Cha is a CIPA patient?

239
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,354
We ran several tests
after he was appointed.

240
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,981
There weren't any abnormalities.

241
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,067
It's a genetic issue, a mere recruitment
checkup wouldn't have caught it.

242
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,655
In order to verify this rumor,

243
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,783
we can ask him directly.

244
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,203
Dr. Cha?

245
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,163
Who'd write something like that?

246
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,249
Right? Who'd dare to write
such a groundless rumor

247
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,626
on our hospital's bulletin board?

248
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:07,297
Hold on. This isn't just any rumor.
This is defamation.

249
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,759
Seeing how this was uploaded
as soon as he appeared on TV,

250
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,844
someone must've been jealous of him.

251
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,931
People who appear on TV for the first time
tend to be mocked by weirdoes.

252
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,392
That must be the case, right?
To be honest, he did seem

253
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,103
a bit strange when he first met Gi-seok,
so I was suspicious.

254
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,315
Was he strange? I had no idea.

255
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,907
-Dr. Lee.
-Yes?

256
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,200
Get the bed ready.

257
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,326
Shouldn't he go to the ER?

258
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,744
No.

259
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,204
He's our patient.

260
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,001
The only thing I can say is that
the impossible has happened.

261
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,931
He's a bit strange.

262
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,643
Right? He kept asking about
the CIPA patient's results.

263
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,729
-Sir!
-He has a fever and is unconscious.

264
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,440
Why did you want to bring him
to another hospital?

265
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,527
I didn't want to cause a scene
at our hospital.

266
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,863
What is it?

267
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,540
Could I know where that warehouse was?

268
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,835
Okay. Please let me know
once you find out the address.

269
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,752
Thanks.

270
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,550
Dr. Kang, we need to talk.

271
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,135
What is it?

272
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,636
Is it true?

273
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,263
What?

274
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,515
Is Dr. Cha…

275
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,768
a CIPA patient?

276
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,186
Dr. Cha!

277
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
Did you find out?

278
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,982
Not yet, but…

279
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,110
What's wrong?

280
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,673
Last night, Prosecutor Son Seok-ki
visited me.

281
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,509
He knew about my illness.

282
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:00,970
It's okay.

283
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,183
I've always kept in mind that
this day could one day come.

284
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,481
What happened?

285
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,989
Sit down.

286
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,123
Dr. Cha.

287
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,837
You promised me.

288
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,298
You said if anything happened to you,

289
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,719
I'd be the first one to know.

290
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,907
Don't cry.

291
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,830
Don't cry.

292
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,605
Dr. Cha.

293
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,610
Is it true?

294
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,579
How do you think this will unfold?

295
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,004
CHIEF MIN TAE-KYUNG

298
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,851
of treating patients being a CIPA patient

299
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,812
have arisen."

PROSECUTOR SON SEOK-KI

301

COMPETENT DOCTOR AT HOSPITAL
TURNS OUT TO BE A CIPA PATIENT

302
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,397
HOSPITAL IS SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER
WEREN'T THEY ON TV RECENTLY?

303
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,943
WHY ISN'T THE HOSPITAL RESPONDING TO THIS?

304
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,945
WHY IS THAT ILLNESS AN ISSUE?

305
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,203
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

306
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,915
I'm sorry to have called you all in.

307
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,835
A serious matter arose, so it was urgent.

308
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,222
Dr. Cha, please sit over there.

309
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,283
Please respond truthfully
to our questions.

310
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,828
Is the content of that post
on the bulletin board true?

311
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,751
I'm talking about the post
claiming that you're a CIPA patient.

312
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,937
It's true.

313
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,403
What? A pain management expert?

314
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:32,200
A CIPA patient treating patients
is a comedy in itself.

315
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,078
There have been no issues or problems
so far.

316
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,623
Nothing has happened yet,
but something was bound to arise.

317
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,085
How could the patients trust you
with their health now?

318
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,587
Did you enjoy observing your patients?

319
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,257
"What is that pain I don't feel?"
You were obsessed, weren't you?

320
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,260
How can such a person care for patients?

321
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,346
How can I not?

322
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,184
The more I observed, the more I saw.
And the more I obsessed, the more I heard.

323
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,936
I couldn't feel their pain,

324
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,981
but their cries never left me.

325
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,025
How could I not care for them?

326
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,989
CIPA is not a lethal contagious disease

327
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,658
or a mental one like schizophrenia.

328
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,077
It doesn't hamper his work at all

329
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,870
or count as a cause for dismissal.

330
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,331
It's true that he deceived us

331
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,417
by hiding his condition from us.

332
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,545
I didn't say we'd decided to dismiss him.

333
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,507
We'll call a disciplinary committee
and discuss what action to take.

334
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:35,513
Until then, you're excluded
from all medical duties.

335
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,270
As chief of Anesthesiology

336
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,855
and the person who hired Dr. Cha,

337
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,857
I hold myself responsible.

338
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,027
I will accept any punishment also.

339
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,741
Let's discuss that
at the disciplinary committee.

340
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,326
I'll accept whatever decision is made.

341
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,415
But let me say one final thing.

342
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,879
Let me treat Lee Gi-seok.

343
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,505
Lee Gi-seok?

344
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,423
Yes.

345
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,718
We were identifying
the cause of his condition.

346
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,554
I must reach a conclusion.

347
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,350
You're in no condition to see patients.

348
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,395
You didn't seem too well at the seminar.

349
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,192
Dr. Cha, are you in tip-top shape?

350
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,778
Answer me.

351
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,531
Are you well enough
not to disrupt your duties?

352
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,037
It's true that I'm not well,

353
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,664
-but--
-Then I can't allow it.

354
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,375
Until the committee's ruling,

355
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,671
you're excluded from seeing
admitted patients and outpatients.

356
00:34:59,138 --> 00:34:59,972
Kang Si-young.

357
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,933
How did it go?

358
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,478
Are they still talking?

359
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,942
What's happening?

360
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,194
It feels like a dream.

361
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,196
What'll happen to Dr. Cha?

362
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,421
CONFERENCE ROOM

363
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,051
To me, you seemed as if
you had no tomorrow.

364
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,100
So I thought that maybe
you lacked something in your life.

365
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,226
Now I get it.

366
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,647
Your illness which no one can cure.

367
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,274
That thirst.

368
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,235
You wanted to quench it
by treating others.

369
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,821
It would be a lie to say

370
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,699
that's not how I felt.

371
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,278
Dr. Cha.

372
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,793
Are you all in shock?

373
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,378
How did it go?

374
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,839
Did they decide what to do with you?

375
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,925
Not yet.

376
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,427
Until they do,

377
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,055
I'm not allowed to see patients.

378
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,020
I didn't know.

379
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,730
I really didn't know.

380
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,400
If I'd known a little sooner,

381
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,238
I could've understood you,

382
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,449
and done all I could to assist you.

383
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,411
I apologize.

384
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,596
I'm grateful,

385
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,057
but you have no time to waste.

386
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,226
Find out why Gi-seok's sick.

387
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,103
Do you understand?

388
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,147
Yes.

389
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,109
Let's work together.

390
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
Do you remember Park Jung-bo?

391
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,201
We'll become your eyes, your hands,
and your voice.

392
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,914
Right. When Father Yu came in,

393
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,667
we were all in different places,

394
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,129
but you led us as a team
and diagnosed him.

395
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,840
We can do this.

396
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,509
You know Gi-seok better than anyone.

397
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,139
I think we've already begun.

398
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,895
Let's go.

399
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,880
If his skin doesn't get better,
we have to switch to an antifungal.

400
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,883
Consult the Division
of Infectious Diseases

401
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,760
before changing the medication.

402
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,221
Also, starting today,
Dr. Lee will be in charge.

403
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,101
Every prescription has to be confirmed
by Dr. Lee.

404
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,648
-Let me know when you need help.
-I'll give you a call right away.

405
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,527
Always keep in mind

406
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,155
that Gi-seok is a CIPA patient.

407
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,325
Due to anhidrosis, he can't regulate
his body temperature well,

408
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,993
and he's infected, too.

409
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,662
Keep an eye on the temperature
of the IV fluids and the room.

410
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,664
Yes, Dr. Cha. We'll keep that in mind.

411
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,166
We'll keep an eye on it.

412
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,211
-You don't have to worry, Dr. Cha.
-You can count on us.

413
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,421
That's all.

414
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,731
Dr. Cha.

415
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,484
I received the address of the warehouse.

416
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,986
3RD FLR SEONGJIN-RO 144-2

417
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,154
I'll go there.

418
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,114
No. I'll go.

419
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,199
Let me come with you.

420
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,743
You should stay with Gi-seok.

421
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,414
I'll let you know if I find anything.

422
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,917
Okay?

423
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:03,878
Okay.

424
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,631
Dr. Cha.

425
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,469
Be careful.

426
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,894
Is there no C-line?

427
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,104
Prepare a C-line.

428
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,855
CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER

429
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,653
Give him phenylephrine,
start him on norepinephrine, 0.1.

430
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,779
It's sepsis.

431
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,240
INJURY CAUSED BY THE BODY'S RESPONSE
TO INFECTION

432
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,340
-Does he need more drugs?
-Another 100mg of phenylephrine.

433
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,341
Yes, doctor.

434
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,634
Don't worry. Focus.

435
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,202
Good.

436
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,418
Why did you do that?

437
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,799
Why did you do that
without talking to me first?

438
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,346
I was worried you wouldn't want to do it.

439
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,642
Why?

440
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,937
Were you touched by Cha Yo-han?

441
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,564
He's a hypocrite.

442
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,608
He deceived both his patients
and the hospital.

443
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,361
You talk like you achieved justice
by doing that.

444
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,613
There are many ways to achieve justice.

445
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,367
And you and I are using different ways.

446
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,994
Your way is just wrong.

447
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,084
Fine, it's all my fault.

448
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,920
Your anger was misdirected
from the beginning,

449
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,630
and I failed to stop it.

450
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,470
-Hey.
-How could you do that?

451
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,888
-Murderer!
-Hey!

452
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,056
Was it out of resentment?

453
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,891
-Step back!
-Murderer!

454
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,893
Why did you do that?

455
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,688
-You're trash!
-How could you!

456
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,606
Please step back!

457
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,692
Keep away!

458
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,987
-Why did you do that?
-Murderer!

459
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,658
You murderer! Bring them back!

460
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,202
Stop them!

461
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,635
SEUNG-YOO

462
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,059
Oh, no…

463
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,895
Are you okay?

464
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,773
JEONG-IN

465
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,503
-Move!
-Step back!

466
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,797
-Coming through!
-Step back!

467
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,592
-Mom! It's hot!
-No, Jeong-in.

468
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,886
-Jeong-in! Come out!
-Mom!

469
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,138
-It's hot!
-Jeong-in! Where are you?

470
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,973
Come out!

471
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:54,311
After only six years in this world,

472
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,396
my daughter died a painful death.

473
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,692
Jeong-in! Come out!

474
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:04,780
I wanted the killer to suffer
more than my daughter did.

475
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,073
You murderer!

476
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,408
And Cha Yo-han ended his suffering.

477
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,536
Bring my child back!

478
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,250
You burned Jeong-in to death!

479
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,545
Your death will be even more painful!

480
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,005
You'll die in a fiery pit!

481
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,841
You murderer!

482
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,683
Since Jeong-in died,
there has been no dignity in my life.

483
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,434
But why

484
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,438
should Yoon Seong-kyu die with dignity?

485
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,359
Is it wrong to be angry about that?

486
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,004
Prosecutor Son.

487
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,674
Prosecutor Son! Are you okay?
Prosecutor Son!

488
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,927
Help! We need help here!

489
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,763
Prosecutor Son! Hurry up. Prosecutor Son!

490
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,117
3RD FLOOR, SEONGJIN-RO 144-2

491
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,619
SEONGJIN-RO 144-2

492
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,096
Hey, kick him harder!

493
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,974
Kick him!

494
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,350
Does that not hurt?

495
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,979
Does this not hurt? I bet it does.

496
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,566
You can't go anywhere.

497
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,072
Kick him harder.

498
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,525
Oil?

499
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,916
Run a brain MRI, MRA,

500
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,877
-and phlegm check.
-Did you find something?

501
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,962
TEST TO DETECT INFECTION
IN RESPIRATORY TRACT

502
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,006
DR. CHA YO-HAN

503
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,300
His immune system had been suppressed
due to the steroids.

504
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,218
He inhaled dirt that was drenched in oil.

505
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,057
Due to nocardiosis,
an abscess was created in his brain stem.

506
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,559
It must've caused the locked-in syndrome.

507
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,105
The ulcers on his shoulder
must be a symptom of it.

508
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,191
I'll run the tests right away.

509
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,617
Is the rumor true?

510
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,413
Did Dr. Cha really have such a secret?

511
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,166
Yes, sir. I wasn't aware of it either.

512
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,837
Perhaps...

513
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,758
we will be better able to convince him.

514
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,218
Should I arrange a meeting?

515
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,847
I'd like to meet him as soon as possible.

516
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,855
I don't think

517
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:35,652
I have much time left.

518
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,030
I understand, sir.

519
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,854
How could you be ill? How?

520
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,240
After losing Seung-yoo,

521
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,993
there was no pain

522
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,997
that was greater than the pain
of losing my child.

523
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,166
But…

524
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:38,548
I felt a substantial amount of pain
that made me forget my sorrows.

525
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,147
Yoon Seong-kyu must've suffered
hundredfold or thousandfold.

526
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,106
Yes.

527
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,402
You deserve that for killing my son.

528
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,323
That was what I thought.

529
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,870
But as time passed,

530
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,831
I became afraid.

531
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,973
I was afraid...

532
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,434
that when that time came,

533
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,314
I'd search for someone
who'd deliver me as well.

534
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,207
And is that…

535
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,795
Cha Yo-han?

536
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,889
It doesn't matter who it is.

537
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,021
Because if that time comes,

538
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,734
not only will my body die...

539
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,989
but my soul will die as well.

540
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,129
The number you called cannot be reached…

541
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,431
I've never seen this occur here.

542
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,682
Me neither.

543
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,439
They're currently conducting
the phlegm test.

544
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,608
You got the results.

545
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,196
His blood vessels are fine.

546
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,448
Just like Dr. Cha said,
there is an abscess.

547
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,992
We'll only know for sure once
the phlegm test result comes back.

548
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,161
Judging by his symptoms
and the radiological findings,

549
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,996
nocardiosis seems like our best bet.

550
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,581
ACUTE OR CHRONIC INFECTION OF THE LUNGS

551
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,793
The phlegm test result
won't come back anytime soon.

552
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,588
Should we trust him and administer

553
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,216
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
and imipenem?

554
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,176
A TYPE OF ANTIBIOTIC

555
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,222
Let's do that.

556
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,808
It's a tricky area, so we'll need
to discuss with Neurosurgery

557
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,184
on the surgical removal.

558
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,978
-Okay.
-Please tell Dr. Cha.

559
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,397
Okay.

560
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,319
Once Gi-seok recovers
due to this diagnosis,

561
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,029
Dr. Cha's suspension will be lifted,
right?

562
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,990
Isn't it ridiculous
to kick out someone so competent?

563
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,535
You're right.

564
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,912
-We should--
-I'll--

565
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,208
I'll talk to Gi-seok's mother.

566
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,313
The number you called cannot be reached…

567
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:36,244
KANG SI-YOUNG

568
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,585
The number you called cannot be reached…

569
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,510
The number you called cannot be reached…

570
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,761
DR. CHA YO-HAN

571
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,975
Please…

572
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,768
Please…

573
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,689
The number you called cannot be reached…

574
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,867
The address is Seongjin-ro 144-2.

575
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,078
I think a man has collapsed. Please hurry.

576
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,623
Seongjin-ro 144-2?

577
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,916
We're on our way.

578
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,251
How is the man's condition?

579
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,088
-I don't know.
-Sorry?

580
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,090
What did you say?

581
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,551
I said I don't know!

582
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,722
He doesn't know if he's in pain
even when he is!

583
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,766
KANG SI-YOUNG

584
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,486
They're gathering a disciplinary committee
for Dr. Cha.

585
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,738
We've had problems
ever since he joined us.

586
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,864
Let's deal with Dr. Cha.

587
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,950
I think I found a way to help Dr. Cha.

588
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,578
-What is it?
-We'll work in two teams.

589
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,870
Yoo Ri-hye got this text?

590
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,957
Isn't it strange?
They never recruit people like this.

591
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,587
Something like the Cherubim video happens,
Death Talks could become a murder site.

592
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,137
Don't you ever get sick.
