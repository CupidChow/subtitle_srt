ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,794
Open it!

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,847
What happened?

4
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,275
He fell while working.

5
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,651
What's wrong with him?

6
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,113
I'm not sure.
He's not suffering from asthma.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,240
What could it be?

8
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,577
He might die at this rate!
Please do something!

9
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,706
Don't worry.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,125
I'll call 119.

11
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,003
Doctor! I already called…

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,672
Wait! Doctor!

13
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,925
Doctor!

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,541
The medical officer just left?
What about the patient?

15
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,547
He's breathing. He's alive.

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,802
MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER

17
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,137
What happened?

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,641
"Please take him
to the Cardiology Department.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,602
Replace the medical officer
as fast as possible."

20
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,103
Do you think this was…

21
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,939
Inmate 6238?

22
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
TO SERVE

23
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,089

24
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,508

THE CONSOLATION OF THE MOON

26
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,934
Now, it's time
for the most important thing.

27
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,109
BANK BALANCE: 42,000 WON

28
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,695
UNCLE JEONG-NAM

29
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,530
Don't you need money?

30
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,745
I thought this was a spam message.

31
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,747
You're out of money, aren't you?

32
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,420
Did you install a CCTV in my room?

33
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,589
UNCLE JEONG-NAM

34
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,468
-Hello?
-What is wrong with you?

35
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,971
You should've come to see me
as soon as you ran out of money.

36
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,264
Get over here right now.

37
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,766
Where?

38
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,118
TAXI STOP

39
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,845
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM,
YOU CAN ALWAYS START AGAIN

40
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,265
I came to meet Uncle Jeong-nam.

41
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,486
AWARD, WARDEN OH JEONG-NAM

42
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,927
Si-young.

43
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,014
-Uncle Jeong-nam.
-It's been so long.

44
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,724
Take a seat.

45
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,145
By the way, what happened?
Why did the medical officer run away?

46
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,521
Gosh, don't even get me started.

47
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,982
We don't even have a chief physician
and the medical officers

48
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,067
who come here constantly keep quitting.

49
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,986
So we're always looking
for someone to fill in.

50
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,280
Is that why you offered me
a part-time job?

51
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,159
It's a part-time job
that will pay you generously.

52
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,911
Okay, sure.

53
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,621
I'll do it.

54
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,165
Will you be okay?

55
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,168
As you already know,
this place can be a bit tough.

56
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,086
-It's okay.
-The facility isn't great either.

57
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,006
-It's okay.
-We don't have the best quality

58
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,800
-or medical devices.
-It's okay. I'm okay with that.

59
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,135
Really?

60
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,139
You even brought your luggage.

61
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,099
What? Oh, yes.

62
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,731
There are a lot of patients
waiting to get treated. Let's begin.

63
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,533
One. Do not have private
conversations with the prisoners.

64
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,203
Two. Do not leak the information
I hear or record.

65
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,872
Three. Follow the instructions
given to me by the employee.

66
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,957
That's right.

67
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,417
You remember everything.

68
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,258
But there's one more thing
you need to keep in mind.

69
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,175
What's that?

70
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,053
Actually, never mind. I'll make sure
he doesn't do anything to you.

71
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,473
What is it? What are you talking about?

72
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,893
There's this guy who got transferred
here last year, and he's a psycho…

73
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,230
I mean, he's such an odd guy.

74
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,690
An odd guy?

75
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,987
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to say to you.

76
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,576
Don't answer any of the questions
he asks you.

77
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,619
Don't look at him in the eyes.

78
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,621
And don't even talk to him.

79
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,833
In other words, don't let him test you.

80
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,752
Make sure you remember this.

81
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,923
What's his deal?
Is he an evil spirit or something?

82
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,258
An evil spirit?

83
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,886
It doesn't matter what people call him.

84
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,889
What matters is that you should never

85
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,100
let him get to you.

86
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,604
Is he a serial killer?

87
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,607
Or is he a felon?

88
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,151
Let's go inside first.

89
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,820
You'll end up running into him
at least once anyway.

90
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,779
Come inside.

91
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,596
My gosh, Dr. Kang.

92
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,640
How have you been?

93
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
The same old.

94
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,769
It seems like you've lost some weight.

95
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,647
Stop the small talk.

96
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,982
We have patients waiting.
Hurry up and send them inside.

97
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,192
Okay.

98
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,861
I washed this after I heard
that you were coming.

99
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,030
Here. Put it on, Dr. Kang.

100
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,033
I'm no longer a doctor.

101
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,620
-What?
-Just leave it. I don't need it.

102
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,373
Oh, okay.

103
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,713
Okay, then. I'll hang it right here.

104
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,964
Wear it when you need it.

105
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,262
I want you to stay alert.

106
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,555
Okay, don't worry.

107
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,474
I'll make sure the prisoners behave.

108
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,144
No, not the prisoners.
Keep a close eye on Dr. Kang.

109
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,773
She's the dangerous one.

110
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,191
What?

111
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,736
Why is she dangerous?

112
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,909
Do I have cancer?

113
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,412
Am I going to die?

114
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,004
You ate exactly 17 go stones.

115
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,591
Go to a hospital outside
and have them taken out.

116
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,509
Next.

117
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,679
There's no injury?
Are you saying I'm lying?

118
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,558
There's not even a single crack.

119
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,519
Stop saying stuff I can't understand.

120
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,649
The top of my foot hurts.
It's seriously killing me.

121
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,278
What will you do if there's
something wrong with my foot?

122
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,237
Then…

123
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,157
stab an ax into your foot.

124
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,992
Only then will you get
a narcotic painkiller.

125
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,619
There's no other way. Next.

126
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,667
He hasn't gone to sleep in days.

127
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,878
Do you have insomnia?

128
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,005
See, it's not me.

129
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
It's him down there.

130
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,887
Lie down. I'll put him to sleep.

131
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,811
Doctor. How will you do it?

132
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,272
I'll stab it.

133
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,111
-With that?
-It'll sting.

134
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,491
NO CHATTING WHILE MOVING

135
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,434
Well done, Dr. Kang.

136
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,897
Don't call me that.

137
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,983
Dr. Kang, there's an emergency.

138
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,236
MEDICAL OFFICE

139
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,863
STOP AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS

140
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,663
Hey, get out of the way! Move!

141
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,789
Make way.

142
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,706
Move out of the way.

143
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,379
Mister. Mister.

144
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,513
Get an Ambu bag and oxygen tank. Call 119.

145
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,430
Okay.

146
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,312
-He's been acting weird since last night.
-That's right.

147
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,606
He coughed a lot,
saying he's out of breath.

148
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,108
I think he had diarrhea too.

149
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,819
Anyway, he had an upset stomach
and a sore throat.

150
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,279
Be quiet.

151
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,036
Stridor?

152
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,539
Is something stuck in his throat?

153
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,456
What did he eat?

154
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,126
Could it have gotten lodged in his throat?

155
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,043
Fish.

156
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,755
He said he'd swallowed
a fish bone and that it hurt.

157
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,175
-A fish bone?
-He also ate a sausage he'd hidden.

158
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,093
What are you eating?

159
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,595
3-UPPER-4

160
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,638
It smelled a bit disgusting.

161
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,058
How many times must you go to the toilet?

162
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,268
Sorry.

163
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,854
3-UPPER-4

164
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,189
Yes. That's why he had diarrhea.

165
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,567
A rotten sausage.

166
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,611
Bacteria?

167
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,071
Hey! Get out of the way!

168
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,364
Give me the Ambu bag.

169
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,082
His throat is so swollen
the oxygen isn't getting in.

170
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,043
-Then what?
-The ambulance.

171
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,669
-Is it nearby?
-Not yet.

172
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,380
What now? He needs to be intubated,

173
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,758
but his airway's so swollen
that the Ambu bag's not helping.

174
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,842
Cricothyroidotomy.

175
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,512
Yes. The cricothyroidotomy kit.

176
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,351
It's not here.

177
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,396
What happened? What's wrong with him?

178
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,774
His airway's so swollen
that the oxygen's not getting in,

179
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,108
and I don't have what I need.

180
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,985
What should we do then?

181
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,699
Will he just die?

182
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,243
I hope not.

183
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,412
Warden. You should call him.

184
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,790
-No.
-He might die.

185
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,791
What if he dies?

186
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,418
Kang Si-young, think.

187
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,963
What's wrong with this patient?

188
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,172
Deep neck infection.

189
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,302
Who was that? Who just spoke?

190
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,763
Where is he? Where are you?

191
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,431
-Inmate 6238!
-Inmate 6238?

192
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,767
-Inmate 6238?
-There he is!

193
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,983
TO SERVE

194
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,327
What did you just say? Deep neck what?

195
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,037
You told me not to obstruct.

196
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,331
Just answer.

197
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,418
-As if you'd know.
-What?

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,424
He has an infection down his throat.

199
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,473
The fish bone ruptured his throat,

200
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,434
and the bacteria from the rotten sausage

201
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
got into the rupture
and caused an infection.

202
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,734
That's right.
The infection obstructed the airway.

203
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,154
Ever seen a case like this?

204
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
No.

205
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,744
Do you know what I'm doing?

206
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,163
No.

207
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,750
It has to go into the airway.
Have you done it before?

208
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,212
-No.
-Then try it.

209
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,092
If you don't hurry,
he'll go into respiratory arrest.

210
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,055
-Are you a doctor?
-No.

211
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,808
And you? Are you a doctor?

212
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,065
If you don't do anything, this man dies.

213
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,946
The cricothyroid membrane.

214
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,200
Below the thyroid cartilage
and above the cricoid cartilage.

215
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,910
Two centimeters in at a 45-degree angle.

216
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,661
Do it.

217
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,394
Check.

218
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,064
Good.

219
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,245
There.

220
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,581
Squeeze the Ambu bag
at the right breathing interval.

221
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,057
-He's breathing. He's alive.
-Gosh.

222
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,684
They did it.

223
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,285
We're here!

224
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040
Take him.

225
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,048
Well done. It worked.

226
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,857
KYUNGWON HOSPITAL

227
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,444
EMERGENCY ROOM

228
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,869
EMERGENCY ROOM

229
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,126
This way.

230
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,797
-What does he have?
-A deep neck infection.

231
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,218
I administered first aid
right before respiratory arrest.

232
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,595
Oxygen saturation's above 90 percent.

233
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,764
-Prepare for intubation.
-Okay.

234
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,935
Glide.

235
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,444
Here.

236
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,667
It's in.

237
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,511
Are you new?

238
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,266
I'm just… a part-timer.

239
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,559
A part-timer?

240
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,063
What matters is that you saved him.

241
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,314
Well done.

242
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,526
The penitentiary lacks the equipment
and you diagnosed

243
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,237
a deep neck infection by just looking?

244
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,989
I'm impressed.

245
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,032
Can you get out of the way?

246
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,160
Hang on.

247
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,955
It wasn't me.

248
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,145
I MISS YOU. I LOVE YOU, SEUNG-YOO

249
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,609
SON SEUNG-YOO

250
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,634
SON SEUNG-YOO

251
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,927
You were here.

252
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,854
I bought the wrong one.

253
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,106
Seung-yoo…

254
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,319
is ten years old now,

255
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,821
not six.

256
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,079
LET'S MEET AGAIN

257
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,803
HANSE MEDICAL CENTER,
THE START OF A HEALTHY CHANGE

258
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,764
Doctors in Anesthesiology,

259
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,850
please come to Room 28.

260
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,520
Doctors in Anesthesiology,

261
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,272
please come to Room 28.

262
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,110
What's wrong with the vitals?

263
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,945
Suction.

264
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,239
Suction!

265
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,331
Suction. Suction!

266
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,962
Epi.

267
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,048
Five bags of RBCs.
Allow them to flow completely.

268
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,594
Set level one.

269
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,263
LEVEL 1: USED TO TRANSFUSE BLOOD QUICKLY

270
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,598
Make sure you don't mistake them.

271
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,936
Conduct an ABGA and administer
0.2 unit of vasopressin per cc.

272
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,729
-Make it continuous.
-Yes, ma'am.

273
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,655
Where is it?

274
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,408
0.2 unit of vasopressin per cc.

275
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,996
ABGA.

276
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,665
Anesthesiology will mess up yet again

277
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,376
and declare the patient dead.

278
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,545
Since Chief Min is here,
that won't happen.

279
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,924
We got the vitals.

280
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,927
Thanks to her, the patient will live.

281
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,765
I guess

282
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,643
it's difficult for you to call the chief.

283
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,272
Why didn't you call me
when the patient was crashing?

284
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,817
Do you not want to learn anymore?

285
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,699
Proceed with the surgery.

286
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,618
I'll stay until the patient stabilizes.

287
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,293
Yes?

288
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,712
What?

289
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:07,964
Si-young did what?

290
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,259
Don't be surprised.

291
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,845
Si-young just saved someone.

292
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,015
She was there?

293
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,601
She didn't do anything for the past year.

294
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,811
I called her out
so she could get some fresh air.

295
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,105
And she did something amazing!

296
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,482
CHIEF MIN TAE-KYUNG

297
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,484
She decided to work there?

298
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,778
-There's no way.
-What?

299
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,404
What do you mean?

300
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,575
She said she just came
to make chump change,

301
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,036
but I thought she was getting ready
to return to the field.

302
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,956
Well, I don't think so.

303
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,041
I'll give it some thought.

304
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,717
How is it?

305
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,762
Why do you ask?
All part-time jobs are the same.

306
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:59,349
I've never seen you save a patient.

307
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:03,144
I was fascinated and proud of you.

308
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,938
You saw me struggling.

309
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,732
You did excellent work for an emergency.

310
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,944
Many of the medical officers
couldn't do what you did.

311
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,572
Who's that man?

312
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,699
Is he a doctor?

313
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,450
Inmate 6238?

314
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,744
He said he's not a doctor.

315
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,788
There's no way.

316
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,456
He's that guy I mentioned.

317
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,917
That psycho.

318
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,378
"That psycho"?

319
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,629
The one I shouldn't talk to?

320
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,340
From the day he transferred in,
he became the king

321
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,508
of the penitentiary.

322
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,011
How?

323
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,640
He went through a harsh hazing.

324
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,102
Another inmate slashed his chest

325
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,062
with a sharp tool.

326
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,397
Hey.

327
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,317
Calm down. Calm down.

328
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,445
He asked for the first-aid kit

329
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,822
and stitched the wound up himself.

330
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,658
He didn't even use anesthetics.

331
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,680
Without anesthetics?

332
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,183
He's fearless and skilled as well.

333
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,936
But still, he's such a headache.

334
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,439
He's the reason why
all the medical officers quit.

335
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,483
He's the reason? Why?

336
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,402
If he doesn't think
they live up to his expectations,

337
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,363
he attacks them.

338
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,865
He scares the living daylight
out of the medical officers.

339
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,535
Because of that,
he's nicknamed Medical Officer Killer.

340
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,374
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm not an official medical officer.

341
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,792
I'm just part-timing.

342
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,212
Right, you're just part-timing.

343
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,510
Look at how nice those gowns look on them.

344
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,139
You look fantastic in a gown as well.

345
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,106
ANESTHESIOLOGY

346
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,038
She's going abroad tonight.

347
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,832
I don't think she's coming back.

348
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,168
It's a one-way ticket.

349
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:17,005
I'm about to leave the hospital right now.

350
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,758
-Keep Si-young there.
-What?

351
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,885
-I'm on my way.
-Okay.

352
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,303
Si-young, is that you?

353
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,389
Si-young.

354
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,268
-Hey, isn't someone calling you?
-What?

355
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,937
No one is. Let's go.

356
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,355
Si-young.

357
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,406
-Hi.
-It is you. It's been a long time.

358
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,450
It has been.

359
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,328
Are you her senior?

360
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,454
Yes, I am.

361
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,040
I'll be waiting in the car,

362
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,042
-so take your time.
-What?

363
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,627
Okay.

364
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,465
Gosh, I can't believe I ran into you here.

365
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,592
How long has it been?

366
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,637
Two years ago at the alumni gathering?

367
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,555
Was it?

368
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,641
Has it been that long already?

369
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,267
Anyway, I'm glad I ran into you.

370
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,477
Have you been doing well?

371
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,729
He doesn't know.

372
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,482
He has no idea…

373
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,819
about what happened.

374
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,695
By the way, what brings you here?

375
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,741
I'm going abroad today.

376
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,493
I came here to see my uncle.

377
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,745
A vacation? I'm jealous.

378
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,873
I'll contact you once I return.
I'll see you around.

379
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,708
-Bye.
-Bye.

380
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,377
Call me when you get back.

381
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,419
I will!

382
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,466
-Hey, isn't that Kang Si-young?
-Do you know her?

383
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,553
How could I not know
the top student of your school?

384
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,305
She's going abroad today. On vacation.

385
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,808
"Vacation"? You sure she's not
taking some time off from work?

386
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,976
What? Why would she?

387
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,563
Do you not know about the huge incident?

388
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,148
Was it medical malpractice?

389
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,644
Si-young.

390
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,073
It's pollen, Uncle.

391
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,415
Let's go.

392
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,341
Si-young.

393
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,595
You can start again.

394
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:13,973
I know.

395
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,269
If I go back to the hospital,

396
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,065
I might even be able to do a good job.

397
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,194
Also, that's what I want to do.

398
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,111
Then do it.

399
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,197
What's the problem?

400
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,329
Do it, you silly. What's the problem?

401
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,915
Then…

402
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,920
I can't be punished
for the rest of my life.

403
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,342
I don't deserve...

404
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,803
to save patients

405
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,389
and feel rewarded and happy.

406
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,602
Never wearing a doctor's gown again…

407
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,730
is my punishment.

408
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,085
Soon…

409
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,089
he'll be released from prison.

410
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,927
He should never wear a doctor's gown again

411
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,722
or treat any patients.

412
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,933
We must stop him...

413
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,477
from coming back.

414
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,065
I can't wait for it.

415
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,402
Has Cha Yo-han…

416
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,572
realized it yet?

417
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,992
What if he hasn't?

418
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,579
I'll make sure he pays a price.

419
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,333
That's why I look forward…

420
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,420
to the day he comes back.

421
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,400
Yo-han.

422
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,986
TO SERVE

423
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,157
How are you feeling?

424
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,077
I'm going to stop
by the medical office later.

425
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,292
-How long has it been like this?
-Since yesterday.

426
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,630
How did the test at the
outside hospital last week turn out?

427
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,341
I'm not sure.
I haven't heard anything special.

428
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,515
I'll be released next week.

429
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,017
I'll go to a big hospital then
like you told me to.

430
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,187
What if you die before your release?

431
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,946
Ask the medical office
to send you to a hospital today.

432
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,366
Okay, I will.

433
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,415
I picked them.

434
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,750
Enjoy.

435
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,293
See you around.

436
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,979
INMATE INFORMATION: PARK JUNG-BO

437
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,380
FEVER REDUCER PRESCRIBED,
ACUTE ENTERITIS

438
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,553
There are many inmates here.
Just stay inside the medical office.

439
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,807
I get it.

440
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,020
Thanks for earlier.

441
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,230
Thank you for your help.

442
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,109
She's not staying here, is she?

443
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,030
Find someone proper

444
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,406
instead of an unprepared novice.

445
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,075
Fine.

446
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,703
She should be able
to either diagnose or treat a patient.

447
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,455
Someone stupid and clumsy
needs experience.

448
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,082
How can a second-year resident
have no idea what to do?

449
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,251
-Excuse me.
-If you keep hiring

450
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,503
these temporary, incompetent
medical officers, next time,

451
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,339
you'll be the one I'll complain about
as well.

452
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,049
Hey!

453
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,884
Complain directly to me, not to him!

454
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,513
Fine. I'd never treated
a patient like him before.

455
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,140
Didn't I do well on my first time?

456
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,059
I stuck it in correctly
and he patient survived.

457
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,103
You did a very good job
considering it was your first time.

458
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,528
If that's what you want to hear,
go back to school.

459
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,447
This is not a place for training.

460
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,907
You can't practice

461
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,617
on the people here.

462
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,578
Hold on.

463
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,872
Are you saying I'm a trainee?

464
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,249
Is that what you mean?

465
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,875
Where is he going?

466
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,211
What's with him?

467
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,004
Why does he speak to me so rudely?

468
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,548
-Just ignore him.
-I can't believe him.

469
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,342
"Someone so stupid and clumsy"?

470
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,928
Who does he think he is?
My professor or something?

471
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,137
This is annoying.

472
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,932
-Did you tell him?
-Tell him what?

473
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,225
I was a second-year resident.

474
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,685
Why would I share your information?

475
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,311
Then how does he know?

476
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,440
Unbelievable.

477
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,943
Does he think he's my professor
or something?

478
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,322
"This is not a place for training.
You can't practice on the people…"

479
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,158
Who are you talking about?

480
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,416
That guy, Inmate 6238.

481
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,834
What did he do before coming here?

482
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,003
Well…

483
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,880
Which hospital was it?

484
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,674
What is he here for?

485
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,803
Well… Three years ago…

486
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,806
Dr. Kang, there's a patient.
Can he come in?

487
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,268
Sure.

488
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,604
It's our regular again.

489
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,317
It's Inmate 5353.
He often pretends to be sick.

490
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,242
-Hello.
-Hello.

491
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,079
INMATE INFORMATION: PARK JUNG-BO

492
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,748
How are you feeling?

493
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,503
I got a sudden stomachache.
I've been vomiting and having diarrhea.

494
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,547
-Will you lie down?
-Okay.

495
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,644
Does it hurt?

496
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,065
No. By the way, my hands have been…

497
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,450
Does it itch?

498
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,744
No. It stings and burns.

499
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,662
Let me take your temperature.

500
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,885
You're running a fever.

501
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,136
When did it start?

502
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,139
I've had a fever for a while now.

503
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,683
You can come down.

504
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
TREATMENT AND PRESCRIPTION

505
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,068
TRANSFERRED TO AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL

506
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,619
You got a blood test and an X-ray
at an outside hospital.

507
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh, are the results out?

508
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,207
Yes,

509
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,334
but everything is normal.

510
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,341
Let me prescribe you antibiotics
and fever reducers for now.

511
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,135
Okay.

512
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,809
Isn't this yours?

513
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,769
I picked it up from the yard.

514
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,981
It is mine. Thanks.

515
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,362
By the way,
where can you buy those things?

516
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,322
I'll be released next week.

517
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,201
I'm meeting my sister after years.
I'd love to get a bracelet for her.

518
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,539
Go to any shopping mall.
I'm sure you'll find something.

519
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,792
I see. Thank you.

520
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,506
Are you okay?

521
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,133
Yes.

522
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,677
Lie down until your fever goes down.

523
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,554
Also, when you're released,

524
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,265
get a thorough check-up
at a big hospital, just in case.

525
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,767
Yes, I'll do that.

526
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,603
Thank you.

527
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,496
What? What is it?

528
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,219
Please check my temperature.

529
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,137
Do you have a fever?

530
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,224
That is for you to determine.

531
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,396
-Are you Inmate 6238?
-Yes.

532

INMATE INFORMATION: CHA YO-HAN

533
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,672
You don't have a fever.

534
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,550
Could you chart it?

535
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,845
Why would I chart it
when you don't even have…

536
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,639
Please check my pulse too.

537
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,100
DATE, TEMPERATURE, PULSE,
BREATHING, BLOOD PRESSURE

538
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,437
Do you suffer from hypochondria?

539
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,565
Why do you check all these things
every day?

540
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,444
It's my hobby.

541
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,200
Do it yourself.

542
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,882
Madagascar.

543
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,846
-What did you say?
-What time is your flight?

544
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,973
How did you know?

545
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,100
You have enough time
to give out an order, right?

546
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,316
Write it down. "Inmate 5353.

547
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,110
Need to visit Nephrology
at a tertiary hospital. Urgent."

548
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,237
Inmate 5353…

549
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,743
-Why Nephrology?
-Which department are you in?

550
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,620
Me? Anesthesiology.

551
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,248
Why?

552
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,835
Have you done an outpatient rotation?

553
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,463
-Yes, once.
-A male, 22 years old.

554
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,091
He's suffering from a stomachache,
diarrhea, and vomiting.

555
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,426
He has rashes on his palms.
They're flushed and painful.

556
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,136
What should you do first?

557
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,846
-What are you doing…
-No external injuries.

558
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,057
The hospital he recently visited
ran a lab test, X-ray,

559
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,684
and electromyography but found nothing.

560
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,852
What are the chances
he's suffering from CTS or CRPS?

561
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,065
The rashes didn't change his skin color.

562
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,984
The result of his NCS came out fine.

563
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,570
Since he had a sudden stomachache,
diarrhea, vomiting, and fever,

564
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,364
I did suspect acute appendicitis.

565
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,949
"Acute appendicitis"?

566
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,536
Look at you, trying so hard.

567
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,831
-What did you say?
-What are you doing? Chart it.

568
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,375
"Need to visit Nephrology
at a tertiary hospital.

569
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,334
Urgent."

570
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,004
What's your reason?

571
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,591
-You wouldn't believe it.
-Do you even have one?

572
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,261
-I have a diagnosis.
-"A diagnosis"?

573
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,556
And who diagnosed him?

574
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,683
The only thing in here is an X-ray scan.

575
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,851
So who did it? And how?

576
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,269
Can your eyes scan or something?

577
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,812
I have my assumptions.

578
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,814
You'll diagnose him with your assumptions?

579
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,151
Forget it. If you're done cleaning,
please leave, Inmate 6238.

580
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,820
Fine, how about this?

581
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,531
How about you and I

582
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,701
diagnose that patient?

583
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,639
Look.

584
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,019
I'm thankful you helped me
save that patient back there.

585
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,605
-You saved his life. But…
-Give them the order.

586
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,065
If you were me,
would you believe a former doctor

587
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,651
-whom you met at a penitentiary?
-Give them the order.

588
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,200
Give them the order
before you flee to Madagascar.

589
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,664
How did you know?

590
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,459
About Madagascar.

591
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,753
About my being a second-year resident?

592
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,172
You better hurry. It's urgent.

593
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,549
What crime did you commit?

594
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,929
You're dying to brag
about how competent you are,

595
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,555
so what brought you here?

596
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,229
59th Street, Ankorondrano, Antananarivo.

597
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,358
It's on the luggage tag.

598
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:04,279
Your phone, shoes, and bags
are all expensive,

599
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,948
but they were made two years ago.

600
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,160
That means, you had the money to shop,
but didn't have the time.

601
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,371
That's how I assumed
you're a second-year resident.

602
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,539
Right, about your fleeing.

603
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,666
A second-year resident
has been working so hard

604
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,501
that she didn't even have time to shop.

605
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,294
But she's going to such a foreign country

606
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,839
that's not in Southeast Asia,
North America, or Europe.

607
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,177
You must be trying to run away
from a crime similar to mine.

608
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,515
But do you truly believe
fleeing will give you freedom?

609
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,435
I think listening to my advice

610
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,939
will help you obtain that freedom.

611
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:50,993
MEDICAL OFFICE

612
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,044
-Also…
-What? What is it this time?

613
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,838
Make sure you give that order.

614
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,467
Don't forget.

615
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,983
UNCLE JEONG-NAM

616
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,540
Is this true?

617
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,127
Is it true you're going abroad tonight?

618
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,797
What brings…

619
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,635
-you here, chief?
-That's not important.

620
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,803
Are you really…

621
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,014
Pack your belongings, and let's go.

622
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,931
What is it?

623
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,434
Are you afraid I won't come back?

624
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,520
You must think…

625
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,651
I don't have a care in the world.

626
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,738
Do you think I'll carelessly think
about killing myself?

627
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,989
Then why are you going?

628
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,409
Tell me the reason.

629
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,914
That's not important.

630
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,333
She just doesn't need to go.

631
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,753
Si-young, don't go.
Why would you go so far away?

632
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,464
-Don't go…
-It's a faraway island.

633
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,176
The time zone is different from Korea.

634
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,350
I thought if I went
to such a foreign place,

635
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,271
I'd be able to forget about everything.

636
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,860
I thought I could pretend
like that incident didn't happen.

637
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,406
I thought…

638
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,492
this reality could all feel like a dream.

639
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,371
I thought perhaps it could be
as if none of this actually happened…

640
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,581
as long as I wasn't here.

641
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,253
-Si-young…
-I know you hate me too.

642
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,338
Your best friend was…

643
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,756
It wasn't your fault.

644
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,343
It was an accident. No one predicted it.

645
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,387
Also,

646
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,765
-I'm sure you're more…
-More what?

647
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,184
I don't deserve to feel pain.

648
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,812
It pains you all to see me.

649
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,605
So it'd be much better for me to…

650
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,400
-Don't act like a baby.
-I'm not.

651
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,527
Even if I did, it wouldn't work on you.

652
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,696
Because, Mom,

653
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,283
you've always put your emotions
before others'.

654
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,663
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

655
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,206
It's not your fault.

656
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:48,044
I'm sure you blame yourself and regret it.

657
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,129
Like I've said before,

658
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,339
this pains me too.

659
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,342
To the point of wanting to kill myself.

660
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,344
So don't worry.

661
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,513
I won't bring any more tragedies…

662
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,224
into your life.

663
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,315
Wait! Si-young! Si-young!

664
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,362
Tae-kyung,
will you let her go just like that?

665
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,385
I didn't

666
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,056
ignore her because I couldn't face her.

667
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,400
"It was unavoidable.

668
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,903
Accept it.

669
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,948
Get back up."

670
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,953
The usual me would've scolded
and lectured her.

671
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,456
I couldn't do that.

672
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,838
Si-young fell down and gave up,

673
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,550
and I accepted that.

674
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,680
She wants to go back.

675
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,016
She really wants to go back...

676
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,019
and thinks she might do well.

677
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,147
-Did she say that?
-Yes.

678
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,067
But…

679
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,236
She wants to go back, but…

680
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,988
She doesn't deserve to?

681
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,183
Where's Inmate 5353?

682
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,895
Come on. He's an expert.

683
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,314
He's very good at making up illnesses.

684
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,316
Did his fever go down?

685
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,360
Yes, it did, so I sent him to his cell.

686
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,616
So… Officer.

687
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,746
If he complains of a fever
or another symptom,

688
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,917
don't put him down but send him
to a hospital for a thorough check-up.

689
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,627
A thorough check-up?

690
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,921
Yes. Please do that.

691
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,968
I feel so much better.
Now I'm ready to eat.

692
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,554
-There's meat.
-Come and eat.

693
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,556
Dinner's here. Get up.

694
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,515
Come and eat.

695
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,517
-Eat with us.
-Hurry up.

696
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,269
Why won't you answer?

697
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,437
Hey.

698
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,190
Hey.

699
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,442
-Look at that.
-Gosh.

700
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,529
Guard! Guard!

701
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,781
Guard!

702
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,823
Get over here!

703
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,368
Guard! Guard!

704
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,619
What's the matter?

705
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,745
Get over here quick.

706
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,122
Look at him.

707
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,667
Come in.

708
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,169
What's wrong?

709
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,504
Do something!

710
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:29,975
NEW BEGINNING OF LIFE!
IT IS UP TO YOUR MINDSET

711
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,617
Let me borrow this.

712
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,370
Let me look at your eyes, Jung-bo.

713
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,874
What's wrong with him?

714
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,337
He's not sweating at all.

715
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,133
-I called 119.
-Well done.

716
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,428
-No.
-What?

717
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,804
Not 119.

718
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,681
What do you mean, not 119?

719
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,433
-Kang Si-young.
-Who?

720
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,393
Call Dr. Kang Si-young right now.

721
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,860
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM,
YOU CAN ALWAYS START AGAIN

722
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,257
I'm leaving.

723
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,471
I'M LEAVING

724
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,612
Hurry.

725
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,199
-Make way.
-Will you hurry?

726
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,825
Move that out of the way.

727
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,287
Where's Dr. Kang?

728
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,180
Dr. Kang! Dr. Kang! Stop! Stop!

729
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,139
Dr. Kang!

730
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,267
Dr. Kang, it's an emergency.

731
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,686
Inmate 5353. He's…

732
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,772
What? How is he?

733
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,566
It doesn't look good. Come with me.

734
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,901
Are you not getting in?

735
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,487
We can't save him without you.

736
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,700
-What?
-We can't save him without you.

737
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,868
It's you or he dies.

738
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,330
-Who said that?
-Inmate 6238.

739
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,540
He told me to bring you.

740
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,336
Miss. Will you get in or not?

741
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,393
Call Dr. Kang.

742
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,145
We don't have her number.

743
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,107
Then find her!

744
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,865
Wait. Wait!

745
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,285
-Move.
-Stop.

746
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,454
Call Dr. Kang, quick. Hurry.

747
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,455
What for?

748
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,956
Why do you keep asking for her?

749
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,500
There's something she has to do!

750
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,377
What is it?

751
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,970
What must I do?

752
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,472
Take him to a hospital.

753
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,183
-What then?
-Just go.

754
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,310
What do I do then?

755
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,561
Save your patient.

756
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:03,813
How…

757
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,690
can I do that?

758
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,234
I'll tell you what to do, so promise.

759
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,446
Promise that you'll save him.

760
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,493
I can save a patient?

761
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,914
If he dies tonight,
it wouldn't be because of an illness.

762
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,124
It would've been
because the doctors did nothing.

763
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,468
To a patient, an illness is despair,

764
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,637
and a doctor is hope.

765
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,055
That hope.

766
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,016
Will you let him down?

767
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,581
What must I do…

768
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,335
to save him?

769
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,773
Special thanks to Jeon No Min and
Jung In Gi for their cameo parts.

770
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,290
Whether he lives or dies
isn't up to me now.

771
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,292
It's up to Dr. Kang.

772
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,459
-Are you crazy?
-What?

773
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,669
You gave out an order

774
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,297
because an ex-doctor who is
currently an inmate told you to do so?

775
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,216
-Do you know why he was imprisoned?
-What do you mean?

776
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,884
Was that enough to make you rush here?

777
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,595
Cha Yo-han.

778
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,888
You administered
a lethal amount of painkillers

779
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,348
and was sentenced to three years.

780
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,933
Dismiss Cha Yo-han!

781
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,936
If Professor Cha wants to do
the same thing as three years ago,

782
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,104
what would you do?

783
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,565
Do you know what you're about to do?

784
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,233
-Get out right now.
-Who are you?

785
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,360
Nice to meet you. I'm Inmate 6238.

786
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,696
Just a moment.

787
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,198
Wait.

788
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,242
Dr. Cha Yo-han.

789
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,161
Dr. Cha Yo-han.

790
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,174
This patient had an emergency
canthotomy two days ago.

791
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,425
What are you saying?

792
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,843
Whatever the specialty,

793
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,803
isn't our job to care for the sick?

794
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,598
I'm now in charge of Pain Surgery.

795
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,183
My name is Cha Yo-han.
