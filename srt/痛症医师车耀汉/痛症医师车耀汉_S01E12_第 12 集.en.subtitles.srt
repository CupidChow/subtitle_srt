00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,994

5
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,556
-Are you being discharged?
-Yes.

6
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,726
The side effects are the worst
after the first and second time.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,104
Swelling, nausea, and fatigue.

8
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,815
The stomach pain may worsen as well.

9
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,150
Come to the ER if it gets worse.

10
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,527
I will.

11
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,330
You will be discharged tomorrow.

HEARING TEST ROOM

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,061
Are you done?

14
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,232
Yes.

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,526
Did you wait long?

16
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,155
That's what the guardian does. Waiting.

17
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,491
You did great. Let's go.

18
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
Isn't that heavy?

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,792
No.

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,544
Give it to me.

21
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,129
I can handle it.

22
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,476
It's too crowded.

23
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,193
The door is opening.

GYEONGSEO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

26
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,819
Hello, Lieutenant Kim.

27
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905
I'm sorry to bother you
during your time off.

28
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,198
What is it?

29
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,159
I'm coming in.

30
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,918
Always walk on the inside.

31
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,173
I want to take you somewhere.

32
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,716
Where?

33
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,636
Don't get your hopes up.

34
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,389
It's just a place
with someone you'd be happy to see.

35
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,932
Someone I'd be happy to see?

36
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,734
Your hand-drip coffee is ready.

37
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,735
Enjoy.

38
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,738
Yo-han.

39
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,615
Hi, Inmate 5353.

40
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,159
Stop that.

41
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,619
Yo-han.

42
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,665
What's going on here? When did you come?
Yo-han.

43
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,584
How have you been, Jung-bo?

44
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,585
Hello.

45
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,758
Yo-han! How long has it been?
How have you been?

46
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,261
-You're looking good.
-Really? Am I?

47
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,478
Here's your hand-drip coffee

48
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
and iced mocha.

49
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,857
Thank you.

50
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,155
You made the water exactly 75 degrees.

51
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,990
How did you know?

52
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,369
Water at 75 degrees Celsius
doesn't give off steam by itself.

53
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,578
But do this...

54
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,041
and it does.

55
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,335
I should come here more often.

56
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,505
They have a barista that gets
the water temperature perfect.

57
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,258
See? I've been telling you to come
for a while already.

58
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,885
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,346
No need.

60
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,599
I saw on the news how busy you've been.

61
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,310
You really are so cool.

62
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,648
How do you feel? You're still going
to the hospital, right?

63
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,859
Yes. I'm going regularly with my brother.

64
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,614
I've gotten much better thanks to you.

65
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,575
-Thank you.
-I'm glad.

66
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,787
I'm so happy to hear that.
You look really great.

67
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,996
Do I?

68
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,290
You guys too.

69
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,087
You look really good together.

70
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,477
-Thank you.
-Come again. You have to.

71
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,271
Don't worry, I'll come often.

72
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,356
-You have customers. Go back.
-Okay.

73
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,234
-Thank you.
-Get back safely. Thank you.

74
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
What's wrong?

75
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,379
Are you dizzy?

76
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,173
Give me a minute.

77
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,639
I'm better now.

78
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,645
Take my hand.

79
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,986
You may get dizzy again.

80
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,039
Let's go. We have a lot to do.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,603
What boosts the immune system

82
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,396
and is high in antioxidants?

83
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,150
Broccoli.

84
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,491
Peppers.

85
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,993
And...

86
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,083
-What are you looking for?
-There it is.

87
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,382
MILK AND DAIRY

88
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,177
DOCTOR CAPSULE

89
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,680
For your GI health.

90
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,892
With steroid treatment,

91
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,852
your immune system gets weaker.

92
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,815
You need to eat this regularly, okay?

93
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,734
Answer me.

94
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,195
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,122
-Missing?
-Yes.

96
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,457
One of the Death Talks members

97
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,042
was reported missing.

98
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,755
Check this place out.

99
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,924
It'll be worth your time.

100
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,011
I saw you at Hanse Medical Center
this afternoon, right?

101
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,805
But this morning, her husband received

102
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,433
this message.

103
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,979
Wait. It'll be quite shocking.

104
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,152
Honey.

105
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,071
I was told...

106
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,450
I have only a few months left to live.

107
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,453
I was more afraid of the pain

108
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,666
I'd have to endure before dying
than the actual death.

109
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,171
I'm at peace now that I can put an end

110
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,756
to that fear.

111
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,467
Thank you...

112
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,095
for nursing me

113
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,098
for over 10 years.

114
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,811
Please be at peace now as well.

115
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,648
This...

116
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,401
wasn't forced upon me by anyone.

117
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,279
It's my choice.

118
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm ready.

119
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,838
I believe pain

120
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,965
is our body talking to us.

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,803
Maybe it's because I don't feel pain,

122
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,221
but I get hurt often.

123
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,557
If something is wrong with a part
of our body, or if it's in danger...

124
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,558
AHN SEUNG-HYUN

125
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
-Hello?
-Can we meet tomorrow?

126
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,231
I need to tell you something
about Cha Yo-han.

127
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,567
This week on Our Famous Doctors,

128
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,445
we'll meet Dr. Cha Yo-han,

129
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,781
an anesthesiologist at
Seoul Hanse Medical Center.

130
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,242
Okay. Let's meet tomorrow.

131
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,422
CHERUBIM

132
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,038
THE BRAIN WAVES STARTED AT BETA
AND DISPLAYED THETA

133
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,008
IT FLATLINED AND MS. PARK HYUN-SOOK
PASSED AWAY PEACEFULLY

134
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,845
CHERUBIM PROMISES YOU A PAINLESS ENDING

135
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,226
Cherubim.

136
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,650
What does Dr. Cha think?

137
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,867
Do you think he'll be able to join us?

138
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,455
I went to pick him up
when he was released.

139
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,585
I'd like to recommend a hospital for you.

140
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,547
What do you say? Do you want
to go right back to work?

141
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,757
I shouldn't bum around.

142
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,551
I should be grateful
if anyone is willing to take me.

143
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,639
What if...

144
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,143
you come across another patient
like Yoon Seong-kyu?

145
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,895
What do you think you'll do?

146
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,275
If you can be protected by the law,

147
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,319
wouldn't you be able

148
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,489
to let people like him die
without fearing punishment?

149
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,865
Protected by the law?

150
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,538
As in, doctors will have the right
to commit consensual murder.

151
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,167
What a frightening thought.

152
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,551
He's skeptical.

153
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,386
Yes.

154
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,430
I don't know what he'd think of Cherubim,

155
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,809
so I didn't want to tell him
until it was perfected.

156
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,229
I'm confident...

157
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,734
that Cherubim will be able to help Dr. Cha

158
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,114
in the treatment of his patients.

159
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,290
The video was sent from a burner phone.

160
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,126
CHERUBIM PROMISES YOU A PAINLESS ENDING

161
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,008
Sir? Are you all right?

162
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,683
Death Talks,
the foundation sponsoring them,

163
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,852
and the pharmaceutical company
Zinmu Rijund.

164
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,604
Yes. Zinmu Rijund.

165
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,064
Their stock price jumped 20 percent
recently.

166
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,358
Yes. Pharmaceutical company stocks
usually go up

167
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,193
in anticipation of a new drug release.

168
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,363
Sir. Can that drug from the video
actually be released?

169
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,992
If euthanasia is legalized, then it
can also obtain exclusive sales rights.

170
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,620
Did you find any connections
to Minister Lee Won-gil?

171
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,788
As you know, he's very powerful.

172
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,003
Here's what you asked me to look into.

173
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,215
This means "cherubim" in Hebrew.

174
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,099
There's definitely a connection,
but no conclusive evidence.

175
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,225
Right?

176
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,562
Please keep digging.
I'm sure you'll find something.

177
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,147
Yes, sir. Will do.

178
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,358
But...

179
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,986
the person who gave her the shot
in the video,

180
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,488
-do you think--?
-No.

181
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,448
We don't know anything yet.

182
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,951
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,955
CHERUBIM PROMISES YOU A PAINLESS ENDING

184
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,840
-Lieutenant Kim.
-Yes?

185
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,219
Have National Forensic Service
analyze this video.

186
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,178
Yes, sir.

ZINMU RIJUND

RECOMMENDED TO SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER,
REASON UNKNOWN

189
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,447
Apples and blueberries.

190
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,658
Eat them every morning.

191
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,952
Mushrooms.

192
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,913
You're trying to fatten me up, aren't you?

193
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,415
That would be good too.

194
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,749
Broccoli.

195
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,794
Broccoli, peppers,

196
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,963
and potatoes...

197
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,757
that are rich in vitamin C.

198
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,470
What is it? Is something wrong?

199
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
No. You sounded muffled,
but it's fine now.

200
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,936
Forget that. Lie down.

201
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,952
I'll take your temperature.

202
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,552
Okay.

203
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,722
Let me check your pulse.

204
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,880
Why is your pulse so high?

205
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,009
Are you dizzy?

206
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,262
No, I feel fine.

207
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,766
Hold on.

208
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,981
-It's strange.
-What is?

209
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,115
My heart...

210
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,867
is racing.

211
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,084
I never imagined

212
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,880
having anyone else in here other than me.

213
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,093
I did have a dream once

214
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,803
that this place was found out.

215
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,973
By whom?

216
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,432
My patients.

217
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,477
"Were you sick too?"

218
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,773
"You can't feel pain?
Then why do you act like you know?"

219
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,901
"You don't even know
what pain feels like.

220
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,821
Are you sure you even made
the right diagnosis?"

221
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,575
You might not be able to feel pain...

222
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,745
but because you're a patient yourself,

223
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,623
you're able to understand
how frustrated, sad...

224
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,794
and lonely the patients must feel

225
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,422
better than anyone.

226
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,925
That's what the patients want.

227
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,346
Instead of having someone ask them
where it hurts...

228
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,018
they prefer to have someone ask them

229
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,769
how much it hurts.

230
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,450
Are you expecting someone?

231
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,035
No.

232
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,554
Will you be okay?

233
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,933
Yes. I'll hide here and quietly leave.

234
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,935
You should answer the door.

235
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,637
Are you sure he's home?

236
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,270
-Dr. Cha.
-What brings you here?

237
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,147
-Are you okay?
-We came because we were worried.

238
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,403
This is such a nice house.

239
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,823
We couldn't come empty-handed,
so we brought this. Nice choice, right?

240
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,499
Why would they discipline you?

241
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,751
What did you do wrong?

242
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,086
This is definitely...

243
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,630
-A conspiracy.
-Yes, it's a conspiracy.

244
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,926
How do you keep your house so clean?
It's really amazing.

245
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,595
The Pain Management Center needs you.

246
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,431
You can't leave your position.

247
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,849
Will you stay still?

248
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,726
You should just come to work.

249
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,144
It's only for a week.

250
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,980
I'll be able to rest a little.
It won't be so bad.

251
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,858
Dr. Cha really does need to get some rest.

252
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,112
I just don't get why the hospital
would treat you this way.

253
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,324
And more importantly, how will we deal
with all those patients without you?

254
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,950
You can handle them.

255
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,244
What? Me?

256
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,497
I'll give you the treatment protocol.
Use that to manage everything.

257
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,583
And use this chance
to do more surgical procedures.

258
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,209
-My gosh.
-This will be good for you.

259
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,503
Why do you have so much food?
This is incredible.

260
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,339
Can I have some, Dr. Cha?

261
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,717
Sure. Go ahead.

262
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,304
Let's go outside.

263
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,597
-What?
-What?

264
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,557
-Let's go outside.
-That sounds great.

265
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,351
Let's go eat outside.

266
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,644
But I like it here too.

267
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,190
Your house is better than my house.

268
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,245
-I don't know.
-Is something bothering you?

269
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,665
It's just really difficult.

270
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,293
"I swear that one day,
I will get to correct

271
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,129
your misdiagnosis."

272
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,881
Don't you remember saying that to me?

273
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,591
Was I really that rude to you?

274
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,717
Inmate 6238.

275
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,886
I swear that one day,
I will get to correct

276
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,596
your misdiagnosis.

277
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,057
What did I know back then?

278
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,101
You're doing great.

279
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,312
You really are.

280
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,484
Oh, I almost forgot.
Did you see this, Dr. Cha?

281
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,695
This is an app for doctors.

282
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,197
And after you came to our hospital,

283
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,032
our hospital ranked number one.

284

1. SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

285
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,287
How about we use this opportunity
to celebrate?

286
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,248
Let's also hope that Dr. Cha
will be able to return quickly.

287
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,295
AP, AP. Come on, let's go.

288
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,629
One, two, three.

289
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,090
-AP, AP, let's go!
-AP, AP, let's go!

290
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,010
-We put our hands down last time.
-But you raised it.

291
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,637
-We changed it because of you.
-He's right.

292
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,764
I want you guys to go home.

293
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,517
-Why?
-Why do you keep telling us to go?

294
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
I want to sleep over.

295
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,313
Can we sleep over? It'll be nice.

296
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,225
I felt sad...

297
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,395
thinking how lonely it must've been
to be here all by yourself.

298
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,066
And I got scared...

299
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,446
thinking that you must do this
every single day in order to stay alive.

300
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,636
But I still want to thank you

301
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,472
for staying alive...

302
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,353
and for staying by my side.

303
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,482
DR. CHA YO-HAN: THANK YOU

304
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,442
Thank you.

There's a full moon tonight.
I remember how you used to like them.

309
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,400
It's my handmade stir-fried squid,
your favorite

310
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,318
I'm a better cook now
It looks good, doesn't it?

311
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,529
I look outside and saw this sunset,
isn't it pretty?

312
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,489
Today's lunch is chicken soup
I'll enjoy the meal

Dad says he loves you.

316
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,473
Tell Dad that I love him too.

317
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,953
I love you, Dad.

318
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,041
Si-young and I both...

319
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,379
love you a lot.

DAD SAYS HE LOVES YOU

322
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,139
My goodness.

323
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,684
I should tell them...

324
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,480
after the ethics commission
makes their decision.

325
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,026
If they decide against
taking him off the ventilator,

326
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,528
it'll be more painful to them.

327
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,617
Other than the two external members,

328
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,703
six out of the 12 in-house members
are your allies.

329
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,913
ETHICS COMMISSION

330
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,916
Kim Chang-sik, your junior,
is the head of the commission,

331
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,460
so it'll be easier to gather a consensus.

332
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,424
Hello.

333
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,191
-You selected the commission members?
-Yes.

334
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,610
Here's the list.

335
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,118
I want them to meet as soon as possible.

336
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,580
Like I said before, closed to the public.

337
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,499
Of course.

338
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,462
You've grown. I'm glad you pulled through.

339
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,882
What happened to your eyes?
Is something wrong?

340
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,219
I'm allergic to cats.

341
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,930
Give him to me then.

342
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,732
Did you visit your dad?

343
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,154
I couldn't visit my dad.

344
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,617
Seeing him made me depressed,
then afterwards, I felt sad.

345
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,828
So I couldn't visit often.

346
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,413
You visit him every day.

347
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
How did you know?

348
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,625
I saw you. I'm always watching you.

349
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,964
You don't know the phrase?

350
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,385
Why do you...

351
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,764
-look at me?
-You're pretty.

352
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,571
I didn't mean your face.

353
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:52,947
Then what?

354
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,366
You do nice things that don't show.

355
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,661
You have a pretty heart.

356
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,834
The moon's so pretty too.

GYEONGSEO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

358
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,404
How do you feel?

359
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,906
I don't know yet.

360
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,535
The first treatment
needs to work if it's to be successful.

00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,038
Let's see how things go
after a couple more rounds.

362
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,999
Okay. Can I go now?

363
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,377
Why are you in such a hurry?

364
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,129
Today...

365
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,506
I return to work.

366
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,261
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

367
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,212
-Mr. Son Seok-ki?
-Yes.

368
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,131
He's one of our cancer patients.

369
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,133
-Symptoms?
-Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain,

370
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,178
-difficulty breathing, and chest pain.
-Put him on a bed.

371
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,185
We'll move you.

372
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,776
Mr. Son Seok-ki? We'll give you
a painkiller and antiemetic.

373
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,361
Stay until you're stable.

374
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,114
I'll prescribe it right now.
Hang in there.

375
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,824
-Check his vitals.
-Okay.

376
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,995
That patient.

377
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,080
What are his vitals?

378
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,964
Give him a painkiller and antiemetic.

379
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,343
FIRST ROUND OF CANCER TREATMENT

380
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,929
CT FOLLOW UP IN 2 MONTHS

381
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,013
Who are you?

382
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,015
Prescribe him nitroglycerine.

383
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,185
Are you saying a young man
has a myocardial infarction?

384
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,979
-Who are you--?
-He was treated with 5-FU.

385
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,773
A side effect of that...

386
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,109
is a contraction of the coronary arteries.

387
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,611
Get some nitroglycerine.

388
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,119
Mr. Son, we have your medication.

389
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,830
Keep it under your tongue
and let it melt slowly.

390
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,720
Cha Yo-han?

391
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,559
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

392
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,126
How do you feel?

393
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,753
Much better.

394
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,468
So, earlier on...

395
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,804
Pardon?

396
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,890
Never mind.

397
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,060
If you feel the same symptoms again,
come right in.

398
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,812
Okay.

399
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,902
What do you think is the role of doctors?

400
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,197
I'm sure she wants to see you too.
Let's go to Mom.

401
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,160
We need people who determine
what is most beneficial to patients.

402
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,662
I believe that's a doctor's duty.

403
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,957
A righteous decision on life?

404
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,418
Is euthanasia a part of it?

405
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,794
Of course.

406
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,966
Death isn't always the righteous option.

407
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,676
-All that I'm doing...
-Mom.

408
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,890
is striving to determine what's best
for the patient until the end,

409
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,602
when the decision between
life and death must be made.

00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,636
-Lieutenant Kim.
-Sir.

413
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,972
National Forensic Service
finished analyzing the video.

414
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,432
Okay, I'll be right there.

415
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,359
WOULD YOU LIKE COFFEE

416
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,737
13 iced Americanos

417
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,239
and one iced mocha.

418
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,574
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

419
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,370
-Chungil Penitentiary?
-Yes.

420
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,123
One of my sources was there.

421
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,708
I met him yesterday after his release.

422
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,751
And?

423
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,089
He knew Cha Yo-han very well.

424
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,467
Chungil Penitentiary's Inmate 6238?

425
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,011
I watched him very carefully.

426
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,932
He's weird. Very peculiar.

427
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,602
If this gets out, no hospital

428
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,354
will want to hire him.

429
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,359
What were you told?

430
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,325
-Hello.
-You have an emergency.

431
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,535
Come this way.

432
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,708
-What's this? Over there.
-What's this?

433
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,303
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

434
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,642
Welcome back!

435
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,104
Congratulations on your return, Dr. Cha.

436
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,524
Isn't this too much for someone
who just got disciplined?

437
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,651
That was uncalled for.

438
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,404
You deserve to be welcomed back.

439
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,744
I brought coffee.

440
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,331
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

441
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,833
She drew this herself.

442
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,502
It looks just like you.

443
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,464
This is yours.

444
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,549
Thank you, doctor.

445
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,825
Gi-seok.

446
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,578
Gi-seok, open your eyes.

447
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
Gi-seok. Wake up. Gi-seok.

448
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,417
Gi-seok.

449
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,428
-Gi-seok. Gi-seok.
-Doctor.

450
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,973
He collapsed in the gym.
He's breathing but is unconscious.

451
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,684
Temperature 40.5 degrees, pulse 125.

452
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,893
BP 92 over 50.

453
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,187
-Let's move him.
-Gi-seok.

454
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,565
One, two, three.

455
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,819
Doctor! It's Gi-seok. Save him.

456
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,195
-Doctor.
-Ma'am.

457
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,156
Let me have a look first.

458
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,075
-Take her to the side.
-Calm down and come with me.

459
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,786
Gi-seok. Gi-seok.

460
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,538
-Are you okay?
-Gi-seok.

461
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,249
He has CIPA.

462
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,959
He doesn't respond to pain.

463
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,461
Get me a stethoscope.

464
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,311
There's a bruise on his side.

465
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,189
Did it happen
before his fall or due to it?

466
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,446
Gi-seok.

467
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,657
One ampule of Ativan.

468
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:20,866
Gi-seok.

469
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,162
Gi-seok.

470
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,373
Gi-seok.

471
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,751
The brain CT shows no abnormalities.

472
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,879
He still has a fever
despite the medication.

473
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,882
Couldn't the seizures just be
a febrile fit due to the fever?

474
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,761
-Other test results?
-At 9.2, his CRP is high,

475
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,346
and ANC is 615.

476
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,432
-Infection focus?
-Infiltration of the right lung.

477
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,476
Could it be pneumonia?

478
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,231
Put him on antibiotics.
Piperacillin and tazobactam.

479
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,732
-Okay.
-Okay.

480
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,285
This is the part you mentioned.

481
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,122
I enlarged it as much as I could,

482
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,873
but I don't see anything.

483
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,174
A white gown and short, black hair.

484
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,053
A man who doesn't wear glasses.
That's all we can tell.

485
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,972
That's right.

486
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,232
-Hello?
-Prosecutor Son.

487
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,319
Do you know they're airing Dr. Cha's
episode of Our Famous Doctors?

488
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,197
I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.

489
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,657
You must watch it.

490
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,163
Watch it.

491
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,124
There's something I must tell you.

492
00:45:55,878 --> 00:46:00,215
After antibiotics and fever reducers,
he's still unconscious with a fever.

493
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,094
He's breathing on his own,
but the pneumonia's advancing,

494
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,971
so we took the usual precautions.

495
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,307
Saturation percentage is in the low 90s.

496
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,278
We might have to put him on a ventilator.

497
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,699
Where's his mother?

498
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,663
Ma'am.

499
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,084
Did he show any symptoms
after he left our hospital?

500
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,795
No.

501
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,255
Then was he hurt recently,

502
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,882
or did he go on a trip?

503
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,968
He didn't do anything special.

504
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,471
Or go traveling.

505
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,231
What could it be?

506
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,567
The antibiotics and
fever reducers didn't work.

507
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,162
Is this his?

508
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,497
I guess so.

509
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,801
Ma'am, is this Gi-seok's phone?

510
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,094
Can we take a look?

511
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,095
Yes.

512
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,097
We might find something useful.

513
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,682
Like notes or photos.

514
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,476
There could be texts
he exchanged with friends.

515
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,978
Okay. Go ahead.

516
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,066
GALLERY

517
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,418
He collapsed at the gym, right?

518
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,004
-Yes.
-Was he exercising?

519
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,881
He didn't before,

520
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,801
but once his vacation started,
he said he wanted to train.

521
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,351
Every day, he measured
his weight, body fat,

522
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,978
and muscle mass.

523
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:22,024
He's thin and his muscle mass
and body fat are below average.

524
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,777
He couldn't be on a diet.
Did he want to gain muscle?

525
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,862
It's possible.

526
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,800
Steroids.

527
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,429
Could that be it?

528
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,265
You know how some people

529
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,101
inject steroids illegally to bulk up?

530
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,270
A side effect is the suppression
of the immune--

531
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,439
Those aren't the same steroids.

532
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,233
-Won-hee, please.
-Unlike the usual steroids,

533
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,819
anabolic steroids that are said to
increase muscle mass

534
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,072
don't suppress the immune system.

535
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,282
That's right. I got confused. Sorry.

536
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,160
What if Gi-seok was too?

537
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:21,124
You mean what if he mistakenly
injected the wrong steroids?

538
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,417
Yes.

539
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,850
Shall I call his mother

540
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,895
and ask her to check
his gym locker and belongings?

541
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,522
Say we'd like to take a look.

542
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:44,940
-Okay.
-Okay.

543
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,860
The patient you'll be meeting today

544
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,655
has a disorder where his body
doesn't tell him what's wrong.

545
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,823
He cannot feel pain.

546
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,451
He's a patient who's suffering from CIPA.

547
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,079
CIPA PATIENTS CAN'T FEEL PAIN,
HEAT, OR COLD

548
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,917
This is the ANI which shows us
his level of pain through the changes

549
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,711
of his heart rate.

550
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:10,298
When a normal person feels pain,
his or her heart rate changes

551
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,676
and the ANI figure
suddenly goes down like this.

552
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,177
But this patient shows

553
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,388
-a steady graph...
-Are you watching?

554
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,098
-He doesn't feel the cold.
-Yes.

555
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,225
What is it you wanted to tell me?

556
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,644
The patient can't feel the cold.

557
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,521
I met a reporter I know today.

558
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,273
One of his sources

559
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,443
stayed at the same penitentiary
as Cha Yo-han.

560
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,861
So what?

561
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,988
From what he saw, Cha Yo-han

562
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,657
was weird, very peculiar.

563
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,078
-He sutured himself without anesthesia?
-Yes.

564
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,707
But other than that,
there were many other oddities.

565
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,042
CHA YO-HAN

566
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,766
Doctor.

567
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,438
This is what was in his gym locker.

568
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,940
-This is his book bag from home.
-Open it.

569
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,376
There's nothing here.

570
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,469
I found it.

571
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,682
Ordinary steroids.

572
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,521
Run a galactomannan test.

573
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:52,275
If the steroids suppressed his immune
system, he could have aspergillosis.

574
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,444
ASPERGILLOSIS: INFECTION OF
ASPERGILLUS FUNGI

575
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,531
Ask Dr. Kim of Infectious Diseases
for a consultation right now.

576
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,490
-Okay.
-Okay.

577
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,844
To maintain our body temperature,

578
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,054
we must secrete sweat.

579
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,932
Peculiar?

580
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,519
They worked outdoors one summer day.

581
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,981
-It's so hot.
-Can't you do it properly?

582
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,650
It's hot. Let's finish up quickly.

583
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,485
Faster.

584
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,073
-My gosh.
-I'm exhausted.

585
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,325
Patients don't sweat,

586
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,453
so it's hard for them
to regulate their temperature.

587
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,833
Anhidrosis or the lack of sweat
is another characteristic of CIPA.

588
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,671
Cha Yo-han didn't sweat a drop.

589
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,257
-Bring some over here.
-Gosh.

590
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,843
It's so hot.

591
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,095
Don't you have manners?

592
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,638
Hey, pull yourself together.

593
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,807
-I feel much better.
-Nice and cold.

594
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,935
I feel so much better now.

595
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,697
KANG SI-YOUNG

596
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,699
What did the results say?

597
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,202
Gi-seok has respiratory failure.

598
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,637
Ambu bag.

599
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,813
Succinylcholine, one ampule.

600
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,023
SUCCINYLCHOLINE: A MUSCLE RELAXANT

601
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,992
We'll intubate.

602
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,791
He doesn't even know when he's hurt.

603
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,710
-Gi-seok.
-He gets hurt often.

604
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,420
He breaks bones.

605
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,796
PATIENT'S GUARDIAN

606
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,880
His skin too.

607
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,133
Even if it's infected,

608
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,303
we don't know unless there are signs
at the surface.

609
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,389
He has to be really careful.

610
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,016
So in the hospital...

611
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,225
CALL LOG

612
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,561
...I always asked the doctor
to prescribe antibiotics

613
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,397
so that he wouldn't get infected.

614
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,108
What did you say earlier?

615
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,736
Cha Yo-han often took antibiotics?

616
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,197
Yes. The source was a drug dealer

617
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,532
who knew his stuff.

618
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,452
But he noticed something very odd.

619
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,911
Like what?

620
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,164
If he took antibiotics that often,

621
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,708
that means he got hurt or infected often.

622
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,919
If that's true, the antibiotics
must be taken with something else.

623
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,422
Dr. Cha took nothing else.

624
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:47,218
He has never required any painkillers.

625
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,137
PATIENT'S GUARDIAN

626
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,513
He didn't need any.

627
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,640
He didn't feel any pain anyway.

628
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,809
-Do you mean...?
-Yes.

629
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,561
Painkillers.

630
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,231
Cha Yo-han's a patient.

631
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,984
He has what that boy has.

632
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,278
I have CIPA.

633
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,656
Congenital insensitivity
to pain with anhidrosis.

634
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,410
He put on a show thus far.

635
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,579
How can someone

636
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,956
who has CIPA treat patients?

637
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,002
I will report him myself.

638
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,552
RESTRICTED AREA

639
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,566
Put him on the ventilator.

640
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,828
Doctor.

641
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,332
Doctor. I can't move.

642
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,584
Gi-seok. Gi-seok.

643
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,211
I hear you.

644
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,756
But I can't speak.

645
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,135
AS SOON AS YOU FIND THIS PATIENT,
CALL AN AMBULANCE

646
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,511
DOCTOR IN CHARGE: CHA YO-HAN

647
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,804
Just like you.

648
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,265
Yes. Just like me.

649
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,277
Save me.

650
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,990
I want to live, doctor.

651
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,701
Save me.

652
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,041
Save me.

653
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,044
Doctor.

654
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,088
I want to live.

655
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,930
Doctor. I want to live.

656
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,268
Save me.

657
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,895
Director Kang, I have bad news.

658
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,522
What on earth...?

659
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,359
Dr. Kang, is it true?

660
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,277
What?

661
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,528
Dr. Cha.

662
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,530
Why did you do it without telling me?

663
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,990
In case you didn't do it.

664
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,950
Were you influenced by him?

665
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,869
Is the post that was recently
uploaded on our website true?

666
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,373
The post that you're a CIPA patient
who can't feel pain.

667
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,419
Dr. Cha's here.

668
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,212
I've wanted to meet you.
