1
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,744
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACES, AND
ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,837
Step away right now…

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,256
from my trainee.

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,807
Are you happy now?

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,518
Or should I step farther away?

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,276
All right. I'll see you there.

7
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,454
I have to go now.

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,289
See you around,

9
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,083
Dr. Kang.

10
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,125
Only a half success
and only a half failure.

11
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
Have you ever said that to me?

12
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,547
It's a success because
I got you a prison sentence.

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,714
But it's a failure

14
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,176
because you got only three years
instead of the ten years that I asked for.

15
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,138
So? I've already served my sentence.
What can I do now?

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,642
Time doesn't erase your criminal record.

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,770
Only society's forgiveness can.

18
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,149
I never asked for society's forgiveness
for what I did.

19
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,111
-I only asked for society's agreement.
-Which you failed to get.

20
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,865
Because you were convicted.

21
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,701
What do you want from me?

22
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,494
Disqualification? Dismissal?

23
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,498
No way. I have no right
to make that happen to you.

24
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,457
Then what?

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,377
Do you want to wait
until I perform euthanasia again

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,963
so that you can catch me
and take my doctor's gown off?

27
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,174
-No.
-Then what is it that you want?

28
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,762
There's only one thing I want.

29
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,183
That you don't do anything.

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,479
COURT

31
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,191
Please don't do anything.

32
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,694
Why?

33
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,197
I'm scared of you.

34
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,408
-You're scared of me?
-Yes.

35
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,958
A public prosecutor
fears an ex-convict doctor like me?

36
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,254
-Why would that be?
-Well, I have no clue.

37
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,845
Murder not based on a sudden impulse
but a firm belief.

38
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,391
And a person who puts his belief
above the law.

39
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,313
That kind of person contaminates
the people around him.

40
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,942
Especially, people who are
still in training

41
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,612
and haven't fully developed
their own opinions yet.

42
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,780
In their eyes,

43
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,492
you sacrifice and dedicate yourself
until you bleed to death.

44
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,535
You're a martyr

45
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,122
to them.

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,002
So please don't do anything.

47
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,963
Anything at all.

48
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,096
See you again, Dr. Cha.

49
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,686
I don't care.

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,150
Your opinions
and judgments about me don't matter to me.

51
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,860
What matters to me…

52
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,162
What matters to me
is not what kind of doctor I am to you.

53
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,165
It's what kind of doctor I am
to my patients.

54
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,793
Am I a doctor who kills or saves?

55
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,839
I'll leave that judgment
to my patients, not you.

56
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,014
Let me give you a piece of advice.

57
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,974
A doctor

58
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,727
can't be a deity.

59
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,479
He can only be the deity of death.

60
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,529
Hello?

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,866
How did it go?
What did Prosecutor Son say?

62
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,201
Does he want to fight?
Are we fighting again?

63
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,370
That's not it. Let's talk tomorrow.

64
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,749
Okay. By the way,
I have another piece of news.

65
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,666
What is it?

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,336
I know a producer at the broadcasting
station that interviewed Joo Hyung-woo.

67
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,214
He called me and said
he wants to interview you.

68
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,968
Would you be okay with going on TV?

69
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,771
Are you doing this as a prosecutor?

70
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,690
-Or as--
-It's as a prosecutor

71
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,110
-that I'm doing this.
-I don't think so.

72
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,225
INCOMING CALL FROM CHAE EUN-JEONG

73
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,104
-Hello?
-Prosecutor Son, it's me.

74
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,649
-Did you meet him?
-Yes, I just did.

75
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,818
How was he?

76
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,820
Is he still the same?

77
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,865
I'll tell you in person.

78
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,284
Okay. I have something to tell you anyway.

79
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,914
Han Myung-oh.

80
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,792
A lawyer on Seoul Hanse
Medical Center's legal team.

81
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,630
As you may know, he volunteered to defend
Cha Yo-han in the Yoon Seong-kyu case.

82
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,384
Min Tae-kyung.

83
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,262
Chief of Anesthesiology
at Seoul Hanse Medical Center.

84
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,390
She insisted on hiring Cha Yo-han
despite the hospital's opposition.

85
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,434
But the thing is,
no matter how hard I look,

86
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,479
she doesn't seem to have
any personal relation to Cha Yo-han.

87
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,482
Then why did she insist
on hiring him so strongly?

88
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,194
We might find the reason here.

89
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,949
Kang Yi-soo. Chairman
of Seoul Hanse Medical Center.

90
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,701
Min Tae-kyung's husband.

91
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,038
He fell into a coma after an accident.

92
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,085
He is receiving life-prolonging treatment
on a ventilator.

93
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,132
CHAIRMAN KANG YI-SOO

94
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,138
What

95
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,765
would he be feeling right now?

96
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,698
What are you two doing here?

97
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,327
We were talking about how your dad
would be feeling right now.

98
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,412
Are you thinking the same thing
as Si-young?

99
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,789
I don't like it.

100
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,129
When you don't like something,
don't you even try to understand it?

101
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,384
A doctor's decision has nothing to do
with whether you like it or not.

102
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,470
In that sense,

103
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,890
I think Si-young is at least trying.

104
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,830
Hello?

105
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,874
Hey, Dr. Cha. It's me, Si-young.

106
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,258
-Where are you?
-Pardon?

107
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,176
Where are you right now?

108
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:40,079
So their daughter is Kang Si-young,
a resident in Anesthesiology?

109
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,247
Yes, that's right.

110
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,793
And right now, she's Cha Yo-han's trainee?

111
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,753
Yes.

112
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,347
-It's just like the Postma case.
-"Postma"?

113
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,933
ANDRIES POSTMA: A DUTCH DOCTOR
WHO EUTHANIZED HIS MOTHER

114
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,727
Andries Postma? The Dutch doctor?

115
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,271
She's a doctor, but she's also
the patient's daughter.

116
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,065
If she decides to end her father's
life-prolonging treatment

117
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,026
and leaves him to die,

118
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,612
that could become the Korean version
of the Postma case.

119
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,323
You mean if someone makes it seem that way

120
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,618
and uses the media
to form a public sentiment?

121
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,079
Could this be a coincidence?

122
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,583
If it's not, there needs to be
a definite connection.

123
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,960
They're not from the same school,

124
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,588
and they're not
acquainted with each other in any way.

125
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,673
But there must be some kind of connection.

126
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,154
Why did that prosecutor want to meet you?

127
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,115
To scare me.

128
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,912
He wanted to make sure
I'll never do the same thing again.

129
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,249
What if…

130
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,461
And I hope it'll never happen.

131
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,091
But what if you're faced with
the same kind of patient--

132
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
Would I make the same choice?

133
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,178
Yes.

134
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,766
Do you know what people asked me
the most after that incident?

135
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,142
They asked me

136
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,480
if I killed that patient not because
I thought it was the best for him

137
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,817
but because I wanted to feel at ease
and free myself from that patient.

138
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
Do you even care what's best for him?

139
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,864
Are you sure it's not because
you want to feel at ease?

140
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,328
There were many reasons
why I decided to let him go.

141
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,249
But I could definitely tell people
that I didn't do it for myself.

142
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,337
If I'm put in the same situation,
and I decide to make a different choice,

143
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,965
then that won't be seen as my belief.

144
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,427
It'll just be an impulsive murder.

145
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,887
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,225
I guess that was a stupid question.

147
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,228
Can I also make a stupid hypothesis?

148
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,982
If by any chance,

149
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,611
you have to consider ending
your father's life-prolonging treatment,

150
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,243
and if you actually decide to end it,
you'll start hearing the same thing.

151
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,580
They'll say you did it
just to feel at ease.

152
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,459
And they'll add one more thing to that.

153
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,753
They'll criticize you
for giving up on your own father.

154
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,474
You need to find an answer.

155
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,894
You need to find your answer
to those questions

156
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,230
so that no one will ever be able
to criticize you again.

157
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,041
I'll find it.
I'll try hard to find my own answer.

158
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,170
And I know this may sound out of line,

159
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,007
but you should also show people
who you are.

160
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,261
I want more people to find out
what kind of doctor you really are.

161
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,059
Go on.

162
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,353
Drive safely.

163
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,673
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

164
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,886
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

165
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,977
Hello.

166
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,771
Take a picture of that one.

167
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,360
It's not like that.

168
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,904
Come on!

169
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,576
We're going to begin the shoot.

170
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,331
The reason people come
to the Pain Management Center

171
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,792
is that they want
to get rid of their pain, right?

172
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
There's a famous quote
from Nabokov's novel Pnin.

173
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,422
"The history of man
is the history of pain."

174
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,967
People are born with pain,
and they eventually die in pain.

175
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,553
And they fight with pain
throughout their entire lives.

176
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,514
My gosh, he looks amazing on camera,
and he talks so eloquently.

177
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,809
It's like he was born to be on TV.
What are you writing?

178
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
Gi-seok's mother was excited.

179
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,316
She thinks it's a great opportunity
to tell the world about his illness.

180
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,358
Concentrate.

181
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,777
Then let me ask you a question.

182
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,989
What's your definition of pain?

183
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,619
I think pain is how our body
tries to communicate with us.

184
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,079
-It's a way of communication?
-Yes.

185
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,416
When something in our body
is in danger or is malfunctioning,

186
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,670
it tries to tell us
that there's something wrong in that area.

187
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,548
But what will happen
if our body doesn't tell us that?

188
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,258
The patient you'll be meeting today

189
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,053
has a disorder where his body
doesn't tell him what's wrong.

190
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,095
In other words,

191
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,264
he cannot feel pain.

192
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,726
He's a patient who's suffering from CIPA.

193
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,565
This is the ANI which shows us

194
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,611
his level of pain through the changes
in his heart rate.

195
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,323
When a normal person feels pain,
his or her heart rate changes

196
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,284
and the ANI figure
suddenly goes down like this.

197
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,578
But this patient shows a steady graph

198
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,581
which means he cannot feel
the temperature change.

199
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,125
Does that mean
the numbers in the graph normally

200
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,419
go down when a person
responds to a stimulus?

201
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,380
-Yes.
-Dr. Cha.

202
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,674
-Look.
-What?

203
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,385
There seems to be a change in the graph.

204
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,555
We've been stimulating
the patient since yesterday

205
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,517
with cold and hot temperatures
and gave him cognitive education.

206
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,062
His brain can't receive any signals
even when his body gets stimulated.

207
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,483
So we constantly told him that what
we're doing is supposed to be painful.

208
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,986
Yes, his nervous system
is reacting instinctively

209
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,446
because we keep telling him that.

210
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,574
His body isn't feeling pain
or receiving a stimulus.

211
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
Oh, I see.

212
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,538
My hand feels weird.

213
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,960
It feels numb. And it feels so stiff.

214
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,465
Is this what it feels like when
people say their hands are freezing?

215
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,226
-What's wrong?
-What did you say, Gi-seok?

216
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,401
Tell me if this stings.

217
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,869
To be honest, I spilled
hot water on myself recently.

218
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,413
And it felt really weird.

219
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,761
Did you say he recently got injured?

220
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,054
Yes.

221
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,389
Did you notice anything peculiar
after the injury?

222
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,809
Has he felt any kind of pain
after the surgery?

223
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,103
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

224
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,147
Is there a problem?

225
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,363
I can only tell you that something
impossible just happened.

226
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,762
What's going on?

227
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,348
Please sit down for now.

228
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,020
Don't get too startled.

229
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,940
It seems like Gi-seok can feel.

230
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,483
What?

231
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,444
If he feels pain,
that means his CIPA got better.

232
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,989
But unfortunately,
this illness is incurable.

233
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,951
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,222
Dr. Cha.

235
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,060
Should we run another test?

236
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,436
Do that.

237
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,356
Also, do an MRI scan
of his spine and brain.

238
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,151
Why do we need that?

239
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,277
Just do it.

240
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,282
I still need to explain it
to his guardian.

241
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,951
She is very anxious right now.

242
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,167
I'm suspecting a nerve block
caused by trauma.

243
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,629
Okay. I'll do the tests.

244
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,244
How perverted. Pain makes him happy.

245
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,539
So this is how stinging and burning feels.

246
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,752
Right? You said you had
a burning pain all night.

247
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,339
Are you happy? Seriously?

248
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,925
Yes. I finally feel alive.

249
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,135
Are you teasing me? You little…

250
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,305
Sir, relax. Relax.

251
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,279
CHA YO-HAN

252
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,865
Gi-seok can indeed sense temperature now.

253
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,785
The test results look
completely different from yesterday.

254
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,666
Dr. Cha, I just got a call from the ward.
Gi-seok…

255
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,798
It hurts!

256
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,260
Gi-seok.

257
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,638
Please! I feel like I'm being sawed.

258
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,766
Where does it hurt? Here?

259
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,185
Gosh. Yes.

260
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,237
His bones are fine.

261
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,656
So are his nerves

262
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,533
and muscles.

263
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,078
Still, pain is spreading
through his whole body.

264
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,373
-Analgesics?
-Neither NSAIDs nor morphine work.

265
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,626
Medicine doesn't work,
and all the scans are normal.

266
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,255
Still, he feels pain
even though he is a CIPA patient.

267
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:44,344
I feel ashamed to say this as a scientist,
but is he possessed or something?

268
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,515
A ghost

269
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,350
pain?

270
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,938
-One silly doctor is enough.
-No. A ghost pain for real.

271
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,317
Phantom pain.

272
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,068
Phantom pain?

273
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,449
Like when you feel pain in your limbs
even after they're cut off?

274
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,952
That's when you imagine a pain
that doesn't exist.

275
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,290
-This case is different.
-No. This might be a kind of illusion too.

276
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,917
-A hallucination.
-A hallucination?

277
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,379
But many things can cause a hallucination.
There are more than 500 causes.

278
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
But we can narrow them down.
He's a CIPA patient, remember?

279
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,678
Even if he had a brain tumor,
he would have had no headaches.

280
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,223
Even if he suffered a brain hemorrhage,
he would have felt no symptoms.

281
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,268
-It must be a brain problem.
-He is also prone to infections.

282
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,812
Infections and poisoning could be
the cause too.

283
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,439
-Start the tests.
-Okay.

284
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,992
How are you feeling?

285
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,496
I must have switched with that boy,
Gi-seok, or something.

286
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,872
I feel less pain now.

287
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,626
But I also feel weak
in my shoulders and hands.

288
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,086
You feel weak?

289
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,589
-Yes.
-Let me try moving your shoulders.

290
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,385
Are you okay?

291
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,642
What? What's wrong?

292
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,443
A herniated disc?

293
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,570
Yes.

294
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,322
The test results show
a herniated disc on the left side

295
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,491
between cervical vertebrae 5 and 6.

296
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,160
After the surgery,

297
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,538
will I feel no pain anymore?

298
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,251
The herniated disc is

299
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,337
the only cause we can find
through tests for your symptoms.

300
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,215
-And we're going to remove that now.
-I see.

301
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,801
You've been fasting for the tests, right?

302
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,518
Dr. Park Sang-hyun in Neurosurgery
is known to be the best

303
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,020
when it comes to disc surgery.

304
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,397
He is fully booked
for the next few months,

305
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,027
-but we were able to squeeze you in today.
-Then I guess I'll have to do it.

306
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,730
What's this?

307
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,444
Did you talk to Neurosurgery
about Mr. Choi Seung-won?

308
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,947
Yes. They're getting ready for surgery.

309
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,948
Can I see it?

310
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,243
Yes. It's Mr. Choi's pain diary.

311
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,871
But I'm not sure if the symptoms
Mr. Choi describes

312
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,540
can be explained by a herniated disc.

313
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,919
He is a 47-year-old carpenter
with 20 years of experience.

314
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,631
He's doing physical labor all his life.
He must be used to all kinds of pain.

315
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,634
And he said he's never experienced
pain like this.

316
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,012
It can't be explained
by just a herniated disc.

317
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,265
A herniated disc can be
very painful too, but…

318
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,517
-He has a daughter.
-Pardon?

319
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,353
She was sick about a year ago.

320
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,980
What was the problem?

321
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,483
"Seul-ah missed school because she's sick.

322
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:13,697
We were going to make a desk,
but she was too sick to do that."

323
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,950
She was sick? How?

324
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,121
Find out what the problem was.

325
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,416
If she missed school, it might have
been something contagious.

326
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,750
Okay.

327
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,253
I like your drawing.

328
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,930
About a year ago?

329
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,016
Mr. Choi wrote in his diary

330
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,227
that his daughter missed school
because she was sick.

331
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,064
-She had chickenpox.
-Chickenpox?

332
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,405
I told you I feel excruciating pain
even when the wind blows.

333
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,327
-No way.
-What's wrong?

334
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,496
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second.

335
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:23,975
Dr. Cha, he felt like his skin
was being cut, burned, and pierced.

336
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,269
The pain got worse when touched.

337
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,688
Could it have been
because the chickenpox virus

338
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,524
remaining in his nerve cells
were reactivated?

339
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,193
-Shingles?
-Yes.

340
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,904
His daughter had chickenpox
about a year ago.

341
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,075
That's also when he started
feeling a pain in his left chest.

342
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,536
Shingles are not contagious,

343
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,040
but if his daughter hadn't had
chickenpox before,

344
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,209
she could have gotten the virus
from her dad.

345
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,380
But the problem is,
he had no skin rash at all.

346
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,258
Apart from that, all his symptoms fit.

347
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,595
Zoster sine herpete.

348
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,681
-Shingles without skin rashes?
-Choi Seung-won.

349
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,435
CHOI SEUNG-WON

350
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,897
Because the condition has
no typical symptoms,

351
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,400
an early diagnosis is rare,
and neuralgia continues.

352
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,405
Is he in surgery right now?

353
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,741
Breathe deeply.

354
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,995
I'll administer 120mg of propofol.

355
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,083
It'll make you feel drowsy.
You can just fall asleep.

356
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,134
Wait! Don't put him under.

357
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,972
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, Doctor.

358
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,101
We have to do a test on him first.

359
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,859
Dr. Cha. Gi-seok's results are out.

360
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,700
-There are no abnormalities.
-We asked Radiology to run thorough tests.

361
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,412
The results are the same.
Tumorlets or minor brain hemorrhage…

362
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,791
are nonexistent.

363
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,753
What about the spinal tap
and urine results?

364
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,212
EXTRACTING CEREBROSPINAL FLUID

365
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,714
It should be out soon.

366
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,681
-He's been weird since yesterday.
-Right? Right?

367
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,059
He asks for the CIPA patient's
test results over and over.

368
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,603
Again, again, and again.

369
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,329
Dr. Cha.

370
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,623
-Are you waiting for the results?
-Yes.

371
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,707
What about you?

372
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,501
Me too.

373
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,595
Choi Seung-won's results are out.
See for yourself.

374
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,554
Okay.

375
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,142
Take a look.

376
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,231
CHOI SEUNG-WON

377
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,025
VZV PCR.

378
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,944
Being processed.

379
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,404
Immunoglobulin G.
Negative. Immunoglobulin M.

380
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,448
IMMUNOGLOBULIN M: ANTIBODY PROTEINS

381
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,992
-Positive. Right?
-You were right.

382
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,495
I'm not mistaken, am I?

383
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,706
Inform them and start treatment.

384
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,707
Okay.

385
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,626
Lee Gi-seok.

386
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,298
Lee Gi-seok. Let's see.

387
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,269
There's nothing.

388
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,541
There's nothing.

389
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,835
There's…

390
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,504
nothing?

391
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,053
Dr. Cha.

392
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,142
He showed symptoms when there's nothing.

393
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,397
Choi Seung-won had symptoms
when he had no rash.

394
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,234
Lee Gi-seok feels pain
when he shouldn't be able to.

395
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,444
Yes, he feels pain.

396
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:49,198
Tumors, brain hemorrhage, infection,
or poisoning. There is no cause.

397
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,827
What if not having a cause is the cause?

398
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,331
-Keep going.
-I read about it once.

399
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,959
A blind person could see
and a deaf person could hear music.

400
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,420
Charles Bonnet syndrome.
Auditory hallucination.

401
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,213
Yes. That.

402
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,090
What's important isn't the fact that

403
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,343
the blind could see
and the deaf could hear.

404
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,096
They saw because they couldn't
and heard because they couldn't.

405
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,099
Our brain craves sensory stimulus.

406
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,685
If that gets cut off,
it creates its own signals.

407
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,686
Right.

408
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,064
Charles Bonnet syndrome
involves the visual cortex.

409
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,358
Auditory hallucinations
involve auditory cortex.

410
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,526
They weren't stimulated
for such a long time

411
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,780
that they created their own
visions and sounds.

412
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,199
What if we apply this
to Lee Gi-seok's case?

413
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,746
His brain has never
received any pain signals.

414
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,042
The insular lobe that
monitors senses waited for signals,

415
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,088
then suddenly, one day,
started to create its own stimuli.

416
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,175
If the neurons were to go into
hypersensitive overdrive…

417
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,680
-Central sensitization.
-Central sensitization.

418
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,266
Good job.

419
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,065
Let's go tell them.

420
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,027
Okay.

421
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,614
-Why do you refuse treatment?
-Do you call that treatment?

422
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,575
I won't be able to feel anything again.
You call that treatment?

423
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,536
Pain, hot, cold…

424
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,037
Your hands.

425
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,416
I won't be able to feel
the warmth of your hands anymore.

426
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,419
A doctor once said this.

427
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:29,173
I have a ticking bomb inside me.

428
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,385
And patients like me rarely
live longer than 20 years.

429
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,679
That means I have
about three years left, right?

430
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,639
-Gi-seok.
-During that time,

431
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,600
I want to live as a normal person.

432
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,021
I want to be cold in the winter
and hot in the summer.

433
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:48,234
I want to sweat when I play soccer.
I want to feel the warmth of your hands.

434
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,739
They're fake.

435
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,657
Pardon?

436
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,787
You won't be able to play soccer
because your legs hurt.

437
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,832
You'll be cold in the summer
and hot in the winter.

438
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,168
You'll keep receiving false signals.

439
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,088
And that'd be harder than receiving
no signal at all. Definitely.

440
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,215
How do you know?

441
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,802
You don't even know what it's like
to receive no signals.

442
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,263
That's why you can say that so easily.

443
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,184
You have no idea
what it's like to feel nothing.

444
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,979
That's why you can tell me
to go back to that life so easily!

445
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,151
What are you doing?

446
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,654
-What are you doing?
-I have something to show you.

447
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,206
This is my office.

448
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,508
Give me just a second.

449
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,760
TREATMENT RECORD

450
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,731
Ta-da.

451
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,484
What's all this?

452
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,361
A ticking bomb.

453
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,116
This person has been making sure

454
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,744
the ticking bomb inside him
hasn't gone off every single day.

455
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,084
Does this person

456
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,671
have the same condition as me?

457
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,359
What do you think he's doing?

458
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:58,281
I think he's showing him a patient
who has the same condition.

459
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,538
Don't worry.

460
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
I'll…

461
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,434
have the surgery.

462
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,022
On one condition.

463
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,404
Well?

464
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,407
It's cold and refreshing.

465
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,075
My teeth ache.

466
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,161
So does my head.

467
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,039
But it's tasty.

468
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,085
Eat a lot.

469
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,427
What else do you want to eat?

470
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,680
I wonder

471
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,809
how ice cream tasted to Gi-seok until now.

472
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,480
Neither cold nor hot.

473
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,653
Not only ice cream but his whole life
would be that way.

474
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,533
He doesn't have to freeze,
but he feels no warmth either.

475
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,161
That's what living without senses is like.

476
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,833
How did you persuade him?

477
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,295
That's a trade secret.

478
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,259
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

479
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,223
"Focus on the symptoms,
not what the patient says."

480
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,308
"If you're swamped
by the patients' emotions,

481
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,685
you won't see the symptoms."

482
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,938
I was told that all the time.

483
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,650
I was always confused as to whether
I should focus only on the symptoms.

484
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,987
You helped me find the answer

485
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,739
through the patient's story.

486
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,618
The patient's story doesn't always
give us the answer.

487
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,998
They only open up the path
that leads to the answer.

488
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,335
Okay. I'll remember that.

489
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,422
Thanks a lot for the hint.

490
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,803
-Go home.
-Okay.

491
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,015
And tomorrow,

492
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,226
scrub in for Lee Gi-seok's surgery.

493
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,443
Is it good?

494
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,488
Eat all you want.

495
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,241
See you tomorrow.

496
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,713
The key was right here.

497
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,340
Thank you, Dr. Kang.

498
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,052
No one had bothered to read this.

499
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,555
If you come across
another patient like me,

500
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,474
use that as reference.

501
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,063
The patient's story opens up
the path to the answer.

502
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,232
MONDAY, JULY 9, 2018. PAIN LEVEL 9

503
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,365
Good job.

504
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,380
Tomorrow, scrub in
for Lee Gi-seok's surgery.

505
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,179
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

506
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,487
Dr. Cha's going to
anesthetize him himself?

507
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,822
Yes.

508
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,867
Awake surgeries are really tricky.

509
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,285
He's too good.

510
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:58,914
Oh, is it true that Kang Si-young
barged into the OR yesterday?

511
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,626
You were putting him under
when she said she needed to run a test.

512
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,880
That patient was diagnosed with shingles.

513
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,339
-Really?
-Yes.

514
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,051
I guess she's becoming like Dr. Cha.

515
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,513
He told her to scrub in to assist, right?

516
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,276
How do you feel?

517
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,707
Here's the anesthetic.

518
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,256
We'll begin.

519
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,519
We're approaching the part that's
sending the wrong pain signals.

520
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,316
-Isn't that enough?
-It is.

521
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,320
We'll stimulate it. Tell us how it feels.

522
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,322
Okay.

523
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,450
0.5 ampere, 130 hertz.

524
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,184
Well?

525
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,230
-I felt the pricks.
-We'll maintain it for 30 seconds.

526
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,653
I still feel it.

527
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,157
-140 hertz
-Wait.

528
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,913
Do you not feel it?

529
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,541
It's not that.

530
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:51,962
For some reason,

531
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,840
this feels like the last time.

532
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,890
Right.

533
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,851
It could be the last time.

534
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,106
Tell me when you're ready.

535
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,001
Do it.

536
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,133
140 hertz.

537
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,840
I don't

538
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,135
feel anything.

539
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,097
Well done.

540
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,600
Now the fake pain
won't bother you anymore.

541
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,687
Promise me something, Dr. Cha.

542
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,273
My illness.

543
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,359
Promise…

544
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,697
you'll heal me one day.

545
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,828
I'll try.

546
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,229
Dr. Cha will get a great paper
out of this.

547
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,273
He'll go on TV and get more patients.

548
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,318
Chief Min,
you're a great judge of character.

549
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,738
You once complained as if
we couldn't find anyone else.

550
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,451
Chief Min. How about some tea?

551
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,799
Minister Lee recommended
Dr. Cha for a reason.

552
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,261
The hospital benefits
from such noteworthy cases.

553
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,557
But considering Chairman Kang's condition,

554
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,185
I'm concerned that
he won't be of much help.

555
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,312
What do you mean?

556
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,274
You're aware that mercy killing
or euthanasia is a very touchy subject.

557
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,945
If you take him off the ventilator,
there will be a dispute.

558
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,115
With Dr. Cha around,
won't people think our hospital

559
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,534
condones euthanasia?

560
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,285
I'm not that concerned.

561
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,082
The public notion of euthanasia
or mercy killings are changing.

562
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,920
If Dr. Cha does what he does,
I think he can help us when we need him.

563
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,757
-What do you mean, we'll need him?
-Well,

564
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,677
I'm not yet sure what that may be.

565
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,778
The boilermakers are ready.

566
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,530
The pork trotters are here!

567
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
The noodles and dumplings
are on the house!

568
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,952
-I'll take it. I'll take that.
-Enjoy.

569
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:57,082
-Should you be giving us so much?
-Don't you worry and eat all you want.

570
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,585
It'll come out of my son's paycheck.

571
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,005
-Okay!
-Tell me if you need anything else.

572
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,382
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

573
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,093
-Dr. Cha.
-Not for me.

574
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,971
-You don't drink?
-No.

575
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,099
Do you go to church?
Is it a baptismal name? Yo-han?

576
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,269
-No.
-Right. I've wanted to ask.

577
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,688
If it's not your baptismal name,
what does it mean?

578
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,400
It means "to cure" and "enjoy".

579
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,820
What? "Enjoy curing illnesses"?

580
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,822
Who gave you that name?

581
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,701
-A good fortune-teller?
-My father.

582
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,995
He must've wanted you to
become a doctor badly.

583
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,539
You were destined at birth.

584
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,792
How about you enjoy the present?

585
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,045
-It won't kill you.
-No, thanks.

586
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,964
Come on, Dr. Cha.

587
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,217
-I'll drink it instead.
-You're his savior?

588
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,352
Let's have a drink ourselves.

589
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,355
-AP, AP, cheers!
-AP, AP, cheers!

590
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,319
-Here.
-My gosh.

591
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,372
-Kang Mi-rae.
-Hello.

592
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,956
-You made it.
-Hello.

593
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,250
-Sit down.
-Mi-rae.

594
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,628
Do you want a drink?

595
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,962
-Yes? Yes?
-Yes.

596
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,984
-What was that?
-I'm your savior.

597
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,490
You're going too fast.
From here on, we'll take turns.

598
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,117
Good for you.

599
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,039
Why did you specialize in Pain Management?

600
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,084
With your skills, if you went to
Neurology or Surgery,

601
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,670
patients wouldn't have to come to us.

602
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,754
I agree.

603
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,925
A patient has chronic pain
with unknown causes.

604
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,262
People tell the patient that some
doctor at some hospital is famous,

605
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,055
that he should see that doctor.

606
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,807
What will the patient do?

607
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,183
See the doctor.

608
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,018
No.

609
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,565
The closer his appointment gets,
the more he pushes it back.

610
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,985
Why? Because he doesn't trust the doctor?

611
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,071
-In case he can't be cured?
-Something like that.

612
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,824
-Out of fear?
-Bingo. That's correct.

613
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,870
Because that doctor might not be able
to identify the illness either?

614
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,539
That's right. To keep his hope alive.

615
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:49,212
To go on thinking that
a doctor out there can cure him.

616
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,675
Is that the reason and goal
why you're in Pain Management?

617
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,471
To be the last doctor to write
that patient's prescription?

618
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,931
It's more of a dream than a goal.

619
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,769
Okay. A toast to our dreams!

620
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,729
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

621
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,189
Is euthanasia

622
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,484
a final prescription of sorts?

623
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,535
I want to ask you something.

624
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,454
Yoon Seong-kyu.

625
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,915
He was barely conscious.

626
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,378
How were you so sure that he wanted to die

627
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,131
and had no regrets
in the moment of his death?

628
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,676
How were you so sure?

629
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,980
Mr. Yoon.

630
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,407
No.

631
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,286
Mr. Yoon.

632
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,457
Yoon Seong-kyu.

633
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,929
He should hang in there
only if he can get better.

634
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,347
But…

635
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,769
however much he puts up with,
he won't get better.

636
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,696
Dr. Kang.

637
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,616
-Why did you become a doctor?
-To save people.

638
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,999
To become a doctor who never gives up
until the end and saves people.

639
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,711
To save people?

640
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,131
I failed to save Yoon Seong-kyu.

641
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,509
But failing doesn't mean
I'm done being a doctor.

642
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,220
When the patient is unconscious,

643
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,348
when not even a machine can tell
how big and where the pain is,

644
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,518
that is when I believe
a doctor should do his job.

645
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,397
One of those things is to
take the patient off the ventilator.

646
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,192
Do you think that's right?

647
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,486
Dr. Kang.

648
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,657
I don't think euthanasia
is always the right option.

649
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:27,037
-But there are times when it's needed.
-Doctors as good as you

650
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,373
would be able to tell when that time is.

651
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,334
We can't.

652
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,212
So don't brainwash young doctors.

653
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,634
Making a critical mistake
due to a serious lapse of judgment?

654
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,428
One time is more than enough.

655
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,099
Please, doctor.

656
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,146
I have to go.

657
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,447
I apologize.

658
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
Mi-rae.

659
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,960
I'm afraid of you.

660
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,128
You always act unpredictably.

661
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,297
And you finally messed up.

662
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,008
I can't tell what you'll do next.

663
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,261
-Mi-rae. If it's about Dad--
-I can't stand

664
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,140
that someone like Dr. Cha is around you.

665
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,662
DUMPLINGS AND PORK TROTTERS

666
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,541
Are you okay?

667
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,088
-Where's Dr. Cha?
-He just left. He said he has to work.

668
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,299
Thank you for the meal. See you tomorrow.

669
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,469
-But…
-Goodbye.

670
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,788
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

671
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,795
Dr. Cha.

672
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,307
Dr. Cha.

673
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,110
AS SOON AS YOU FIND THIS PATIENT,
CALL AN AMBULANCE

674
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,695
DOCTOR IN CHARGE: CHA YO-HAN

675
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,821
That's my number.

676
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,533
Always carry that
with your student ID card.

677
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,409
Thank you.

678
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,664
I'll keep my promise.

679
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,961
The promise I made

680
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,004
with you yesterday.

681
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,430
I'll study and understand my body

682
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,849
so that I can protect

683
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,185
myself.

684
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,523
"Cha Yo-han"?

685
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,609
Like you.

686
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,493
Give me your hand.

687
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,916
That's right. Like me.

688
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:05,101
He can break his bones, rupture his organs
but he still won't feel any pain.

689
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:09,063
It's congenital insensitivity
to pain with anhidrosis.

690
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,525
He's a CIPA patient.

691
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,947
I have a ticking bomb inside me.

692
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,825
And patients like me rarely
live longer than 20 years.

693
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,703
You have no idea
what it's like to feel nothing.

694
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,415
That's why you can tell me
to go back to that life so easily!

695
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,377
He doesn't have to freeze,
but he feels no warmth either.

696
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,755
That's what living without senses is like.

697
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,090
Neither cold nor hot.

698
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,721
Not only ice cream
but his whole life would be that way.

699
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,409
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN,
JUNG KYUNG-SOON

700
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,385
-What's your intention in visiting me?
-Your two daughters

701
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,762
are training under Dr. Cha.

702
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,098
Please do not show up at my workplace.

703
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,183
Everyone says it's over.

704
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,602
But what is over, really?

705
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,270
Nothing is, in my opinion.

706
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,691
The country's first confirmed
Nipah virus infection?

707
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,568
-When did the coughing start?
-It was 39.5 degrees.

708
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,155
-She's burning up.
-We were on the same shuttle bus.

709
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,825
-Are you okay?
-Until the tests come back negative

710
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,369
and the quarantine is lifted,
no one can enter or leave

711
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:50,415
-the Pain Management Center.
-Give me a protection suit. I'll go in.
