16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,430
Wei!

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,110
Wei!

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,470
Your boyfriend is here to see you.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,670
My boyfriend?

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah, over there.

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,750
Come on.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,960
Who are you?

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,430
Wei…

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,590
We're about to get married,

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,310
but your coworkers don't even know

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,430
I exist?

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,920
Am I some dirty little secret?

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,230
What nonsense are you spouting?

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,560
Who said I'm marrying you?

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't even know you!

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,510
You? You're not worthy.

32
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,000
I know you don't want to
see me right now,

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,120
but the baby
you're carrying is innocent.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,350
A child needs father.

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Let's share this wonderful news

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,230
with everyone here.

37
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,310
What are you doing?

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,790
Security! Security!

39
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,070
Get this lunatic

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,150
out of here!

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm the crazy one?

42
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,280
If the baby in your belly

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
isn't mine, then whose is it?

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,720
(Customized Professional Services)

45
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,680
It's written clearly right here.

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,150
Wei…

47
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,870
This report has
the hospital's official seal.

48
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
It's probably not fake.

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,430
Getting the deal done in advance

50
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,870
isn't actually a bad move.

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
So, when's the wedding?

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,480
A wedding dress

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
won't look good with a big belly.

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
You should get a life.

55
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,200
Have you found Ke?

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,790
Why are you so nervous?

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,560
Because people might find out
you got pregnant before marriage?

58
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,840
Or that you're just a homewrecker?

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Shut up!

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,150
Where's Ke?

61
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,470
You dare hit me?

62
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,310
I'll ask you one last time.

63
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,030
Where is Ke?

64
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,840
She's your child.

65
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,190
How would I know where she is?

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,870
You can't even control your own husband.

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Now, you've lost track of your kid too?

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,240
You're such a failure.

69
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm informing you now.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
You're fired.

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
An N+1 severance package,

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,960
is the most generosity
you'll get from us.

73
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,120
You're firing me?

74
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,030
Why should I lose my job
because I'm pregnant?

75
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,240
I'll sue you for this!

76
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,120
Go ahead.

77
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,200
While you're at it,

78
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
bring along Mr. Zhao
who you had dinner with.

79
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,430
I heard you used him

80
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,000
to pocket quite a few kickbacks.

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
You win this time.

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Wei!

83
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,120
Lu Yan!

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,710
Lu Yan!

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

86
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:25,910
Dad.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
How's Ke?

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
She's hiding back home.

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
Your mom is watching her.

90
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm honestly sick and tired

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,190
of dealing with that burden.

92
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,430
If it weren't for

93
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,960
the house you bought me,

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,150
I wouldn't be able
to stand living back home.

95
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,310
When are we moving into the villa?

96
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,190
Dad, we're not going back.

97
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,840
Not going back?

98
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm ten million in debt.

99
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,310
If I don't fill that hole,

100
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,030
I might end up in prison.

101
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,840
Lu Yan,

102
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,590
you can't go to prison!

103
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,080
Talk to Xu Cheng.

104
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
You two are still married.

105
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,840
What's hers is yours.

106
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,470
She won't give me money anymore.

107
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,030
She's already divorcing me.

108
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,190
And I borrowed a lot from loan sharks.

109
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,840
If I can't pay it back…

110
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,960
They'll be coming for me soon.

111
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,240
If you can't pay off those loan sharks,
they'll kill you!

112
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,190
Lu Yan,

113
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,480
you need to hide.

114
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,630
Let the debt collectors
go after Xu Cheng.

115
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,040
Her family should be paying for this.

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Hello?

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,830
Where did you take Ke?

118
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,270
I'm calling the police!

119
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,750
And what good will that do?

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,510
I'm Ke's father.

121
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,830
Listen to me.

122
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,190
Give me 30 million.

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,070
Otherwise, you'll never

124
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,190
see Ke again.

125
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,000
You...

126
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,830
Hello?

127
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,870
Lu Yan, curse you!

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,870
At least now we know Ke is safe.

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,630
Who are you?

130
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,040
We provided your husband, Mr. Lu Yan,

131
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
with a loan.

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
He's overdue on his payments.

133
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,800
When will he be settling his debt?

134
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,240
Miss,

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,630
it's only right
to pay back what you owe.

136
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,160
Make sure the money
is ready within three days.

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
(No wonder he asked for 30 million.)

138
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,630
Wait.

139
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,600
No need to wait three days.
I'll pay you right now.

140
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,390
Thank you, miss.

141
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,510
Who is it?

142
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,630
Why are you here?

143
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,560
Ke?

144
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,600
Ke!

145
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,270
Hey!

146
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,430
Ke!

147
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,390
Where did you hide my child?

148
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
She's at a TCM clinic.

149
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,190
What clinic?

150
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,600
Send me the address.

151
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,270
The doctor doesn't like being disturbed

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,000
while treating patients.

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,430
Besides,

154
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
this is my house.

155
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,750
Get out.

156
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,270
Mr. Liu, come in.

157
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,040
Do you think that will scare me?

158
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,870
It's you guys?

159
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,630
That's right.

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
Cursed woman.

161
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
How much did she pay you?

162
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,630
Listen, she's mentally unstable.

163
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,800
All her money is with her husband.

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,190
Do you even know who her husband is?

165
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,190
Her husband is my son!

166
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,160
You should pick the right side.

167
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,240
Old man,

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
your son is the one
who refuses to pay his debt.

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
That's right.

170
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,240
Then go after him!
He's the one who owes you money.

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,000
This house is under my name.

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,360
It has nothing to do with me.

173
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm just his father.

174
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,720
That's exactly why we're here.

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,390
Exactly!

176
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
This is the house Lu Yan bought.

177
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
He claimed
it was a gift for his father,

178
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,510
but in reality, it's his own property.

179
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,510
It's not under his father's name at all.

180
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,080
I bet this place is worth
at least a million.

181
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,120
That should cover
part of the interest he owes you.

182
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,160
How could you be so vile?

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Not only did you not help Lu Yan
with his debt,

184
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
you're scheming against him!

185
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,510
What did our family do to deserve

186
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,190
a daughter-in-law like you?

187
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,040
Mr. Lu,

188
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,720
it's time to vacate the house.

189
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,360
Why is this happening to me?

190
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,600
Is there no justice anymore?

191
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,560
Lu Yan!

192
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,870
Do you know how cruel Xu Cheng is?

193
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,680
She took my house away!

194
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,750
She made me homeless.

195
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,800
I got it. Just take care of Ke.

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,630
Alright.

197
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,160
Ying.

198
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,270
Bring Ke over.

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
How many times do I have to tell you?

200
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,600
Just stay close by.

201
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,750
Why did you go so far?

202
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,310
Get something for this brat to eat.

203
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,310
Make it cheap. I'm out of money.

204
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Go.

205
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,720
Are you sure you won't come
to the hospital today?

206
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,150
I'm getting a checkup.

207
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,600
It's so boring being alone.

208
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,240
Wei…

209
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,030
I know you're upset.

210
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm on a business trip.

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,790
I really can't get away.

212
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,030
I ordered you some
bird's nest soup and fish maw.

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,200
It'll be delivered soon.

214
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,030
I have another call coming in.

215
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
I'll talk to you later.

216
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,480
Okay.

217
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,150
Hello?

218
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,510
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

219
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm really busy today.

220
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,630
You don't need to treat me to a meal.

221
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,030
Taking care of patients
is just part of my job.

222
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
Alright.

223
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,670
Actually,

224
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,600
Ke knew I was meeting you today,

225
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,390
so she picked out a gift for you.

226
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,720
I happen to be near the hospital.

227
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,670
How about I drop it off for you?

228
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,550
It's her little way
of showing appreciation.

229
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,320
What do you think?

230
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,870
Alright.

231
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,320
Wait for me, then.

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,270
Wei?

233
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,390
And you are...

234
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,910
I am Wen Wan.

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,630
Don't you remember?

236
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,320
I came to your hospital
for a facial slimming injection.

237
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,030
I was terrified of the pain.
You calmed me down.

238
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,630
Oh, it's you.

239
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,630
Are you feeling unwell today?

240
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,150
There's been a flu
going around at the hospital.

241
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,480
No, it's not that.

242
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,360
My stomach has been feeling off.

243
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,790
I thought I'd get it checked.

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm pregnant.

245
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,750
It's my first time at this hospital.

246
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,840
I don't know my way around and got lost.

247
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,720
It's okay. I'll take you there.

248
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,030
Thank you.

249
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,510
No problem.

250
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,200
Ke, come out.

251
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,030
The phone.

252
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,870
It's Mom!

253
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:25,980
(Mom)

254
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,240
Hello?

255
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:27,870
Cheng!

256
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm with Ke right now.

257
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,670
Lu Hua took me into the mountains.

258
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,320
I don't know exactly where we are.

259
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Mom!

260
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
Send me your location!

261
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,790
Mom, please come save me!

262
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,440
Ke!

263
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, right!

264
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,270
I can share my location!

265
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,160
(Mom: The call has been disconnected.)

266
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,960
What are you doing?

267
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,670
Move!

268
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,080
So, you're tipping them off!

269
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,240
I should teach you a lesson!

270
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,670
She's your own granddaughter!

271
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,910
You can't do this!

272
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Are you sending her our location?

273
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,280
(Jiangcheng, Renshou County
Qianjia Village)

274
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,000
This is the place.

275
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,920
(You are not added as a friend.
Voice call unavailable.)

276
