16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,560
Lu Yan was out of line this time.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,070
Jiang Yang is his own brother.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,430
How could he hit him?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,470
Don't worry, San.

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,240
When I get home,

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,560
I will teach him a lesson.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,710
Are you a family member?

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,840
The test results are out.

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,320
How is he?

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,320
He is fine.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,400
He fainted due to
iron-deficiency anemia.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,760
He needs a proper diet.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,230
(Routine Blood Test. Blood Type: AB)
Could this be a mistake?

29
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,120
That is impossible.
Our tests are accurate.

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,640
Doctor,

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,590
I have a question.

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,560
Can someone with type O blood
have a child with type AB blood?

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
No, that is absolutely impossible.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,920
So that means...

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
San?

36
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,510
I need to...

37
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,870
Liu Genhua! Stop right there!

38
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,510
Stop!

39
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,870
Hua.

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
Whose child is this?

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,560
I am asking you a question! Answer me!

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,280
What do you mean by that?

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Yang Yang is my son,
and I am proud of him.

44
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,000
Tell me, who is his biological father?

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
It doesn't matter.

46
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,870
Just treat him as your own.
That's all that matters.

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,680
You got yourself a healthy son for free.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
You should consider yourself lucky.

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,790
You despicable woman!

50
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,560
Who are you to insult me?

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,680
If it were not for the Xu family,
the Lu family would be nothing.

52
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,560
Listen. If you're going to
live off a woman, just stick to it.

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,870
Why go around having affairs?

54
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,630
Have you even looked in a mirror?

55
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,030
Do you know your worth?

56
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,080
Pathetic.

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,280
Get out.

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
Take your cursed son with you.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,630
Get lost!

60
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,030
Thank goodness.

61
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,430
I can finally be done with you.

62
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,630
What did you just say?

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,560
It's you!

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
You're lazy, dumb, and filthy.

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,430
More than once,

66
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,400
I've thought about poisoning your soup

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
and ending you once and for all.

68
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't have to

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
put up with you anymore.

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
What a relief.

71
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,960
Get out! Get out!

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,630
So…

73
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
So...

74
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,190
Wei.

75
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,590
There was nothing
between me and Wen Wan.

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,590
I don't expect you to believe me.

77
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,590
But whatever you ask,

78
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,150
I'll do it.

79
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
I won't believe you again.

80
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,190
After all these years,

81
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,400
when have I ever lied to you?

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,240
Alright.

83
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
Then, divorce Xu Cheng.

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Marry me.

85
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,150
I can promise you

86
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,030
anything else.

87
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,150
But not this.

88
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,750
The timing isn't right.

89
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,520
And when will it be?

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,000
Soon.

91
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't give me that!

92
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,750
I want a real answer.

93
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,190
A month?

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,910
A year? Ten years?

95
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,590
Don't push me like this.

96
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,630
You have to trust our love.

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,590
Love?

98
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,030
I've loved you for years.

99
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,150
And what did I get in return?

100
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,150
I told you.

101
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,750
The other women meant nothing.

102
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,080
It was all for our future.

103
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
You're the only one I truly love.

104
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,280
Fine.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
If you don't believe me,

106
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,190
I have nothing more to say.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,430
If you want to leave, go.

108
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
It's your choice, after all.

109
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,710
Alright, Lu Yan.

110
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,710
After all the years we spent together,

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,470
this is how you treat me?

112
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,390
Listen up. It's never happening.

113
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,870
You will divorce Xu Cheng right now

114
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,070
and marry me.

115
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,720
Even if you're worthless,

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,830
you'll still stay by my side.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,870
Otherwise...

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
I don't mind letting everyone know

119
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,600
the truth about
that medical accident three years ago.

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,430
I'm giving you one last chance.

121
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,070
The only person

122
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,040
I've ever wanted to marry is you.

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,360
Good.

124
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,160
Words mean nothing.

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,870
I won't believe you so easily again,

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,310
unless

127
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,600
you prove it to me.

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,750
Buying me coffee again?

129
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,950
What if your girlfriend gets mad?

130
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
That's not why we're here.

131
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,430
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,630
That's all.

133
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,760
And do you think an apology is enough?

134
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,560
I'll be honest with you.

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,630
Luo Wei and I were
middle school classmates.

136
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,630
We left our small town
and worked our way up together.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
In the beginning,

138
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,190
her family helped me a lot.

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
So, in every way,

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
I felt obligated to look out for her.

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,630
But over time, I realized

142
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,630
she misunderstood how I felt about her.

143
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,950
Why are you telling me all this?

144
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,360
I want you to know

145
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,830
Luo Wei is not my girlfriend.

146
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,190
The child she's carrying isn't mine.

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,870
And you think I'd believe you?

148
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,070
Believe me or not,

149
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,390
you still came, didn't you?

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
So what?

151
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
You're in the medical field too.

152
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,950
Do you really think I'd lie about this?

153
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,680
By the way,

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
you asked me to check with my dad

155
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,390
about the medical equipment deal.

156
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,830
I talked to him.

157
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,240
What did he say?

158
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
He said...

159
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,120
It's not impossible
to give you the deal.

160
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,040
But you'll need to pay
a one-third deposit.

161
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,190
How much?

162
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,430
Four million.

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
Four million? That's a lot.

164
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,720
If you're not interested,

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
don't take the deal.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,870
I'll take the deal.

167
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,000
Hello? Zhang?

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,430
I'm really sorry.

169
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,680
We haven't talked in so long,

170
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,240
and now I'm calling to borrow money.

171
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,510
But don't worry,

172
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,950
once I finish these surgeries,

173
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,720
I'll pay you back right away.

174
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,830
Lu,

175
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,600
the money can wait.

176
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,360
Cancer is no small matter.

177
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Focus on getting better first.

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,750
Once you're well, come find me.

179
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,560
Thank you so much, Zhang.

180
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,630
Hello? Ling?

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Well?

182
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,390
Have you thought about what I said?

183
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,830
What's your decision?

184
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,070
I transferred the money to your account.

185
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,920
Even with Mrs. Lu in a vegetative state,

186
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,160
you're still sticking by her side.

187
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,430
Mr. Lu,

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,070
you really are the man
who caught my eye.

189
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,480
Thank you, Ling.

190
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,070
Mr. Lu.

191
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,120
What?

192
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,750
Is there something on my face?

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
I thought you
weren't going to call me again.

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
So, did you call

195
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,070
because of this?

196
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,950
Of course not.

197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680
I just missed you.

198
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Missed me?

199
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,390
That's brazen.

200
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,630
What if Luo Wei gets jealous?

201
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,270
The slap she gave me

202
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,830
stung for days.

203
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,120
So?

204
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,390
Does it still hurt?

205
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,200
My face doesn't,
but my heart still does.

206
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
What would make it stop hurting?

207
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,440
Mr. Lu.

208
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
There's a million in here.

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
An intern like you
has this kind of money?

210
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
That's not your concern.

211
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm doing this for you.

212
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,510
When you make it big, Mr. Lu,

213
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,840
don't forget about me.

214
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,390
I won't.

215
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,750
I heard you're looking for a job.

216
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,750
If these photos got out,

217
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
would any hospital still hire you?

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,240
Mrs. Lu, I'm sorry.

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,630
Mr. Lu threatened me.

220
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,550
I was just a student.

221
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,550
If you're really sorry,

222
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,840
then make it up to me.

223
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,510
Do something for me.

224
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll be blunt.

225
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,600
If you get this done,

226
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,390
I'll destroy the photos.

227
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,440
I called everyone here today

228
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,670
to announce some good news.

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,670
Our former CEO, Xu Cheng,

230
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,550
has taken time off to rest.

231
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,150
She has now fully recovered.

232
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,440
She is ready to return to work.

233
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,630
So, the board has decided

234
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,550
to reinstate Xu Cheng as CEO.

235
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,550
I thank the board for this opportunity.

236
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,480
These past few years at home

237
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
have made me realize something.

238
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,480
Aesthetic medicine
is life-changing for women.

239
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
From now on,

240
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,510
I will dedicate myself completely

241
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,030
to the medical beauty industry.

242
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,840
Helping women feel beautiful
shall be my mission.

243
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
Today, I've invited

244
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,840
several women from different age groups

245
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,150
for a discussion.

246
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,270
I hope that through this conversation,

247
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,670
we can better understand.

248
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,910
What women of different ages

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,910
truly need when it comes to beauty.

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,150
Let's welcome them.

251
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,670
Mrs. Lu?

252
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,000
But you became vegetative
after the car crash!

253
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,790
