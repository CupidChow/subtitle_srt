16

How did it go?

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,320
Is everything taken care of?

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,470
We're in the hotel room.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,430
Come over.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,710
(Xu Cheng.)

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,230
(Don't blame me.)

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,640
(You brought this on yourself)

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,790
(when you refused to divorce Lu Yan.)

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,040
Xu Cheng.

25
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,280
I just saw you go in with two men.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
Who are they?

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
Can I come in and take a look?

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,000
Xu Cheng! Xu Cheng!

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
What are you doing?

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,870
Let go of me!

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,350
Wei.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,680
You're playing quite the game.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,150
Alright, let's record another one.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,590
No need. I've already started recording.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
What are you doing?

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,040
What are you doing?

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,200
Xu Cheng, let's not waste words on him.

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,480
Come on, call the police.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,150
Let's go.

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,920
Wait.

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,870
Just you two?

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,520
Calling the police?

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,630
What if you count me in?

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,590
Hey, handsome.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,310
This is just a misunderstanding.

46
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,400
We're just trying to make a living.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,680
We haven't had a job in months.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,840
This is our chance to earn some money.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,750
Fine.

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,150
I'll give you one more chance.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,190
As everyone knows,

52
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,590
Lu Yan is a total hypocrite.

53
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,430
He can cheat as much as he wants,

54
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,840
but if someone else
has more fun than him,

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,870
then...

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,030
You...

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,630
Do you think Lu Yan would still marry you

58
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,710
if he saw these videos?

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
Get out.

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,080
Madam, don't forget
the rest of my payment.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,560
You'd resort to this despicable trick?

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,150
You really are shameless.

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,910
You're calling me shameless?

64
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,750
Who started it first?

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Who hired those two men just now?

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,000
Should we let the police investigate?

67
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,000
Even if Lu Yan sees the videos, so what?

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
He won't believe them.

69
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,280
The years of love we've shared

70
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,960
won't be ruined by the likes of you.

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,430
Alright, let's wait and see.

72
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,560
That was close.

73
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,960
You have my thanks.

74
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,080
No need to thank me.

75
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,030
We've known each other for years.

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
Your problems are my problems.

77
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,360
Besides,

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
I came back just to help you.

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,150
I've already told Lu Yan.

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
If he wants to secure this deal,

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
he has to pay a four-million deposit.

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,710
This is just the beginning.

83
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,030
What I want is for him
to be utterly ruined.

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
They've added a lot of new dishes here.

85
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,750
I want you to try them.

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Thank you.

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,470
By the way,

88
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,360
about the medical equipment procurement,

89
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,960
has your uncle made a decision?

90
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,360
Have you and Xu Cheng
finalized the divorce?

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,910
Xu Cheng already agreed.

92
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,430
She said she'd divorce me soon.

93
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,510
You're still not divorced yet?

94
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,870
Then what are we now?

95
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,510
Wan, don't go.

96
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,040
If my dad finds out about this,

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,040
there's no way

98
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,990
he'll help you secure
that medical equipment deal.

99
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,920
Wan.

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,430
Don't worry.

101
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,950
For the sake of our future
and a better life together,

102
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,950
I will do my best.

103
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,120
Trust me.

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,310
It won't be long.

105
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,240
Come in.

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Dr. Lu, here are
the documents you requested.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Thank you.

108
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,680
(Xu Cheng, this is for trying
to ruin my life.)

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,270
This is the nose job
scheduled for this afternoon, right?

110
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,360
Yeah, why?

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,950
Nothing.

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,870
I remember this client being troublesome.

113
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
They're allergic to many medications.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
(Rhinoplasty Surgery Drug Allergy Test)
But the allergy section here

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,720
is blank.

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,630
What's so strange about that?

117
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,120
Maybe it's not the same client.

118
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,270
Besides, these documents
were signed by Ms. Xu.

119
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,830
(Rhinoplasty Surgery Drug Allergy Test)
Ms. Xu wouldn't make a mistake.

120
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
That's true.

121
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,190
Ms. Xu, the surgery is complete.

122
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,180
Everything went smoothly.

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,360
Get back to work.

124
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,830
Ms. Xu.

125
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,800
The surgery is done, right?

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
That rhinoplasty client just now

127
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,970
clearly stated they were allergic
to those drugs.

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,430
But the report you sent to the pharmacy

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,310
was completely blank.

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
How could this happen?

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,070
Because of this mistake,

132
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,830
the company could face backlash.

133
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,510
It could even cost the client their life.

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,430
What do we do now?

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,270
Am I going to prison for this?

136
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,680
Is this the reaction
you were hoping to see?

137
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,430
For such an important document,

138
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,370
of course I made a backup and handed it
to the attending doctor in person.

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Lu Yan, you've really lost your mind

140
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,950
trying to frame me.

141
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,310
Enough talk.

142
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,070
Here's the divorce agreement.

143
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,950
Sign it.

144
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,750
Marital assets split equally.

145
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
The child stays with me.

146
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,360
Plus, I must you an extra 20 million.

147
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,310
Wishful thinking.

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,070
I made compromises.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,830
Just sign it.

150
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's end this quickly.

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
In a hurry?

152
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,720
But I don't want a divorce anymore.

153
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,800
What now?

154
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Dr. Lu.

155
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,000
What surgery takes this long?

156
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,430
I'm sorry

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,630
for the wait.

158
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,870
