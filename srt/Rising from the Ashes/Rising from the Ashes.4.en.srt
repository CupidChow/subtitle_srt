(She Found Out!)

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,110
Why? Are you jealous?

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,640
You betrayed me.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,600
No, I didn't.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,030
Why were you and Lulu
in a hotel room together?

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,470
She wanted an injection.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,040
Then why did she run away
when I tried to call the police?

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,350
It's because she stole the injection
from the hospital.

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,640
You think I'm that stupid Xu Cheng?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,760
Why couldn't she do it at the hospital?

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,280
Why must you rent a hotel room?

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,680
My silly girl,

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,070
think for a moment, will you?

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,230
She's a nurse.
There are too many eyes at the hospital.

29
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,590
How could she do it there?

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,150
Look at this.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
She transferred money to me

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,160
(Nurse Han Lu)
after every session.

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,640
Really?

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,230
We've been together for years.

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,920
Ten years.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you have no trust in me at all?

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,950
So you do realize that.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
We've been together for ten years.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,150
And this is what you treat me?

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,790
I've always wanted

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,950
to give you this ring.

42
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,070
Isn't this the one
Xu Cheng posted on Moments?

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,510
Whatever Xu Cheng has,

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
you'll have it, too.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,520
In my heart,

46
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,552
you are my real wife.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,560
I keep wondering

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,470
if it was really worth it

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
to let Xu Cheng have you?

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,710
Of course, it was.

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,520
Soon, we'll take everything

52
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,280
from Xu Cheng.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,310
Do you think
people who are born without privilege

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
will never have it for their lifetime?

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
Maybe.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,870
Some people

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,240
are born with everything.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you see that girl?

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,000
She's my dormmate, Xu Cheng.

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
She's the daughter
of the Xu Group's president.

61
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,800
We talked about her in our dorm.

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,560
She lost her mother at a young age,
and her father was always abroad.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
She yearned for family love,

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,960
and we believed she'd definitely
pursue true love

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,840
and never agree to a marriage alliance.

66
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,630
She's intelligent,

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,150
and she's also the only child.

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
She's bound to inherit everything.

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,150
Back then, I went to great lengths

70
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,630
to win Xu Cheng over,

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,750
and you became her best friend.

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,590
She even gave you a job.

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,750
I used her family's influence

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,910
to climb my way up to where I am now.

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,630
We're so close

76
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,549
to reaching our goal.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,310
All these years,

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,750
I've watched you two fall in love,
get married, and have a child,

79
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,680
playing a perfect couple in front of me.

80
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,960
Sometimes, I think

81
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
that one day,

82
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,360
I'll take you back
without hiding anymore.

83
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,400
You will.

84
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,430
You're the only one I care for.

85
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
If I were cheating on you,

86
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,520
why wouldn't I try to hide it?

87
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,400
I bet you wouldn't dare.

88
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,860
If I hadn't covered up
the major medical accident for you

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,710
back then,
you wouldn't be where you are today.

90
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,710
That's enough.

91
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,030
Let's not talk about the past.

92
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,430
I'll always remember

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,190
what you did for me.

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,710
Now that Xu Cheng has been stripped

95
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,000
of her position.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,590
That seat

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,310
is mine.

98
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:18,750
Soon,

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
Xu Group

100
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,240
will be renamed as Lu Group.

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,800
By the way,

102
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,430
Xu Cheng found out about the pills.

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,070
Dear.

104
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
It's time to take your meds. Here.

105
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,680
Dear,

106
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,040
thank you for always

107
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,480
reminding me.

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
This is

109
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,070
the least I can do.

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,510
Very good.

111
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,830
I'll go take a shower.

112
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,070
Excuse me.

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,120
We found hallucinogenic substances
in your system.

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
The levels are high.
It's likely due to long-term intake.

115
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
(Initial Assessment: Hallucinogenic
substances found in the patient's body.)

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Thank you.

117
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,870
Madam,

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,360
I've read your medical records.

119
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,180
It states that you have
mental health issues.

120
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,040
If you didn't take these voluntarily,

121
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
we need to test your medication.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
If there's an issue,

123
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,680
we're required to report it.

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,160
I've had them tested before.

125
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,800
I didn't bring the report.

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,160
But

127
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
I do have the pills with me.

128
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,950
It's best to test it again

129
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,430
in the same hospital right now.

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Please do it.

131
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,310
As soon as possible.

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,430
All right. I will.

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
Where did you get this?

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,870
There are hallucinogens in it.

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,360
He took them himself.

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,070
He keeps sleeping after taking them.

137
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,240
Life is boring.

138
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,070
Dear,

139
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,000
it's time to take your meds.

140
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,310
These are regular sleeping pills.

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,630
It's helpful for mental health issues.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Did you bring the wrong medication?

143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,510
No.

144
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,430
I take them every day.

145
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,980
(The medication is normal
for sleep aid.)

146
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,040
Was it an exhausting trip?

147
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,070
Not really.
I'm trying to get used to it.

148
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,510
The trip is too long.

149
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,310
Ying, you cut the fruit so nicely.

150
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,270
Being young is good.

151
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,430
How tall are you?

152
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,750
I'm 178 cm in bare feet.

153
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,360
Sister,

154
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,680
put it over here.

155
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,310
Ying,

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,510
wash two apples.

157
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,160
Mom.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
How tall are you? 178 cm?

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,630
Where's Ke?

160
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,630
178 cm in bare feet.

161
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,160
I've sent her to kindergarten.

162
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,630
Cheng,

163
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,000
have some strawberries.
They're freshly picked.

164
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,830
Come.

165
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,190
Mom, please sit.

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Have some.

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
You've taught your son so well.

168
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
Yang is such a good boy.

169
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Unlike someone

170
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,360
who's selfish.
Treating family like outsiders.

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
It's better to have a son.

172
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,630
It's a shame that the Lu family

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
isn't that lucky.

174
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,270
Jiang Yang, eat more.

175
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,310
Eat more.

176
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,720
The traffic was terrible.

177
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,870
You got a new car?

178
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,430
I can't afford it.

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,160
My boyfriend bought it for me.

180
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
He's not bad.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,750
My place is only 200 meters
from the office.

182
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,960
I barely use it.

183
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,630
It's been collecting dust in the garage.

184
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,550
Why?
Have you finally decided to get married?

185
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,440
You will have to beg me

186
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,080
to let my daughter be your flower girl.

187
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
I'd love to.

188
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,080
But marriage

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
is all about timing.

190
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,240
Enough about me.

191
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,390
Have you looked into your pills?

192
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,030
(Since you've found out
about the pills,)

193
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,790
(you'll be getting divorced soon.)

194
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,790
I'm still looking into it.

195
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,080
Don't let love cloud your judgment.

196
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
Once you find proof,

197
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
do what you need to do.

198
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,767
Don't hesitate.

199
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,790
(The medical report clearly states)

200
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,080
(that hallucinogens
were found in my system.)

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,150
(But the second drug test)

202
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,550
(showed the pills were normal.)

203
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,550
(Did someone warn Lu Yan,)

204
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
(so he switched the pills?)

205
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,360
(But the only person
who knew about this)

206
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,720
(is)

207
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,320
