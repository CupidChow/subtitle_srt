(A New Prey Appears)

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,520
Lu Yan, you're finally home.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
Dad, what did the doctor say?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,880
How's Wei?

19
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:57,670
I'm fine.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,240
Come on, sit down.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,710
Here.

22
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,670
I just took a little fall.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,230
The checkup results are normal.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
Our baby is healthy.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,070
That's good.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,120
Lu Yan,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,510
I know you've been busy
taking care of Ke,

28
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,070
but Wei is carrying your child.

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,280
Besides,

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,560
Ke has lost her sight,

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
but Wei is carrying a son.

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,070
He's the future of the Lu family.

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,920
Wei, don't worry.

34
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,840
I'll take good care of our child.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,150
Alright, we're all family.

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,950
Wei, if you're craving anything,

37
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,760
just tell me.

38
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
I'll make sure you and the baby

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,920
are well-fed and healthy.

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,790
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

41
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,920
Of course.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,430
Let's go get some rest.

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,950
Go on.

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,350
Slow down.

45
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,350
Take it easy. Come.

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,150
Lu Yan, I have to say this.

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,310
Why did you sign that contract
with Xu Cheng's father?

48
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,590
The one saying if you cheat,
you leave with nothing?

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,950
Dad, don't you remember?

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,640
That was the only condition he set.

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,590
If I hadn't signed it,

52
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,190
he wouldn't have agreed
to our marriage.

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,240
Alright, since it's already done,

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,030
there's no point
in talking about it now.

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,750
But don't forget,

56
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,910
you and Wei have been
planning this for years.

57
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,360
What was the goal all along?

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,030
Now that Wei's belly is getting bigger,

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,750
even if you don't think about yourself,

60
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,870
at least think about
the child she's carrying.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,150
As for Ke,

62
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,870
she's just a daughter.

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,360
And now, she's blind.

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,680
Xu Cheng has plenty of money.
She'll take care of her.

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
You don't need to worry about that.

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,310
I know you feel guilty.

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,080
But sooner or later,
you two will divorce.

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,520
Right now, your priority should be

69
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,590
draining Xu Cheng's wealth.

70
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,030
That's what really matters.

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
Honey.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,360
How's Ke doing?

73
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,000
Honey.

74
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,710
You haven't slept in days.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,430
Let me take care of Ke tonight.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,560
No need.

77
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,030
Then, at least take a shower,

78
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,560
get some rest, or even just a nap.

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,630
I don't need to.

80
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,800
No, Ke is my daughter too.

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Her suffering breaks my heart too.

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
This is uncalled for.

83
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,280
Is it?

84
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,690
So, you've decided
to divorce me after all?

85
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,800
No, can we

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,030
just talk this through?

87
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,190
Let's talk outside.

88
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,840
Honey…

89
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,870
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,560
Back when Luo Wei

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,430
started seducing me,

92
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,630
I should've shut her down immediately.

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,910
I know.

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
I know you won't forgive me now.

95
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,190
But, after what happened to Ke,

96
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,520
I can't let you exhaust yourself
taking care of Ke.

97
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,630
So please,

98
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,910
for Ke's sake,

99
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,960
can you forgive me?

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
The divorce papers
are already with your lawyer.

101
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,870
From now on, we're strangers.

102
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,960
Forgiveness doesn't even matter anymore.

103
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,030
Honey.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,310
Please, I'm begging you.
Just give me one more chance.

105
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,870
Honey!

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,720
Have you thought about
who Ke will end up with?

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,270
You are mentally troubled.

108
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,390
Do you really think

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,850
the court would ever
grant you custody of Ke?

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Looks like you never even read

111
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,950
the documents I sent you.

112
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,830
Let me spell it out for you.

113
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,070
I'm completely fine now.

114
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,600
After the divorce, I get full custody.

115
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,240
You cheated, so you leave with nothing.

116
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,270
And you'll have to
pay me alimony every month.

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,430
Now that Ke is in bad shape,

118
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,630
can you really guarantee
your condition won't relapse?

119
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,680
Even if it doesn't,

120
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,120
the moment you mention divorce,

121
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,750
I will make sure it does.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
Can't keep up the act anymore?

123
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,310
Not really.

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,270
I just want my wife's forgiveness.

125
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,830
Give me 30 million.

126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,680
We split the marital assets equally.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
As for Ke's custody,

128
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,430
you can have it.

129
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,040
I don't think you understand.

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm informing you, not negotiating.

131
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,480
Everyone at the kindergarten
saw it that day.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,160
Your dad was the one who took Ke.

133
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,160
Intentional or not,

134
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
he's responsible for her injury.

135
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,870
I've already filed a lawsuit.

136
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,920
Of course,

137
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,480
if you don't want to
cover the damages for him,

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,870
you can always
send him to prison yourself.

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,240
Ke?

140
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,190
Ke?

141
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Nurse! Nurse!

142
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,600
Time rushes by,
but I only care about you…

143
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
Where's Ke?

144
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,270
Answer me! Where's Ke?

145
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,950
Isn't she still in the hospital?

146
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,070
She hasn't come back.

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Director Wen has been looking for you.

148
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,070
My dad is so annoying.

149
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,720
(Wen Wan)
(Our city has two major medical groups.)

150
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,240
(Wen Group also has a high demand)

151
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,070
(for medical equipment
procurement projects.)

152
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,510
Hello?

153
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,040
Is this Nurse Wen Wan?

154
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
Hello, who's this?

155
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm Ke's parent.

156
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
Sorry for calling out of the blue.

157
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,750
Here's the thing.

158
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,720
Ke has been
talking about you a lot lately.

159
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,830
I wanted to personally thank you.

160
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,240
Has Ke been discharged already?

161
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,310
No, she hasn't.
She was transferred to another hospital.

162
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,430
Ke has been

163
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,270
pestering me to contact you.

164
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,920
She even prepared a gift for you.

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Are you free tomorrow night?

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,510
I'd love to treat you to dinner.

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Sure.

168
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,870
See you tomorrow, then.

169
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,550
What do we do?
Lu Yan isn't answering his phone.

170
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,600
We...

171
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,630
Hello?

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,150
Send more people to investigate.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,150
Check all the doctors,

174
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,510
department heads, and nurses

175
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,440
on duty that day.

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,270
See if anyone knows where Ke went.

177
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,390
Go through all entry
and exit surveillance footage.

178
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,120
Do it fast.

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,120
I can't wait any longer.
I'm going to find Ke right now.

180
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,150
Wait!

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
Where are you even going to look?

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,870
We need a plan.

183
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,510
We need to know
where to start searching.

184
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,870
It's highly likely
Lu Yan is behind this.

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,390
Has anyone at the company
seen him recently?
