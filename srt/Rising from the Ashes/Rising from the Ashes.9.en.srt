(Wave After Wave)

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,030
Luo Wei,
why are you in such a hurry to see me?

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,710
Get in the car.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,240
I don't want to live

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
in the shadows anymore.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,070
Are you getting divorced or not?

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,840
You must give me an answer today.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,150
Otherwise, I won't mind
if things get ugly.

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,430
I have nothing to lose anymore.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,430
I should be asking you instead.
Xu Cheng told me you're pregnant.

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,520
But when I texted you,

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,120
you said you just gained weight.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,710
When did this happen?
You shouldn't keep it from me.

28
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,070
I...

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,680
I just want to give you a son.

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,840
Give me a son? How?

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,950
Listen.

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,510
I'm drowning in debt right now.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,950
But the doctor said

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,070
this is my last chance to be a mother.

35
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,920
I must keep this baby.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,870
Trust me.

37
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,200
Once I get money from Xu Cheng

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,070
and clear my debts,

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,430
I'll compensate you.

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,920
If I get a divorce now,

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
I can only take half of her assets.

42
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,430
That's not enough to cover my debts.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,950
But if I control her,

44
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,150
I can take everything from her.

45
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,430
Just be patient a little longer, okay?

46
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,070
But my mom

47
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,280
pressures me to get
an abortion every day.

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,070
And you and Xu Cheng
act like a lovely couple in front of me.

49
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,560
I really can't take it anymore.

50
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,510
All right.

51
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,280
I know.

52
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
(Han Lu, Nurse)
Please give me some more time.

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,700
(Han Lu, Nurse)

54
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,790
You hussy

55
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,470
seduced a married man!

56
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,470
What's this?

57
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,120
Tell me. What's this?

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,590
Uh...

59
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,590
Very good, Lu Yan.

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,150
I got pregnant before marrying you,

61
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,710
and you're cheating on me.

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,910
Calm yourself down.

63
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,960
It must be Xu Cheng's doing.

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Think about it.

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Only you and she have been in this car.

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
If it's not you,

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,080
she must've put it here on purpose.

68
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,120
I...

69
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,840
She must've figured out
something's going on between us.

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,590
She's trying to break us.

71
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,980
(Han Lu, Nurse)

72
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,940
(Han Lu, Nurse)

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Very good, scoundrel.

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,030
You're still lying to me.

75
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,280
Wei.

76
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,820
(Han Lu, Nurse)

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,750
Mom,

78
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,590
I've decided to divorce him.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Why divorce him all of a sudden?

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,710
This marriage

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,190
has been a lie since the beginning.

82
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,000
I did know something was off

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
about Lu Yan and Luo Wei.

84
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,310
If you really can't take it anymore,

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,750
divorce him.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,910
What about you?

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,710
Everyone can see

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,760
something's going on
between Third Aunt and Dad.

89
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,710
I'm too weak.

90
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,430
If not,

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,560
he wouldn't have been so brazen

92
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,270
as to bring them into the house

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,630
and slot his illegitimate son,
Jiang Yang,

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
into the company.

95
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,040
Illegitimate son...

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Coming.

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,560
Coming.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,390
Mom, don't tell anyone

99
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,510
about this.

100
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,920
Especially not Lu Yan.

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,240
Qin.

102
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Please take a look at this report.

103
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,040
Third Aunt, leave us.

104
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,430
All right.

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,430
The doctor said Mrs. Lu
is at risk of depression.

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,240
She needs treatment
as soon as possible.

107
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,260
(The preliminary check-up indicates
a possible state of depression.)

108
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,600
Mom,

109
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,430
if it weren't for Lu Hua,

110
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,830
you wouldn't be depressed at all.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,870
What are you thinking?

112
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,080
Are you going to continue
to live with him?

113
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,270
I'm already old.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,630
Perhaps

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
this is my fate.

116
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,750
I've been divorced once

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
before marrying him.

118
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,070
If I divorce again,

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,870
the villagers will tear me apart.

120
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,270
Half of my life is gone.

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
I might as well just settle.

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,630
You can't settle for this.

123
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,600
You should take control
of your own life.

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,270
Hello, Hua?

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,240
I bought you a coat.

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Have you tried it?

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
Does it fit?

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,070
You know what?

129
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,560
That brat brought a man home today.

130
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,630
All right. Don't worry. I'll be careful.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,160

I'll give my very best
to our collaboration.

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,480
Oh, right. I can't drink tonight.

138
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,430
My wife hasn't been doing well lately.

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
I need to take care of her later.

140
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,270
That's all.

141
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,630
Your relationship with your wife

142
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,270
is still as strong as ever
after so many years.

143
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,680
Back then,

144
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,270
I was just a poor lad from a village.

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,480
My wife never looked down on me

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,040
and always supported me quietly.

147
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,830
I thought to myself

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,070
that I'd give her
the best life possible.

149
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Now that I've run Baidi so well,

150
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,560
I think I've kept my promise to her.

151
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,000
There's only one thing I know.

152
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,600
A loving husband

153
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,190
must have a good character.

154
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,680
It's my pleasure

155
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,900
to work with your company.

156
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,760
Let's head to the company
to sign the contract

157
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,000
after having the meal.

158
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,190
Sure.

159
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,160
Lu Yan.

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, it's Ms. Xu.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,070
Why are you here, dear?

162
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,630
What's this?

163
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,480
Uh...

164
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,040
Dear, please hear me out.

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
We'll get a divorce.

166
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,870
After that,

167
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
you'll have nothing to do
with Xu Group.

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Dear.

169
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,750
Mr. Wang.

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
I think you're well aware

171
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,000
that I'm working with Xu Group,

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,310
not with you.

173
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,270
Dad,

174
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,560
I need you to come back right now.

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,510
Let's go, Ke.

176
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,000
Why are you picking her up
so early today?

177
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,190
Something came up.

178
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,480
Let's go. Say goodbye.

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,270
Goodbye, miss.

180
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,830
Goodbye, Ke.

181
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,430
Goodbye.

182
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,720
Let's go.

183
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
Where are we going, Grandpa?

184
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,070
Home.

185
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:30,510
Quick.

186
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,950
Come in.

187
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,200
Where is this, Grandpa?

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,030
Where's Mom?

189
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,910
Stay here.

190
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Look.

191
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,360
You can play or sleep if you like.

192
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,630
You'll be home later.

193
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,840
Grandpa, I want to go home.

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm your grandpa.

195
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,910
I won't hurt you.

196
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,550
Grandpa!

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,150
Grandpa!

198
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,440
Grandpa!

199
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,080
Grandpa!

200
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,320
I'll leave Ke here.

201
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,320
Keep an eye on her.

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't let her see you.

203
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,670
By the way,

204
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,480
Lu Yan will pick her up soon.

205
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,030
There's somewhere I need to be now.

206
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,750
The test results are out.

207
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
(Neurological Examination Report)

208
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,600
(Preliminary examination indicates
the patient in a normal state.)

209
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,270
Congrats, you've fully recovered.

210
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,720
That's great.

211
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,510
Lawyer Zhang has reviewed
all the evidence.

212
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,360
It's enough to prove
that Lu Yan cheated.

213
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,750
So if you divorce him,

214
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,750
you have a high chance of getting
Ke's custody.

215
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,720
Qin Mian,

216
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,480
thank you.

217
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
You don't need to thank me.

218
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you here to fetch Ke?

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,910
I came here for you.

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,840
I heard you and Xu Cheng
are getting divorced.

221
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,750
Guess I'll forgive you then.

222
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,320
What's wrong?

223
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,910
You're marrying me soon.

224
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,790
Are you unhappy?

225
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,030
Or

226
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
can you still not get over Xu Cheng?

227
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
Let's talk in the room.

228
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,910
What's wrong with you?

229
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,150
Was it you?

230
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
What?

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,750
Stop pretending. Those photos.

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Is it Dad?

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Yes, it was me.

234
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,240
So?

235
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,510
Why couldn't you listen to me
and hold on a little longer?

236
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,390
Hold on?

237
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
I've been holding on for years.

238
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,000
Listen up.

239
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,600
If I wanted to send those photos,
I would've done it long ago.

240
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,960
Why would I wait until now?

241
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,320
Now you're trying to stay away
from the blame now.

242
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,200
Have you been leeching off your wife
so long

243
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,960
that you've forgotten
what responsibility is?

244
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Seems like you've been living
too comfortably

245
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,320
and have forgotten who you really are.

246
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,750
Without me,
we'd still be farming in the village.

247
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
Lu Yan, you scoundrel!

248
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,480
I must've been blind to be with you.

249
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Fine, so you're turning against me now?

250
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,790
I'll tell Xu Cheng

251
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,360
how you drugged her

252
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,630
and drove her insane.

253
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,960
Weren't you in on this too?

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Fine. Go ahead and tell her

255
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,920
how her best friend
tampered with her meds

256
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,540
and landed her in the hospital,
nearly driving her to kill herself.

257
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,080
You're threatening me, huh?

258
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,790
What about the medical accident
three years ago?

259
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,910
Did you forget how I covered for you?

260
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,960
Fine, I won't argue with you.

261
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,750
Dad.

262
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,030
Wei.

263
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,910
Give me a little more time.

264
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
Once I settle everything,

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,870
I'll take you and the baby far away

266
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,550
and start a new life together.

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,720
Dad.

268
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,270
Dad.

269
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,000
Dad.

270
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Dad.

271
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,200
What's your plan after the divorce?

272
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,600
I want to fulfill Ke's wish.

273
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
What wish?

274
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,150
Once the divorce is finalized,
we're leaving.

275
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,960
(Jiangcheng to Iceland)
I've got the tickets ready.

276
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,120
You're going to Iceland?

277
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,000
