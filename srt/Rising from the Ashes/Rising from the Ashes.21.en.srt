(iPad logged in)

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,710
Why are you going through my WeChat?

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,750
You're still in touch with Wen Wan!

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,030
I guess old habits die hard, right?

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,110
Get out!

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,400
No, these are old messages.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,760
I said get out!

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,350
Wei! Listen to me...

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,040
Leave!

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,310
Wei.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
What do you want?

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,280
What makes you think
I would fall for Lu Yan?

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me put it this way.

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,000
I graduated from a top university.

30
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,840
I won countless scholarships.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,230
My father is the hospital director.

32
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,480
As for my looks,

33
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,350
I don't need to explain.

34
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,510
And Lu Yan?

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,430
He's divorced and has a kid.

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,120
Tell me.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,230
Why would I be interested in him?

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,070
What trick are you playing now?

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
No tricks.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,510
I just want you to see the truth.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,350
Get out! I said leave!

42
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,870
It's me, Wen Wan.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
You've won.

44
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,840
You won this gamble.

45
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,080
I wasn't trying to compete with you.

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,120
He doesn't love you.

47
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,560
But,

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,000
it doesn't mean he truly loves me either.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,430
What are you trying to say?

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,710
I already told you.

51
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,280
I just want you to see reality.

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,520
First,

53
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,840
I don't love Lu Yan.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,080
Secondly,

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,430
he's already looking for his next target.

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,030
Even if I turn him down,

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,870
he'll just find another girl.

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,630
Sooner or later, you'll be discarded.

59
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,750
Even if that's true,

60
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,150
why do you care?

61
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,150
You've been his mistress for years.

62
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,680
What has he done?

63
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,430
He moves on to the next woman
like nothing happened.

64
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,680
Are you really okay with his deception?

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,150
Aren't you going to think

66
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,120
about your own future?

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,630
Or perhaps

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
you want to end up

69
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,800
as a woman with nothing?

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,520
By the way, Wan.

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Have you ever wondered?

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,710
After all these years,

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,630
how does Wang Hao always
manage to find you?

74
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,240
I don't know.

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
I've moved several times.

76
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,100
I even changed
my phone number many times.

77
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
But somehow,

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,030
he always finds me.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,710
That day,

80
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Qin Mian actually pointed something out.

81
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,910
Is it possible

82
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,840
that he put a tracker on your phone?

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,470
I see.

84
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,030
I've used the same phone for years.

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,190
Right? Check it now.

86
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,000
Open the door before I tear it down.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,160
Ms. Xu.

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,680
What's wrong?

89
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,230
It's Wang Hao.

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,270
No, you can't...

91
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,180
You know what I'm capable of.

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,950
Why are you here?

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,800
Who was that guy
you were having dinner with?

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
A friend.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
A friend?

96
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,800
Funny, because he told me
he was your boyfriend.

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
Listen to me, Wan.

98
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,750
You'll never escape
from me in this lifetime.

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,750
Wan.

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm sorry, Wan.

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,430
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,000
You have to know.

103
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
No one loves you more than I do.

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,680
Wherever you are,

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,830
I'll always find you.

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,950
The police should be telling you that.

107
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,560
I already called them.

108
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,040
You should know how fast
the response time is in Jiangcheng.

109
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,480
I dare you to lay a finger on me.

110
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,390
You should know who I am.

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
And just so you know,

112
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,800
when I called the police,

113
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,680
I only reported illegal trespassing.

114
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,830
If you're still here in three minutes,

115
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll also sue you for assault.

116
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,870
I've already saved evidence
of you hitting me.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
If anything happens
to either of us today,

118
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,430
that's at least three years in jail.

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,390
Wan.

120
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Xu Cheng.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
It's over.

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Don't worry.

123
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,830
He'll never find you again.

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
It's okay now.

125
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,420
♪Your presence makes
this rainy scenery beautiful♪

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,630
You have no idea what kind of life

127
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,120
I had at the Xu family.

128
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,630
No alcohol

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,070
and no mahjong!

130
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,510
It was exasperating.

131
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,920
Exactly.

132
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Look how free you are now.

133
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,830
Dad.

134
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,270
This place is a mess.

135
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,480
Make sure to clean up.

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,070
Yeah, I got it.

137
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Cheers!

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,830
Come on, Hua.

139
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,510
Who's that?

140
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,750
Coming!

141
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,430
Hua.

142
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,430
Isn't this San,
the one head over heels for you?

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,970
She even followed you all the way here.

144
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,800
Hua, your charm is unreal.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
What do you want?

146
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
I have a wife.

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,560
We need to keep our distance.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
We wouldn't want people gossiping.

149
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,040
What does your wife have to do with me?

150
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,240
You!

151
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,160
You're acting like
a shameless scoundrel,

152
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,800
and now you're worried about gossip?

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Pay me the wages you owe me.

154
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,240
What wages?

155
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,680
I worked my fingers to the bone

156
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,340
at your house for that little bit of pay.

157
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,190
Otherwise,

158
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,870
did you think I was there
just to serve you?

159
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,870
You're not worthy!

160
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,600
Listen up.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,750
Get lost, now.

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,240
Or I'll call the cops on you.

163
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,600
Go ahead, call them!

164
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,160
You hired a housekeeper
and refused to pay her.

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
Let's see whether the cops
arrest you or me.

166
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,630
You're no different from a leech.

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,340
You live off
your daughter-in-law's family,

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
eating, drinking, and taking their money.

169
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,480
And now, you want to cheat me
out of my hard-earned wages?

170
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,480
Do you have no shame left?

171
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,830
You old parasite.

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,870
I'm warning you.

173
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,560
Give me my wages, now!

174
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,830
Fine, take it!

175
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm telling you.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,680
Once I pay you,
don't ever bother me again.

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
You?

178
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,200
You think I'd waste my time on you?

179
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,440
You were so easy to fool,

180
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,910
and treated my son with my ex-husband

181
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,790
as if he were your own.

182
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,840
But since you've been so generous,

183
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,390
when you die someday,

184
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,630
I'll make sure Jiang Yang
burns joss money for you.

185
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,390
You wretch!

186
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,550
What? Didn't expect to get hit
by a woman?

187
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm warning you!

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,840
