16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,960
Today, I've invited

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,880
several women from different age groups

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,110
for a discussion.

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,000
This will help us design
more precise beauty treatments.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Let's welcome them.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,840
Mrs. Lu?

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,120
But you became vegetative
after the car crash!

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
A car accident?

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,040
Who told you I was in a car accident?

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,950
It's a regular company meeting now,

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,950
if you have anything to say,
talk in private.

27

Lu Yan?

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,230
Didn't you tell me

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,120
you were terminally ill
and in the hospital?

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,040
Scoundrel.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,070
I must have been blind
to have fallen for you.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,310
I was a fool to have given you a loan!

33

to pay me back!

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,120
Unbelievable, Lu Yan.

36
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,150
You were with me

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,920
just to scam me out of money!

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,070
You told me you'd divorce Xu Cheng
and be with me.

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,230
Was that just another lie
to get my money?

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,430
No, Lu.

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,070
You lying piece of trash!

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
Lu Yan.

43
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,030
You went as far as to

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,560
curse me with a car crash over money?

45
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,430
We've been married for so many years.

Don't think I don't know.

Over the years, you've been
taking money from Xu Cheng's family

and investing in multiple companies.

These documents

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,910
could've fooled anyone else.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,000
But me?

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
Not a chance.

57
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,710
You see right through me.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,080
I was just joking.

Of course, this isn't all of it.

I've always appreciated

67

everything you've done for me.

68
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,990
The Lu family only had one son
in each generation.

69

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,120
of you bearing me a son.

72

could just live happily together,

73
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,080
that would be perfect.

74
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,310
Enough.

75
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,520
No point talking about that now.

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,430

you won't be left with nothing.

What do you mean?

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,280
Are you leaving me?

80
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
How could I bear to leave you?

81
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,400
It's just...

82
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,520

I need ten million yuan right now.

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,310
I embezzled company funds.

87

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360

89

This is serious.

91
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,720
Why didn't you tell me?

92
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,270
I didn't want you to worry.

93

Do you still remember this place?

I brought you here
when I was in college.

107
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,310
Yeah.

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,920
It was my first time
in such a fancy restaurant.

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,040
I was so nervous

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
when I sat right in this seat.

111
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,280
I didn't even know
how to use the utensils.

112

Watching you sit across from me,
so poised and confident,

113
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,270
I made a promise.

114
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,430
I promised to become someone like you.

115

for a trip down memory lane.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,830
Yes, I'm marrying Lu Yan.

124

I hope you will finalize
the divorce soon.

I'll make sure you get custody of Ke.

127
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,240
you get to decide
who gets custody of Ke?

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,430
You know exactly how things are
between Lu Yan and me.

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,630
He listens to me.

130

What's so funny?

131
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
You think he listens to you?

132
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,190
In all these years, when has he ever?

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
When he made you his mistress?

134
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,630
Or when he married me?

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't tell me both were your ideas.

136
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,430
The timing just wasn't right back then.

137
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,750
He'll make it up to me.

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
I hope you understand.

139
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,720
You can't force happiness.

140

Letting go is best for everyone.

141
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,360
You actually think the reason
I won't divorce him

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
is because I still love him?

143
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,870
Ridiculous.
