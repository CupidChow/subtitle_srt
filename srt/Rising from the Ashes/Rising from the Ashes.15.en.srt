It's hard not to fall for you.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,390

What is it?

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,560
You've been so busy lately.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,950
You don't even have time
to see me anymore.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,230
I've been on business trips
back to back.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,590
Besides, I'm in a meeting right now.

28
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,590
I need to hang up.

00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,640
Come on. We're going to the restaurant.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,760
I must know

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,510
which tramp Lu Yan is seeing.

38
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,280
Well, I have to cook lunch.

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,680
We'll go out for lunch.

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,480
But I want to eat at home.

41
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,430
You're my nanny.

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,790
Shouldn't you listen to my orders?

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,800
You can't put it like that.

are all in this together!

on a date with another woman.

54
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,750
She's already on her way there.

55
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,240
I haven't felt this relaxed
in a long time.

56
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,190
If you like it,

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,680
we can come back anytime.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,750
Sure.

59
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,360
Sorry.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,030
What is it?

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,080
Lu Yan,

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
Luo Wei already knows.

63
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,630
She's on her way there right now.

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Got it.

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,560
The environment here is quite nice.

66
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,080
It's getting late.
I don't want to delay your work.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Shall I take you home?

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
It's fine.

69
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,960
I happen to have the day off today.

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,840
What's wrong?

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,030
Do you have matters to attend to?

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,030
I just got a call about a meeting.

73
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,000
It's urgent.

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,190
I need to go.

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
It's all right.

76
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,750
If you need to leave, go ahead.

77
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,400
Sorry about this.

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,470
Let's meet again next time.

79
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,680
Excuse me.

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,600
Don't worry about it.

81
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,190
Check, please.

82
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,090
I'll pay.

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,030
Be careful!

84
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,800
Are you all right?
Did you hurt yourself?

90
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,080

91
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,680
You two have been fooling around
this whole time!

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,960
- It's not like that, Wei!
- That's not what happened, Wei!

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,516
I can explain.

94
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,240

or the baby anymore, is that it?

It's not that I don't want it.

154
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,240

We can't keep it.

156
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,750
I will give birth to this baby
no matter what!

157
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,680
The doctor already said
the baby is deformed.

158

If you insist on giving birth,

159
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,040
the baby won't survive,
and you might lose your life too.

to our baby, no matter what.

163
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:52,040
Wei. Have you thought things though?

164
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
You can't lose the baby.

165
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,310
But have you thought about yourself?

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,360
I can't lose you.

167
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,240
Don't worry.

168
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,360
We'll become a family very soon.

169
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
What are you doing here?

170
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,480
Visiting Wei, of course.

171
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,790
What? Here to pile on
my moment of weakness?

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,630
You're my husband.

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,600

174
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,030

175
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,910
about your child.

176
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,480
We've been married for years.

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,320
Is this really necessary?

178
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,550
Oh, you still remember we're married?

179
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,280
You got another woman pregnant,

180
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,630
and now you're accusing me
of kicking you while you're down?

181
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,480
I don't have the energy to argue
with you right now.

182
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
The fruit is for Wei.

183
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,630
Of course, I have something for you too.

184
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,030
I gave Dad a phone.

185
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,600
I found a recording on it

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,790
that might interest you.

187
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,670
It's my fault for letting you two down.
