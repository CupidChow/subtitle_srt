Your baby is fine.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,520
Your body is just weak right now.
You need to take good care of yourself.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,070
I'll ask my dad to prepare
some Chinese medicine for you.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Thanks for everything.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,840
No worries, it's what I should do.
Why did you come alone today?

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,350
Where's the baby's father?

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,200
The baby's father is busy with work,

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,230
so he didn't come.

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,790
Wen Wan, someone's looking for you.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I'll head over first.

(Ultrasound Diagnostic Report)

(What is he doing here?)

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,950
This is Ke's favorite toy.

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,760
She asked me to give it
to you in person.

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Thank Ke for me.

33
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,040
I'll take this.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,840
These flowers are for you.

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,640
Sorry. I'm not interested in flowers
from a married man.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
It's all right.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,430
It would be a waste

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,750
to throw these flowers away.

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,520
Why not you do me a favor
and accept them?

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,310
Please?

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
All right.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
You accepted my flowers.

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,630
Could you also accept me too?

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Sorry.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,430
Today's gift quota is full.

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,680
Maybe next time.

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,680
Dad.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
Lu Yan! Xu Cheng knows I have the girl!

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,800
What do I do?

51
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,520
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

52
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,400
Mr. Qin.

53
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,310
You needed to see me?

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,630
Who let you sit?

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,750
Answer me.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
Where is Lu Hua?

57
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,750
Uncle Lu?

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,910
How would I know

59
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,240
where he is?

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
Stop beating around the bush.

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,240
As if you wouldn't know
where your father is.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,030
Ms. Xu Cheng…

63
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,470
Please don't mess with me.

64
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,630
Uncle Lu isn't my father.

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,430
I'll ask you one last time.

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,560
Where is Lu Hua?

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't forget.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,470
I can let you in,
and I can kick you out.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,240
GPS shows we're five kilometers away.
Don't worry.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,030
We'll find Ke.

71
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,580
(Safe and sound)

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Dad.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,560
What is it now?

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,830
Where are you, Lu Yan?

75
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,070
I can't hold on anymore!

76
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,600
I've already sent someone to pick up Ke.
Also, stop calling me.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,200
If the Wen Group's
medical equipment deal falls through,

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,830
we'll both be chased by debt collectors
for the rest of our lives.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Ms. Wen! Are you all right?

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,830
Are you hurt?

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,960
Let me help you.

82
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,390
Easy there.

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Mr. Lu.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,270
Playing hero to rescue the beauty

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,920
and suddenly being so attentive.

86
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,830
What are you…

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not just being attentive.
I have business to discuss.

88
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,830
What business?

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,680
I heard that Director Wen wants to
purchase some medical equipment.

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,070
I have a friend abroad
with the right connections

91
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,720
and guaranteed low prices.

92
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,040
I want to discuss
a partnership with you.

93
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,240
You're well-informed.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,430
So

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,040
you're just here to talk business?

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,040
What else?

97
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,870
All right.

98
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,310
Are you free tomorrow night?

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,950
I'd like to take you out to dinner.

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,630
I'll

101
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,360
think about it.

102
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,510
Lu Hua!

103
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,960
You've got some nerve
showing your face here!

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
This is all your fault!

105
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,510
If you had paid back the money,

106
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,040
I wouldn't be constantly harassed
by debt collectors!

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Where is Ke?

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
What did our family do to deserve

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
such a selfish daughter-in-law like you?

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm asking you a question!

111
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,870
I don't know!

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,070
Jiang Yang is your biological son,
isn't he?

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

114
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,830
Do you need me to get a paternity test?

115
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,720
What exactly do you want?

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,630
You're being chased by debt collectors,

117
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,950
and Lu Yan hasn't even shown up.

118
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,560
Do you think he still cares about you?

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,750
Now you can't even live here anymore.
What's your plan from now on?

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
Are you going
to let yourself be homeless?

121
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,600
I…

122
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,360
Dad.

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,870
I can take you back to the villa.

124
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,000
You can stop hiding.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,680
I'll even give you an allowance.
You can spend it however you want.

126
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,640
You'd do that
out of the goodness of your heart?

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
Of course not.

128
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,480
My condition is that you tell me
where my daughter is.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
Let's go, Qin Mian.

130
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:21,720
Ms. Xu!

131
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,040
Fine.

132
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,510
I'll tell you where Ke is,

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
but you have to keep your word.

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
I want my old room.

135
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Deal.

136
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
Ms. Xu, I…

137
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,600
I've been looking for you.

138
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes.

139
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,270
What do you want?

140
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,040
Money.

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,680
Right.

142
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
I don't have any.

143
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,510
Whoever owes you money,
go after them for it,

144
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
or call the police.

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Got it.

146
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Mr. Lu.

147
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,360
We've been searching everywhere for you.

148
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
What are you guys doing here?

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,480
I told you guys
to ask my wife for the money.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Don't scare the child.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,750
Let's talk outside.

152
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's step outside, then.

153
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,720
Your mother is here!

154
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,440
Ke!

155
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,720
Mommy!

156
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm here. Mommy's here.

157
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm here. Mommy's here.

158
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,320
Baby,

159
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,270
you must've had such a hard time.

160
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,720
I missed you so much, Mommy.

161
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,320
But grandpa won't let me call you.

162
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,200
Mom.

163
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,080
Ke.

164
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
Can you answer my question?

165
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,750
On the day of the incident,

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
