Wei,

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,720
you see us together every day.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,190
Aren't you sick of it?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,750
Not at all.

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,190
I have a boyfriend, too.

21
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,040
Your boyfriend is like nonexistent.

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,360
Tell me what you think of the guy later.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,430
Chen.

24
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,680
Hi, Ms. Xu.

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,030
Hi, Dr. Lu.

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,080
Hi, Ms. Luo.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,480
Who is he?

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,640
I set a blind date for you.

29
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,360
Chen's my dad's PhD student.

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,640
He's now an associate professor
at a prestigious hospital.

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,480
He's young, promised, and reliable.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,030
He's also of age.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,870
Ms. Luo, it's our first meeting,
so I've prepared a small gift for you.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
I heard

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,430
you studied pharmacy
and are now working as a doctor.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
I hope

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,430
we'll have plenty to talk about.

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,920
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,320
You're thoughtful.

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,310
Dear,

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,080
what do you think?

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,790
Isn't he more reliable

43
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,670
than her boyfriend?

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,640
Right.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,790
Chen is a nice guy.

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,390
Chen took a few days off

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,200
when he knew he was going to meet you.

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,870
He also drove his car here.

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,590
He can give you a ride later.

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,180
(You have received a message.)

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,760
(I found a transaction of Lu Yan's.)

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
(Seven million was
transferred overseas.)

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,920
(He went on a business trip overseas
earlier this year.)

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,360
(I suspect he bought assets outside.
But I need more time to verify.)

55
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,990
The dishes will be served soon.

56
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,040
Let's raise our glasses.

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,510
Come.

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Come, Chen.

59
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,950
(You have a big appetite, Lu Yan.)

60
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,640
Wei's a little tipsy tonight.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
Give me a call

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
when you get home safely.

63
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,480
I will, Ms. Xu.

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,440
We're leaving, then.

65
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,080
Bye.

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,400
I told you to give me more time
to gather the money.

67
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,880
Stop calling me.

68
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,790
Come on.

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,230
Dear,

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,600
are you using my phone to buy something?

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Ke's insurance needs renewal.

72
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,550
By the way, dear,

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,080
I've tried to meet Qin Mian

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,790
but couldn't get an appointment.

75
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,830
You both are family friends.

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,230
Could you introduce me?

77
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,320
He just took over recently.

78
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,550
He's busy.

79
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,790
Arranging a meeting

80
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,760
shouldn't be a problem.

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,390
But

82
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,320
I think it's better
to prepare some gifts.

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,920
We haven't met for years, after all.

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,320
How about you reactivate
my bank account tomorrow?

85
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,230
We can set up a shared account
like before.

86
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,230
Yes, you're right.

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,390
Your condition

88
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,950
has improved a lot lately.

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,670
Tomorrow.

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,110
I'll go to the bank tomorrow.

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,950
Sure.

92
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,260
(Luo Wei: It's bad. Xu Cheng suddenly
wants to reactivate her account.)

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,590
Mom.

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,080
Mom.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Delivering a debt notice?

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,710
How dare you slander me for owing money?

97
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm just asking.

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,600
(Loan Agreement,
Lender: Wang Yuan, Recipient: Lu)

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,960
What place are you in to ask this?

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,150
Huh?

101
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:54,950
I...

102
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,910
Don't you dare!

103
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
If you raise your hand again,
I'll call the police.

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,200
Call the police?

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
You should go.

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,760
He might beat you.

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,150
You think you can walk over me?
Call the police?

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,440
Go ahead. Call the police.

109
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,150
Beat me then.

110
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,680
All you do is drink.

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,830
Let's go.

112
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,440
Where are you going?

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,120
Open the door.

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,390
Mom, listen to me.

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,150
You can't keep avoiding this.

116
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,470
Otherwise, it'll happen again and again.

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,560
If you hit me again,

118
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,270
I'll call the police as Cheng says.

119
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,560
I read online

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,470
that many women can't endure
domestic violence

121
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,350
and end up killing their husbands.

122
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,590
Even a rabbit bites when cornered.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,590
He's your husband. Why call the police?

124
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,390
Hua has a stomach situation,
and he drank.

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,510
I'll get him some medicine.

126
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,320
Third Aunt,

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,240
you're kind.

128
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,480
You're so concerned about a man
who abused his wife.

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,200
He might feel worse after drinking.

130
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,030
He must take medicine.

131
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,350
(She claims she's been suffering
domestic abuse for years,)

132
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,760
(but she shows no sympathy
for women in the same situation.)

133
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,560
(Something must be going on
between them.)

134
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Hua.

135
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,560
Hua.

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
- Take the meds.
- Call the police?

137
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,560
Go ahead and call the police.

138
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,560
- My waist!
- Third Sister.

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,030
Are you all right?

140
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,560
Where are you hurt? Let me see.

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,320
My stomach.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,950
I'm good.

143
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,350
It doesn't hurt.

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm drunk.

145
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,800
One moment.

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,270
Come.

147
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,000
Mom, it's tight here.

148
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,760
I'll adjust the seat.

149
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,710
(Is this really okay?)

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,590
(This is Xu Cheng's car.)

151
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,590
I feel like Lu Yan doesn't love me
as much anymore.

152
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,800
Did he

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
do something to hurt you?

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
I'll teach him a lesson.

155
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,640
It's my father-in-law.

156
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,760
He keeps nagging

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,180
that the Lu family has only had a son
for three generations.

158
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,880
But most importantly,

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,390
I know

160
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,710
that Lu Yan dreams of having a son.

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
