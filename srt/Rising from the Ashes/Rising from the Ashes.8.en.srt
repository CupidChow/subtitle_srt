(Retaliation)

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,320
Dear.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
Let's visit Luo Wei later.

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,320
She always comes over.
Why do you suddenly want to visit her?

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,150
She's pregnant.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,750
It can't be.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She must be kidding you.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,120
It's true.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
She has been quite close to Chen lately.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,680
But that's way too fast.

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,710
(She just met Chen last week.)

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,000
(That's impossible.)

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,150
Sure.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,400
When are we going?

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,710
No rush.

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,950
I'll find a suitable time.

31
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,070
We should buy some supplements for her.

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,480
Anything you say.

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,400
By the way, dear.

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,760
Is this a surprise for me?

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,200
This?

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,070
Wait.

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,640
I think I saw Luo Wei
wearing this before.

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,150
She probably left it here by accident

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,430
when she came over.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,120
It looks cheap.

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
I wouldn't bought
something like this for you.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Once I make more money,

43
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,590
I'll buy you something better.

44
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,430
Lu Yan, Xu.

45
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,350
The meal is ready.

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,640
You go first.

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,510
Why? Are you not feeling well?

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,030
I feel a little nauseous.

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,430
Perhaps I caught a cold.

50
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,280
I'll go downstairs to get you some meds.

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,910
No need. I'll just wash my face.

52
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,680
You go first.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll wait for you downstairs.

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
When do you have time?

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,560
I want you to go shopping with me.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,590
I've put on some weight lately.

57
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,000
None of my clothes fit anymore.

58
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,800
Are mistresses all good actresses?

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,910
Oh, right.

60
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,000
Shouldn't you pay her salary?

61
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,150
It's promised the 5th,
but it's already the 8th.

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
You hired her, you should pay her.

63
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,310
This is your house.

64
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,910
Why should I pay?

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,590
You're close to her, aren't you?

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
Isn't this your Third Sister?

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
Madwoman,

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
don't you get fresh with me.

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,800
You can't give birth to a son,

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
and now you're mental.

71
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,800
Lu Yan is a kind husband.

72
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,310
If I were him,

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
I would've thrown you
out of this house.

74
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,310
You should be the one
getting thrown out instead.

75
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,750
This is my house. I don't welcome you.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Pack up and go back to where you belong.

77
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,590
Lu Yan!

78
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,590
What again?

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,870
Look at her.

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,710
Look at your wife.

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,190
If we were back in our hometown,
I would've slapped her in the face.

82
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,870
Dad.

83
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,630
I still have money.
I can wait a few days.

84
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,400
Don't say anything.

85
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,430
I'd like to see

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,720
who calls the shots here, the father-in-law
or the daughter-in-law.

87
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,240
I already bought the ticket.

88
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,910
3 PM. Hard seat.

89
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,890
Transfer the money
for the ticket to me later.

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,070
Dear, you don't have to go this far.

91
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
We're family.

92
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,310
Besides, it's too rush

93
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,630
to send Dad back today.

94
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,430
Qin Mian wants to talk to you
this weekend.

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Dad, how about this?

96
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,270
I'll buy you a sleeper ticket.

97
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,560
You can go back

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,310
to visit your friends in the village.

99
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,870
I'll fetch you back a few days later.

100
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,630
All right?

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,950
Lu Yan,

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,040
is this how you treat your own dad?

103
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,040
Did you forget how hard

104
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
I raised you?

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,870
If you send me back now,

106
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,390
those in the village

107
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,630
will laugh at me.

108
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,190
Dad, it's not that I abandon you.

109
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,680
I just want you to pay them a visit.

110
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:55,830
Okay.

111
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,240
Fine.

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,630
Ying, pack our things. We'll leave.

113
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Mom,

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,240
who's going to take care of Ke
if you leave?

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
How about

116
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,800
you go back with me?

117
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
You're the one who demands a salary

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
and time off,

119
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,800
yet now you're taking her away.

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,870
Are you aiming for her money?

121
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,390
Xu Cheng...

122
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
I can't leave.

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,120
There are many mouths to feed.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,950
Third Aunt, you can stay.

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,920
But

126
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,870
since the most troublesome person
is leaving,

127
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
your salary will be cut in half.

128
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,160
You!

129
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,950
I wonder if Jiang Yang

130
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,240
is adapting well at the office.

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,510
Perhaps he should leave

132
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,510
after this month.

133
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,630
What do you say?

134
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,520
Are you coming with me to see Luo Wei,
or are you going to send your dad off?

135
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,480
Dad.

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,840
This is humiliating.
I can't be bothered to stay here.

137
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Exactly.

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,800
You're right.

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,510
Let's go.

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
Hua,

141
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,160
I really love you.

142
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,120
I'd follow you to the ends of the earth.

143
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,190
But...

144
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,160
What?

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
You're not coming with me?

146
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
I wish I could.

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,310
But the village is too remote

148
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,560
to receive my packages.

149
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,040
I have five more on the way,

150
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,870
so I have to stay.

151
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,560
But I...

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
There's Wi-Fi in every house
in the village.

153
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,120
Video call me if you miss me.

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,310
Hua, you should leave now.

155
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,510
Or you'll miss the train.

156
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,310
Go on.

157
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,070
Third Sister.

158
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
Hua.

159
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,600
Come back soon.

160
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,070
Coming.

161
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,800
Wei.

162
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,070
What brings you here?

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Why? Are we not welcome?

164
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,120
No.

165
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,720
I thought you were the delivery guy.

166
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,430
Xu Cheng said you're pregnant,

167
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,830
so we brought you some supplements.

168
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,240
How do you feel now?

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,430
Do you want Xu Cheng to ask the hospital
for some time off for you?

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,430
Pregnant?

171
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,390
Who told you that?

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
The entire hospital knows.

173
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,540
You were keeping it a secret from us.

174
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,280
Was this supposed
to be a surprise for us?

175
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
The entire hospital...

176
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,830
This is indeed a big surprise.

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
Since you're expecting,

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,430
you should stop eating takeout.

179
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,600
It's bad for your health.

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,510
When I was pregnant,

181
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,920
Lu Yan cooked for me every day.

182
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,510
By the way, dear,

183
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,160
do you have any cooking tips
to share with Wei?

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,310
Take your meal on time.

185
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,630
If you forget or skip meals,

186
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,390
you're only hurting yourself.

187
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
I left your meds here.

188
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Be good.

189
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,270
Here.

190
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
I'll go and take a shower.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Coming.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll go and get the takeout.

193
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Mom?

194
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,480
I've lived as a widow for 20 years.

195
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,630
I raised you all by myself

196
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,360
and made you into a decent person.

197
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,270
How could you do something
this shameful?

198
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm going to beat you.

199
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,270
Mrs. Luo.

200
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,360
The first three months are vulnerable.

201
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Wait, I...

202
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,030
Don't hurt her baby.

203
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,550
Mom.

204
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,390
Tell me.

205
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,790
Who's the father?

206
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,550
Wei.

207
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,150
Is it not Chen?

208
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,750
Is it your boyfriend?

209
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
I knew it.

210
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,670
This is a serious matter,
and he's acting like a coward.

211
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,750
How disappointing.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
Don't blame your mom.

213
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,510
She just wants to help you.

214
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,320
What are you doing, Xu Cheng?

215
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,150
No one knew I was pregnant.

216
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,790
Did you ask my mom to come here?

217
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,670
Yes.

218
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,080
I thought she could take care of you.

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,440
You!

220
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,390
You brought shame on yourself.

221
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,150
Let's go to the hospital.

222
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,910
No.

223
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,750
I want to keep the baby.

224
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,720
Mrs. Luo,

225
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,390
Wei had an abortion once.

226
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,120
The doctor said

227
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
it hurt her body,

228
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,100
and it would be hard for her
to get pregnant.

229
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,960
Now that she finally has a baby,

230
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,550
you should be more careful.

231
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,390
I don't care.

232
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,840
Come with me to the hospital.

233
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't want to.

234
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
Xu Cheng, how could you do this?

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
Luo Wei, calm down.

236
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,240
I can't believe you did this.

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,960
Are you all right?

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,670
You brought shame on me.

239
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,270
I'm not

240
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,480
that shameless Lu Hua.

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,270
Mrs. Luo,

242
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,480
Luo Wei isn't in a good state now.

243
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,870
Xu Cheng and I will head back first.

244
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Please take good care of her.

245
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,900
(You have received a new message.)

246
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
(I'm downstairs.
You have ten minutes. Come down.)

247
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,360
(I'm downstairs.)

248
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,670
(You have ten minutes.)

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
(Come down.)

250
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,240
Dear...

251
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,480
Dear, my head hurts.

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Can you give me a massage?

253
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,910
Sure.

254
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,390
Let me help.

255
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,630
Is it here?

256
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,750
Slowly.

257
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Who is texting you
in the middle of the night?

258
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,360
Are you going out?

259
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,150
No.

260
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,790
It's the hospital group chat.

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
It's already late. I'm not going out.

262
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,840
I'll go wash up and go to bed.

263
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,840
My shoulders.

264
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,750
That's enough. I'm getting sleepy.

265
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Go ahead and sleep.

266
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,360
Come.

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll wait for you.

268
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,000
Send me

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,790
