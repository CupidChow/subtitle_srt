00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,000
Wei!

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
Don't you want justice for your baby?

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,150
(Ultrasound Diagnostic Report)
This is your prenatal test report.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,470
All the indicators are normal.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,320
It was never a deformed fetus
like he claimed.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,110
If you take your life,

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,680
who will be held responsible
for the baby's death?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,640
This can't be… It can't be!

(Early intrauterine pregnancy.
Regular check-ups advised.)

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,560
My baby was normal…

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,760
The baby was completely fine…

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Why?

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,350
That baby was his too.

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,920
Why would he do this?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,310
Wei!

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,120
Wei!

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,480
Wei!

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Lu Yan proposed to me!

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Look!

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,710
Lu Yan moved fast.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,990
I don't care what the rules say.

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,310
When you guys get engaged,

38
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,570
I want to sit at the main table.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,310
When you get married,

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,150
I want to be your only bridesmaid.

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,790
I haven't even said yes to him yet.

42
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,880
He practically forced the ring
onto my finger.

43
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,630
There's still a long road ahead.

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,240
I need to take my time and test him.

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,710
What's wrong with your eyes?

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,870
The wind's too strong here.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm really happy for you.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Now that we've graduated,

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,630
so many couples have broken up.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,150
It's great that Lu Yan is proposing to you

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,380
at a time like this.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
If only

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,190
I could find a boyfriend
who loves me that much…

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
You're amazing.

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,080
You'll definitely find someone.

56
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,000
But if I get married,

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,910
I won't be able to be
your bridesmaid anymore.

58
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,840
See? You're not fooling me.

59
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,310
You're excited about marrying him.

60
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,840
Jiangcheng is so big.

61
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,240
I'd love to stay here forever.

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,000
You and Lu Yan are from
the same hometown.

63
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,280
If he can stay,

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
why can't you?

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,520
The pharmaceutical industry
is very competitive.

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,430
I'm worried I won't find a job
I'm happy with here.

67
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,470
Why don't you come work for Xu Group?

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,840
Really?

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,910
You're the best!

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,030
Have some self-respect, will you?

71
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,000
Wei.

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,240
You're the best friend I've ever had.

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I really hope

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,870
you'll stay by my side forever.

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,560
Do you think

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,080
I can become someone like you one day?

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Of course you can.

78
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,800
Luo Wei.

79
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,000
All these years,

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,910
you two stayed by my side,

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,150
scheming to steal everything

82
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,910
from me,

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
didn't you?

84
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,150
From Lu Yan's emotional manipulation

85
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,360
to you two drugging me together.

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
Did you ever stop to ask yourself

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
if this was truly what you wanted?

88
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,520
Or was it just Lu Yan imposing

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,000
his desires onto you?

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,630
When it comes to love,

91
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,910
everyone is blind.

92
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,390
Before, it was me.

93
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,870
Now, it's you.

94
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,600
It's your love that pushed you
into the abyss.

95
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,050
And it's your love
that dragged me down with you.

96
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,630
Are you all right?

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm fine.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,160
I won't let you off so easily.

99
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,390
So you're not allowed

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,970
to give up on yourself so easily either.

101
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,800
There's only hope if you're still alive.

102
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,000
Why did you come looking for her alone?

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
She's already at the end of her rope
because of Lu Yan.

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,460
What if she pulls you down with her?

105
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm still standing here, aren't I?

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,000
I mean,

107
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,560
if something happens to you,

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
how am I supposed to face your father?

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,390
I'm glad you're safe.

110
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,240
Wan.

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,000
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,430
Was there more

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,800
to that medical incident?

114
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,120
You seem… different.

115
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
If it were just a botched plastic surgery,

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
I wouldn't have tried to kill myself.

117
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,360
I honestly don't know

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,830
how I would've kept going

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,480
if you hadn't been there for me…

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,750
So, Xu Cheng,

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,270
promise me,

122
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,800
you have to make sure he falls.

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,270
I promise you.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,830
Lu Yan.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,480
How are things going with Luo Wei?

126
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,870
I heard she's drowning in debt

127
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,240
and hiding from loan sharks.

128
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,190
She's had so many abortions for you.

129
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,040
Is she even still able to have kids?

130
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,480
If you ask me,

131
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
you need to cut ties

132
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,680
with her as soon as possible.

133
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,750
Got it.

134
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,000
Lu Yan.

135
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,240
I heard your current girlfriend

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,920
is Director Wen's daughter.

137
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,510
My son really knows how to pick them!

138
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,390
You have to bring her

139
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,800
to meet me sometime.

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,070
I want to see
what Director Wen's daughter looks like.

141
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,040
Don't say anything. Turn around.

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,120
It's Lu Yan.

143
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,240
Hello?

144
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,750
Wan.

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,630
I haven't seen you all day.

146
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,510
Where did you go?

147
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000
I had something to do.

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,790
I went out with a friend.

149
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,390
So you're alone now?

150
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,200
Yes. Why?

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,030
No reason.

152
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,320
What's wrong, Lu Yan?

153
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,630
Director Wen,

154
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,840
today's consultation was excellent.

155
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,120
I learned so much from it.

156
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,910
You're too kind.

157
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,240
Hello, Director Wen.

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,670
Hello. Who are you?

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,510
My girlfriend was one of your patients.

160
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,030
I came by to thank you.

161
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,240
Brought you a little gift.

162
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
That's not necessary.

163
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
Sorry.

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,440
I meet so many people.

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,670
I don't quite remember.

166
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,030
This is my girlfriend.

167
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,510
Thanks to you,
her recovery has been going great.

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
What's funny is,
she has the same last name as you.

169
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,030
What a coincidence.

170
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,390
Sorry. I have to go now.

171
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,080
I briefly mentioned to my dad.

172
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,790
About the medical aesthetics equipment.

173
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,440
