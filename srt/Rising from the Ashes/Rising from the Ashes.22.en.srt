(Truth Revealed)

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,600
Well? Have you figured it out?

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,560
Go ahead. How do you want us
to work together?

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,920
Lu Yan's embezzlement of company funds

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,880
and illegal transfer of company assets
is already a crime.

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,430
But I couldn't find any evidence of it

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,840
in the company's accounts.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,600
I remember seeing

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,350
related transactions

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,870
in his personal computer account.

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,280
That could be

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,000
the smoking gun that exposes him.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
I need you to copy the files
onto this USB drive

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,810
and hand them over to me.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,590
All right.

30
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,510
What's your price?

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,640
Name it.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,280
Xu Cheng.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,870
Do you really think I'm doing all this
just for money?

35

(Copying project files

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,560
I'm back.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,840
I thought you weren't home.

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,680
Where else would I be?

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,310
I watched some dramas using your laptop.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,310
Close your eyes, Wei.

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,520
Do it.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
You can open them now.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,430
Wei,

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,750
will you marry me?

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
Ten years ago, it was you.

46
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,680
And now, it's still you.

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,350
I want to take care of you
for the rest of my life.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,470
Would you give me that chance?

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,120
There have been misunderstandings.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,710
I told you.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
I only got close to Wen Wan

52
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,560
because I wanted to convince the Wen Group
to purchase the medical equipment.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,960
I don't believe that excuse anymore.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,560
Just let me finish.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
But I didn't go through with it.

56
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,630
I didn't want to put you through
any more pain.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,630
That's why I asked her

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,960
to help me.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,710
Help you?

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,240
I want to transfer all the shares I hold

61
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,710
to you.

62
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,030
Her friend specializes
in this kind of thing.

63
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,190
(Stock Transfer Agreement)
I've transferred over 90% of my shares

64
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,280
to you.

65
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,150
That's everything I own.

66
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,360
Is this enough to prove my sincerity?

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,590
Wei.

68
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,280
I used to be a poor man with nothing.

69
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,120
No one wanted to bother with me.

70
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,030
Only you stood by me,

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,030
without complaint or regret.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm so grateful

73
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,560
and so touched.

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,560
I can't count on my dad.

75
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,280
My mom left me too soon.

76
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,910
You're the most important person to me

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,840
in this world.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,870
Marry me.

79
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,240
(He's actually willing)

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,390
(to give me what he cares
about the most, his money.)

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,830
(Does this mean he really loves me?)

82
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,950
Wait.

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,720
Let me double-check something.

84
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,070
She's not picking up.

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,000
Who's calling you so late?

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Spam call.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,510
By the way,

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,270
when I came in just now,

89
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
you seemed distracted.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,160
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,630
No, I'm fine.

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,070
That's good.

93
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,900
Tomorrow, I'll take you out
for a fancy meal,

94
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,920
then we'll go shopping

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,830
for wedding rings and a wedding dress.

96
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,240
After all, this is your first wedding.

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
It's important.

98
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,070
Lu Yan.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
What's wrong?

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,510
You don't look too happy.

101
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,950
Don't worry.

102
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
We'll always be together.

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,480
Lu Yan, I love you.

104
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,830
(Wei, don't blame me.)

105
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,800
(They left me no choice.)

106
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,190
Sorry.

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,070
The person you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

108
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,750
Please try again later.

109
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,360
I went to Luo Wei's house.

110
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,630
Her neighbor said she owes a huge debt

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,510
and is now hiding from loan sharks.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
No wonder he had the money
to buy back the house

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
and could even pay out 4 million.

114
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
Turns out it was Luo Wei's money.

115
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,630
Lu Yan must have tricked her

116
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,310
into signing those loan contracts.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
We had planned to use the files
from the USB against him,

118
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,510
but now…

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,390
There you guys are.

120
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,360
Mr. Qin, relax.

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm just here to have
a little chat with my wife.

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
With the way you're acting,

123
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,750
some might think she's your wife.

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,510
What's wrong?

125
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
Can't find Luo Wei?

126
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,240
You've lost.

127
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,120
I investigated
what you asked me to look into.

128
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,680
(Ultrasound Diagnostic Report)
I found the doctor

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,230
who diagnosed Luo Wei's baby as deformed.

130
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Lu Yan bribed him.

131
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,070
Then, he…

132
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,630
He lied.

133
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,070
The baby is in perfect health.

134
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,480
He didn't want Luo Wei to have the baby,

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,270
so he tricked her
into getting an abortion voluntarily.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,830
That animal!

137
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,480
Where is Luo Wei now?
Still no sign of her?

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,750
Loan sharks and the authorities

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,270
are both looking for her everywhere.

140
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,900
(Ultrasound Diagnostic Report)

141
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,480
Recently,

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,950
authorities busted

143
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,360
a major illegal cash-out operation.

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,430
The suspects are still on the run.

145
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,070
Police are working around the clock

146
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,040
to catch those responsible.

147
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,360
So he was just using me

148
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,270
all along.

149
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,560
I knew I'd find you here.

150
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
Our old hangout from back in school.

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,510
Stay away from me!

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
It wasn't my debt.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,870
So why should I have to repay it?

154
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,800
Why are you forcing me?

155
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,750
Save that explanation for the police.

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,510
You're all liars.

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,310
I won't trust anyone ever again.

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,870
There's nothing left for me

159
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,870
in this world.

160
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,360
Nothing!

161
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,190
