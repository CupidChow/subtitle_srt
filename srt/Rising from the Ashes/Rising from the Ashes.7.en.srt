16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,960
Hello, Mr. Ge.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,110
Here's the thing.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,960
Recently, my company's fund flow...

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,280
Hello?

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,110
Is the property mortgage necessary?

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,640
The house is my wife's
pre-marital asset,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,150
but we're legally married.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,230
Can't I really get a loan?

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,870
Your company is ridiculous!

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
(I've called a dozen places.)

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,320
(Is there really no way to get a loan?)

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,070
Hello, dear.

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,920
Nothing. I just want to ask you

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,000
if you've set up a meeting
with Mr. Qin for me.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,840
Yes, it's scheduled
for the day after tomorrow at 2 PM.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,310
Dear,

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm so grateful to have you.

33
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,680
You're my lucky star.

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,310
You're my husband.

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,510
This is what I should do.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,320
See you tonight.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Bye.

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,160
I'm planning to start
the divorce procedure.

39
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,310
We'll stay quiet for now.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Consult a lawyer for me.

41
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,240
Once we gather enough evidence,

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,840
we can maximize our chances

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
of securing Ke's custody.

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,710
Impressive.

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,080
You're back to your senses, Cheng.

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,960
Your smart brain is working again.

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,630
All right. I'll do as you say.

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
I'll fully support you.

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,240
Since I stopped the meds,

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,520
my mind has become clearer.

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,400
When I went back to check-up,
the doctor said

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,400
I should fully recover

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,750
in a month or two.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
In the meantime,

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,240
your health matters the most.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
You need a strong body
to fight this war.

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,310
When I got married,

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,400
many people told me

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,960
that Lu Yan was a social climber,

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,870
that our families were compatible,
and that I wouldn't be happy.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,590
But I didn't care.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,710
I truly believed

63
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,030
he would give me a family.

64
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,750
Turns out the dream shattered.

65
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,910
You still have Ke

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
and others who love you.

67
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,310
Finally, I got to meet you.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,630
I've arranged a few good doctors
for Xu Cheng.

69
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,470
I believe she'll recover soon.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
Thank you so much, Mr. Qin.

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,710
Mr. Qin, I'll cut right to the chase.

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,870
I came here as a favor to a friend
whom I've known for years.

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560
He hopes to know if the company

74
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,720
would consider purchasing
medical equipment from them.

75
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,080
Your friend wants to take charge
of the procurement projects?

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,120
Yes.

77
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,590
They can supply

78
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,910
the most advanced and
the largest scale medical equipment.

79
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,000
Everything will go through
proper procedures.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,790
They're willing to join
the bidding as well.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Have you ever worked on

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,870
overseas medical equipment projects?

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
My friends abroad

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
need to major upgrade
for their medical equipment.

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,720
If you're interested,

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,120
I can introduce you.

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,280
You and your friends can work on overseas
medical projects for the long term.

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,490
If things go well,
you could also consider immigrating.

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,870
I've always worked at Xu Group

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
and have never been involved

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,360
in overseas business.

92
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,800
Besides, my family is here.

93
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,120
I don't plan to immigrate for now.

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,630
That makes sense.

95
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,000
I heard you're a family man.

96
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,160
You live up to that.

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,270
But there's been some rumors
at the hospital lately.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,430
People say

99
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,430
you had a serious
medical accident before.

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,510
Mr. Qin, you said it yourself.
It's just rumors.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,310
If I were really involved
in something like this,

102
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
how would the company

103
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
still keep me around?

104
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,040
True.

105
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,120
Your friend

106
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,070
may fit for this project.

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,950
But I have one condition.

108
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,040
Go ahead.

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,240
You know

110
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,600
that we got to meet today
because of Xu Cheng.

111
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
So,

112
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,800
she must be the guarantor
of this project.

113
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,800
Of course.

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,830
Also, I believe my wife
will recover soon

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,430
with the treatments
from the doctors you recommended.

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,190
She definitely will.

117
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,680
There are two major medical corporations
in the city.

118
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,270
Besides Xu Group,

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,510
Wen Group

120
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,870
also has a large demand
for medical equipment.

121
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,950
You might want to look into it.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
Thank you for your advice, Mr. Qin.

123
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll thank you on behalf of my friend.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Don't mention it.

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,190
I had someone check

126
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,920
that Luo Wei has a maternity file
at the People's Hospital.

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,070
The report shows
she's six weeks pregnant.

128
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,360
I've sent the documents to your email.

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,120
All right.

130
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
(I knew she was pregnant.)

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,950
What's the problem with that?

132
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,120
Tell me.

133
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,240
I spent the money, and that's all.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,830
What's the point of asking?
It's only 80,000 yuan.

135
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,040
That's not a small figure.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
You think this is okay?

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I'll beat you.

138
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Mr. Xu.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
That's enough.

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't make a fuss about it.
Neighbors might see us.

141
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,310
Mrs. Xu, calm down.

142
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,920
Mr. Xu, calm down.

143
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,040
What's this all about?

144
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,510
Cheng.

145
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,920
Wei is such a nice girl.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
She should be the Lu family's

147
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,830
daughter-in-law.

148
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,390
Unlike someone

149
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,120
who never works
and is always fooling around outside.

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,430
That's enough, Mr. Xu.

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Who knows

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
if she's seeing some guy out there?

153
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,560
You live off me,
yet you still walk all over me.

154
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,320
Do you know that
I can give you everything,

155
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,630
but I can also take it all away?

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,800
What are you doing here?

157
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,510
I went to the sports day
in Ke's kindergarten,

158
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,390
and I sent her back.

159
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,510
All right.

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Mom, let's go.

161
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,630
Come.

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,320
Let's go inside.

163
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,870
Mom,

164
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,830
we won first place today.

165
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,950
Really?

166
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,950
But

167
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,870
I prefer playing games with you.

168
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm sorry, darling.

169
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
I wasn't

170
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,510
feeling well.

171
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,950
I couldn't win the game with you.

172
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,040
It's all right. I love you the most.

173
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,600
As long as we're together,

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm happy even if we don't win.

175
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,680
Good girl.

176
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,630
Do you want some cake?

177
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,870
This is Ke's favorite flavor, right?

178
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,670
Dear.

179
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Let's visit Luo Wei later.

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,270
She always comes over.

181
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,800
Why do you suddenly want to visit her?

182
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
She's pregnant.
