Mr. Lu,

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,119
isn't today your wedding anniversary?

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,399
Why are you here with me?

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,240
My wife is

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,840
always not in her right mind.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,280
She has no sense of romance.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,760
Dear,

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,310
happy fifth anniversary.

24
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,230
Five years ago, I had nothing.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
I could only afford to buy
a simple silver ring.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,590
For the rest of my life,

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,350
I'll make it up to you little by little.

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,280
Mr. Lu.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,480
It's really you, Mr. Lu.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,790
Come.

31
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,640
What a coincidence.

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,950
Let me introduce you.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
This is my wife, Xu Cheng.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Today is our fifth wedding anniversary.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,470
This is my student from last year, Lu.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Mrs. Lu, you're gorgeous.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,120
May I take a picture of you two?

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,430
Come on.

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
Lu, we're leaving.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,030
Well,

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
my friends are having dinner inside.

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,310
I'll go and join them.

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,910
Dear.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,840
Look. Don't you think tonight's moon

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,080
is beautiful?

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,870
You're a good-for-nothing.

47
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,400
You're a burden.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Go to hell, you psycho!

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
You die, and everyone will be free.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't you run.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't hurt my child.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
I'll fight you.

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,560
Dear.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,630
Mom!

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,430
Ke.

56
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,927
Ke, what's wrong?

57
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:05,367
What happened?

58
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,174
Let go.

59
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,310
Let go.

60
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,000
We're on vacation. Give us a break.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
You were fine before this.
Why are you sick after getting married?

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Did you get hurt, Yan?

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,310
Dear. Are you all right?

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:14,680
Dear.

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
You jinx!

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
Can you stop acting crazy?

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
Your madness is getting serious.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Stop it, Dad.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Dear, what has happened?

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
It's all right.

71
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,510
There, there.

72
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,630
I got this from the surveillance room.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,560
Dear.

74
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,000
Is this me?

75
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,240
Stop watching.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,160
It's all right.

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,120
I'm not a psycho.

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,830
Can you please not leave me?

79
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,630
Nothing's wrong with you.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Ke and I

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,750
will never leave you.

82
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,390
It's all right. There, there.

83
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,680
Our family will never be separated.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,830

of attempting suicide)

87

(Xu Group President fell into the water)
(on the bridge behind me.)

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,120
(We're told that the woman is Xu Cheng,
the president of Xu Group.)

(Sources suggest)

90
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,600
(she may have a mental illness.)

91
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,310
This madwoman is a trouble.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,430
Why did someone

93
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,560
save her?

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,270
She's still unconscious.

95
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,720
Don't be so mean.

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
She's always trying to kill herself.

97
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,830
We're not that blessed
to have a daughter-in-law like her.

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Divorce her. You have to divorce her.

99
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,000
I won't give up on Xu Cheng.

100
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,870
I'll stay by her side

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,120
for life.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,190
You!

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,310
How dare you?

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Why did you slap him?

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,680
- Don't beat him.
- Back to your senses already.

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Are you only satisfied

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,720
when this psycho kills us all

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,680
one day?

109
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,040
Dad, don't shout here.

110
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,830
We can talk outside.

111
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,390
Let's go out.

112
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll talk right here.

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,950
Let's go out.

114
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,560
I want her to listen. Why?

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,190
Dad, Xu Cheng needs rest.

116
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,160
Let's go out and talk.
Don't disturb her, please.

117
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,420
- Good morning, Dr. Lu.
- Good morning, Dr. Lu.

118
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,720
Happy birthday.

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm surprised you remembered.

121
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
You're welcome.

122
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,310
Your coffee is on your desk.

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,720
Dr. Lu,

124
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,480
I like the nose job you did for me.

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
My friend wants one too.

126
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,390
But it's hard to book an appointment
with you.

127
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,160
Is it possible for you to book her in?

128
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm sorry. Doctors here aren't allowed

129
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,310
to give private contacts to customers.

130
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,640
If you need an appointment,
you can go to the receptionist.

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,240
Dr. Lu is so hot.

132
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,070
But it's hard to make an appointment
with him.

133
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,510
That's exactly why
I need him to do mine.

134
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,310
How nice.

137
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,150
Mr. Lu,

138
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,270
when can I come over for dinner?

139
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,390
Anytime.

140
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
This place is

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
more exciting than my house.

142
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,750
I envy your wife.

143
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,910
She has a big diamond ring.

144
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,000
I bought it for you

145
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,390
in the first place.

146
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,080
Mr. Lu, are you serious?

147
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,150
Didn't her father help you a lot?

148
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you really want to divorce
your rich, obedient wife?

149
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,550
He helped me?

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,360
I earned everything myself.
It has nothing to do with anyone else.
