(Awakened)

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,560
Mr. Lu,

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,520
having an affair with you is too risky.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,320
I need to watch out for your wife
and her best friend.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,360
Your wife almost caught us
in your office last time.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,850
I'm surprised you managed to
alter the footage and cover it up.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,240
Nothing good is ever easy.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
It's reported

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,430
that Xu Cheng, the Xu Group's
president has stepped down

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,150
due to her body condition.

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,920
The new candidate has
yet to be announced.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,350
My father-in-law trusts me.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
My wife trusts me.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,560
The higher-ups also trust me.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,950
This seat is definitely mine.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Just wait.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,480
I'll give you what you deserve.

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,150
Look at that slim waist of yours.
Like a young lady.

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,430
You don't look your age.

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,590
Get out.

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,950
I'm two years older than Ying.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
Stop talking nonsense.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,870
Excuse me, does Mr. Lu Yan live here?

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,340
What's the matter?

39
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,120
Our company is celebrating
its anniversary.

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,140
We're here to deliver gifts
to our loyal clients.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
Do we have to pay?

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,350
Is this some kind of scam?

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,230
Mr. Lu is our loyal client.

44
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,040
This is free of charge.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,200
Free? Give it here then.

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
If so, we won't disturb you further.

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,310
Okay. Goodbye.

48
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,750
It's free.

49
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,360
Let me see.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
What is this?

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,030
Who are they?

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,870
Nothing.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's go.

54
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,750
Mom.

55
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
Granny.

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,080
You're home, Ke.

57
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,000
Free stuff is always disappointing.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,590
Why did you go to my house?

59
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,630
Didn't I tell you

60
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,840
I'd pay you back?

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
What do you want?

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,910
We came by to recognize faces.

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
You know how it works
with overseas casinos.

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,150
You have two weeks left.

65
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,710
If you don't settle your debt,

66
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,310
you know the consequences.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,470
What's it?

68
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,520
Mr. Lu,

69
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,870
I saw the new president's name
in the HR Department.

70
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,710
It's not you.

71
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,710
What?

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,150
Actually, I didn't tell you something.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
I think Lu Yan might be cheating on me.

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,910
And

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,960
I suspect he did something

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
to my medication.

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
I figured that much.

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,470
This is why I came back.

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,910
No rush.

80
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,310
We'll sort everything out.

81
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll help you.

82
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,310
If this is true,

83
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,240
I'll make sure he pays the price.

84
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,310
Your mental health hasn't
fully recovered yet.

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
If you divorce now,

86
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,280
you might lose custody of Ke.

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,870
I can't accept this!

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,780
I've been planning everything
for so long.

89
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,630
How could they let an outsider
take over it?

90
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,590
They don't respect me at all.

91
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,590
Are they trying to force my hand?

92
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,080
Calm down.

93
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,310
Don't do silly things.

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,360
If you can't be the president,

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,440
you can still aim
for vice director of the hospital.

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,800
Right?

97
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,910
What silly things will I do?

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
Taking Xu Cheng down with me?

99
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,590
Don't do that.

100
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,120
If anything happens to you,

101
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,360
what about me?

102
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't worry.

103
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,270
I won't die

104
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,800
until I take everything from Xu Cheng.

105
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,000
Dear.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,120
Why are you drunk?

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
Dear.

108
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,946
We had a gathering,

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,390
so I drank a bit.

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,360
But I'm not drunk.

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't worry about me.

112
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,510
As long as you're fine.

113
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,830
I just got back.

114
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,270
I had dinner with the new president.

115
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,390
The new president

116
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,800
is appointed?

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,510
I've been busy at the hospital.

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
I haven't heard anything about that.

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,680
It's a family friend, Qin Mian.

120
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
That's good.

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,600
A family friend is reliable.

122
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,240
Dear,

123
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
I think I've been not doing well lately.

124
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,360
Your madness acts up...

125
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,240
I mean, you're in a weak condition.

126
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,360
I have many surgeries.

127
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,160
I don't have time to look after you.

128
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,600
And I'll be

129
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,000
even busier.

130
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,950
I'm running for vice director
of the hospital.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,870
But

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,510
I heard the position
has already been taken.

133
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,040
It's Dr. Zhao.

134
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,390
Dr. Zhao?

135
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,630
Is Dr. Zhao your husband?

136
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,560
Why are you helping outsiders?

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,070
As if you're not.

138
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,920
What were you doing
in Third Aunt's room

139
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,270
in the middle of the night?

140
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430
We were

141
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
learning English.

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,390
A, b,

143
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,950
c.

144
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,950
(Meng Hui Kindergarten)

145
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
Hello, dear. Yes?

146
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,680
Dear,

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,190
are you free to pick up Ke
this afternoon?

148
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,040
I have two surgeries.

149
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,870
I can't leave.

150
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,920
Why? Where are you going this afternoon?

151
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,870
It's fine. You better
get back to your work.

152
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,920
I'll ask someone else.

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,830
Wei,

154
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,430
are you free at 3:30 PM later?

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,430
Yes. Why?

156
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,040
Can you drive my car to pick up Ke?

157
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,750
I have a meeting in Qincheng.

158
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,240
I can't make it back tonight.

159
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,680
What about Lu Yan?

160
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,240
He's busy.

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,720
You're the only one I can ask.

162
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,750
No problem. Leave it to me.

163
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,070
Good. I'll treat you to a meal later.

164
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll make you pay big time.

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Not only do I have to be your mistress,

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
but also Ke's mom.

167
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,040
Xu Cheng went to Qincheng
and won't be back tonight.

168
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,360
Got it.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,480
Come, Ke.

170
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,390
Good girl.

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,800
Hello?

172
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,120
Your phone's location
has been changed to Qincheng.

173
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,950
Ke,

174
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,160
I came all the way to fetch you

175
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,750
and brought you some delicious treats.

176
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,040
What should you say?

177
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

178
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
That's not right, Ke.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
You should say, "Thank you, Mom."

180
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,320
But I have a mother.

181
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm your mom's good friend,

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
and I like you very much.

183
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
You don't look like

184
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,240
Mom at all.

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,960
But you smell

186
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,030
just like Mom today.

187
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,080
Ke,

188
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,200
from now on, I'll be your mom.

189
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,440
The neighborhood organized
a Mother's Day event.

191
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Kids are asked to film a video
with their mothers.

192
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,440
You weren't home,

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
so I had to put on your clothes

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,390
for this.

195
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,440
It can be done in a few minutes.

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,720
She took a shower and changed clothes,

197
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
but didn't get to film the video.

198
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
You haven't been resting well lately.

199
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
You need to take your meds.
Take your meds.

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,320
Ke, I'm your mom.

201
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I saw the bed was messy

202
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,270
when I entered the room.

203
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,510
I thought Lu Yan was cheating.

204
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,550
Luckily, it's you.

205
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,150
Yes, luckily, it's me.

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
Why are you back all of a sudden?
Weren't you in a meeting?

207
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,550
I was on my way

208
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,910
when they moved it online.

209
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,440
I rushed back

210
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
and left my phone in Qin Mian's car.

211
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,240
All right.

212
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
I'll get changed and head back.

213
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,510
Don't forget to treat me to a nice meal.

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,720
Sure.

215
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
(I'll make everyone who betrayed me)

216
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,750
