00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,070
Are you ready yet?

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,390
Mom.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,920
Cheng.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,070
I don't want to live with him anymore.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
No matter where he goes,

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,710
I don't want to follow him.

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,560
Are you sure about this?

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Of course, she's my wife.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,570
You think she'll live with you?

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,310
Mom.

26
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,590
Lu Yan and I will go
our separate ways one day.

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm going

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,480
to take Ke abroad soon.

29
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,870
Won't you come with us?

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,590
Why should my wife go with you?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who do you think you are?

32
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,680
Ying.

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,790
You better think carefully about this.

34
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,790
You're not getting any younger.

35
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,370
You really think getting a divorce now

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,590
and relying on an outsider
is a smart move?

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
When you're old
and can't take care of yourself,

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,390
it's still going to be your spouse
looking after you.

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,280
Shut up.

40
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,690
She'll be lucky
if she doesn't have to take care of you.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,710
You…

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
Yes, you're right.

43
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,230
Yes.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,310
I was wrong before.

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,710
But we've been together
for most of our lives.

46
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,840
Is this really worth tearing
everything apart over?

47
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,280
Come home with me.

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,680
Come on!

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
Come on!

50
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,950
Mom.

51
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,760
Mom, think it over carefully.

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,310
What's got you
making such a serious face?

53
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,240
Nothing.

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,590
You're here. Sit.

55
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,710
I have good news for you.

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,430
What is it?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,680
My dad's friends run
a few beauty clinics,

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,490
and they're looking
to buy medical equipment.

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,800
It's not a huge order volume,

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,590
but it's still a profitable deal.

61
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,430
What will it take for him to help me?

62
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,120
Qingcheng Mountain.

63
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,520
(Qingcheng Mountain)
My dad's on vacation here now.

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,080
He won't help just anyone,

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,840
but I'm sure he'll do it

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
for his son-in-law.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,800
I know you and Xu Cheng
aren't divorced yet.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,080
All you have to do is fake a proposal
to me in front of him

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,630
to put his mind at ease.

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,190
Then this deal will probably go through.

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,840
But there's one condition.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
Once you propose to me,

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,570
you need to divorce her
as soon as you can.

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,310
OK. I promise.

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,190
Oh, right.

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,710
I have a surprise for you too.

77
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,710
I'm here. Where are you?

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,870
5666. I left the door unlocked.

79
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,430
(Surprise?)

80
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,800
(Well, I have a big one for you too.)

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,910
(Lu Yan, everything you made me
suffer through,)

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,840
(I'll return it a hundred,
a thousand times over.)

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,590
Lu Yan?

84
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Lu Yan?

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,400
Why are you here?

86
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,840
Why wouldn't I be here?

87
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,120
You don't own this hotel.

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,430
I can stay here if I want.

89
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,390
Run! Lu Yan's onto us!
Don't worry about me!

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,630
Give that back!

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,680
Do you want to go to prison
with your criminal son?

92
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,190
You wench!

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,950
How dare you pretend to be
Director Wen's daughter to fool my son!

94
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,340
Did you think the Lu family
would be that easy to mess with?

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,720
(I put the USB drive
in the safe in the living room bookcase.)

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,310
(The password is 1226.)

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,310
(Now I finally see what kind of man)

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
(I've loved)

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,830
(all these years.)

100
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,560
(I'm sorry, Xu Cheng.)

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,310
(I'll pay the price for everything)

102
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,720
(I've done.)

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,870
Hand it over.

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,950
(What is he doing here?)

105
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,390
(Didn't Wen Wan lead him
to Qingcheng Mountain?)

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Stop while you still can.

107
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,160
You're committing a crime.

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
I underestimated you.

109
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,750
Did you really think I stayed
by your side all these years

110
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,070
because I wanted to?

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
You've been living off

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
my care and affection,

113
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,870
acting so superior
and self-righteous every single day.

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,990
Did you ever once think
about how I felt?

115
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,000
Hand it over.

116
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,470
And that's your excuse
for committing these crimes?

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,360
You feel wronged

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,560
because you chose
to suppress your true nature

119
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
to maintain a perfect image.

120
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,240
You know exactly why you approached me,

121
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,240
and why you've been pretending to be
a good husband and father

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,510
all these years.

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,390
Hand it over.

124
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,190
Not a chance!

125
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,510
Give it to me!

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,800
Lu Yan…

127
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Let go!

128
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,510
Are you all right?

129
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,830
Are you hurt?

130
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,630
I'm fine.

131
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,950
Mom.

132
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,190
Did you get what I asked you to find?

133
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Mom.

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
I need you to do me a favor.

135
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,160
What is it?

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,920
Play along with me.

137
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,430
I never imagined Lu Yan
would have such a twisted nature.

138
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
That poor girl, Wen Wan.

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,300
(Wen Wan)

140
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
Wan.

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,780
Lu Yan knows everything.
Get out of there!

142
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm safe. How about you?

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm fine. Get out of there!

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,430
Why did you lie to me?

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,390
Why would you become someone's mistress?

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,830
I loved you so much,

147
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,040
and this is how you treat me?

148
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,950
Wan!

149
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,460
(Xu Cheng)

150
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,270
I'm taking Wen Wan with me.

151
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,630
Stop wasting your time.

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
You won't find her.

153
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,750
I sent Wen Wan a video.

154
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
It's censored,

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
but you'll understand what it means.

156
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,980
The legal representative
has already been changed.

157
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm not the debtor anymore.

158
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
You can look it up online.

159
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,390
Stop harassing me!

160
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Sue me?

161
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,240
Go ahead.

162
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,070
Let's see who the court
rules in favor of.

163
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,310
What are you doing, Wang Hao?

164
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,430
I've already talked it out with Wen Wan.

165
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
There's nothing between us anymore.

166
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,490
I'm leaving on
an afternoon flight today.

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
I'll never come back.

168
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,260
(Luo Wei)

169
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,390
You don't have to do this.

170
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,870
You'll keep your mouth shut

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
if you want to live.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Don't be reckless, Wang Hao.

173
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,600
There are cameras everywhere
at Rongcheng Hotel.

174
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,000
Wang Hao.

175
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,790
Where are you taking me?

176
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,030
There are no cameras here.

177
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,390
Calm down.

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,790
What happened between me and Wen Wan
is a misunderstanding…

179
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,240
She doesn't love me at all.

180
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
I don't love either.

181
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,390
Don't worry.

182
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,630
My flight's at 4 PM.

183
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,710
I'll be gone from your sight.

184
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,790
You don't love her?

185
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,320
Of course, I don't.

186
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,910
You're scum!

187
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,630
Wait! Wait…

188
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,630
I have four million right here.

189
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,840
You can have all of it.

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,870
Wen Wan's yours too.

191
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,440
You've been in jail, right?

192
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,080
Use this money to buy a house.

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,790
You can use it to live a good life

194
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,870
with Wen Wan.

195
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
You're not going anywhere!

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,790
Even if I have to die,

197
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,160
I'll make sure you go down with me!

198
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,390
Lu Yan, are you all right?

199
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,320
Wei…

200
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,870
Wei…

201
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm feeling lightheaded…

202
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,870
I can't breathe…

203
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,750
Let's get you over there to rest.

204
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,030
Lu Yan.

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,510
Do you remember
when we first started university?

206
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,790
Everyone looked down on me,

207
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,630
mocked me for coming from a small town.

208
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,840
But you never did.

209
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,790
You told me I was pretty.

210
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,870
You took me to get facials,

211
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,390
bought me pretty clothes and handbags.

212
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,670
I knew they were all fakes,

213
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,440
but you were spending
all your living expenses on me.

214
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,240
You even ate nothing

215
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,440
but steamed buns for a month
just to buy me those shoes

216
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,200
I'm wearing now.

217
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,550
You said

218
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,630
I was prettier than all the city girls.

219
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,510
You said one day
you'd let me live in a big house.

220
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,030
That's when I swore

221
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,270
I'd stay with you
for the rest of my life.

222
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm not feeling so good…

223
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,270
Can you take me to the hospital first?

224
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,120
Do you know the things
those debt collectors do?

225
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,510
If you treated me like you used to,

226
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,390
maybe I could help you
pay off your debts.

227
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,670
But why did you have to manipulate me?

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,150
You knew

229
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,960
it was my last chance to be a mother.

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,150
You knew how much I wanted that child.

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,630
Did you even think about me
for one second

232
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
when you made me have that abortion?

233
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,320
Lu Yan.

234
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,030
Do you remember what you said to me?

235
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,510
You said

236
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,240
we'd be together forever.
