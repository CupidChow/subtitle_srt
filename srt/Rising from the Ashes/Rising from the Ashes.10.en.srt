(Blind Daughter)

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,750
Ke!

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,350
Ke!

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,430
- Hurry.
- Ke!

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,390
Sorry.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,480
The child has a head injury.
Now, her eyes are sensitive to light.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,350
The initial assessment

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
suggests that her blindness
is caused by a blood clot in her brain.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,710
We need to continue to
monitor her condition.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Thank you.

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,070
What does such a misfortune fall on us?

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,230
Ke.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,590
Hua, don't be sad.

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,590
Don't be sad.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,710
Ke was supposed to be in class.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,920
Why did she fall for no reason?

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,920
There was a school event,

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
so students left early.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,040
I had some free time,
so I picked her up.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,480
You!

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,840
She was being naughty
and running around at home

36
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,510
and ended up falling.

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,350
What do you mean?

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,950
I looked after the girl
out of kind intentions.

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,230
And now it's my fault?

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Ke left school early...

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,950
I see.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,240
How can you call yourself a mother?

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,150
You didn't even know Ke
would leave school early

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,350
due to a school event.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,790
If you weren't messing around
with some man,

46
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,840
this wouldn't have happened to her.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,430
Watch your words.

48
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,750
I speak as I like.

49
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,430
Hua.

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,910
You!

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,630
That's enough.

52
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,360
Let's leave.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Dad.

54
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,520
You two...

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
Dad,

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,190
what's Ke's condition now?

57
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,960
She's blind.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,150
Really?

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
Could it be a misdiagnosis?

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
Should we take her

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,150
to another hospital?

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,030
Stay calm first.

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,630
Xu Cheng didn't know

64
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Ke was at your house when she fell.

65
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,960
Don't give yourself away.

66
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,750
You were there, so why didn't you send
Ke to the hospital in time?

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,080
If Xu Cheng finds out that Luo Wei and I
were the ones who brought Ke in,

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
what do you think she'll do?

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,190
True.

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,100
But it's a shame.

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,910
If I had gotten Ke here
ten minutes earlier,

72
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,560
she wouldn't have lost her sight.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Mr. Lu,

74
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
what's that supposed to be?

75
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,240
Are you saying

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,630
that if we had taken her in right away,

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,680
she wouldn't be blind?

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
(Crap, the surveillance camera.)

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
Where are you doing?

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,750
Maybe this is her fate.

81
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,630
Enough. So what if she's blind?

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,630
Maybe

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,750
it still can be cured, right?

84
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,750
Mom,

85
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,080
my teacher said auroras

86
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,120
are spilled paint from the immortals

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,840
when they try to paint.

88
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,400
That's why the sky is full of colors.

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,750
Do you want to see auroras?

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,150
I love colorful skies.

91
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,910
All right. I'll take you
to see it one day,

92
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,470
okay?

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
(Wait.)

94
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,120
(Why did Lu Hua suddenly come back?)

95
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
Where are you going?

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,950
Home.

97
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,040
I knew something was off.

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,870
The camera is broken today.

99
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,430
So you suspect Ke didn't return home

100
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,560
and it concerns Lu Yan?

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,920
Everything about this marriage

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
has made me suspicious.

103
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,830
Ke has such beautiful eyes.

104
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,160
She's curious about this world.

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
We haven't watched auroras yet.

106
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,720
Think on the bright side.

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,070
I know many

108
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,950
famous ophthalmologists overseas.

109
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,750
I'll find the best treatment

110
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,600
to cure Ke's eyesight.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,270
All right.

112
00:05:36,174 --> 00:05:38,980
(Inpatient Department)

113
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,720
Excuse me.

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
Where is the ophthalmology ward?

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Go straight, turn right, and go up
to the third floor.

116
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,480
Thank you.

117
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,680
Dear,

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
how's Ke today?

119
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,510
She's sleeping. Please leave.

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,630
I know

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,780
you're heartbroken about
what happened to Ke.

122
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,750
She's my child too.

123
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,560
I feel the same way you do.

124
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,600
She was fine before I left the house.

125
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Why did something bad happen to her
after your dad showed up?

126
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,950
Isn't he back in his hometown?

127
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,280
Why did he suddenly come
to pick up Ke from school?

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,720
He's been in the village
since you sent him away.

129
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,510
He missed Ke, so he went to pick her up.

130
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,630
It's understandable.

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920
Is it?

132
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,190
Is this really a coincidence?

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
What are you getting at, dear?

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Do you think my dad and I

135
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,720
deliberately hurt Ke?

136
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,510
Yes,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,830
we're having conflicts.

138
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,160
You resent me, and I get that.

139
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,270
But you've seen

140
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,720
how much I love Ke over the years.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,270
Love?

142
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,270
Does your love for her

143
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,920
mean giving her a little brother?

144
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Dear,

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
please hear me out.

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,950
Hear you out?

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,560
Tonight is the last dose.

148
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
It's over after that.

149
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,920
Has Ke been

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,830
eating well lately?

151
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,070
Yes.

152
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,120
But she can't sleep well.

153
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,240
All right. I'll bring the medication...

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,270
Hurry up.

155
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,240
Director Wen has been looking for you.

156
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,630
Dad is so annoying.

157
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,776
(Wen Wan)

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,160
(There are two medical corporations
in the city.)

159
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,600
(Wen Group also has a large demand
for medical equipment.)

160
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,950
I got everything you asked for.

161
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,430
I also bought her some sensory toys
to keep her entertained.

162
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,510
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

163
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,160
You care so much about my girl.

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,390
Of course.

165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,190
Dear,

166
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,360
you must be tired these days.

167
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll take care of Ke tonight.

168
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,920
You can go home.

169
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,160
No need.

170
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,750
Hello?

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,270

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,830
