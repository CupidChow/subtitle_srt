(Four Rings)

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,000
Whatever Lu Yan has in the future,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Yang will have too.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,790
I didn't know
you had a younger brother, Lu Yan.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,000
What exactly do you want?

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
You're an adult.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,840
Keep your emotions in check.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,390
Give my regards to Wei.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm hungry. Make me some noodles.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,200
I'll cook for you
after I cut fruit for Ke.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
I can't get you to do things now, huh?

26
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,040
Dad.

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,120
Ms. Xu.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,310
What were you doing?

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Nothing.

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,950
I was hungry.

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,790
I asked your mother
to make me some noodles.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,480
Ke just finished her bath.

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,430
Mom will be going upstairs to dress her.

34
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,590
Do you need something?

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,280
Nothing.

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,040
She can cook for me after she's done.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
After that, she's going out with me.

38
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,400
You seem pretty free, though.

39
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,230
What do you mean?

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,600
You want me to cook for myself?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,900
I was thinking of giving you more money.

42
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,960
But it seems like
you're not that happy living here.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,780
Maybe you'd like to go back
to your old house?

44
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,840
No, no…

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm happy. Who said I'm not happy?

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
I just don't know how to cook noodles.

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,590
But it's fine.

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,800
There are tutorial videos.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,840
I think I can figure it out.

50
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,280
All right.

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,430
Let's go, Mom.

52
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:35,258
Add the right amount of boiling water.
Season with soy sauce and oyster sauce.

53
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:38,189
Add eggs and some bok choy.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,920
This will make
your tomato and egg noodles

55
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,272
a hit with the family.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
I heard that Lu Yan pressured you
into having an abortion.

57
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
How are you doing?

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Sorry to disappoint you,

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,190
but I've recovered well.

60
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,870
I'm not here

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
to argue with you.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
Then what do you want?

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,590
The diamond ring on your hand.

64
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
Lu Yan gave it to you, right?

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,240
Lu Yan said that

66
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,470
whatever you have, I'll have too.

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,240
Don't get too smug too soon.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
The one

69
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,360
who isn't loved

70
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,470
is the homewrecker.

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
He's given the same ring

72
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,870
to many women.

73
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,198
Wei.

74
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,430
I knew

75
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,470
you've been seducing Lu Yan.

76
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,360
But I know him well.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
He's just toying with you.

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,240
If I hadn't been putting

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
so much pressure on him lately,

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,870
he would've never given you
any attention.

81
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,800
If a certain someone thinks

82
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,240
this is enough

83
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,870
to break our relationship
of over ten years,

84
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,470
then she's sorely mistaken.

85
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,680
We've been together since last year.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,190
Out of all the rings,

87
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,560
only mine is real.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Of course,

89
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,240
it's not because he loves me.

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
Part of it is because
of my family's status.

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,160
The other part is because

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm his wife.

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
It's just a ring.

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,510
Even if it's fake, so what?

95
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,870
Don't you get it?

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,950
Lu Yan will never marry a woman

97
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,720
who brings him no benefit.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Even if we divorce,

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
you still won't get your turn.

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
You've seen how he's treated me
over the years.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,240
You know better than anyone.

102
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,120
You know so many of his secrets.

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Do you think he'll let you go
that easily?

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Suit yourself.

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Why did the company fire me?

106
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,600
Fire you?
I don't know anything about that.

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,510
You don't know?

108
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,000
Xu Cheng,
who else could've fired me but you?

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
It wasn't me.

110
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,920
It was Lu Yan, wasn't it?

111
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:38,040
He knows everything?

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,270
Xu Cheng, tell me where he is.

113
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,070
Tell me!

114
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,070
He's at Jiahua Hotel.

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't do anything rash!

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,830
Oh, right.

117
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Xu Cheng has a membership card here.

118
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,430
I brought it for you.

119
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,480
Order whatever you want.

120
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Hua,

121
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,630
if I had known following you

122
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,430
would lead to such a good life,

123
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,560
I would've left the countryside
to find you much earlier.

124
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
We've got a long future ahead.

125
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,310
Where did you come from?

126
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,390
You scared me!

127
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,680
Dad,

128
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,120
I don't care what's going on
between you and Third Aunt.

129
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,120
But why did you

130
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,390
put Jiang Yang in my company?

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,390
We come from the same village.

132
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,340
It's only right
that we look out for each other.

133
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,630
Besides,

134
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,000
with my relationship with San,

135
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
I should take extra care of him.

136
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,310
Were you helping a fellow villager

137
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,240
or your illegitimate son?

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,630
How did you know?

139
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,630
If Jiang Yang

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
hadn't tipped off Xu Cheng,

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,120
Xu Cheng wouldn't have found Ke.

142
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,680
If she couldn't find Ke,
she would've had to pay back the money.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
We wouldn't have had to use
my money or your house

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,390
to repay the debt.

145
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,070
But now, we've lost everything.
Happy now?

146
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,070
I told you.

147
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,310
Jiang Yang is still young.
He doesn't know any better.

148
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,040
He'll understand when he grows up.

149
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm a board member of the company.
I already fired him.

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,000
What gives you the right to fire my son?
My son is honest and hardworking.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
He's been working his heart out
for the company.

152
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
What makes you think
you can just fire him?

153
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,240
Explain yourself!

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,870
Let me talk to him, San.

155
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,720
Lu Yan, you can't be so ruthless!

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
No matter what,

157
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,120
she's going to be your stepmother.

158
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,200
Dad, are you out of your mind?

159
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,560
You're living off a woman!
What are you acting so smug about?

160
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
Without Xu Cheng,

161
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,000
you'd be nothing!

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Enough, enough…

163
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,870
Stop fighting.

164
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,120
We're all family here…

165
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,870
Lu!

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
It wasn't enough to fire me,

167
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,750
but you're bullying my mom too?
Let's see if I don't…

168
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,390
Stop!

169
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,270
Yang!

170
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,270
I told you…

171
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,320
No…

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,510
What should we do now?

173
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Yang! Wake up!

174
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,270
To the hospital!

175
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,670
