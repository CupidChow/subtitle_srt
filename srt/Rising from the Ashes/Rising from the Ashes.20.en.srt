(Who's Whose Lover)

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,790
I've made myself very clear.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,430
A four-million deposit is required

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,520
to sign this contract.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,350
The medical aesthetics
industry is booming.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,150
Not to mention

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,590
the price inflation on this batch
of medical equipment is bad.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
Many people are competing for this deal.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,110
I know.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,350
You came to discuss business with me.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,840
You should focus on

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,430
figuring out how to get
the four million soon.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,760
I brought the money.

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,710
Where's the contract?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,120
Where did you get the money?

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,230
Does it matter where it came from?

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,950
Since I have it now,

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,790
prepare the contract.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,870
Alright.

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,950
I'll have someone
prepare the contract now.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,980
Pleasure doing business.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,480
Too many sunflower seeds
could give you too much heat.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Welcome back.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,590
Clean up.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,070
Ying is upstairs napping with Ke.

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,200
I'll go wake her up.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
She can clean it.

42
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,280
If she's napping, then don't disturb her.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,920
Pick them up.

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,680
Get a new rag from the kitchen.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,280
I...

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,120
(Fine.)

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,590
(Let's see how long you can stay smug.)

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
Work faster.

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,840
Dad.

50
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,310
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,310
Come on, I'm taking you home.

52
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,710
I quit.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,430
Wait, Lu Yan.

54
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,840
Where am I supposed to live?

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,190
Don't worry.

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,360
I already bought back
the house we lost to debt.

57
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,590
Once the paperwork is done,

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,150
you can move in.

59
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,470
Really?

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,000
I knew it!

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,710
I don't want to stay here
a second longer.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
A lunatic

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,520
and a blind fool.

64
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,280
Disgusting.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,560
Enough, let's go.

66
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,560
Wait a minute.

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,190
I bought that shirt.

68
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Who cares?

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
The slippers too.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Son, remember this.

71
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,470
In the Lu family,

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,400
we don't live off women!

73
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,080
Take them all back!

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
I'll walk barefoot.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,430
Lu Yan paid the four-million deposit.

76
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,430
(Medical Equipment Purchase Agreement)
He signed the contract.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Didn't he use all his money
to pay off debts?

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,710
Where did he get the money?

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,680
When he came home today,
he even said that he bought back

80
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,870
the old house that had been sold

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,800
to pay off his debts.

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,680
This company's bank account is clean.

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,870
That money probably
didn't come from the company.

84
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,270
Strange.

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,070
If it's not the company's
and not his own,

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
then whose money is it?

87
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,870
We can't wait any longer.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,600
We can't give him any chance
to turn things around.

89
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,000
By the way,

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,070
after Luo Wei rejected you last time,

91
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,120
have you talked to her?

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
Weird.

93
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,310
They've introduced
a new chef's special here.

94
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,040
You'll definitely like the flavor.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
It's coming up soon.

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,630
Thanks for always
remembering what I like.

97
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,000
You look great today.

98
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,120
Let me take a picture to remember this.

99
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,830
Who are you?

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Had too much to drink?

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
I'm her boyfriend.

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,270
I finally found you.

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,390
Wang Hao, stop pestering me.

104
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,430
I'll call the police!

105
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,950
You already have a record.

106
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,310
Do you want to be in jail?

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,270
I'm warning you.

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
No one is allowed to bully Wan.

109
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,120
Right now,

110
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm her boyfriend.

111
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,480
You think you can call her Wan too?

112
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,800
If you're her boyfriend,

113
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,390
then who am I?

114
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,560
Wan.

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,310
He is...

116
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
No, he's not!

117
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
He's just an obsessive maniac.

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Two years ago, he forced me
into a relationship with him.

119
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,420
Even after we broke up,
he kept harassing me.

120
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,280
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,310
Wan, go now.

122
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,870
What do you want?

123
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,830
Are you okay? Did he scare you?

124
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,630
I'm glad you were here today.

125
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,480
By the way,

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,870
has that guy been
bothering you all this time?

127
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Yeah.

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,120
He's obsessed like a lunatic.

129
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,000
He keeps pestering me.

130
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,800
I've called the police many times.

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,310
Wan.

132
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't worry.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
From now on, I'll protect you.

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,830
By the way,

135
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,040
what about your
dad's medical equipment deal?

136
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,190
Has he made a decision?

137
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,630
My dad says
he's postponing the purchase.

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
It's delayed by two months.

139
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,680
Wan.

140
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,750
I really need this money.

141
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,190
Can you talk to your dad
and push him to approve it?

142
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,040
But this is such a big decision.

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
I can't make the call on my own.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
But, I can ask him again for you.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,390
Just break the contract if you must.

146
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,310
Worst case,
when the right opportunity comes,

147
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,340
I'll recommend you again.

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Come on, take me home.

149
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,680
Honey, you're back.

150
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,630
Has Xu Cheng contacted you

151
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,800
in the past two days?

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,750
No.

153
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
Are you hungry, honey?

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,070
I'll make you something to eat.

155
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,310
No need.

156
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
I don't have much of an appetite.

157
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,160
Come, take a seat.

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,830
Honey.

159
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,560
Can you help me
get my job at the hospital back?

160
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm so bored staying at home.

161
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Wei.

162
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,510
I can barely keep myself afloat.

163
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
What's wrong?

164
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,150
It's nothing.

165
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,120
Just work troubles.

166
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,630
You're not well.

167
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,910
Just rest at home.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,030
Dr. Lu.

169
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,360
What's so interesting on your phone?

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,670
Let me take a look too.

171
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,630
Nothing.

172
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,790
Just some messages
from the hospital group.

173
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,240
I see.

174
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,240
Honey.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
I feel like eating grapes.

176
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Can you get me some?

177
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,840
I'll go wash them for you.

178
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,420

179
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,290

I want to see you.)
