On the day of the incident,

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
did you see your father?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,030
No, I didn't.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,390
Daddy?

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,710
But I did hear Daddy's voice.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Did you bring them here?

Why didn't you pay off the debt?

I've paid them back now.

to push me to this point?

Yan.

Ke is settled in and asleep.

Xu, you're the filial one.

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,190
You knew to bring me back home.

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,710
Dad, you should've realized much sooner

45
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,680
that I'm way more filial than your son.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
You're right.

47
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,150
I was foolish.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,360
Now I realize

49
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,680
my room here is the most comfortable.

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,400
This is a new phone I bought for you.

51
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,360
Use it.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
On the third of every month,

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,960
I'll transfer some pocket money
into it for you.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Xu,

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,240
you're so good to me!

56
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,960
I'll go tidy up my room.
Call me if you need anything.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,430
Come on, Ying!

58
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,190
Coming.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,030
You know his temper.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,630
Why did you bring him back?

61
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't worry, Mom.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,870
He's dependent on me now,

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,430
so he can't stir up any trouble.

64
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,310
Besides, the house is now equipped
with surveillance cameras.

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
With him right under my nose,

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,710
I can monitor him easier.

67
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,630
San,

68
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm not blaming you,

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,520
but Lu Yan is
Jiang Yang's biological brother.

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,150
How could Jiang Yang tell Xu Cheng

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,870
where Ke was hiding?

72
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,630
Yang had no other choice.

73
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,710
Xu Cheng was going to fire him.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,080
He just graduated.

75
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Losing his job would ruin his future.

76
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,000
He's not like Lu Yan,

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,960
who had you to protect him
since he was a kid.

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,840
It's my fault for letting you two down.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
But don't worry.

80
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,360
Whatever Lu Yan has in the future,

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
Yang will have too.

82
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,960
Hua.

83
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,840
When can I come back?

84
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,190
For now, just take care of Wei.

85
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,840
Once she gives birth to a son,

86
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,360
I'll divorce Ying.

87
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,270
Then I'll bring you and Yang over,

88
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,270
and we'll all live together as a family.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
All right, Hua.

90
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll do as you say.

91
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,190
I'll take good care of Wei.

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,160
Dad. Where are you?

93
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,480
Is Ke at Xu Cheng's place?

94
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Lu Yan!

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,000
I… I don't know.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,430
Dad. Are you getting used to life
back in the old house?

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,390
Should I pick you up and bring you back?

98
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,240
No, no!

99
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,510
You're busy with work.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
I can't trouble you.

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm getting used to it here.

102
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,950
Didn't you say you don't like
using the toilet at the old house?

103
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,480
Nonsense.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm very adaptable.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,310
All right. I'm hanging up.

106
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,950
I'm at the marketplace right now.

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
It's noisy.

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,750
Don't call me

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,600
unless it's important.

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Wei, have some fruit.

111
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,680
Third Aunt,

112
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,630
thank you for all your help lately.

113
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,070
Of course. We're family.

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,310
Third Aunt, get the door.

115
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,430
Coming!

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,630
Hello. I'm looking for Wei.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,950
Please come in.

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
What brings you here, Wan?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Come sit down.

120
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,800
Wei.

121
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,240
I heard you were taking it easy
at home during your pregnancy,

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
so I thought I'd drop by to visit.

123
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,240
I brought some clothes for the baby.

124
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,480
Third Aunt.

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,630
Get some water for our guest.

126
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,390
Is this your mother?

127
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,600
She's my nanny.

128
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,950
Just call her Third Aunt.

129
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,600
Thank you for the thoughtful gift, Wan.

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,750
It's just a little something.

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,390
Is your husband not home today either?

132
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,950
He's a busy man.

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,190
Wei.

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,430
I'm not trying to start anything,

135
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,600
but when a woman is pregnant,

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,630
men are most likely to cheat.

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
You should keep an eye out.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,680
That actually makes sense.

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,510
How about this?

140
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,120
Why don't you stay for dinner tonight
and give me some advice?

141
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Next time.

142
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,040
I already have plans tonight.

143
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,600
Is it with that guy from last time?

144
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,630
Are you two involved?

145
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,630
Is he treating you well?

146
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,190
What kind of man is he?

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,630
I don't really know

148
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,750
what kind of man he is.

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
But when it comes to relationships,
I've always gone with my feelings.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,830
How about this?

151
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,830
Come with me to dinner

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,750
and help me read him.

153
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,390
I'm sorry, Wan.

154
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,430
I'd love to go,

155
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,870
but I'm not in the best shape.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
I shouldn't leave the house.

157
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,680
Maybe

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,430
you can invite him to have dinner here?

159
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,870
That's all right.
You can meet him another day.

160
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll be off, then.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,430
I'll see you off.

162
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,720
It's fine. You should stay here.

163
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,830
It's all right.

164
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,940
(Collection)

165
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,260
(Hibernation and metamorphosis)

166
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,510
Allow me.

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,510
Thank you.

168
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,950
By the way,

169
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,190
did you pass on my regards to Mr. Wen?

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
I briefly mentioned

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,830
the medical aesthetics equipment
to my dad.

172
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,750
He asked me
which friend was handling it.

173
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,800
You know

174
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,120
how these deals work.

175
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,630
It all depends

176
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,920
on the relationship
I have with the other party.

177
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,550
I'm counting on you to handle it.

178
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,440
I don't want to talk about work today.

179
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
Then we won't talk about work.

180
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,240
It's already hard enough

181
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,270
to get a meeting with you.

182
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,030
True.

183
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,030
My friend even got the wrong idea
about our relationship.

184
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,200
How so?

185
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,840
It just so happens that every time
you invite me out, she's around,

186
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,080
