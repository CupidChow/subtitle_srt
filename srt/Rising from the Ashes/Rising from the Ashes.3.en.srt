(The Fourth Pill)

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,790
You don't care to show me respect
in front of all our relatives?

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,920
Why didn't you inform me earlier
that we had guests?

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,070
My relatives visit my son's house.

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,430
Why should I?

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,520
I bought this house
before we got married.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,520
You married my son.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,200
Your properties belong to the Lu family.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,950
I'm not feeling well, and I need rest.

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,310
I don't care.

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,510
I'll only allow them to stay
for one night.

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,070
They came to help you.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,350
You should appreciate it.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,070
Do I need their help?

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I was wondering

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,590
why my son married a psycho.

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm also curious

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,510
why your son chose me.

33
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,070
Very well.

34
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,230
You dare talk back to me.

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,680
Hello?

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,680
Hello, dear.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,560
Your dad brought a lot of people back.

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,840
It's a mess. I don't know what to do.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Put on your earphones

40
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,000
and relax.

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll be back soon.

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,760
Fine.

43
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,040
Riqing,

44
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,920
size 11 scalpel is missing.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,280
Fetch one for me.

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
All right, Mr. Lu.

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,960
Mom,

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,630
there are two kids

49
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,310
who were being rude.

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
You feel upset today, right?

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,520
When we visit other people's houses,

52
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,590
we need to be polite.

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,310
Don't touch their things.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
Understand?

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
I'll clean your face.

56
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,520
(Your help is back. Come downstairs.)

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
I'll go downstairs later.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I'll wipe your face later, okay?

59
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,310
Good girl.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,560
How's it?

61
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,630
Dear relatives, it's been a long time.

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Yan,

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
aren't you going to

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,910
take over as president?

65
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,710
You're busy. Why did you come back?

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,430
Eldest aunt, you still look so young.

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Jiang Yang, you're graduating
from college, right?

68
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
You've gotten taller.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,150
See that?

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,240
I told you Lu Yan is doing great now.

71
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,910
I've booked a hotel for everyone.

72
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,030
Please pack up,

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,120
and I'll take you there.

74
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,910
What hotel?

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,310
There's plenty of space here.

76
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,840
You didn't inform Xu Cheng

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,910
before moving in.

78
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,574
Who does she think she is?

79
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,150
Xu Cheng is the owner of this house.

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Everyone here,

81
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,960
including me,

82
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,240
should listen to her.

83
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,470
Jeez.

84
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,360
You ungrateful punk.
I raised you for nothing.

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you leaving or not?

86
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,030
Pack up and go.

87
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,800
Take the cured meat with us.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fourth brother, isn't that for me?

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
It's tiring to carry it back and forth.

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,140
We can't even stay here.
Why bother asking for the cured meat?

91
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,430
Let's go. Let's leave.

92
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
Fourth brother.

93
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,240
You can at least give me pickles soup.

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,910
Fourth brother.

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,750
I'll clean this up.

96
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,750
Dear,

97
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
it's my fault.

98
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,120
Dad told me

99
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,270
that Third Aunt is coming to work here.

100
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,800
I thought she was nice,

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,720
and she used to take care
of me when I was little,

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
so

103
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
I didn't say no.

104
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,560
But why did so many people come here?

105
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,560
It's my dad. He loves showing off.

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,480
I see.

107
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,360
Well, Third Aunt

108
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,830
is a nice person and works hard.

109
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,390
Her son, Jiang Yang,

110
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,480
is looking for a job in your company.

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,510
He'd take anything,

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
security guard is fine.

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,070
If you think they're reliable,

114
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,680
they can stay.

115
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,830
Thank you, dear.

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,430
Thank you, President Xu.

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm no longer the president.

118
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,510
My dad told me

119
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,160
to take time off at home.

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,270
The entire Xu Group is yours.

121
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,630
The position doesn't really matter.

122
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,630
Whether or not you're the president,

123
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,870
I just want you to be healthy and happy.

124
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,680
Oh, right. I've got you the water.

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
Remember to take your meds.
I'm going to take a shower.

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Shouldn't it be four pills?

127
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,120
Did I miscount?

128
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
Ten million isn't much.

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,360
I never said I couldn't pay back.
Watch your words.

130
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,750
The Xu Group is backing me up.

131
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no way I won't pay back.

132
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,950
You should check

133
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,480
my wife's properties.

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Forget about ten million.
Even fifty million won't be a problem.

135
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,920
Dear.

136
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,830
What are you doing here?

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,310
I was playing games.

138
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,510
I didn't want to wake you up,
so I came here to play.

139
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,870
My luck is terrible tonight.

140
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,630
I've been losing.

141
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm so frustrated

142
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,430
that I recharged fifty million tokens.

143
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,600
Why are you up suddenly?

144
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,240
I don't know.

145
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,680
I feel uneasy.

146
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
Let's go back.
I'll sleep with you.

147
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,680
Dad,

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,800
why are you lying here?

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
What happened?

150
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,800
Why are you sleeping again?

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,120
You just woke up, and now
you're sleeping on the sofa.

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,160
Get up now.
You went to bed early last night.

153
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,240
What's wrong with you?
Are you not feeling well?

154
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Boring.

155
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,000
Life is boring.

156
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,160
I didn't do anything to you.

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
Get up.

158
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,630
I'm going back to my room.

159
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,430
No need to wake me up for meals.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,270
I might as well starve.

161
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,950
I told you not to simply take meds.

162
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,040
You didn't believe me.

163
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,950
What medicine?

164
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,950
Mom,

165
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,920
you can't take medicine randomly.

166
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,270
It can be dangerous.

167
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,480
It's your medicine.

168
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,750
Mine?

169
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,600
He wasn't feeling well a few days ago.

170
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,750
He said

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,480
your imported supplements were good.

172
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,390
He's been sleeping after taking it

173
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,600
and talking nonsense.

174
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll go check on him.

175
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,190
Should it be four pills?

176
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,600
Did I miscount?

177
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,218
Where did you get this medicine?

178
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,390
What do you mean?

179
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,510
There are hallucinogens in it.

180
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,670
Who gave you this?

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,670
Was it your father-in-law?

182
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,150
I'm going to call him out.

183
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Wei, no.

184
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
You're an educated woman.

185
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,910
Can't you handle an old provincial man?

186
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,200
If you really can't,

187
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,000
divorce his son.

188
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
Divorce?

189
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,360
Excuse me,
your food delivery has arrived.

190
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
Wei!

191
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,750
You seduced a married man.

192
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,910
Won't your parents feel ashamed
when they find out?

193
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,550
Xu Cheng is such a coward.

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,390
She sends you here

195
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,200
to deal with me?

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,630
For a hussy like you,

197
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,630
she doesn't need to step in personally.

198
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,320
I'd like to see how much
your true love is worth.

199
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,670
Stop it.

200
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,440
Hello?

201
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
Is this the police?

202
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,080
I'd like to report a prostitution case
at a hotel.

203
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,870
You win. Just you wait.

204
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,240
I'll get back at you.

205
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,320
Jerk!

206
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
