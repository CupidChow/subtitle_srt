(I'm Not Okay!)

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,000
Dear. You're awake, dear.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,670
Don't touch me.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,710
What's wrong, dear?

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,920
Dear, what happened?

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,430
Calm down.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,920
I saw you and Lu.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,070
Lu?

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,710
You mean my student
who stood next to me just now?

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,680
What about her?

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,950
Lu Yan,

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,760
how could you do this to me?

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,920
Are you hallucinating again?

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
Give me one minute.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,350
Sit down and calm yourself.

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,840
All right?

31
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,950
Just one minute.

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,150
Sit.

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,790
One moment.

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,000
I had someone check the footage
of the procedure room.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,760
Check this.

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,000
Dear, look at this...

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,950
Mr. Lu,

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,790
I feel like the nose job

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,430
Prof. Zhao did for me

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,510
doesn't look quite right.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,510
I actually think

42
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,840
it suits your face shape well.

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,040
Then you suddenly came in.

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,070
Dear.

45
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,150
Dear.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Dear.

47
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,080
It's all right.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,430
Have you not been resting well lately?

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,030
It's fine.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,710
Dr. Lu,

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,750
you have a meeting at 3:30 PM later.

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,750
Should I reschedule?

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Postpone it.

55
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
No need.

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,990
You should go.
Your patient is waiting for you.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Lu Yan,

58
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,280
you can't let this psycho

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
interfere with your work.

60
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,310
Dad,

61
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,840
Xu Cheng needs rest.

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,030
Don't cause trouble here.

63
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,630
Go back.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,120
I must've had the worst luck

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,470
to meet a jinx like her.

66
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,630
Dad, stop it.

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,310
Even if Xu Cheng is sick,

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll always stay with her.

69
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm really fine.

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,310
Get back to your work.

71
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,080
Remember to take your meds.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,910
I'm off.

73
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,960
Dad, why did you suddenly come here?

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Wire me 10,000 yuan.

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,960
Why again?

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,710
What for?

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Don't ask. Just do it.

78
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,590
Fine. I'll transfer it later.

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Dear,

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm leaving.

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
(Based on your current condition,)

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
(you must take your medication on time)

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
(and follow the treatment plan.)

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,910
(Dear,)

85
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,630
(remember to take your meds on time.)

86
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,400
(It can stop your hallucinations.)

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,630
We're home.

88
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,560
Careful.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Mom.

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,960
Ke.

91
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,710
Ke.

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
I miss you so much.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Everyone says you're sick.

94
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,870
Dad also says you're sick.

95
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,870
I'm feeling much better.

96
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,840
What's this?

97
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,310
While you were unwell,

98
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,270
Lu Yan enrolled her in kindergarten.

99
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,630
It's been two days.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
But...

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
But what?

102
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,510
I'll take the medications upstairs.

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,920
What's wrong with my granddaughter
attending a prestigious kindergarten?

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,120
You own a big enterprise.
How can we not afford that?

105
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,600
Anyway, she's enrolled.

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,630
If the two of you

107
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,040
don't have time,

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
I'll send her to school and pick her up.

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,430
Anyway, your condition

110
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,800
is unstable now.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm worried you might hurt Ke.

112
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,750
I...

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,270
Mom,

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,870
my teacher says

115
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,190
kids need sunlight to grow healthy.

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,600
You need that, too.

117
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,070
All right.

118
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,950
Let's go outside now.

119
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,800
Hello, Dad.

120
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,920
Mr. Lu,

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,480
I have a question for you.

122
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,800
Come in.

123
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,000
Dr. Lu,

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,430
please help me with
the face-lift injection.

125
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,190
Mr. Lu,

126
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,040
if there's nothing else, I'm off.

127
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,360
By the way, how's Xu Cheng?

128
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,870
Don't worry.

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,430
She's on the mend.

130
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,510
Bite.

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,950
Hello?

132
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,190
Dad, how are you doing overseas?

133
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm doing pretty good.

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,630
But you don't seem so.

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,430
Your body condition is poor.

136
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,310
You're not fit to be the president now.

137
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,080
Take time off and rest at home.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,360
Spend time with Ke.

139
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,620
(President's Office)

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Long time no see,

141
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,600
Cheng.

142
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,040
Why are you back?

143
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,950
A while ago,

144
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,800
I met Mr. Xu in the U.S.

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,750
He mentioned your health
hasn't been great

146
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,190
and asked if I'd be willing
to return to help manage Xu Group.

147
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,070
Are you okay?

148
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm not okay.

149
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,750
One character.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Get one.

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,830
Nine character.

152
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,720
Nine character, pong!

153
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,310
You're back, Cheng.

154
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,000
You're home.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,950
Look around.

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,390
This is where I live now.

157
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Isn't it amazing?

158
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,070
This is a huge house.

159
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,000
Stay here if you want.

160
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,310
I'm doing great now, you know?

161
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,200
My son is going to become the president.

162
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,160
Dad.

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,000
And I'll become...

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Why are they here?

165
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,160
You're back so late.
That's not how you should behave.

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,240
Something's wrong with her brain.
She doesn't recognize faces.

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,880
This is your second uncle,

168
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,040
eldest aunt, fourth uncle,
and Jiang Yang.

169
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,040
In the kitchen is your third aunt.

170
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,870
I meant,

171
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,800
why are they in my house?

172
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,600
It's school break,

173
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
so I invited them over
with their children to visit the city.

174
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,240
Hotels cost money.

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,310
There's plenty of space here for them.

176
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,310
They're only staying for a week.

177
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,750
Where's Ke?

178
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,120
Ke.

179
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,240
Mom.

180
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,680
Here, take it.

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
Darling,

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,190
what happened to your face?

183
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,950
They drew on my face and took my toys.

184
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,360
Why are you whining?

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,750
They're not here all the time.

186
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,480
Hu, Erhua.

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,390
If you like any toys here, take it.

188
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,000
Treat this place like home.

189
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,920
Let's go.

190
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,830
Where are you going?

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,360
