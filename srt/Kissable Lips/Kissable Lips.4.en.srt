1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,210
Apparently, I was almost kidnapped when I was little.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,820
I just want to live normally.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,700
How about you?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,060
Do you like me?

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,230
I can't do this.

[EP 04: Because you might kill me?]

7
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,030
Are you not going to see me anymore?

8
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,800
I was conceited.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,030
(I believed) even vampires could endure their hunger.

10
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,310
Get a hold of yourself!

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,900
I said let me go.

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,550
Choi Min Hyun.

13
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,320
You don't think about me, do you?

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,840
For the past ten years, I've been raising you alone.

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm always anxious, worrying something might happen to you when I'm not there.

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,220
And I always hold on to my phone at work worrying about you.

17
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,840
You don't care about me, right?

18
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,270
Am I right?

19
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,750
Please pick up your phone. Contact me. Tell me if you go somewhere. Please! Please! Please!

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,370
- Is this such a crime?
- What?

21
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,110
What did I do so wrong?

22
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,100
- I can't even be with the person I like?
- What?

23
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,450
You like that jerk?

24
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,950
Yeah.

25
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,290
I like him.

26
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,850
Damn it!

27
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,720
You're driving me crazy.

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,290
Are you acting like this because Jun Ho is a guy?

29
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,280
Listen carefully. You were almost killed...

30
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,580
- What?
- ...by a vampire.

31
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,790
Vampire?

32
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,320
The reason why you're special...

33
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,210
is because you're a pureblood human.

34
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,880
- It's a polaroid.
- What?

35
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,610
Hyung, can I take a picture with this?

36
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,140
You still haven't drank from him?

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,780
As you can see.

38
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,590
You were so confident.

39
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,510
What have you been doing till now?

40
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,240
Do you even want to become human?

41
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,510
I can't even see you clearly now.

42
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,630
How can you even laugh in this situation?

43
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,870
There's something I learned after living for 500 years.

44
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,620
What's that?

45
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,410
Your heart becomes at ease if you give up.

46
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,890
What?

47
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,110
I gave up. I want to stop now.

48
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,860
Where have you been?

49
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,400
I've been waiting for a really long time.

50
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,440
Why did you just leave earlier?

51
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,830
Are you not going to see me anymore?

52
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,660
We didn't do anything wrong.

53
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,750
You said you liked me.

54
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,160
I like you, too.

55
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,120
I don't think I told you before...

56
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,540
Sorry. It was a lie.

57
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,000
If you were being sincere, I'm sorry.

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,230
I was just joking.

59
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,710
You're lying.

60
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,810
It's because you might kill me.

61
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,360
You're a vampire.

62
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,280
And I'm a pureblood human.

Hyung.

71
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,600
So it's him. If it's because of guilt that you can't feed, then let's share.

72
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,830
How about we become humans after feeding on him together?

Let's live relying on each other when we become humans.
