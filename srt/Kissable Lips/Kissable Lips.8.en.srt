162
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,040
♫ I, I'll never let you go ♫

163
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,500
♫ Not letting you be lonely ♫

164
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,350
♫ I need you in my arms ♫

165
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,790
♫ My world, you are my soul ♫

166
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,150
♫ I'm always on your side ♫

167
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,520
♫ You are my life, you are my heart ♫

168
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,440
♫ Nothing's gonna change my love for you ♫

169
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,020
And... whenever I look back on those memories, it always comes back to me.

170
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,830
♫ How could I ever forget you ♫

171
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,620
That I still miss him.

172
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,160
♫ Just making our story ♫

173
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,210
I dreamed about growing old with you.

174
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,020
It was a very happy dream.

175
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,590
But when I woke up, I realized

176
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,530
that this was the dream.

177
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,560
♫ Whenever I look at you ♫

178
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,570
♫ I become a little sad. It must be worse than I thought ♫

179
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,360
I wish I had the chance to tell you

180
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,040
that I love you.

181
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,710
♫ It's okay even if it's not ♫

182
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,330
♫  As long as it's all right with you ♫
