[EP 05: Hyung, you're a vampire.]

4
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,350
It's because you might kill me.

5
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,640
You're a vampire.

6
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,610
And I'm a pureblood human.

7
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,150
But... you didn't harm me.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,450
It's because you like me.

9
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,970
Right?

10
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,950
You're still the same.

11
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,650
Hyung!

12
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,420
Long time no see.

13
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,430
It's been a long time,

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,580
and you're not going to greet me?

15
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,720
Follow me.

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,810
You're really on the brink of death.

17
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,550
If you don't want to die, cut the crap.

18
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,580
Is that something you should be saying to your brother you haven't seen in ten years?

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,720
Hyung.

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,710
So, it's him.

21
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,830
Is he really not going to see me?

22
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,030
No. He's probably being cautious.

23
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,480
He probably never imagined I would know.

24
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,060
He's the pureblood human, right?

25
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,810
What is your purpose?

26
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,870
Why are you curious about that?

27
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,060
If it's because of guilt that you can't feed, then let's share.

28
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,950
How about we become humans after feeding on him together?

29
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,850
In the end, he'll die. But then, you won't be the sole killer.

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,760
Let's live relying on each other when we become humans.

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Just like old times.

32
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,000
Didn't I tell you to cut the crap or I'd kill you?

33
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,220
I won't stand still if you do something to him.

34
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,980
Why is this only happening to me? Seriously.

35
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,310
I told you to take it easy.

36
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,720
It's the first time I've seen you with such a scary look.

37
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,180
We've met before, right?

38
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,830
Is he your friend?

39
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,880
We are...

40
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,930
a little more than friends.

41
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,870
It was hard to get this.

42
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,740
Did you call him?

43
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,380
I couldn't help but call him.

44
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,540
I know what you're thinking...

45
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,530
But?

46
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,190
You should put yourself in my shoes.

47
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,620
My friend of 30 years is dying

48
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,670
and there is a way to live, but he still chooses to die.

49
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,950
How do you think I feel just watching you?

50
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,230
Even so, you should've at least told me!

51
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,390
Jun Ho, don't think about anything but surviving.

52
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,030
Please, say something!

53
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,460
It looks like he has feelings for the pureblood.

54
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,590
He's probably mistaken.

55
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,850
If you want to become a human through a pureblood's blood,

56
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,030
you have to win their heart.

57
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,700
So, he can be confused.

58
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,050
That's why I need you to guide him.

59
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,040

62

since then.

63
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,500
If you're going to die soon, just tell me.

64
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,710

We weren't like this before.

67
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,050
Or... are you still not over what happened then?

68
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,790
I'm not hoping for much.

69
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,500
Just tell me, what state you're in?

70

We weren't like this before.

72
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,560
Also, in the end, you didn't do anything wrong...

73
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,560
