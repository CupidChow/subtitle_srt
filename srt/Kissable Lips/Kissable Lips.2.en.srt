Hi.

Hello.

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,580
You know me, right?

6
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,960
We met on the stairs.

7
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,960
Yes.

8
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,490
I can't believe you remember that.

Why am I stuttering so much?

10
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,080
We take a few classes together, too.

You know that, too?

12

If it's okay, do you want to do the assignment together?

13

Excuse me?

14
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,040
I think it'll be nice if we can film each other.

No, not yet.

I'm glad. Then let's do it together.

You have to drink the needed amount of a pureblood's blood at once.
