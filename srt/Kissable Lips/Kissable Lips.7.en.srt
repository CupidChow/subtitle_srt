00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,050
What do you gain from doing this?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,010
I'm not trying to gain anything.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,350
I just don't want to lose anything.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,950
You told me I was heavily mistaken last time, right?

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,610
However, I think you're the one who's mistaken.

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,210
Jun Ho never once...

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,500
belonged to you, right?

I guess there's something you didn't know.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,830
Jun Ho will die soon.

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,070
He killed a human.

12
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,890
Additionally, he killed the person, his lover, by sucking his blood.

13
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,460
Humans like you would never know...

14
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,510
how ridiculous love is...

15
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,780
in front of desire.

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,510
Jun Ho would never do that.

17
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,300
Hyung, why...

18
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,920
do you only look at those trivial things?

19
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,630
You knew, didn't you?

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,180
That I liked you.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,960
But you pretended that you didn't know, right?

22
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,790
No matter how hard I tried,

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,670
you always ignored me.

24
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,720
Hyung.

25
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,560
It's okay.

26
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,050
It's not your fault, Hyung. It's okay.

27
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,370
Don't worry.

28

You have me.

We need to talk.

Jun Ho, I...

31
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,620
didn't know when you would dissipate so...

32
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,860
Don't tell me...

33
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,330
Did something happen to that guy?

34
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,140
Or...

35
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,730
Hae Soo...

36
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,800
I killed him.

37
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
You...

38
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,150
You truly love him, don't you?

39
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,600
Then, are you just going to dissipate?

40
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,190
Don't...

41
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,400
ever do this again.

42
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,310
Shall we go?

43
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,360
You pretend not to be,

44
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,270
but you're also scared (of me).

45
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,980
I did it to protect you.

46
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,510
I'm really fine,

47
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,920
so you don't need to explain anymore.

48
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,460
Let's be honest with each other for once.

49
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,220
Apparently, I'm a pureblood human.

50
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,820

You gave me enough happiness and interest.

I can't live at ease without you.

55
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,280
The reason why you can't drink my blood...

56
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,130
is because, if you do, you may put me in danger.

57
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,000
Right?

58
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,020
Just turn a blind eye and forget about it.

59
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,470
Hyung.

because I'm not doing this for you.

then drink my blood.
