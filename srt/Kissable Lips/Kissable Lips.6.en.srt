00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,500
- Drink it.
- What?

4
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,650
Aren't you like this because of the smell of my blood?

5
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,420
Get out of my way.

6
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,950
Since there's no one here,

7
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,480
drink it.

8
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,410
Are you kidding me?

9
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,760
No.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,700
I'm serious.

11
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,240
I can give you as much as you want.

12
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,840
So, go for it.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,220
This is why I hate you.

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you think everything is that easy?

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,880
Stop saying childish things like a little kid.

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,180
Hyung.

17
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,280
I can kill him

18
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,310
if he's in the way, right?

19
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,560
This is driving me crazy!

20
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,350
Hi.

21
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,450
I'm here to see you.

22
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,180
I get it now.

23
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,190
This is what Jun Ho likes.

24
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,770
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,210
I heard your blood taste very good.

26
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,660
Pureblood's blood.

27
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,140
What are you doing?

28
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,430
Does Jun Ho know you're acting like this?

29
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,220
What?

30
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,860
You guys don't seem to be on good terms.

31
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,980
Can you treat me like this?

32
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
How interesting.

33
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm going to leave if you don't have anything more to say.

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
You're heavily mistaken.

35
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,760
Do you think you're someone special?

36
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,390
I think you're mistaken.

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,230
A pureblood human is just food to vampires.

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,730
On top of that, a very precious food that can

39
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,160
turn them into a human just by feeding on them.

40
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,640
That's probably why Jun Ho cherishes and protects you.

41
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,280
If you mistook that for love,

42
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,080
that's pretty sad.

43
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,250
Are you a vampire, too?

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,210
I love the sight of scared humans.

45
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,280
I want to...

46
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,680
slowly...

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,440
play with them.

48
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,420
It was me who was by Jun Ho's side for centuries.

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,480
And in the future, too.

50
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,270
I'm the only one who can understand everything about him.

51
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,260
It's not you...

52
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,240
who only knew him for just a few months.

53
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,750
It's not about the time you've spent together.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,170
It doesn't matter if it was centuries or a few days.

55
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,310
It's about Jun Ho's heart.

56
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,320
So?

57
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,150
I like Jun Ho.

58
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,580
And I'm the one by his side now.

59
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,500
Not you.

60
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,070
Min Hyun.

61
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,100
Hyung.

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,130
Are you okay?

63
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,490
It's no big deal. Why are you here?

64
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,210
How could I pretend and cold-heartedly leave when a sick person is in front of me?

65
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,390
I'm probably the only one who cares this much about you.

66
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,270
You're right. You're right.

67
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,750
I hugged you because

68
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,970
you were shaking a lot in your sleep.

69
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,950
It became warmer while I hugged you,

70
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,200
so I fell asleep, too.

71
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,130
You have to go quickly. If your brother knows...

72
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,190
Hyung, can I just eat ramen before going?

73
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,150
By any chance, do you know a student named Choi Min Hyun?

74
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,710
Ah, yes. We're in the same department.

75
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,000
You're the one who called me?

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,430
I know this is a bit childish,

77
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,660
but this is the easiest way.

78
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,410
What do you gain from doing this?

79
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,330
I'm not trying to gain anything.

80
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,680
I just don't want to lose anything.

81
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,230
You told me I was heavily mistaken last time, right?

82
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,100
However, I think you're the one who's mistaken.

83
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,610
Jun Ho never once...

84
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,810
belonged to you, right?

85
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,040
- Hyung, you just got here?
- Yes.

86
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,500
You told me to tell Min Hyun to meet at the rooftop earlier.

87
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,160
So I thought you were on the rooftop.

88
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,200
I did? Who told you so?

89
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,480
I don't know. Someone said you told them to, so I relayed the message to Min Hyun.

[Kissable Lips]

91
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,590
I guess there's something you didn't know.

92
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,540
Jun Ho will die soon.

93
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,310
He killed a human.

94
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,700
Additionally, he killed a person, his lover, by sucking his blood.

95
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,810
Humans like you would never know

96
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,290
how ridiculous love is

97
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,480
in front of desire.
