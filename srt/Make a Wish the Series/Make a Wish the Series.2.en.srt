1
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,420
- Previously -

2
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,960
Can you really see me?

3
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,570
So cool.

4
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,240
Are you really an angel?

5
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,210
Um, okay, so...

6
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:32,000
Angels don't need to wear ancient, white
Thai-style clothing or something like this...?

7
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,800
It's very modern.

8
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,940
That style has been gone for a
hundred year already.

9
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,189
Angels can also have fashion sets.

10
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,470
Just like you humans we have
collections for summer, fall, and winter.

11
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,060
So what is it?

12
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,040
Hurry up and make your wish.

13
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,410
Don't wait for next year.

14
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,489
Oh, sorry.

15
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,879
I... am here today

16
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,129
to ask for your help.

17
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,529
Everyone comes here to ask for help.

18
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,170
Tell me about your problem.

19
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,370
Well... I am a doctor,

20
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,980
a doctor who sees ghosts.

21
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,060
Seeing those ghosts really
interferes with my work.

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,640
So I was hoping that you could help me
get rid of this ability to see ghosts.

23
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,130
Follow me.

24
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,330
Is this the metaverse?

25
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,680
- Another universe?
- Yes.

26
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,589
So outdated.

27
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,420
In the world of angels, we used that
word 500 years ago.

28
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,879
We call the world that you live in
the World of the Living.

29
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,069
The world where humans are born and die.

30
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,720
As for my world, it's called the afterlife.

31
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,359
In the afterlife, there are angels
who function as the employees.

32
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,479
They are divided into different
departments and manage everything.

33
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,640
Follow me, I'll show you.

34
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,370
Hurry up!

35
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
Come on in.

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,190
The first department is in
charge of everything.

37
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,990
- Why are you so surprised?
- This is really amazing.

38
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,000
Hey, come on.

39
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,980
This is the Spirit-Catching Department.

40
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,800
Hey, there's a list, too.

41
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,130
Of course. Cool, right?

42
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
Hey!

43
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,710
Don't touch anything!

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,150
The last department is my department.

45
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,400
The angels here collect human wishes.

46
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,230
What do you think?

47
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,270
It's really amazing.

48
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,850
Hey!

49
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,010
- Yes, Auntie?
- Auntie who?

50
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,650
Uh, you. What's wrong?

51
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,189
Do you want something to eat?

52
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,769
- You have something?
- A lot.

53
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,050
Baked meatballs!

54
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,000
- Baked meatballs?
- Yes.

55
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,380
Do you have sausage?

56
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,270
Hey!

57
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,549
Simply put, our job as angels is like this.

58
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,050
Every human being has a cycle of
life and death, right?

59
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,510
Everything should be handled neatly.

60
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,739
So, heaven created angels like me.

61
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,759
To help human reincarnation go smoothly.

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,789
While they are alive,
we give them blessings.

63
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,350
And when they die, we take their
souls back to the afterlife.

64
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,590
The world of the living and the
afterlife are like two parallel worlds.

65
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,820
Hang on a minute.

66
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,750
So, what do I need to do?

67
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,719
Normally, humans wouldn't
be aware of life in the other world.

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,690
But there are some who can see or
feel a little bit of it.

69
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,500
But someone like you who can
see the whole afterlife,

70
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,459
both ghosts and angels...

71
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,130
- Young man!
- Thank you.

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,220
I've never seen it before.

73
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,360
It's only you.
There must be a reason.

74
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,680
Young man, want some ice cream?

75
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,889
It is very good.

76
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,920
Honestly, I really don't want to
accept your case because it's difficult.

77
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,969
But I haven't had that
much merit points recently.

78
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,789
That's why my boss
complains to me everyday.

79
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,489
- So I-
- Wait, wait.

80
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,640
What are you doing?

81
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,789
Do you want some coconut ice cream?
I'll buy for you.

82
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,990
I don't eat chocolate.

83
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,460
- Two coconut ice cream please.
- Okay.

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,556
- So I will accept your job.
- One without chocolate.

85
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:09,949
Actually, the heavens created us
so we only survive because of merit.

86
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,939
- Here is the special.
- The special, right?

87
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,209
- And here is the no chocolate.
- No chocolate, right?

88
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,540
- Yes, no chocolate.
- Okay.

89
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,730
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

90
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,730
Wow, you're very pious.

91
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,240
So, is merits like your life force?

92
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,970
Correct!

93
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,030
We are spirits created by heaven, so we can
live there only by doing the work assigned.

94
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,220
The merit points are our wages.

95
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,330
If we run out of merit, we disappear.

96
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,790
Hang on.

97
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,240
If you disappear, can't you be
reincarnated like humans?

98
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,480
If I disappear, I will disappear forever.

99
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,320
That's why merit points
are so important to me.

100
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,720
And I don't have much merit right now.

101
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,520
I usually take on big jobs
so I can survive for a long time.

102
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
Young man?

103
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,549
If you want to pay respect to him,
you should buy some flowers.

104
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,450
Okay, I'll take some.

105
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,400
Bring another bunch of flowers!

106
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,969
Actually, you would make me a lot of merit.

107
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,030
- Really?
- Yes, double the amount of others.

108
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,640
- Hey, young man!
- What?

109
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,320
Here is a bunch for you!

110
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,960
You want me to pray with all of this?

111
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,130
Go on. Pay respect~

112
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,680
- That's it!
- I'll pay respects.

113
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,090
What, what, what?

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,690
I've decided to help you.

115
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,250
Wait, really?

116
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,730
Dear Angel, bless you.
I don't have to see ghosts anymore!

117
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,850
What are you doing?

118
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,349
I already told you it will be difficult.

119
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,270
You expect me to just grant your wish
and you go on your way?

120
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,449
Hey.

121
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,630
But isn't it supposed to be like humans
come to ask angels for a wish,

122
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,660
then the angel grants it?

123
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,169
If that was the case, everyone who
asks wins the lottery.

124
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,630
Everyone in the country would
win the lottery by now.

125
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,179
But angels have power over
humans to grant wishes.

126
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,840
Can't you just grant it right away?

127
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,219
Anything that happens will have its
consequences and it must happen for a reason.

128
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,279
Your situation involves changing fate.

129
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,389
So I need to find out
why you can see ghosts.

130
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,830
So it will take time.

131
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,440
Then, what do I need to do?

132
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,319
It's easy.

133
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,939
In order for me to
easily investigate this matter,

134
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,510
You need to find a human body
for me to possess.

135
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,170
Find a human body for you to possess?

136
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,509
Angels can possess humans, too?

137
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,710
That's right.

138
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,160
If I have a human body, it's more
convenient for me to do things.

139
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,360
So, it's kinda like having a spirit medium?

140
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,560
Hold on a minute!

141
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,800
Are you going to possess me?

142
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,430
What should I do? And...

143
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,509
And will I still be me?

144
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,760
Oi, that's not how it works.

145
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,830
I don't need a living human's body.

146
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,059
Find a body of someone whose life
has expired and the soul has escaped,

147
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,609
but they couldn't die because they
are on a ventilator.

148
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,649
Someone about the same size as me.

149
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,720
And someone not too old.

150
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,209
What are you doing here?
This is outside your jurisdiction.

151
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,619
I haven't yet been notified by
the department responsible for this area

152
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,140
that another angel would be coming.

153
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,960
Did you report that you were
coming here to your boss?

154
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,280
You don't need to worry.

155
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,640
Just kidding, Sir.

156
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,719
Well,
I received a mission to help a doctor here.

157
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,549
You don't have to worry about my boss.

158
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,439
I'll take care of it.

159
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,479
You just keep doing your work.

160
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
Come on, let's get to work!

161
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,720
No playing around.

162
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,420
No playing...

163
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,050
What are you doing?

164
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,270
What are you playing at?

165
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,920
Didn't you tell me to find you a body
about your size and not too old?

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,040
You don't call that too old?

167
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,520
80 is less than 100 years old.

168
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,610
Hundreds of years younger than you.

169
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,580
Right?

170
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,920
With this body, I'll have to use a
wheelchair to complete the mission.

171
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,510
Still want to use it?

172
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,040
Isn't there another body?

173
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,399
This ward is full of
critically-ill patients.

174
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,200
But I haven't seen
souls leave their bodies.

175
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,600
So, there's no other option.

176
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,069
What about this one?

177
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,550
Can't it be used?

178
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,720
This is my medical student.

179
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,380
I didn't see a soul leave his
body yet either.

180
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,840
Ah, this person...

181
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,910
What is it?

182
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,010
When you said you couldn't see his soul
is it because you really can't...

183
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,330
or you weren't looking for it?

184
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
What?

185
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,340
What are you doing?

186
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,140
Um... nothing.

187
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,200
I just stopped in to visit him.

188
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,460
What? Something wrong?

189
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,850
You're suspicious.

190
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,620
What do you mean suspicious?

191
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,910
Crazy.

192
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,280
Suspicious?

193
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,570
Not at all!

194
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,710
I-is it really you?

195
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,990
You can see me?

196
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,150
Yes...

197
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,730
Yes, it really is.

198
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,400
Thank you, thank you, God.

199
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,280
I thought I lost it.

200
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,730
My pen from the nine temples.

201
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,400
(Mantra)

202
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,890
Hey!

203
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,590
How is that possible?

204
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,890
Can you see me?

205
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,040
It really is!

206
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,649
I also found 1000 baht.

207
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,440
It's a really good day for mommy. Mommy will
use this for you, my son. Thank you, God~

208
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,600
It's a really good day.

209
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,190
What the heck?

210
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,510
I thought she could see it.

211
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,640
You can come out.
We have things to discuss.

212
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,480
Nong Met.

213
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,439
You want to use my body?

214
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,750
Mhm.

215
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,810
That's it.

216
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,429
You can't go back to your body because

217
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,280
your lifespan has already
expired in this life.

218
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,669
It all happened so fast.

219
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,829
I don't even know what happened.

220
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,480
I just know that I fell down the stairs.

221
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,560
I can't remember how it happened.

222
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,870
But I can help you with this matter.

223
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,920
But you'll have to lend
me your body first.

224
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,380
I don't understand why it
has to be me.

225
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,210
Well...

226
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,760
It's because of me.

227
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,399
I wanted to stop seeing ghosts.

228
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,150
So, I asked this angel for help.

229
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,609
And the angel's condition was...

230
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,080
that I find a body of someone whose
lifespan has expired but is not dead yet.

231
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,480
So he can borrow the body.

232
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:00,960
After I borrow your body to help
Dr. Phakphum, I can help you rest in peace.

233
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,270
Met.

234
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,870
Met.

235
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,790
Met, my dear.

236
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,960
Why are you like this?

237
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,940
Met...

238
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,240
Met... Met, my dear.

239
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,430
Met...

240
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,990
You fell down the stairs?

241
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,330
It's intracerebral hemorrhage and
traumatic brain injury.

242
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,469
There has been no improvement
since the surgery.

243
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,840
Patient's consciousness rating
is E1VTube M1.

244
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,620
May God bless you, my baby.

245
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,210
Don't leave your mom
and dad behind.

246
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,910
Stay with us.

247
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,630
Hey, Met.

248
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,120
It's been a month already.

249
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,930
We have just a little longer
before graduation.

250
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,720
I want us to graduate together.

251
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,530
Met.

252
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,240
Are you tired?

253
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,600
Mom and Dad went to the temple
today to do merit.

254
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,320
We're praying for you.

255
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,760
Don't worry.

256
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,790
Mom and Dad will do everything
possible to get you back.

257
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,600
Mom and Dad miss you, baby.

258
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Don't you have any other
body to choose from?

259
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,960
What if he doesn't agree?

260
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,439
There isn't any more.

261
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,239
All that's left would be
in the morgue.

262
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,140
Hey, what if there really is one?

263
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,170
Hey, what's wrong?

264
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,529
Will I really have to go back and
use that old lady's body?

265
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm happy about it.

266
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,310
There's no way I can recover, right?

267
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,240
To be honest, it isn't possible anymore.

268
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Even though I'm dead, I can still
be of help to you, right?

269
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,280
Fine, I agree.
But I have a condition.

270
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,180
You said that you could help
me regarding my accident.

271
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,149
I want you to help me find out
why I fell down the stairs.

272
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,840
Because it's been bothering me a lot.

273
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,990
Of course!

274
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,599
If that will free you of worries and
let you rest in peace,

275
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,990
then that is my duty as an angel.

276
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,950
Also...

277
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,789
Could you pleas take my body

278
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,840
to spend time with my parents
in the last moments before I die?

279
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,899
Then, once you've completed your missions,

280
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,120
please let my body rest peacefully.

281
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,410
That's all.

282
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,320
Okay, I will do as you wish.

283
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,970
Thank you.

284
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,600
Um by the way, won't others be
suspicious that my mannerisms have changed?

285
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,689
I won't be the same as I was.

286
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,799
Don't worry about that.

287
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,289
When I enter your body, I will
have access to all your memories.

288
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,640
I will act as realistically as possible.

289
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,579
You mean...

290
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,489
you'll see all my memories?

291
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,149
That's right, all of them.
Don't worry.

292
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,600
So easy.

293
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,110
Hold on.

294
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,770
- What are you planning to do? -

295
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,030
- Let's hurry to the UCI now!
- What?

296
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,080
- You mean ICU...
- Yeah that!

297
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,340
What the heck?

298
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,990
What's wrong?

299
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,279
It's my boss.

300
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,659
He already knows I'm going to
break the rules and borrow a human body.

301
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,890
If it's breaking the rules,
why still do it?

302
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,370
I have no choice or I can't
fix your problem.

303
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm going to enter your body.

304
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,720
Hey, wait...

305
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,200
P'Shan!

306
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,909
Let me go!

307
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,729
You can't interrupt me like this.

308
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,880
I was trying to act cool, but you
totally ruined it.

309
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,270
P'Shan.

310
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,959
Let me go.

311
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,620
Ok, ok, I surrender.

312
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,719
Now let me go.

313
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,900
Look, my legs are still stuck.
I have to get them out.

314
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,970
Otherwise, we'll be stuck together.

315
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,840
Come on, P'Shan, let me go.

316
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,710
Angel Krit...

317
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,270
This will not be good.

318
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,880
Who was that?

319
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,360
I don't know either.

320
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,140
It must have been a higher up angel.

321
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,860
I made it.

322
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,290
That sound... is it that loud?

323
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,530
Hey, wait, wait!

324
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,149
Stay calm. Don't move yet.

325
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,419
Hey, calm down.

326
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,920
Stay calm.

327
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,120
Phum!

328
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,270
The patient is agitated. Prepare the
endotracheal tube and administer 10 mg diazepam.

329
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,430
Hurry.

330
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,199
- Hold the tube.
- Patient, please calm down.

331
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,940
Met, it's okay.

332
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,460
Stay calm.

333
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,190
Phum...

334
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,989
What are you doing here?

335
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,460
What happened?

336
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,030
Was he just agitated all of a sudden?

337
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,560
Or was it a seizure?

338
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,560
What happened just now?
Did you see anything?

339
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,560
Well...

340
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,720
Let's go make merit and
pray for Met again.

341
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,919
We just went to pray at the
sacred Bodhi tree yesterday.

342
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,880
Do we have to go again?

343
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,170
I just want to do it for Met.

344
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,520
Let's try again, okay?

345
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,350
We have gone to so many temples
and places to make merit.

346
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,880
But Met still hasn't woken up and
his condition gets worse.

347
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,160
I think we might have to prepare
ourselves like the doctor said.

348
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,070
Mom and Dad...

349
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,930
Did our best, didn't we?

350
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,009
Then, we should let Met go...

351
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,200
and use the rest of our time to take
good care of Mac and Min, right?

352
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,520
Hello?

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,849
What did you say?

354
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,440
Met woke up?

355
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,080
Yes, I'll hurry over.

356
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,850
Met woke up?

357
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,600
Met woke up.

358
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,650
Thank God.

359
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,520
The angel of the Bodhi
tree is really sacred.

360
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,209
Are you awake now?

361
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,800
How do you feel?

362
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,640
Hurry and wake up, Mr. Angel.

363
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
You're waking up in the ICU.

364
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,710
How handsome...

365
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
Hey, what's he doing?

366
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,240
Why can't I stop smiling?

367
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,630
Don't come too close, Doctor.

368
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,450
Ow, it hurts.

369
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,620
Cool.

370
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,240
Room 74...

371
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,750
You scared me.

372
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,649
Mr. Angel, I don't know if
you know this or not,

373
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,709
But since you're in my body,

374
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,240
there's something I should tell you.

375
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,800
What is it?

376
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,429
- Well...
- Really?! That's serious!

377
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,000
I haven't said anything yet.

378
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,030
What is it?

379
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,670
Say it.

380
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,469
Don't people say that dead men can't talk?

381
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,390
How lucky you are...

382
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,120
Well...

383
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,160
Well...

384
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,070
I like Phum.

385
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,430
What, what, what?!

386
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,389
Oho, he just smiles at you
and you fall for him.

387
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,790
Aren't you too easy to
fall in love?

388
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,589
The doctor is definitely charming.

389
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,710
It's no surprise you were
moved by him.

390
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,270
Come in.

391
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,210
Do you need something?

392
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,680
I have something to tell you, P'Phum.

393
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,450
What is it?

394
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Well, I...

395
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,949
- Doctor.
- ( Ugh! )

396
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,320
( The nurse came at the worst time! )

397
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:12,560
- Darling, what should we
eat this evening? -

398
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,720
( Wow, it's love again. )

399
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,720
Is love really that important
to humans?

400
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,450
Excuse me.

401
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,720
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

402
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,350
What did you want to tell me?

403
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,240
It's nothing, sorry.

404
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,300
Why do I have to know
about you two?

405
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,440
How am I supposed to act now?

406
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,360
Sorry you have to know all that.

407
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,509
When I found out he has a girlfriend,

408
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,800
I didn't dare see him again.

409
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,619
Because I was afraid I'd behave
improperly when we were together.

410
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,340
So, I don't want to like him anymore
than I already do.

411
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,980
So that's why this body gets fidgety
when I'm around him, right?

412
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,370
Mr. Angel, please don't ever tell
P'Phum about this.

413
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,480
Okay.

414
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,710
I'll keep this a secret for you.

415
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,380
Hey, guys!

416
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,950
Guys!

417
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,690
Guys!

418
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,420
What?

419
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,610
It's Met...

420
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,170
Met? What happened to him?

421
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,610
Met woke up!

422
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,340
Oh, it's just that Met woke up.

423
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,500
What?! Met woke up?

424
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,630
Yeah!

425
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Come on!

426
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,950
Let's go.

427
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,700
- Dao, let's go.
- Hurry up!

428
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,170
I'm coming, wait for me.

429
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,560
- Hey, Met!
- Hey!

430
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,000
We were so worried, you know?

431
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,050
Hold on, hold on.

432
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,210
Why you all came together?

433
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,500
Oh, how could we not?

434
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,310
Sleeping Beauty just woke up.

435
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,450
Of course, us dwarves had to come visit.

436
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,069
What Sleeping Beauty?

437
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,520
That's from Snow White.

438
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,599
There are dwarves in Sleeping Beauty.

439
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
- That's Snow White.
- Sleeping Beauty.

440
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,090
- It's Snow White.
- Sleeping Beauty.

441
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,020
Snow White.

442
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,030
- Dao?
- I didn't see anything.

443
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,439
What do you mean, Dao?
If you couldn't see me, come closer.

444
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Okay...

445
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:03,960
Well, I'm glad you're better and
getting back to normal, Met.

446
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,210
Well rested, battery charged,
and ready to work.

447
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,030
That's great.

448
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,769
Then...

449
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:20,500
Met, do you remember
what happened to you that day?

450
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,020
I can't remember.

451
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,929
Dao...

452
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,800
Don't ask about anyhting yet.
He just woke up.

453
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,889
On another note...

454
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,559
What do you guys think
of throwing a party?

455
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,839
To celebrate Met waking up?

456
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,239
Good idea!

457
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,820
I'll set it up.

458
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,990
Careful, don't hit him.

459
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,600
You'll put him back to
sleep again.

460
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,190
- What should we eat?
- Let's get hotpot. I'm hungry.

461
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,130
Your Met's mother, right?

462
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,589
Hello.

463
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,030
No, I'm not.

464
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,299
Oh, is that so?

465
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,010
I guess I mistook you
for someone else.

466
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,680
Doctor, I'm just kidding.

467
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,020
I'm kidding, too.

468
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,760
- You're here to visit Met, right?
- Yes.

469
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,960
Well, I happen to be Met's senior.

470
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,249
- Here, let me help you.
- Oh no, it's okay.

471
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,916
- You don't have to.
- Just let me carry it for you.

472
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,180
- It's okay, no need.
- Please let me.

473
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,889
Don't be stubborn.
We'll be doing this all day.

474
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,970
Fine, I'll let you do
what you want.

475
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,840
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

476
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,639
I'm fine with anything,
but no alcohol.

477
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,630
- Oh, hello, Mom.
- Hello.

478
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,030
- Hello, P'Phum.
- Hello.

479
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,480
Okay, see you at the party.

480
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,360
- Bye.
- See you.

481
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,880
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

482
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,000
Met.

483
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,720
My son.

484
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,720
My son, Met.

485
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,279
I'm so relieved.

486
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,640
How are you?
Do you hurt anywhere?

487
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,760
- I'm okay.
- You're really okay?

488
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,189
Uh, Mom, I can't breathe.

489
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,040
Doctor, he can't breathe!
What's wrong with him?

490
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,640
You just hugged him a
little too tight.

491
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,109
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
- It's okay.

492
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,390
Mom is just so happy.

493
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,560
How are you today?
Is there any pain?

494
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,670
No.

495
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,240
I'd like to be discharged, P'Phum

496
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,690
Where's Dad?

497
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,789
Dad is out making merit.

498
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,450
He went to so many temples
to pray for you.

499
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,120
Are you okay, Mom?

500
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,549
I'm not too good, but a little better
now that you're awake.

501
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,820
It's been a long battle, you know?

502
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,159
You need to eat more.

503
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,540
Really?
I will be able to eat now.

504
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,240
You're back, son?

505
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,790
- Come in, come in.
- Okay.

506
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,430
Hey, wait a minute.

507
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,460
What?

508
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,470
This.

509
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,839
There was a superstition in ancient times.

510
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,490
If you put pomegranate leaves
in a basin of water,

511
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,679
it washes away bad luck.

512
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,069
- Washes away bad luck?
- Yes.

513
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,440
Yes, that's right.

514
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,900
No, wait!

515
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,540
Stand up, Son.

516
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,560
You need to step over it,
not wash your face with it.

517
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,770
I wanted to check if the water is cold.

518
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,760
Is it left or right first?

519
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,829
Either way.

520
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,070
Either is fine.
You could jump, too.

521
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,280
It's up to you.

522
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,240
It's okay to go with left or right first.

523
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,319
It seems...

524
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,520
I crossed over into bad luck instead.

525
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,320
P'Shan, it hurts.

526
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,599
Do you know what you've done?

527
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,520
Leave this body right now.

528
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:21,840
No, I don't want to, no~

529
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,130
I can't leave!

530
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,679
I used all my merit to enter this body.

531
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,420
If I leave, this body and
I will disappear.

532
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,420
After living so long, my
joints are so creaky.

533
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,740
Why do you have to always make
trouble and exhaust me?

534
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,209
You, get up right now.

535
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,730
You only have one option.
Hurry up.

536
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,590
You're still going to
play like this?

537
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,200
P'Shan!

538
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,080
Then, there's only one way.

539
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,879
P'Shan, you can't pull me
out of this body!

540
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,120
Do you wanna make me disappear?

541
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,639
I'll give you six days to
complete the mission.

542
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,869
If you don't succedd,

543
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,159
you will die and rot
with this body.

544
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,640
And you will never be an angel again.

545
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,129
Don't make another mess.

546
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,590
And don't get carried away.

547
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,800
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

548
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,400
What the heck?

549
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,950
- (Graduation is coming!:) -

550
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,269
Why are you calling again?

551
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,269
Nothing really, just calling to ask...

552
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,670
when will we start the mission?

553
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,680
There's no rush.
We still have time.

554
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,149
I'll start after going to
Intouch's house party tonight.

555
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,840
It seems I have a friend who knows
about the accident this body went through.

556
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,450
Really?

557
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,579
Okay then, I'll pick you up later.
I'm worried about you.

558
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,320
Met's body just recovered.

559
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Okay?

560
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,560
Okay.

561
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,330
Mr. Angel, what are you doing?
Why are you going through my closet?

562
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,260
Too dark.

563
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,400
Looks like you have an interview.

564
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,770
Too plain.

565
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:32,189
You're a human. Can't you live a
more colorful life?

566
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,080
Are you going out now?

567
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,279
Well, my boss only gave me six days
to complete the mission.

568
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,729
Including today.

569
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,219
Every minute is precious.

570
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,880
I also have to investigate your accident.

571
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,129
What's in here?

572
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,450
Don't open it!

573
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,840
No way!

574
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,439
I don't want you to wear
that cartoon shirt.

575
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,280
It looks like a kindergartener's.

576
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,399
The place is there.
You go in first.

577
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,879
I'll wait here for you.

578
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,240
No need to wait.
You can go back first.

579
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,540
I said I'll wait for you.

580
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,250
You can go ahead.
Go on.

581
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,769
Make sure you answer your phone.

582
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,910
Understand?

583
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,200
Cheers~

584
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:10,090
And today, we also want to
congratulate the new doctor!

585
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,990
Thank you, thank you.

586
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,729
What did you see while
you were asleep?

587
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,930
I was asleep. How would I know?

588
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,649
I'll get some more food.

589
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,600
He was unconscious.
What would he see?

590
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,110
He would probably see... the afterlife!

591
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,830
- The afterlife?
- Yeah, that.

592
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,360
- You see it too, don't you?
- You're not making sense.

593
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,800
Wanna dance?

594
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:46,910
Dance?

595
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,439
You?

596
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,039
- No thanks.
- Are you challenging me?

597
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,320
Dance battle.

598
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,990
Oh, a dance battle.

599
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,160
I was the champion in kindergarten.

600
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,280
- Come on.
- Come on. What are you waiting on?

601
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,869
Hang on, here's the food.

602
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,880
Sit and have some.

603
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,690
It's still hot.

604
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,250
- Hey Met!
- Hmm?

605
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,480
Should you be drinking?

606
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,299
You shouldn't, right?

607
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,519
Why?

608
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,889
You always get drunk easily.

609
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,360
But it's delicious.

610
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,000
Why doesn't he pick up?

611
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,520
You're good.

612
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

613
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,570
Sorry, I'm here to take Met home.

614
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,319
Who's Met?

615
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,640
I'm Angel K...

616
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,630
Met, let's go home.

617
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,400
You're drunk. Let's go.

618
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,860
Come on.

619
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,550
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

620
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,850
It's okay, it's okay.
Let's keep going!

621
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,700
Hey...

622
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,850
Hey...

623
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,970
We're home.

624
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,370
Hey...

625
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,680
You're so drunk.

626
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,790
Hey.

627
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,870
Hey.

628
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,100
Mr. Angel.

629
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
Hey.

630
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,360
Wake up.

631
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,280
What's wrong with you?

632
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,500
Are you okay?

633
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,870
