The followings are auto translated subtitles.
Manual translated version will be updated later.

2
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,780
I apologize to you.
No need.

3
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,500
Go apologize to my mom and dad.

4
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,739
That's the only thing I need from you.

5
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,980
Have a chance to see you later.

6
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,100
Goodbye.

7
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,659
You really have to go, don't you?

8
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,659
Then my mission is done.

9
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,300
If I want to see you again,
what should I do?

10
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,900
You're still with us, dad.

11
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,819
Are you ready?

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,900
Last wishes from me.

13
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,020
Hello.

14
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,620
What's up?

15
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,140
Cancer.

16
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,860
- The doctor knows. - Just kidding.

17
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,900
It's hard on the inside, Doctor.

18
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,740
But... when you're mentally prepared...

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,340
Live life as if you can.

20
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,220
But...

21
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,580
If I had to leave...

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,220
Normal.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,860
Bai.

24
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,660
You are lucky that your family...

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,020
They understand.

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,699
That triptych.

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,699
Oh, I once met that person

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,860
at the bodhi tree.

29
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,020
Fortunately,
the patient's family understands that.

30
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,700
Because of so many patients I've seen,

31
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
their families are still
not mentally prepared.

32
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,380
And beg to hold on to life.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,620
In the end, the patients themselves suffer.

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,779
Actually, I'm worried about that.

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,020
That how they will live,

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,020
when she left.

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,340
But until then,

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,100
when you're gone,

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,660
They also have to live.

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Because they know that you have left

41
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,660
I want the people who are
still alive to be happy.

42
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
With both,

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,260
continue to live well.

44
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
Is that right?

45
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Thank you, Doctor.

46
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,859
Thank you, Doctor.

47
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,380
Saved my life.

48
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,779
I'm so happy.

49
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,019
When the doctor visited
me before going home.

50
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,220
Even if the doctor is
not in charge of my case.

51
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,059
How are you today?

52
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,540
Is there any pain anywhere?

53
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,099
It's not.

54
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
I want to leave the hospital, Mr. Phum.

55
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,300
Doctor.

56
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,020
Doctor

57
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,060
Oh, yes.

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
Do you fall asleep?

59
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,100
Hard work these days, right?

60
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,660
A little bit.

61
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,220
Anyway, Mr. Bank, take care of yourself.

62
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes, thank you

63
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,580
Ah, Doctor Phum.

64
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Yes?

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,020
I followed the Doctor IG again.

66
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,820
Didn't follow back before.

67
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,780
Let's talk later, Doctor

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,820
- What happened? - What happened?

69
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,659
Man, what's wrong?

70
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,260
I don't see it anymore either.

71
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,220
Is that the story of you Mes?

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,140
I said it went peacefully, Mr.

73
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,780
People who continue to live like us,
must also move on.

74
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Right?

75
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,020
Can I have a meal, please?

76
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Scat.

77
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,420
Next step.

78
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,020
Then what happened to her?

79
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,420
Sir!

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,459
Son son.

81
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,860
My treasured son.

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,700
Go to IC.

83
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,540
There is no alertness,
no awakening, nothing at all.

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
I don't know what to do anymore?

85
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,459
Calmly, calmly speak slowly.

86
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,539
Speak slowly,
listen to not understand anything.

87
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,780
Give Mandarin, say what?

88
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,780
My son...

89
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,940
in the room

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,700
first...

91
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,780
C...

92
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,900
U. ICU: intensive care room

93
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,300
There is no awareness at all.

94
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,660
I do not know what to do anymore.

95
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Prepare yourself mentally.

96
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I...

97
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,459
Impossible!

98
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,940
My child!

99
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,620
Eh, dirty.

100
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,900
Are you okay sir?

101
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,459
Will you wake up?

102
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,140
This one.

103
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,419
And it's funny to talk about it.

104
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,380
When we met for the first time,
send me a message to do meritorious deeds.

105
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,180
I thought that the first meeting someone would
make an appointment to do merit together.

106
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
How are you? Is it delicous?

107
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,220
Doctor.

108
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Yes?

109
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,060
Is it good?

110
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,100
Oh, it's delicious.

111
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Well, it's private, isn't it?

112
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Yes.

113
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,940
I once went to eat with a friend of mine,
he is an artist.

114
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,940
But now, very sorry for him.

115
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,620
Suddenly,
a blood vessel in the brain burst.

116
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,180
Does the doctor know about this?

117
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,300
He's in the doctor's hospital.

118
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
I don't know anymore.

119
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:38,420
What's his name? Let me go check.

120
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,420
This person.

121
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,820
Angel Kristi

122
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,100
What's wrong with Dr. Phum?

123
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Ah.

124
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,740
No, it's nothing.

125
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,500
The patient is awake.

126
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,500
Is the patient aware?

127
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
Hey man!

128
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,500
Grandfather!

129
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,739
My precious son is awake.

130
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,459
There's the angel Krit,
that's the real spirit.

131
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,219
Thank you so much for the introduction.

132
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,900
Oh, thank god

133
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
Wait! What's wrong with her?

134
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,220
Is it a boy?

135
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,580
Is that Narin?

136
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,259
Uh... so...

137
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,780
Is his face always like that?

138
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,299
What's wrong with him?

139
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,539
Say my child fixes it?

140
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,019
Such a handsome man.

141
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,259
The face is naturally beautiful,
nothing has been done.

142
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,659
Not! No... that's not what it meant.

143
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,619
I mean, is his face always like that?

144
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,939
That's right.

145
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,460
Ask again. What's wrong with him?

146
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,700
You can remember right?

147
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Older brother...

148
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,380
who is that?

149
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm a doctor.

150
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Is it a boy?

151
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,220
Is that Narin?

152
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,819
Is his face always like that?

153
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,140
That's right.

154
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,659
Waking up like a miracle?

155
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,140
Like when the angel Krit
entered the body of Doctor Mes.

156
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,580
Is it really you?

157
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,500
I really hope it's you.

158
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,340
This cup is less sweet.

159
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Still sweet.

160
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,819
Doctor!

161
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,740
Would you like to drink
pearl milk tea together?

162
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,219
Oh! Today, what to buy that much?

163
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,099
Not ours, Doctor.

164
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,739
It's from a fan of the artist
who just woke up from the ICU.

165
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,619
He's a famous artist.

166
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,779
The face is so cute.

167
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Ah...

168
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,779
Doctor Phum is the
patient's next treatment.

169
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Please.

170
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,980
Older brother!

171
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,260
Did the doctor come
to see me the other day?

172
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,619
That's right.

173
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,500
I am the next doctor to treat.

174
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,780
Thank you.

175
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,340
Please allow me to check.

176
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,020
Take a deep breath.

177
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,740
Have you been feeling
dizzy or nauseous recently?

178
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,460
No.

179
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,900
So... have you seen any hallucinations?

180
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
What is it?

181
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,219
Have you ever been to a swimming pool with dead children, had
a superior named Shan, and seen yourself under the Bodhi tree?

182
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,100
What is it?

183
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,619
Have you ever been to a swimming pool?

184
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,499
Is there a superior named Shan?

185
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,899
And have you seen yourself
under the Bodhi tree?

186
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Is this the Doctor's
memory retrieval exercise?

187
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,780
That's right.

188
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Uh...

189
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,380
What is this?

190
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,740
Try opening it.

191
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,500
What do you remember?

192
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay.

193
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,980
Egg!

194
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,619
I used to play when I was a kid.

195
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,060
Always like it.

196
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,460
Ring?

197
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
What ring?
Monkey.

198
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,979
Ok, so...

199
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,859
Get plenty of rest to get well
soon. Doctor will visit again!

200
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,900
Yes.

201
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Doctor, get plenty of rest too!

202
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,420
Is the doctor okay?

203
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,300
Or am I not okay?

204
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Or Doctor?

205
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,979
- Dr. NungNing? -Huh?

206
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,900
What are you doing here?

207
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,299
- Stole? - Are not!

208
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,260
Not.

209
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,819
Drop pen.

210
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,540
- Dropped the pen? - Um.

211
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Hey man!

212
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,619
Are you taking my case, Narin?

213
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,620
How is she? Is she okay?
Any strange symptoms?

214
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,060
Hmm?

215
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,260
Would also like to have it.

216
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,259
You can't look at my baby.

217
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,819
Not. Not that kind.

218
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,259
Nee. If you want to know,
please come and see for yourself.

219
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Can you come in?
Invite!

220
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,099
Impossible.

221
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,380
I am not the patient's therapist.

222
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,860
But my child is in your hands.
Just like that, I was reassured.

223
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,579
What's wrong with her?

224
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,540
- what? - Wait.

225
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Listen to what you say.

226
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,540
Get well soon!

227
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,420
Thanks for giving her
lots of encouragement.

228
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Also, tell her that there is
Doctor NungNing as mami here.

229
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Dr. NungNing will always be a
source of encouragement for her.

230
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,940
Please?

231
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,260
Um. That's OK.

232
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
But there she is.

233
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
When?

234
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
When what?

235
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:35,819
When will you stop...
speaking Southern? Huh?

236
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,299
Is it not? Is it okay Isan?

237
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,340
- Isan - Oh! Nonsense. Back to work.

238
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,380
How? Isn't my son cute?

239
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,180
Why can't you fall in love?

240
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,460
I'm Narin~

241
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,699
I want to thank Ink and Kaew noona so
much for always taking good care of me.

242
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,020
Oh! It's okay, Narin em

243
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,619
- Oh, you're coming back? - Yes.

244
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,219
Oh, can I take a photo together, please?

245
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,659
- Oh, okay. - Wait a minute.

246
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,179
100 guys.

247
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,699
- 100 cheats? - That's right.

248
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,740
Just kidding

249
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Open the camera.

250
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,379
Oh, can you help me take a picture?

251
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,660
Ah, okay.

252
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Tired.

253
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,420
Thank you very much!
- Yes. - Thanks.

254
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,900
- see No? - So cute.

255
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,179
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- Where? See a little bit.

256
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,459
Please excuse me first.

257
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,219
Thank you very much Doctor,

258
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,460
for always taking good care of me.

259
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,459
Pleased.

260
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,420
That's the Doctor's job.

261
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,940
For a chance,
I would like to invite Doctor to thank you.

262
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,939
But I don't know if I have free time.

263
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,380
Because...

264
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,260
My manager is fierce

265
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,499
Hey!

266
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,579
- What do you say to each other so much?
- No Yes.

267
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,979
You have that job, baby.

268
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,579
Any! Got to go. Goodbye to him.

269
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,099
Go ahead a.

270
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,379
- Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye a.

271
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,099
- Manager! - Goodbye! Goodbye!

272
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,099
- Oh, Miss Manager! - Yes.

273
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,659
Phone.

274
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,579
- Forgot your phone. - Forget.

275
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,579
- Thanks. Goodbye, Narin. - hi.

276
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,499
Let's go baby! Let's go baby!

277
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Handsome!

278
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,460
No panels.

279
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Impossible. Not always.

280
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
What should I do?

281
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,740
- Please take a picture. - But he's back.

282
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,339
What's wrong with her?

283
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,099
Impossible.

284
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,379
Do not have anything.

285
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,020
Not always.

286
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,339
What's the doctor's name?

287
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,140
Um.

288
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,499
Uh, two pictures.

289
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,139
3 panels.

290
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,100
Still always.

291
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,500
Oh my God!

292
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,060
Yes. Go on, Doctor.

293
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,179
Grandfather! Look at this.

294
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,899
My son,

295
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,899
2nd place on Twitter.

296
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Hashtag #Welcome_baby_Narin.

297
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,660
Um, good, right?

298
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,259
What's wrong with him?

299
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,900
Are your patients not happy to go home?

300
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,139
Huh?

301
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,100
Your patient is Narin. It's
Narin! It's Narin! Don't you know?

302
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,860
But Narin's face is very
similar to the angel Krit.

303
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,379
Angel Krist?

304
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,460
Uh.

305
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,899
The face is very similar.

306
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,899
And even woke up in the same way as Mes.

307
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,379
Nee. Do you think it's possible...

308
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,899
Narin is the angel Krit

309
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,259
but he can't remember me?

310
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,500
This!

311
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,500
Is it possible?

312
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,859
If it's really the real Krit angel,
he should have remembered.

313
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
That's right.

314
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,740
That's god.

315
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,060
Is it possible?

316
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Hey lady!

317
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Are you following her?

318
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,620
Where and when will her next event be held?

319
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,740
Not yet.

320
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,260
Her manager is very picky.

321
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,660
Don't like it very much.

322
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,940
But maybe I also want to give her a break.

323
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,820
What's wrong?

324
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Well... I want to know the truth is

325
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,820
Is she a real Krit angel?

326
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,780
Um.

327
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
But if he left near me.

328
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,020
I will flirt with you.

329
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,859
If there is anything, let me know.

330
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,820
Don't drink, remember to say.

331
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,539
Do we have to do this?

332
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,659
No need.

333
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,540
- Just Nothing Played.
- Oh! What's wrong with you?

334
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Huh?

335
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,500
What?

336
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,860
- Let's go. - Oh my God.

337
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
This!

338
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,900
How do you know Narin
has an event here today?

339
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,580
Who is this?

340
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:08,819
That NungNing.

341
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,860
Who is this?
That NungNing.

342
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,260
Who is this?
That NungNing.

343
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,419
- I... - Nung Ning.

344
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,179
If you want to know something,
you know it all.

345
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,419
That's Mrs. Keetava.

346
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,579
Her manager invites all the
mothers who are close to her Narin.

347
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,619
The people sitting here are all fans.

348
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,179
The shop is very nice, Ms. Kee.

349
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,980
He waited for her to record for a while,
then there was a chance.

350
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,140
Anyway, thank you very much,
Ms. Kee, for inviting me to the shop.

351
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,899
The shop is so beautiful.

352
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,099
Yes.

353
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,180
God so beautiful.

354
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,540
Thank you very much Narin
for coming to Ms. Kee's shop.

355
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,619
- It's an honor. - So cute.

356
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,780
She used to be cute.

357
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm talking to Narin.

358
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,700
Take it easy, she's working.

359
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,500
What's wrong with her?

361
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,019
Go ahead, stay there and make the price,
will you go?

362
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,659
It's her treating doctor.

363
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,139
You can go. Scat.

364
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,459
Do you go? If I don't go, I go there.

365
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,459
- Go here. - Wait.

366
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,939
Calmly go. Can you give me some
time to mentally prepare? Huh?

367
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,459
A little.

368
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,780
Prepare yourself mentally.

369
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
Sit down.

370
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,900
- All right. - Very good.

371
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,299
Sister Aoi, are you hot?

372
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,580
The sweat is gone,

373
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,580
You're fine.

374
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,620
Are you okay?

375
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,820
You're fine.

376
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Ah.

377
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Chi Aoi,

378
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:16,619
I think Aoi should go to the bathroom.

379
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,860
Lest hemorrhoids reoccur.

380
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,460
What?

381
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,820
Reach out.

382
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,740
It will probably take a long time.

383
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,739
- Scat. - It was okay?

384
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,940
Came to this country.

385
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Um...

386
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,620
Oh, Doctor?

387
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,819
- Yes. - It's so coincidental.

388
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,660
It's not the right time for
me to deal with business nearby.

389
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,676
That's what they call a coincidence.

390
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,140
Yeah, that's also true.

391
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,699
If the doctor didn't say it,
I'd think he was a fan of mine.

392
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,540
Oh! No, it is not.

393
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,339
It's not like I have an appointment
to chat with the fans here.

394
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,979
Oh, no, I'm not your fan. But...

395
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,259
After discharge from the hospital
with any unusual symptoms, or...

396
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
do you remember what?

397
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,860
No, everything is fine.

398
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,579
Oh, it's all normal. - That's right.

399
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,899
So that's good.

400
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
I can still drink alcohol.

401
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,020
This Mr. Narin,

402
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,139
I promise this is the last time
I ask stupid questions like this

403
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,300
and will never ask a
question like this again.

404
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,660
You're the angel Krist, aren't you?

405
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
Probably not.

406
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Sorry!

407
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,580
It's all my own speculation.

408
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,180
Ms. Kee, give me three servings of
fried rice and pork with omelette leaves.

409
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,580
Take it easy, she's working.

410
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,620
Add three servings of fried meat and rice,
like an omelet.

411
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,979
Oh! Do not hear.

412
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,499
Speak loudly.

413
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,460
Add three servings of fried meat and rice,
like an omelet.

414
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,499
Mr. Phum!

415
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,100
Keep your mouth shut,
the video is mixed up with the sound

416
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,180
My favorite dish is fried basil leaves.

417
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,580
Always remember that.

418
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,820
In addition to the fried rice
with basil leaves that I miss,

419
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,820
I still remember you too.

420
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,619
I miss you too.

421
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,420
Miss.

422
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,460
Mr. Phum!

423
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,100
It's good to be an angel, isn't it?

424
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,780
I won't lose to a
girl-killing doctor like you.

425
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Is this challenging you?

426
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,660
He is also really...

427
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,820
Can't be neglected at all.

428
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,820
This! If you've already started,
you won't be able to stop.

429
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,380
During all this time,

430
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,499
I'm in my body Mes

431
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,580
Do you know how patient I was?

432
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Hmm?

433
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,700
Tell me now why you are in this body.

434
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,500
Do you want me to tell the truth?

435
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,500
That station.

436
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,580
Add "one inning" first?

437
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,700
Can I stand it?

438
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,659
Hey, why am I so cruel?

439
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,540
Remember from the
beginning without telling me.

440
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,459
I really don't remember then.

441
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,500
Oh, so when do you remember?

442
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,500
So beautiful.

443
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,300
Hey, you can remember it's been
a week and you won't tell him?

444
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,860
Just pretend to forget a little.

445
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,940
Don't be angry.

446
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,339
Dental! Dental! Dental!
Don't be mad at each other!

447
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,460
Dental! Dental! Dental!

448
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,460
That's OK.

449
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,500
Do you like this ring?

450
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,380
Like you.

451
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,420
It's because it's the first gift
I've received as a human being.

452
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,140
So... give me a hug.

453
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,219
Dental! Dental!

454
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,339
You're hot. What's wrong here please?

455
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,619
EH? Then I want to hug.

456
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,820
- Refused! - Dental!

457
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,420
This guy!

458
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,779
I'm so glad we got to see each other again.

459
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Now tell me. After you disappeared

460
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,540
what happened?

461
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
That's OK.

462
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,620
Are you going to listen here?

463
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,580
Isn't it okay to kiss the first one?

464
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,340
Cheek is also okay.

465
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,020
Help...

466
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,900
Help me Narin...

467
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,820
no more...

468
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,620
comatose...

469
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,460
and be completely cured, sir.

470
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,420
If the request...

471
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,820
of children...

472
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,420
reality...

473
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,660
I promise...

474
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,020
that you will be a good doctor...

475
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,140
Always help.

476
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,140
Treat patients.

477
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,060
Ever after, sir.

478
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,420
Please help someone I love.

479
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
EH?

480
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,220
Oh!

481
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,580
Just finished talking to understand.

482
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Love?

483
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,100
Is this word a very powerful word?

484
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,540
Hey, don't tell me you can see me?

485
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,500
Oh my God!

486
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,620
It's like there's some kind of power.

487
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,740
Startle yourself.

488
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,940
Narin.

489
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,740
Mr. Narin.

490
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,540
You will end your life tonight.

491
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,579
But his body can still live on,

492
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,980
It's thanks to the ventilator to help you.

493
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,260
I don't want to die yet.

494
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,460
My mother and I are the
only two living together.

495
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,620
I have a job, I have money

496
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,180
and prepare to welcome
her mother to live with her.

497
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,420
Our lives are about to be comfortable.

498
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,060
What if I have an offer for you?

499
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,380
What suggestion is that?

500
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,500
Let an angel who is seriously ill

501
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,260
Use your body instead of Narin

502
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,020
to take care of his mother
in the best way possible.

503
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,060
Do you accept this offer?

504
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,020
What do you mean, Shan?

505
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,220
Last Blessings...

506
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,140
Then do the same thing
you did with Dr. Mes.

507
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,140
But that's against the law, isn't it?

508
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,380
I already told the president.

509
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,339
But this time won't be like
when he entered Doctor Mes .'s body

510
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,459
where you can use this body forever

511
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,060
until you run out of merit points,

512
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,340
which has nothing to do with
the lifespan of the body owner.

513
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
Position...

514
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,500
if I could see Dr. Phakphum again,

515
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,300
how will it be?

516
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,660
This is the purpose

517
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,300
for Doctor Phum to prove himself.

518
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,740
I will erase all memories

519
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,060
when he was still an angel.

520
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,580
You won't be able to remember Dr. Phakphum.

521
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,620
Until

522
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,700
Dr. Phakphum

523
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,820
prove to you that

524
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,340
he really loves you.

525
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,900
Theretofore,

526
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,780
all your memories will come back.

527
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,300
So...

528
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,539
So... if he...

529
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,620
- if he... - If he can't remember,

530
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,860
if he can't remember that he loves you,

531
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,300
you will live forever in Narin's body.

532
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,900
Until you run out of merit points.

533
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,620
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

534
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,460
Thanks for always helping me.

535
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,500
- I'm sorry. - It's OK.

536
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,180
See as

537
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,540
I help my brother who has
been next to me for a long time.

538
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,340
And finally...

539
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,260
Final...

540
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,540
love this time

541
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,140
which will lead him to the end.

542
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,380
That's the thing.

543
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,780
How can I be sure you're the angel Krit?

544
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,900
Oh, it's the same with Mes.

545
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,260
You must fight to the end. If not,
then just a little bit.

546
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,539
But, he also proved it.

547
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,460
That you really love me.

548
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,580
Now, we can be together forever, right?

549
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,140
So if...

550
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,420
If I run out of merit points,
what will happen?

551
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,420
I will disappear.

552
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,579
But there's still time.

553
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,860
You don't have to worry.

554
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,660
Wazzup?

555
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,299
Actually,
I just wanted to thank your superiors

556
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,340
for helping me get back to you.

557
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,260
I took him to see him.

558
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,380
I don't even know how
to contact him anymore.

559
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,099
Now, I'm not an angel anymore.

560
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,820
I'm just a human being.

561
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:44,180
Um. Hey, if it's human,
how can it disappear forever?

562
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,180
I thought there had to be a way to
keep you from disappearing forever.

563
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,540
Or try to find a way to ask your superiors.

564
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,620
Or go back to being an angel.

565
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
Do not need.

566
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,500
This is good enough.

567
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,300
For me,

568
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,620
as the Bodhi tree angel, granting
wishes to people for hundreds of years.

569
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,420
That I'm back to see you again.

570
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,100
It was the best wish a
human could ever receive.

571
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,300
I don't ask for anything more.

572
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,540
Mr. Shan?

573
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,180
Mr. Shan?

574
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,620
Mr. Shan?

575
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:13,020
OUT OF GRANT POINTS FOR DIVING ALL FOR
HELPING THE CHILDREN INTO THE HUMAN BODY.

576
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,140
Incorrect.

577
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,740
Mr. Shan!

578
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,300
Mr. Shan!

579
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,940
Mr. Shan!

580
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,060
Mr. Shan!

581
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,140
Mr. Shan!

582
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,540
Mr. Shan.

583
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,860
What happen?

584
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,340
I dream...

585
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,740
I dreamed that I went to
an empty angel's office.

586
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,700
Already...

587
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,300
Then it looks like Mr. Shan

588
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,460
Mr. Shan has disappeared.

589
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,740
Let me enter this body.

590
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,140
Em.

591
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,940
Don't think so much.

592
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:06,180
Don't forget that you can't
enter the world of angels anymore.

593
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,140
What you see may just be a nightmare.

594
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,340
Every human, every angel,

595
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,940
are born with the task
that they have to do.

596
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,940
Now,

597
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,860
My mission was also
successful at the same time.

598
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,300
Mr. President,

599
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,860
you always see through everything,

600
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,060
every life,

601
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,460
He has assigned tasks
to each of us already.

602
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,819
I want to stay with you for a long time.

603
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,300
- Is it not possible? Just bring it to the front door.
- See you in the evening.

604
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,140
Warm food.

605
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,020
This is the hospital.

606
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,019
- Go here. - Goodbye.

607
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,020
Goodbye.

608
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,379
HOW TO STOP LOOKING FORGET

609
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:39,380
HOW TO SEE GOTHER
