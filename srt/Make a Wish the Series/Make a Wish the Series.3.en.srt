00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The followings are auto translated subtitles.
Manual translated version will be updated later.

2
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,020
This. This.

3
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:03,299
Our normal duty, to put it simply, is...

4
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,940
Humans will have reincarnation right?

5
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,660
Okay.

6
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,901
Please excuse me for a moment..

7
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,100
Use my body?

8
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,860
It's OK.

9
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,579
But I have an exchange.

10
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,220
Promise you'll help find the truth about
the accident where I fell down the stairs.

11
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,340
I like Mr. Phum.

12
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
Why can't I stop laughing?

13
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,019
Don't get too close, human doctor.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,500
Love again.

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,140
Is love so important to humans?

16
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,540
I'm only giving you six
days to do this quest.

17
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,540
If you don't finish,

18
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,260
you will have to die

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,060
with will dissolve with this body.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,180
Huh?

21
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,300
FIVE DAYS LEFT

22
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,460
Oi.

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,740
How was last night?

24
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,220
How do I come back?

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Turn back?

26
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Diarrhea, right?

27
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Out of soul.

28
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,700
The diarrhea is talking,

29
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,220
is... how much poop... doesn't stop right?

30
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,980
Drinking beer right? Beer makes diarrhea.

31
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,980
The smell is really rotten.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,100
I never smelled like
this when I was an angel.

33
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,540
It's like they say it smells
like a dead body, isn't it?

34
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,220
You shouldn't be doing this.

35
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,340
Normally,
I don't go out very often at night.

36
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,220
And then I just got out of the hospital.

37
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,260
My parents couldn't sleep last night.

38
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Uh.

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
Sorry.

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,580
Then go investigate your accident.

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,860
No matter how much you investigate,
you shouldn't drink so much.

42
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
Know.

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,100
But... now that,

44
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,100
Can you go out for me?

45
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,099
Do you know? Drinking a lot of beer
is not good because it affects the body.

46
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,459
Especially the liver.

47
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,819
In addition, liver enzymes, AST, ALT
are high. AST, ALT: Enzymes in the liver

48
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,396
Cirrhosis: Liver cirrhosis
Liver cirrhosis may occur.

49
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,700
Plus it's not good for the blood sugar.

50
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,860
Get out first!

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,099
Here's the breakfast.

52
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,740
- Thank her mother. - Yes.

53
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,740
The intestines are always.

54
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,780
Wait...

55
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,139
Yellow.

56
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Nice.
Red.

57
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,899
Wealth.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Green.
Support.

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,820
Wait a minute, son.

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,660
- Just a little, a little bit. - Yes.

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,660
Just die, baby.

62
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,180
It's... it's awesome.

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,900
Bow your head, baby, bow quickly.

64
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,420
The sacred treasure will
bless the whole person.

65
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,020
- Namo amitabud. - Mo Buddha, son.

66
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,020
So... I beg your pardon.

67
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,020
Oh wait.

68
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
Yes?

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,700
Left in front of you.

70
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,700
Left lead.

71
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,060
Left leading?

72
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,220
Left lead, child.

73
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Right.

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,339
- Alright. - Keep it up, kid, keep it up.

75
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,459
Left lead all the way.

76
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,540
That's right, son, go.

77
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,060
Left leads, right follows. Left baby, left.

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
- Left lead? - Left to lead, son.

79
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,700
Knowing that, I chose the old
woman's body from the beginning.

80
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,636
Willing to wear the clothes
my mother bought me again.

81
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,460
- That's it. - I can't believe it.

82
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,940
I don't know if I think to myself.

83
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,180
But it looks like my son has
changed a bit compared to before, dad.

84
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,460
Come on, mother.

85
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,300
It could be due to the aftershocks
from the head impact as well.

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,420
But it's good like this,
my baby looks much more radiant.

87
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,139
- True. - Ah.

88
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,939
- Left to lead his father.
- Left to lead its mother.

89
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,220
- Left lead.
- Lead all the time, his mother.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Look.

91
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,460
- Yes! - Hey you.

92
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,900
What way are you going?

93
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,700
Nervously drunk last night?

94
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,940
Let it go.

95
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,539
Hey, whatever you do,
take care of people's bodies.

96
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,219
I am a good child.

97
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,020
Lest her parents suspect.

98
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,620
About the mission yet?

99
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,220
At work, talk to me. Go.

100
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,940
So now to start from what?
How do I stop seeing ghosts?

101
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Then how did you try?

102
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
Tell me, try it.

103
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:15,660
PRAY

104
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,580
I've tried everything,
nothing seems to fix it.

105
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,979
That means trial and error.

106
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,100
What's wrong?

107
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,859
Then people see ghosts from childhood,

108
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,140
may be born from something that
connects them to the world of the dead.

109
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,299
Maybe it's because of the angel.

110
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,539
Or is it because of something
they or their parents hold on to.

111
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,139
Or maybe they've had a
near-death experience before.

112
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,179
So... so where do you start?

113
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,259
Then you said it's only six days?

114
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,940
Five-day.

115
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:01,539
Huh? Five days huh?

116
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,699
Those five days?

117
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,939
Yes, but no matter what.

118
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,019
Starting from my break room,
then to my house,

119
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,300
other places mentioned below.

120
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,499
Keep it like this.

121
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,980
Whatever God says, just do it.

122
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,780
Namo amitabud!

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,340
Namo amitabud!

124
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,900
All good food.

125
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,939
Angel Krit is running away from work again.

126
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,059
Every dish is delicious.

127
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,100
Running away from work won't help.

128
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,460
Wow, I don't know what to put on.

129
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,340
Ever won the lottery?

130
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,020
Won yet? Never won.

131
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Just stay there and reapply.

132
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,539
Use white chalk for better luck.

133
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
Must use baby chalk.

134
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,700
I told you not to use cold powder!!!

135
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,340
The chicken skin is all raised.

136
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,580
But where did the angel Krit go?

137
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
Call the angel Krit and see.

138
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,460
Call to try.

139
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,380
What the hell?

140
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,740
Did you change your number, angel Krit?

141
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,980
Never been contacted.

142
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,620
Or is it the wrong number?

143
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,220
- 4 5 6 7. - Hey! This!

144
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Did she hear anything?

145
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,419
Correct.

146
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,699
4 5 6 7.

147
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,979
Four numbers.

148
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,939
Only four numbers, how to play?

149
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,539
Earn more, earn more.

150
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,620
Keep searching.

151
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,100
Eighty six.

152
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,380
4 5 6 7 8 6, this number is standard.

153
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,539
- 4 5 6 7 8 6. - 4 5 6 7 8 6.

154
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,899
Oh! There are enough six numbers.

155
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,259
6, 6, 6, 6... rich.

156
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,939
Scat!!!

157
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,579
- Namo amitabud! - Uncle, uncle.

158
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,019
Uncle, uncle, this is the Krit number.

159
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,819
Uncle... don't buy too much!

160
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,140
Just hopeless.

161
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
The number is correct but
the call cannot be made.

162
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,380
Or go out abroad?

163
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,819
Oiiii!!!

164
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,380
It's too much, angel Krit.

165
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,619
Work is not done.

166
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,100
Must tell...

167
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,980
Oh.

168
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,780
Why don't you go?

169
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,460
Probably overweight.

170
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,980
Well, you can go by yourself.

171
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,540
Hey you!

172
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,299
What's with the black glasses?

173
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,939
- Hey? - YES.

174
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:44,619
Well... I'm afraid I'll
run into ghosts by mistake.

175
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,099
If the ghosts knew I saw them,
they would follow me everywhere.

176
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Ohhh!!! Older brother.

177
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,859
With me,
you don't have to be afraid of ghosts.

178
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,700
I have more power than ghosts,
only ghosts should fear me.

179
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,580
What are you laughing?

180
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,220
Laugh for strength.

181
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,099
But... wouldn't it be true, would it?

182
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Um.

183
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,980
I don't really see it.

184
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,979
That's the real top!

185
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,499
Also... it's very
comfortable without glasses.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Um.

187
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,300
How are you?

188
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,020
Do I look handsome?

189
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Also temporary.

190
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
Also temporary?

191
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,579
Hey, do you think I'm pretty?

192
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,779
Self-indulgence!

193
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,860
Hey there.

194
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,980
Boss kha... that, khrap!

195
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,299
Angel Krit is gone again, Boss.

196
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,780
Yes, Boss.

197
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,899
Called no answer,
text message didn't answer.

198
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,740
I don't know what to do... khrap.

199
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,500
No more pretending to be forced.

200
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,340
The fact that Badin has to accept the
request for help, is it reasonable, Boss?

201
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,459
Let me handle for "kha".

202
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,460
EH...

203
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Khrap.

204
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,619
Boss!

205
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,940
Or does Boss really know where
the angel Krit disappeared?

206
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,940
Boss is thinking about helping him, right?

207
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,740
I'm not okay, Boss.

208
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,579
Why so? Just my tree... oh... long nails.

209
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,499
Only my tree...

210
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,980
Many people have come to beg.

211
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,699
You're not going to give me a break,
are you?

212
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,620
Wait and see, going to sue
the Angel Labor Union for real.

213
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,700
You can go back then.

214
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,180
Boss!!!!

215
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,820
Can't you wait a minute?

216
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,300
Waiting.

217
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,820
- Not Boss! - Oh, is that so?

218
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
It's really good to beg, isn't it?

219
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,260
This temple is also not going to close or
not, to stop begging and messing up all day.

220
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,580
Gotta help again.

221
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,780
Who wants to replace the task of
receiving merit in the old tree?

222
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,700
Anyone who wants to work can work overtime.

223
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,940
Krist, Krist.

224
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Not here.

225
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Wow.

226
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,100
It's better to call God Jum.

227
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,700
Ha luuu!!

228
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,220
God Jum, what are you doing? Can eight?

229
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,020
Hello!

230
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,219
You know who I'm talking about, right?

231
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,380
Do you know now the angel Krit...

232
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,020
Angel Krist.

233
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,819
It's not here anymore, it's gone forever.

234
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,579
I think Boss Shan is
definitely helping him, God Jum.

235
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,819
Know where he disappeared to,
but definitely help him.

236
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,339
Boss Shan probably wouldn't do that.

237
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,539
As captain for 500 years,

238
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,299
After going through many things,
Boss must have his reasons.

239
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,860
So if that reason is against the
law of angels, what about you, Jum?

240
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,819
Oh! There's no way,
who would want to be demoted,

241
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,819
Or disappear into the air?

242
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,660
It's not worth it.

243
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,260
Stop! Go to work.

244
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,259
So in short,
is it called to support or to scold?

245
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,300
- No regrets, okay!
- Ok!

246
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,979
Dear Mr. Chairman!

247
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,819
Angel Badin has reported the
matter of angel Krit again!

248
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,420
Tell me how should I continue?

249
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,300
Take orders, Mr. Chairman.

250
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,860
What are you?

251
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,220
Wait bro.

252
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,819
Hey you! Is it floating?

253
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Drill...

254
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,019
To this extent? It's only the third floor.

255
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,900
Walk from the parking lot.

256
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,340
Tired is tired, hot is hot.

257
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,019
It really makes people miserable.

258
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh my God!!!!! Hey you!!!!!

259
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,660
Mes's body is not old yet.

260
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,139
You're one of those comfort junkies,
aren't you?

261
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,459
Oh, that's right. If you're an angel,
you just need to transform, right?

262
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,580
That's right.

263
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,500
Just think about it.

264
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,340
There is no need to go like this,
it takes both strength and time.

265
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,779
Nee. Is there no elevator?

266
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,460
Broken. Being an angel or nagging?

267
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
Hey man!

268
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,220
I'm an angel. Respect each other a little.

269
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Yes!!!

270
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,060
But now,

271
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,780
you are human.

272
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,419
Still stubborn.

273
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,020
Be human first.

274
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,859
Watch out I'm not helping anymore.

275
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,660
If it weren't for the merit points...

276
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,700
Oh, here you are.

277
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,499
My room.

278
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,740
Ha ha ha.

279
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,300
What are you laughing at?

280
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,020
What are you laughing?

281
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Room number.

282
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,580
Uh. This is my room.

283
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Doctor Mes.

284
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,180
Did you see anything?

285
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,380
Are you nervous because you
first came to Dr. Phum's room?

286
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,460
Calm down first.

287
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,660
Will you start right away?

288
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Start what?

289
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,980
Find that item.

290
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,379
Uh... b... start looking for things.

291
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Then let's start

292
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,019
You keep looking. Your room, isn't it?

293
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,379
Ok. Ok. Okay.

294
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,820
So you find this room, I'll find that room.

295
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,180
Oi!!! Room...

296
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,940
too much stuff.

297
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,180
I don't know what the box is.

298
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,180
Is there any stuff here?

299
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,420
Fuck!

300
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
This is...

301
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,740
Hey you! Did you find anything?

302
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
What's wrong with you?

303
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,740
Hey... c... you!

304
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,539
Do you have to play that big?

305
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,659
What's wrong with you?

306
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,579
What have you got? Crazy?

307
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,620
Oh my God!!!! Are the clothes that white?

308
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,740
I also know to chase ghosts.

309
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
Oh my God! You're more like a ghost.

310
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,740
There is also rice salt.

311
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,020
What is this? Bamboo leaves, lemon, coconut,
grapefruit, pumpkin, watermelon, turn!

312
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,819
This! What are you?

313
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,620
Oh my God. My image is gone.

314
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,619
Oh!!! What nonsense is that? Put it in.

315
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,780
What's wrong with you?

316
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,660
Just kidding like a kid.

317
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,019
Yours isn't it?

318
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,700
Oh!!!!

319
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,340
So what is this?

320
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,219
What box is so much?

321
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,580
I don't know, I can't remember either.

322
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,860
Don't say...

323
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,620
What are you?

324
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,460
What is this?

325
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,460
That rubber chicken.

326
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Rubber chicken?
Uh.

327
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,859
Used to chase ghosts?

328
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,619
Right. Well... the crest is
used to ward off evil spirits.

329
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,700
I believe...

330
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,699
It's a cockroach tree.

331
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,540
That's it! Is that a real doctor?

332
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Chase ghosts?

333
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,580
To chase to see.

334
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,580
Where? Go away, mama.

335
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
Where?

336
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,900
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

337
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,540
Warts.

338
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,619
- Oh!!! Bother! - Where. His chase.

339
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,619
- Go away, mama. - That's enough, man.

340
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,180
Give it to me. Bring it back here.

341
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,220
Hungry.

342
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Huh?

343
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,780
Well... that's hungry.

344
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,059
Well... you... put it full of rice.

345
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,220
Obviously hungry.

346
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,740
Go! Then go eat together.

347
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,979
Eat what?

348
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,339
Then... Let's go eat there.
Hurry up. I'm hungry, too.

349
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Hurry up!

350
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,659
What is this? Shake yourself.

351
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,860
What is it? Then he was surprised,
I was also surprised.

352
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,340
Hey you.

353
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,019
This shop is awesome. You must call...

354
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,900
Stop.

355
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:25,100
No need. I know.

356
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,420
Stir-fried minced meat
with flavor like omelet?

357
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,620
Correct.

358
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,819
When I was an angel,

359
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,819
and see people like to order this dish.

360
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,340
What's so good?

361
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,460
He looked.

362
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,980
It's so delicious, heaven and earth, man.

363
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,540
I know why people like to order this.

364
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,699
Che.

365
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,979
For five servings of fried minced
meat with flavor like an omelet.

366
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,019
- Yes. - More water.

367
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Neck.

368
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,499
- Hey you. - Huh?

369
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,540
Did you eat it all?

370
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
YES.

371
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,700
Four more discs.

372
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,260
Stomach upset.

373
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,939
It's too good to go.

374
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,740
But now it looks like my
stomach is about to explode.

375
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,060
Watch him eat.

376
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,979
If you eat 10 plates,
why can't you be full?

377
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,660
Hey man, humans only eat enough.

378
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,300
- Really? - YES.

379
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,819
I see that when people bring offerings
to worship, they also bring a lot.

380
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,779
I just thought that, for humans,
everything must be a lot.

381
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,820
Eat a lot, visit a lot.

382
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,699
There are people, life is extremely hard

383
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,260
but still bring many things to worship.

384
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,260
Do you know why?

385
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,460
Because people believe that
sacred things can help them.

386
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,219
No matter how much they try to pay,
no matter how much money they spend,

387
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,500
they also accept, if there is
really no way to solve the problem.

388
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,100
Just like me, man.

389
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,539
Everything happens
because the cause is sown.

390
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,059
There are people who get what
they want because of themselves too.

391
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,500
Have a good disposition
and pray earnestly like him.

392
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,220
Please pay. Go here.

393
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,300
Hey you.

394
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,380
Older brother.

395
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,499
Buy me some clothes, man.

396
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,019
What's wrong with you?

397
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,660
- Huh? - Please.

398
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:36,220
Why do you say go on a mission?

399
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,899
This outfit looks like it wants to die.

400
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,020
Nah, nah.

401
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Uncle.

402
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
This!

403
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,500
Take all this place?

404
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,580
Hey you.

405
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,580
Is it too much?

406
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Uncle!

407
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,260
How do you feel?

408
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,140
Also... eh.

409
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,700
Uh...

410
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,740
How do you feel? Am I handsome?

411
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,059
Pay for it. All.

412
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,180
That's it! That's it! Nee.

413
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,979
That's it! Wait you. What else?

414
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,260
Dude, let me have a look.

415
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,739
I really want to play.

416
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,819
When I was an angel,
it was fun to see humans playing.

417
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,380
Nah.

418
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,420
Yeah, fine, but hurry up.

419
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,980
Here you are.

420
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,419
Hey, try it. Insert the coin.

421
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,579
Then rotate.

422
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,140
Eggs will fall out.

423
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,660
Um. That's right.

424
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,300
YES.

425
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,380
That's it.

426
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,180
Humans have no special powers,

427
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,180
don't know what will happen.

428
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,900
Every day is like opening an egg.

429
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,700
If you can open good things,
that's also fun.

430
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,020
But if you open a bad item,
you will be sad.

431
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,180
Take turns back and forth.

432
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,499
So what if opening a ring like this?

433
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,100
Is it considered good?

434
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,540
Um...

435
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,500
Also...

436
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,860
You can still rotate.

437
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,460
Then...

438
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,620
sure good.

439
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,300
Hey you.

440
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,780
Where are you going? Huh?

441
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,260
We've wasted a lot of time playing.

442
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,940
When are you going to go to work?

443
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,859
Now then.

444
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,180
Go to your house.

445
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,660
Oh hey, hey man.

446
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,180
What is it, say go, go.

447
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,460
That's it! That's it!

448
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,299
Huh? Person hit by a car.

449
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,019
Anyone can help, help, hurry.

450
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,700
Help, someone got hit by a car.

451
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,819
Is he okay?

452
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,620
I'm sorry.

453
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,180
Angel boy!

454
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,659
Can someone help me?

455
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,699
I am me. I am an emergency doctor.

456
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,860
Paramedic: Emergency doctor
Quick, come here!

457
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,219
- Hold my head, please. - Okay.

458
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,219
Help me hold my leg.

459
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,340
Yes.

460
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,219
With hold this place. Then flip together.

461
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,220
- Ready! - Flip it! 1, 2, 3!

462
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,060
Hey you! Hey you! Hey you!

463
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,979
Hi, report an emergency.

464
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,379
A man about 25 years old was hit by a car.

465
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,939
Currently unconscious, bleeding head.

466
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,379
The pulse is still beating.
Urgently need an ambulance.

467
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,700
Want to come here! Yes!

468
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,340
The patient is currently wheezing. Move your jaw.
Stridor: Wheezing sound caused by airway obstruction.

469
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,099
Jaw thrust: Open the
airway by lifting the jaw.

470
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm sorry! Can someone
help me put on the wound?

471
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,300
Come here! Click here to help.

472
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,380
Ok.

473
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,140
He must be mine.

474
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,900
No more bleeding, no deformity.

475
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,420
Uh... I'm a doctor. Can
I get in the car with you?

476
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,179
No need to go anywhere,
man. Then they went to the hospital.

477
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,100
Hey... you want me to
leave the patient like that?

478
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,380
That's right! That's because it's your job.

479
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,419
So I ask permission to be a doctor
who sees ghosts to save people.

480
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,300
Better than being a doctor,
letting patients die in front of you.

481
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Go go!

482
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Go go!

483
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,516
See electromechanical separation. Perform CPR. CPR:
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients with cardiac arrest.

484
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,300
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...

485
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,619
Come back, man.

486
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,740
1 2 3 4 5...

487
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,900
How is the patient?

488
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,460
Hello teacher!

489
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:30,699
I'm a resident doctor here. Because
by chance I saw a patient hit by a car

490
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,899
So I asked permission
to go in the car with me.

491
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,179
The patient was unconscious
and suffered a severe head injury.

492
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,259
On the way here, the patient had a cardiac
arrest, so I did CPR right in the car.

493
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,059
- Okay! Let me continue watching. - Yes.

494
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,899
- CPR is enough for two minutes.
- Please check the circuit a bit.

495
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,340
Palm, wait a minute.

496
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,739
The patient has a cardiac arrest. Electrocardiogram shows
electromyography dissociation. Give 1mg of adrenaline.

497
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,059
1mg adrenaline rush.
Endotracheal tube 1.5 immediately.

498
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Scat! Scat! Prepare to go!

499
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,740
Yes!

500
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,380
Here's 1mg of adrenaline.

501
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,300
Here is the tube.

502
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,740
Withdraw!

503
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,819
CPR is enough for two minutes.

504
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,580
The pulse is not beating. Electrocardiogram shows
electromyography dissociation. Continue CPR.

505
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,300
Hey, stop it.

506
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Uh...

507
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,100
Please... sorry.

508
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,180
Good luck.

509
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,580
Never mind seeing ghosts until you die.

510
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,940
But didn't complete the mission

511
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,939
merit points will also run out.

512
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,180
And can't go back to
being an angel anymore.

513
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,780
Go to the hospital. Go to the hospital.

514
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,700
Hospital!

515
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,980
Fuck!

516
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,020
It's not a hospital!

517
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,100
Once again!

518
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
Hospital!

519
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,220
Oh!

520
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,100
When it's time to use the angel rank,
it's not enough.

521
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,260
Humans are human.

522
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,220
Taxi!

523
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,700
Why is it so difficult to be human?

524
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,939
Where do you hurry to go?

525
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,620
Isn't it empty?

526
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,660
Go to the central hospital.

527
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,340
Don't touch this person anymore.

528
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,980
Live in two different worlds.
Don't cling to each other anymore.

529
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,380
Are not!

530
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
What's up?

531
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,019
He just ran away. Anyway,
come back again to see.

532
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,299
At least he didn't bring this
person's soul with him for now.

533
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,020
Patient has restored
spontaneous circulation.

534
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,980
How can you leave me at the market?

535
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,619
Today we have wasted time in vain.

536
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,540
Nothing is progressing.

537
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,660
You also shop all day.

538
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,540
I am not right to blame myself.

539
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,339
Then he was just busy
helping someone he didn't know.

540
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,900
So how can I leave people alone?

541
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,579
After saving people, you just let them go.

542
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,220
Even if I have to help till the end?

543
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,299
Take care of yourself
before taking care of others.

544
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,900
- Hey you! That is the life of that person.
- This is also your life.

545
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,979
I'm here on duty because of you!

546
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,939
And also for yourself! Your merit points
are running out! You didn't come to help me!

547
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,940
It's about helping yourself!

548
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,540
I'm sorry.

549
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,620
Because I was too harsh just now
and because I left you at the market.

550
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,580
But I want to make sure she's safe.

551
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,540
Worrying about each other?

552
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,379
Hey you! Can you help
me talk to that ghost?

553
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,860
Say let go of her?

554
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,380
Then we will do the next mission.

555
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,980
How?

556
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,500
Do you like that person so much?

557
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,300
Why do you keep forcing me to
help this one and help the other?

558
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,500
What's wrong with you?

559
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,179
Are you jealous of me?

560
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,899
Hey, I don't like her the way you think.

561
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,420
I really want to help her.

562
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,980
You see it too,
don't you? How scary that ghost is.

563
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Go, man.

564
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,340
That's OK.

565
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,380
Wait here first.

566
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,580
Do you have a consultation
appointment today?

567
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,740
Right.

568
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,420
What do you follow me to do?

569
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,059
That guy, following him since he was in the
pub, is he going to follow people everywhere?

570
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,540
Let go and reincarnate.

571
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,820
Impossible!

572
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,860
Try to love someone so much,

573
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,860
You can't let go of that person either.

574
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,620
Stop meddling between me and my lover.

575
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,700
Hey you!

576
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,380
How come you can do that?

577
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,980
Normally not.

578
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,620
I do not know.

579
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,979
Luckily I ran after him.

580
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,300
Otherwise,
he would have been killed by a ghost.

581
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,940
Let's go.

582
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,380
Older brother!

583
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,380
Mr. Shan!

584
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,220
Stop it!

585
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,620
What I do is my business!

586
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,820
What is this?

587
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,540
I just want to bring my lover,

588
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,020
why interfere?

589
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,299
And he didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,259
Because of the promise that the
two of them once gave to each other.

591
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,140
That they will always be
together in life or death.

592
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,900
I know that too.

593
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,860
So what are you doing in my way?

594
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,219
Because if you do,

595
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,820
The two of you won't be
able to be together anymore.

596
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,820
Lie!

597
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,500
Angels never lie!

598
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,340
If you want to be alone for
the rest of your life, please!

599
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,740
Bank must go with me!

600
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,780
I'll take him with me!

601
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,139
You still haven't
realized your mistake yet?

602
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
Healthy people,

603
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,540
life span up to several decades,

604
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,300
but got sick and got worse and worse,

605
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,619
because the evil spirit of
the lover is always around.

606
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,179
If he had to die for you,

607
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,980
Do you think he will be happy?

608
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,900
Lovers should stay together, right?

609
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,260
I don't want to leave him.

610
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,379
I want the two of us
to be together forever.

611
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,620
Nothing is forever.

612
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,700
Even angels

613
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,740
will also have to disappear

614
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,380
someday.

615
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,220
So how long do I have to wait?

616
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,380
Is there still time?
Until I can see him again.

617
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,260
I miss him.

618
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,420
I want to be by his side.

619
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,620
Please, angel.

620
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,900
I really love Bank.

621
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:01,100
People who belong to each other, no matter how
many lives they live, they can't escape each other.

622
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,180
Take advantage of the time to
do meritorious deeds together,

623
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,340
so that we can quickly be
reincarnated and be next to each other.

624
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,020
But even if I wanted to go alone,

625
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,020
I can't go either.

626
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,620
- For me...
- Bank apologized for keeping Tip.

627
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,620
Or is...

628
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,420
no matter how much you want
to give up reincarnation,

629
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,740
but being held back by suffering...

630
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,460
so he couldn't go.

631
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,579
Don't tell people who won't let go...

632
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,020
not that ghost,

633
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,580
who loves him?

634
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,260
This is the...

635
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,900
what people call "haunted".

636
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,300
Tip go.

637
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,460
Bank apologizes for keeping Tip.

638
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,540
The Bank itself cannot forget Tip.

639
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,940
No need to worry about the Bank.

640
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,300
Bank can live.

641
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,340
Let's escape, Tip.

642
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,740
Sorry Bank.

643
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,260
It turned out that Mr. Shan
already knew everything.

644
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,180
That's why I brought the soul of a person
named Bank to tell the ghost clearly.

645
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,620
That's good.

646
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,660
It's finally over.

647
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,820
Um.

648
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,540
- Sorry. - Sorry.

649
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,060
I'm sorry, I'm a bit harsh today.

650
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,620
You're not wrong.

651
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,700
That I am too selfish,
only thinking about merit points.

652
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,180
I shouldn't have said that to you at all.

653
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,060
Sorry.

654
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,420
Thanks for helping that brother.

655
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,060
You were also in danger because of me.

656
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,020
Who? Who's in danger?
It's just me giving in.

657
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,340
Yes. Talented angel.

658
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,500
So let's do our best in the remaining days.

659
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,220
Heal it okay?

660
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,060
What's wrong with you?

661
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,979
I don't know this ritual.

662
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,660
When coaxing each other to do good

663
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,940
people will do this.

664
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,660
Know that.

665
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,980
Ah,
but how did you touch that ghost just now?

666
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:52,060
I think the reason you see ghosts
is definitely not a normal cause.

667
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,620
If so, please help me find the cause.

668
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,539
Why am I in a difficult
situation like yours?

669
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,459
So many people want to pray,

670
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,580
still limited in time.

671
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,820
- We were a couple in a previous life...
- Chai Muang Sing?

672
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,260
So good? How I know?

673
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,339
- I can't think of it, you're so good that I can't think of it.
- Oh, so slow.

674
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,220
How do you know that?

675
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:42,260
Do you even know about Chai Muang Sing?

676
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,740
FOUR DAYS LEFT

677
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,100
This is my house.

678
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,900
This is my room.

679
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,980
- Just try to find it. Try and see. - Um.

680
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,379
Doctor Mes.

681
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,179
Are you nervous about
getting into someone's bedroom?

682
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,220
That's enough.

683
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,779
Childhood,

684
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,140
when other people know I can see ghosts

685
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,580
consider me a geek,

686
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,580
so no one dared to play with me.

687
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,060
So my mother bought a new toy for me
to play with so I wouldn't be lonely.

688
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,579
But actually there's a lot more.

689
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,100
But I don't know where my mother kept it.

690
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,220
What do you like?

691
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,419
- Um. - I give it to you.

692
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,860
Make memorize.

693
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,700
Can you see anything?

694
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,379
You didn't keep your promise to me.

695
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,860
- Dr. Mes calm down. - Get out of my body!

696
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,539
I will get my life back.

697
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:14,220
The president is the one
who sees and knows all.

698
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,619
Each life has been assigned its own task.

699
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,619
Dao, Dao tell me directly.

700
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,579
Dao knows about his accident right?

701
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,379
Are you coming to play with me?

702
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,299
This ghost's power might follow you...

703
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,419
How do you know? Why? Who said?

704
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,180
Or is?

705
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:34,459
I will successfully complete
the real mission, right?

706
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,739
But the condition is not to get
closer to Dr. Phakphum than this.

707
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,540
Do you like me?
