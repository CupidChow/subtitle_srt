2
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,420
How are you?

3
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:07,740
Che, for 5 plates of fried minced
meat and fragrant like an omelet.

4
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,660
Give it to me.

5
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,380
Gotta help again.

6
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Hey you.

7
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,699
Mr. Shan.

8
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Let's escape, Tip.

9
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,100
When coaxing each other to do good

10
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,540
people will do this.

11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,300
GREETTING CARD

12
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
Not found.

13
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,620
Nah, you. Drink water first.

14
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,660
Sorry my fridge doesn't have red water.

15
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,020
Is this toying with me?

16
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,580
Seeing that he was an angel, I thought he liked
drinking red water, just to be refreshing.

17
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,940
Drink other water is fine,
only drink red water with diabetes now.

18
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,580
Oh, surprise.

19
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,340
Angels know diabetes too.

20
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,300
Over the top!!

21
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
Oh, Phum.

22
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,900
Oh, parents.

23
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,580
Hello sir.

24
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,099
Why don't you tell your
mother when you go home?

25
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,580
Always remember.

26
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,980
Because I came to make
a surprise to startle it.

27
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,540
Ah, this is...

28
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,900
Me, Mes, is Phum's junior doctor. With...

29
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,100
Always Phum's new lover.

30
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,300
My lover?

31
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
That's right.

32
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
Hello sir.

33
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Hey you!

34
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,020
What are you doing?

35
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,060
Then say hello to your parents.

36
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,100
If so, then stay and have lunch together,
baby, let me go to work.

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,540
It's OK.

38
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,659
If so,
then take your lover to sit and wait first.

39
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,259
Give mom time to cook.

40
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
It's OK.

41
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,300
Let... Phum go help me.

42
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,579
Lover huh? Right?

43
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,939
Oh, darling.

44
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,700
Lover.

45
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,099
Lovely ha.

46
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Let's go.

47
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
Oh!

48
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Uhh.
Lover?

49
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
That lover.

50
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,940
We have to look close for my parents
to answer questions about my past.

51
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,060
Go ahead, honey, follow soon.

52
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,020
This hat, Phum keep it very carefully.

53
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,420
Mom used to take it to the laundry,
refusing to let her touch it.

54
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,700
Mom!

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,820
That's true.

56
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,980
How are you?

57
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,259
If you are free today,
how can you come back?

58
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,540
Oh, then Phum wants to visit my parents.

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,700
More importantly,
my lover wants to see my parents again.

60
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,700
I have a question.

61
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
To be...

62
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,579
Did your parents ever go to ask
for blessings from angels anywhere?

63
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,699
Or did Mr. Phum ever have a
near-life or death experience?

64
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,980
Or have you ever moved house?

65
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,020
Because... Me Mes is a funny person.

66
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,180
That's it, naturally speaking so fast.

67
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,419
Then Mr. Phum said he could ask
his parents if he had anything.

68
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,619
Well, yes, but it doesn't have
to be that fast. Is that right?

69
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,259
Uh, how can this be?

70
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,980
I answer my lover a little bit.

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Then...

72
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,979
In fact, I have never taken Phum to
pray for peace or for blessings anywhere.

73
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,580
- They used to be sent to do charity at the temple, right?
- Yes.

74
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,259
When I was a child,
I wasn't really at this house.

75
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,660
I moved house once.

76
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,820
This house I find it larger,
more comfortable.

77
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,660
With privacy should move here.

78
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,820
If asked,
have you ever nearly lost your life?

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,859
Phum it used to be when he was 5 years old?

80
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,619
- Once fell into the water. Do you remember me?
- A. That's right.

81
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,619
- Oh, my son? - That's right.

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
5 years old.

83
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Can't remember.

84
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Oiiiiii.

85
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,819
At that time, he almost died,
fortunately someone saved him.

86
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,500
If not sure Phum is asleep,
can't swim anymore.

87
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,380
So... Where is that?

88
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,739
In the village next to the old house.

89
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,620
But I'm not sure if not now.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,260
- Oh, eat rice. - That's it.

91
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,980
That lucky one.

92
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,340
Hey, this one,
my mother's skills are always there.

93
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,339
Selling good stuff.

94
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
Grandma's recipe.

95
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,940
Delicious, no duplicate,
can't remember the recipe.

96
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,860
This guy.

97
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,420
- Chicken. - To scoop.

98
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,180
Or do you have to cut it even smaller?

99
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,380
Here you go, bring it back to eat.

100
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,819
Thanks.

101
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,620
Let Phum keep eating tonight.

102
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,260
Please go ahead.

103
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,099
Drive home carefully.

104
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Yes.

105
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,180
Will be back to visit often.

106
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,900
Goodbye.

107
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Goodbye.

108
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,940
I go here.

109
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,620
Go, child.

110
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,180
I go.

111
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,020
Bye bye.

112
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,860
What happen?

113
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,500
I thought you would get
acquainted with Dr. Nung Ning.

114
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,500
Go on a date with that kid again.

115
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,060
We've talked before, haven't we?

116
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,300
Will not talk about this anymore.

117
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,580
My happiness,

118
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,580
is our happiness.

119
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,140
But we only have one child.

120
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,500
I want you to marry a girl.

121
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Have children like everyone else.

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,740
I have to accept that.

123
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,340
My child from childhood until now,

124
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,620
if you don't count ghost sightings,

125
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,059
My child is always a good child.

126
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,300
Work hard, try to learn.

127
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,660
And grow up to be a good doctor,

128
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
a talented doctor.

129
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,020
So you should accept
your child for who he is!

130
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,380
And be proud of you.

131
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,260
Mon doesn't understand, why change?

132
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,100
That's my life.

133
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,460
Our child has grown up.

134
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,700
The boy likes who loves whom,
it's up to him.

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,020
We only have one child left, Mon.

136
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Any!

137
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,460
Come on.

138
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,660
I really don't remember
ever nearly dying here.

139
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,740
The power is still there,
refusing to go anywhere for a long time.

140
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,899
Are you coming to play with me again?

141
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,620
Do you miss me?

142
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,819
Ah! Where are you going? Can I go with you?

143
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,499
Okay! Let's go!

144
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,579
Wait for me, drive slowly.

145
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,460
Her eyes are correct.

146
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,059
The power of this ghost may have
been around him when he almost died.

147
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,660
Make him able to see ghosts.

148
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,619
Right!

149
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,180
I see you lonely,
so I want to come and play together.

150
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,899
But... why are you playing here alone?

151
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,060
Refusing to take the lead?

152
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,060
20 years, right?

153
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,699
I can't go anywhere.

154
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,980
I have to wait for my brother to come.

155
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Why?

156
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,579
Did your brother tell you to wait?

157
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,779
Right.

158
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
He told me to wait,

159
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,540
I have to wait for my brother to come back.

160
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,979
Can I tell you where my house is?

161
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,300
Let me go find your brother here.

162
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,660
Are you sure this house?

163
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,740
That's probably right.

164
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,659
I think, we have to make her
soul soldier entanglement go away,

165
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,140
Only then did she give birth.

166
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,140
And you may not see ghosts anymore.

167
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,980
- Hey, you. - Hmm?

168
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,740
Hey... what are you
doing in front of my house?

169
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
Is your brother Mint?

170
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,099
I don't understand what you're saying.

171
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,780
EH! Wait a minute.

172
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,260
What are you doing? I will
report it to the police!

173
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,500
You must come with us now.

174
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,019
What's wrong with you?

175
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,220
Mint wants to see you.

176
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,980
Mint drowned 20 years ago.

177
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,420
The day she drowned,
she wore a pink checkered dress.

178
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,340
And carry a teddy bear named Linly Chang.

179
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,259
- I... Linly Chang? - Um.

180
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,940
How do you guys know?

181
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,500
That... that's the name...

182
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,020
teddy bear that only
me and my brother know.

183
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,140
How do you know?

184
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Because we just talked to Min.

185
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,100
Talking to my sister?

186
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,580
You told me Mint to wait, didn't you?

187
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,780
She's still waiting for him.

188
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
Come with us

189
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,380
His sister was sitting there.

190
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,380
You probably can't see her.

191
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,660
But you can feel it right?

192
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,379
Are brothers together.

193
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,420
Maybe feel it.

194
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,820
So... so what should I do next?

195
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,300
Come and sit next to my brother.

196
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,620
I think he might also have words in
his heart that he wants to say to her.

197
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,940
Brother Nine! Did you come to pick me up?

198
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
Mint.

199
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,540
Mint is still here right?

200
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,499
Mint didn't go anywhere?

201
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I want to see you Nine,
I have to wait to see you Nine.

202
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,300
If Mint takes care of mom and dad,

203
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,380
no need to worry!

204
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,499
Parents are fine.

205
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I miss my parents,

206
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,420
but as long as I get to see
you... it's enough for me.

207
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm sorry!

208
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
When that day...

209
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,219
Brother Nine, Brother Nine,
Linly Chang want to play in the water.

210
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,579
Can I go play in the water?

211
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,020
No, I have to wait for my father to come!

212
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,780
See Linly Chang? Mint got scolded!

213
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,899
Mint stay here!

214
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,500
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.

215
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Um.

216
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,780
Huh? What?

217
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,379
Tiny Chang wants to play in the water?

218
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,260
Brother Nine does not allow.

219
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,860
If that's all, that's fine.

220
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,620
Mint!

221
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,060
Because you couldn't save Mint that day.

222
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm sorry, Mint! I'm sorry!

223
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,219
It's okay, Mr. Nine.

224
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,739
You come back to see me and I'm fine.

225
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,780
Thank you!

226
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,940
My sister passed away peacefully.

227
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Thank you!

228
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,020
Thanks a lot!

229
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,380
How are you?

230
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,380
Jealous? Because he hugged me earlier?

231
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,180
It's not you.

232
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
To be...

233
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,500
What we did earlier,
I don't see any effect.

234
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,820
Mint also passed away peacefully.

235
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,300
Then why do I still see
your face like before?

236
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,659
EH! Then it's me,
how can you see me in other people?

237
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,260
Not! I mean...

238
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,260
This is Mes' body.

239
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,500
If I don't see ghosts anymore.

240
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,019
I don't have to see your face,
I have to see you, Mes, right?

241
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,100
OH!

242
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,060
That's right. Forget
thinking about this anymore.

243
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,260
So that means...

244
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,740
We still haven't gotten
to the bottom of it yet.

245
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,340
Slowly find a solution.

246
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,020
Eat first. lest it get cold.

247
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
But...

248
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,540
it also makes me think of something.

249
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,700
Think... you have dead siblings?

250
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,099
How do you know? Why? Who said?

251
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,780
Or is...

252
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,940
What's wrong with you? What
does violence against me do?

253
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,940
Speak slowly and clearly.

254
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,819
Say what?

255
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
EH?

256
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
You keep eating.

257
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,900
What's wrong with you?

258
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,140
So what were you going
to say to me just now?

259
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,740
Ah,

260
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,420
then...

261
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,260
my seeing ghosts...

262
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,660
I have never helped them
fulfill their wish like you did.

263
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,420
For example, the patient's soul
begged me not to hold on to life.

264
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,939
Do not. Do not. Don't hold me back.

265
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,699
I said that. Let me die.

266
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,020
But I didn't listen either.

267
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,460
Until he was held back
and continued to suffer...

268
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,779
I still don't think I'll stop listening.

269
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Help, help! Doctor! Help!

270
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,820
That something happened to them.

271
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,259
Helping reincarnated souls reincarnate,

272
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
not the duty of man.

273
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,620
You don't have to think much.

274
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Hello?

275
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,500
Doctor Phakphum here.

276
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,300
Yes, I'll be right there.

277
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Go ahead.

278
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,340
Actually, I'm jealous too.

279
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,300
When he was hugged,

280
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,140
I also...

281
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm sorry!

282
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Hey you!

283
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,620
Do you like me?

284
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,500
This body commands me to do so.

285
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,140
These... are not my feelings.

286
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,340
It's the feelings of Dr. Mes, rather.

287
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,220
Wazzup?

288
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,859
What happened, Dr. Mes?

289
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,819
You didn't keep your promise to me.

290
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,539
You talk about making love to Mr. Phum.

291
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,979
Why do you say you're going to investigate
the accident, make me stop worrying?

292
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,660
And you come home late at night,
making my parents worry even more!

293
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,100
Calm down first, Dr. Mes.

294
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,420
You don't keep your word!

295
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,620
Why did you do that?

296
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,740
That would cost me a lot of work.

297
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,900
I will get my life back.

298
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,420
Doctor Mes!

299
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,259
This body is no longer yours.

300
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
You're dead!

301
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,260
Doctor Mes!

302
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,660
Listen to me first.

303
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,819
I help you do the things you want but no longer have
the opportunity to do, so that you can die peacefully.

304
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,540
The whole story of your family,
the story of your accident.

305
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,419
All souls want the same chance as you.

306
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,139
Only I can help you.

307
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,540
I will do it all with my own body.

308
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,180
Doctor Mes!

309
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,260
Both are enough.

310
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,260
Mr. Shan came very well! Help tell Dr. Mes.

311
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,059
As the cause of all things,

312
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,060
and told me to help you?

313
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,299
You're his angelic ruler, aren't you?

314
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,659
Help bring him back. I want my body back.

315
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,900
Then when the time is right, I will die.

316
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,940
I probably can't do that.

317
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,740
Then no. Sole I made myself.

318
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Why? Why can't I enter the body?

319
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Once the soul has expired,
it will not be able to re-enter the body.

320
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,700
But the body is still alive,

321
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,780
it is because of the
power of the angel Krit.

322
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,619
But that's my body.

323
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,340
Nothing is ours in the first place.

324
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,420
How could he control the pain of this body?

325
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,300
The body whose heart has stopped beating,

326
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,300
Can you control it?

327
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,900
Give me a chance.

328
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,500
This body...

329
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
It's not yours anymore.

330
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,820
The only chance you can do that is...

331
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,140
give this body a chance
to do what you want to do,

332
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,100
before you leave this world.

333
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,940
And that's my duty,

334
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,420
will continue to do it for you.

335
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,340
And don't forget what your mission is.

336
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Yes.

337
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,740
This body...

338
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,420
will only live 10 more minutes.

339
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,340
Then it will die completely.

340
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,140
The decision lies with you.

341
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,259
Mess!

342
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Oh! It's dead! Mes baby!

343
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,820
Mess! How are you, son?

344
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
Mess!

345
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,860
5!

346
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,500
Mess! My son!

347
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Mess! Mes wake up baby.

348
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,780
Mess! Did you hear what mom said?

349
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,980
Mess!

350
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,900
First

351
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,340
Can you do it, baby?

352
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,739
Are you OK? Need your mom
to take you to the doctor?

353
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,900
It's okay. I was just a little stunned.

354
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,220
Drunk again, right?

355
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,659
Oh! Lessen, child. Any. Stand up!

356
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,780
Since returning,
there has not been a decent meal.

357
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,500
Tomorrow, please. Rest at home,
eat together.

358
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,620
Me!

359
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:50,740
I'm so glad you're home.

360
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,140
Let's live together for a long time.

361
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,060
Do you know what I've done?

362
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,099
It's like I can't control my emotions
whenever I'm around Dr. Phakphum.

363
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,660
The owner of the body consents
to the continued use of the body.

364
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,940
But the condition is not to get too
close to Dr. Phakphum any more than this.

365
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,340
And let this body be with
his parents for a full day.

366
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,420
Impossible!

367
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,100
I'm here, what about my mission?

368
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,500
Only 3 days left.

369
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,659
This! But letting this body be
with his parents for a full day

370
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,539
It's also one of those missions.

371
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,780
Don't forget.

372
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,780
Will I be able to complete the mission?

373
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,580
Saying goodbye to what
we love is always painful

374
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,540
and we will see the value of what we have

375
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,540
when we lose them.

376
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,300
Your Sacrifice

377
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,500
is to create great merit.

378
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,780
For helping Dr. Phakphum

379
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,820
so that he can continue to help others

380
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,020
is to create great merit.

381
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,820
I don't want to hope for
things that may not exist.

382
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,900
Then you'll make it clear to yourself,

383
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,060
when he passed away
peacefully without any problems.

384
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,299
I apologize on behalf of
the inappropriate behavior

385
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,380
and disrespect your soul.

386
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,780
After completing the task,

387
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,900
Angel Krit can no longer use his body.

388
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,460
He will never be able
to see Dr. Phakphum again.

389
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,980
As if I had no choice but
to lend him my body to use.

390
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,060
Forgive the angel Krit.

391
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,340
I believe.

392
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,660
That he would definitely get
a lesson from what happened.

393
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,020
I don't know if I can forgive
the angel Krit before I leave.

394
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,620
But i will try.

395
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,019
Where do you go to work tomorrow?

396
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,980
What time do you meet?

397
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,739
No appointment tomorrow.

398
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,939
Can't go.

399
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,100
Dr. Mes asked me to stay
with his parents all day.

400
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,660
So... can we talk about the kiss?

401
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,180
ONLY 3 DAYS

402
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,219
Lunch is Pad Thai, Mes' favorite.

403
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,060
And in the evening, after Dad comes home, Mom will make
crab curry with guise leaves - Dad's favorite dish.

404
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,859
Every dish is delicious.

405
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,860
Well, from time to time, cooking some dishes
for the children should be a little hearty.

406
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Whoa!

407
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,700
Whoa! Mom!

408
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,259
Is it okay?

409
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,859
It's okay,
baby. It's OK. It's just a little bit.

410
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,460
Only had one finger. There are
still 9 fingers. Just kidding.

411
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,260
It's okay, just a little bit. See it?

412
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,620
Who is that?

413
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,980
- Let me go take a look. - YES! Scat!

414
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,059
Uh... want to go to dinner... no.

415
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,820
Uh... please... come see...

416
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,940
Calm! Phakphum calm down!

417
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,739
Come do what?

418
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,436
I told you I don't have
an appointment today.

419
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,180
Well... I want to talk to you.

420
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,100
Refused! Does not say! Go back!

421
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,099
- Can't we talk to each other? Just a little bit.
- Does not say!

422
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,619
- Can I have two minutes, please?
- Are not!

423
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,900
Why did you come, child?

424
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,619
Hi Mom.

425
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,179
Hello doctor.

426
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,619
Come in here already. Come
and eat Pad Thai together.

427
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,899
Do not disturb right?

428
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,340
No. Please.

429
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,659
Go back!

430
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,540
Dress like this and you're ready to go out.

431
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,219
I beg your pardon, mother.

432
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,460
Um.

433
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,579
Take it easy, Doctor.

434
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,219
Oh, so I'll stay here.

435
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,499
The doctor lying down
is the mother lying there.

436
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,859
Oh okay, okay.

437
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,780
- Be natural. - Yes.

438
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,860
They fit together so well.

439
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,980
Oh no sentence.

440
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,460
Uh, hey you, hey you.

441
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,459
Uh... wait, man! Hey you!

442
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,179
I think we have to be clear.

443
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,700
What happened last night was in my head,
I was like...

444
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,939
I want to make it clear.

445
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,820
What else has been said. It's
because of this body, not me.

446
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,540
Are you sure?

447
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Then..

448
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,140
Is there any other reason?

449
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,220
So what if it's hard to understand

450
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,660
it's like when you order
minced meat rice like an omelet.

451
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,500
Why did you order this dish?

452
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,260
What are you saying?
- EH? - Huh?

453
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,780
Mr. Krist!

454
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,140
My heart often beats fast because
this body makes me like this.

455
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,420
Blame my body for what?
Because you yourself.

456
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
What?

457
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,580
Don't know. Go help mom
wash the vegetables next.

458
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,660
When guests come to the house,
they are welcomed.

459
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Uh...

460
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,940
How are you, Mes?

461
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,900
Fine.

462
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
Uh... but...

463
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,420
I don't know if I can use that
word because I've become a spirit.

464
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,420
That's right too.

465
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,780
I... saw that Mr. Phum had
kissed Mr. Krist yesterday.

466
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,100
I'm sorry, Mes.

467
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,900
Mes must feel bad, right?

468
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,219
Even though... he could see that
Mes' body was the angel Krit, but...

469
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,420
The body you kissed
yesterday was also Mes's.

470
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,660
Its ok.

471
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,620
And the angel Krit said...

472
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,380
Mes likes you...

473
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
is it true?

474
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,939
I'm a 4th year medical student.
Today is my first day here.

475
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,900
My name is Mesa.

476
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:05,140
I hope you can help me.

477
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,980
Honor:

478
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,900
But I know...

479
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,100
that is not possible. As it is now,
it is not possible.

480
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,780
My lifespan is over.

481
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,980
No matter how much I like Mr. Phum,
I have to let go.

482
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,780
Sorry, Mes.

483
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,979
No,
it's me. I regret when I was still alive.

484
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,500
Surely there will be
opportunities to try more than this.

485
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,500
Now, I want to see Mr. Phum happy...

486
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,500
upon successful completion of the task.

487
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,220
That's probably the only thing that makes me not
feel sorry for the things I went through with you.

488
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,500
Thank you very much, Mes.

489
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,420
And I sincerely apologize to you.

490
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,220
Now, Mr. Phum has feelings for Krit, right?

491
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,659
Ah, well...

492
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,620
Doctor! Pad Thai eggs are done.

493
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,700
Yes, I will pass.

494
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,699
My mom's Pad Thai is delicious.

495
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,900
I want Mr. Phum to taste it.

496
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,580
Thank you very much, Mes.

497
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,699
Oh! Looks so delicious.

498
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,420
- Try it. - Yes.

499
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,260
The Pad Thai that mom made is
really as delicious as Mes said.

500
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,739
Thank you.

501
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,939
When the doctor said that,
my mother also felt warm.

502
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,660
- Let's eat more. - Yes.

503
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,020
Oh, his father,
come back at the right time.

504
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,060
How are you?

505
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,540
Hello sir.

506
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,540
Hello doctor, please take a seat.

507
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,299
I just finished making Pad Thai,
let me clean it up for you.

508
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,700
- yes, her mother. - Yes.

509
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,660
Ah, thanks.

510
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,540
- Oh, Pad Thai has a big piece of egg, mother.
- Ah, Yes, Yes. That's right, his father.

511
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,819
There's a doctor here, it's embarrassing.

512
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,139
- But the "egg" is a bit too soft.
- Oh, his father.

513
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,299
- But it also comes with age. Yes,
according to age.

514
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,060
Can't imagine following.

515
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,140
I don't know how else to help you.

516
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,500
I guess I'll have to ask my Boss
to help me do some more research.

517
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Um.

518
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,939
If you don't know how
to proceed with my story,

519
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,900
Well, it's okay to find out
about Mes' accident first.

520
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,940
- It must be. - Um.

521
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,619
So, tomorrow I'm going to visit
the Faculty of Medicine for a bit.

522
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,980
Go for more evidence.

523
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,700
I'll come pick you up.

524
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,860
No need, let my mother drive.

525
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,780
Let's go... Let me come and pick you up.

526
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,219
Let's go, home?

527
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,739
Why make a face like that?

528
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,420
Then do that, sometimes the soft-hearted
angel allows me to come pick it up.

529
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,179
Nah, nah, nah.

530
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
That's OK.

531
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,796
What are you laughing at to that extent?

532
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,300
Well... I'm glad I'll be near you.

533
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,059
Oh my God!

534
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,539
Honestly speaking,

535
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,939
if you read it in a simple way,

536
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,220
It's not an angel's book anymore.

537
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,260
It's nothing to do with this Badin.

538
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,540
ALLO HOMORA!

539
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,060
Not up.

540
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,019
A PARTY ÙM!

541
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,820
A PARA SI BUM! BUM! BUM!

542
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,300
I always break my nails.

543
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,900
Not up.

544
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,459
No one can read that book but me.

545
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,779
Really, I've tried many
ways and still can't read it.

546
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,140
Is there any way?

547
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,940
What are you going to do?

548
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,340
Then...

549
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,220
then...

550
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,060
I mean... find information.

551
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,260
Why do you think so?

552
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:43,299
Boss, you can see that Boss and the
angel Krist must have something wrong.

553
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,100
Otherwise Boss wouldn't
try to protect him like that.

554
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,699
Well... the angel Christ was in my group.

555
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,540
No wonder I have to keep a
close eye on his behavior.

556
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,300
The person in the group who is
always going to cause trouble.

557
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,260
The person in the group, the person
the Boss always tries to protect.

558
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,220
Mr. Shan!

559
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,780
Both, enough!

560
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,500
The person in the group, who the Boss
always has to help talk to the Chairman.

561
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,180
Boss doesn't think?

562
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,340
If the Chairman finds out,
Badin thinks Boss is dead.

563
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,980
Don't you know it yourself?

564
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,940
That the Chairman is the one
who can see and know everything.

565
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,259
Is there something you don't know?

566
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,700
If I break the angel's law,

567
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,099
or if any angel sneaks into
the room of the Guardian Angel,

568
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,060
because of their false curiosity.

569
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,379
I am a helper.

570
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,179
The maid came to clean the angel Shan's room
because the angel Shan's room was too messy.

571
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,740
That's the helper.

572
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,940
Goodbye.

573
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,340
Mr. President...

574
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,660
who can see, know everything,

575
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,300
every human life.

576
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,660
He already has a task for everyone.

577
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,380
So you know where to go to investigate?

578
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,020
- Dao. - Huh? I don't see anything.

579
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,260
What's up Dao? If you don't see it,
come close.

580
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,020
Uncle.

581
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,180
Hmm?

582
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,340
Ah, I know.

583
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,740
If there is any progress,
call me immediately, you know?

584
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,380
Okay.

585
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,380
Anyway, it has to end today,
I don't have much time left.

586
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,420
2 days left

587
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,780
Knife.

588
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:57,940
Mess...

589
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,900
Knife.

590
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:01,540
Dao told me frankly.

591
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,820
Dao knows about his accident right?

592
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,820
Me...

593
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,300
I didn't see the crash, Mes.

594
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,260
I only heard the sound of arguing
at the exit near the rest room.

595
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,339
Why did you do that? What do you need?

596
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,340
Mess!

597
00:48:28,341 --> 00:48:30,420
Mes? Mess!

598
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,420
Mess!

599
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,059
I tried to ask Intouch.

600
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,700
Is what happened.

601
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,220
But Intouch said...

602
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,420
he happened to see Mes
when he fell down the stairs.

603
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,420
I'm just here to help.

604
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,140
Me...

605
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,860
I really don't know if he's the
one who made Mes fall down the stairs.

606
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,460
I don't have any proof either.

607
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,660
And I don't dare touch Intouch either.

608
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,980
Mes also knows... the Intouch family is rich, and
his father is also a high-ranking police officer.

609
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,940
Me...

610
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,940
I don't want to get in trouble, Mes.

611
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,700
Don't answer the phone.

612
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Knife.
Huh?

613
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,540
Do you know where Intouch is?

614
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,940
Department of Internal Medicine.

615
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,060
Mes.

616
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,140
Oh, what's up?

617
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,340
Why come together?

618
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,700
Knife!

619
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,300
Knife!

620
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Hey Touch.

621
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,220
You know about my accident, right?

622
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,899
- I met you too. - Did you meet?

623
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,739
- Uh. - No, I meet more.

624
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,779
- Sorry, I really don't know... - Dao, Dao.

625
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,260
Sorry for what?

626
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,659
Ah, stress, why didn't you tell us?

627
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,179
Same, so are we.

628
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,899
- Well, let Non-boy serve you coffee.
- When did I say?

629
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,099
It's okay, I'm in a hurry.

630
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,980
It's okay,
what are you doing so tense? It has money.

631
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,300
So you treat...

632
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,460
Where then?

633
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,859
At the coffee shop.

634
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,139
Going here.

635
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,139
I want to make everything clear.

636
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,900
Don't do anything crazy, you know?

637
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,019
Intouch! Intouch! You OK?

638
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,220
Come quickly, Dao.

639
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,780
I'll wait where it all begins.

640
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,940
Dao knows where it is.

641
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,980
No need to worry about me.

642
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,620
Anyway,
today all the truth must be exposed.

643
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,340
EH?

644
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,780
What are you doing today, Doctor Phakphum?

645
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,460
Come and wait for people.

646
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:00,179
- Wow, miss you without telling...
- not you.

647
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,780
Rude.

648
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,380
So who are you waiting for?

649
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,020
Does not say.

650
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,660
Lover?

651
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,420
Why do some people love their
spouse but don't tell their friends?

652
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,979
Ooh?

653
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,180
My style, man.

654
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,099
Hello?

655
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,300
What's up?

656
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,780
Where are you?

657
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,780
In the rest room.

658
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,780
Ok, let me come.

659
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,420
Me Mes...

660
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,900
who just got out of the hospital?

661
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,980
Yeah, but it's not what you think.

662
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Real.

663
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,179
Oh, Mes? Going to see Phum?

664
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,659
Hey man.

665
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,380
Wait a minute, turn around!

666
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,100
Hurry up.

667
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,500
What's so bad about it?

668
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,460
What's the fold?

669
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,020
Hurry to that point.

670
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,580
Yes, that's for sure.

671
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,380
Must understand for the needy.

672
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,020
Huh? Did Intouch and Dao
know about Mes' accident?

673
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
Correct.

674
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,700
Dao said he saw Intouch
when the incident happened.

675
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,740
When I went to ask Intouch

676
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,940
then he told me to wait at the cafe.

677
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,740
But did not see.

678
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,620
It's like trying to avoid it.

679
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,940
This is it.

680
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,899
Can you try searching in my memory, Mes?

681
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,699
Did Dao,
Intouch and Mes quarrel about anything?

682
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,260
Then between Dao and Intouch,
who is more capable?

683
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,580
Can you try?

684
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,299
Have you thought of it?

685
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
Not yet!

686
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,779
He's in such a hurry.
Haven't thought about it yet.

687
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,100
Then I want to know.

688
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,340
Do you think to yourself?

689
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,540
Hey you! Uncle!

690
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,780
Hey you! Oh isn't it?

691
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,020
Take a break?

692
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:51,740
Huh?

693
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,140
No problem.

694
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,100
I want to think out.

695
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,820
Like... just a little bit more.

696
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,100
Really just a little more.

697
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,100
No problem.

698
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,540
So we have to face the truth directly.

699
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,540
We've made it clear, haven't we, Dao?

700
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,860
Mes.

701
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,940
Where are you going, Mes?

702
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,140
Oh, I'm going to apply.

703
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,780
We said it, didn't we?

704
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,500
Friends must help each other.

705
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,420
You know how important
that position is to me.

706
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,260
You can't win like this.

707
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,380
I don't win. Just use your rights.

708
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,420
Mes.

709
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,140
Hey Mess.

710
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,300
That's clear, isn't it, Mes?

711
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,539
- Submit your application form here.
- Are not.

712
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,620
Why do you have to do
this? What do you want?

713
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,300
How much do you want?

714
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,300
I can pay you.

715
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
You say go.

716
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,980
I'm going to go apply.

717
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,139
- Give it to me. Bring it here. - Are not.

718
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,979
No, you give up.

719
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,340
You leave.

720
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,260
Mess!

721
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,980
Mess!

722
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,140
Yes, I remember everything.

723
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,579
So why last time

724
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,580
No one is willing to speak up?

725
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,380
If you complete this quest,

726
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,899
You have to go back and take the
position of Head of Angels that I offered.

727
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,420
And stop messing with humans.

728
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,100
As long as you close your eyes

729
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,340
You will always find me by your side.

730
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:29,980
He had to quickly erase
that feeling of love.

731
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,820
Love...

732
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,380
This word has too much energy.
