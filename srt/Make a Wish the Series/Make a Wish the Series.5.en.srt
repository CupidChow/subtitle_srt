The followings are auto translated subtitles.
Manual translated version will be updated later.

2
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,380
You didn't keep your promise to me.

3
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,619
You told me that I like Mr. Phum.

4
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Calm down first, Dr. Mes.

5
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:04,700
Get out of my body!

6
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,819
This body is no longer yours.

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,460
You're dead!

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,060
Give this body a chance
to do what you want to do,

9
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,579
before you leave this world.

10
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,100
Now, I just want to see Mr. Phum happy...

11
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,900
upon successful completion of the task.

12
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,900
That's probably the only thing that makes me not
feel sorry for the things I went through with you.

13
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,740
Mess!

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,540
Are not.

15
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,460
Do you remember everything?

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
That's right.

17
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:04,420
I remember everything.

18
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,780
I don't want it to be like this.

19
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,459
I never wanted to hurt you.

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,180
It's just an accident.

21
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,900
What about Dao..?

22
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,980
Dao has nothing to do with this.

23
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,740
You're not the one doing it right?

24
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,980
Dao think I do?

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,060
Dao see?

26
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,860
Do not have.

27
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,500
I do not see.

28
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,540
Knife.

29
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,420
It's just an accident.

30
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,020
Dao himself did not see everything.

31
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,060
Dao should not continue to mention.

32
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,980
It's not the truth.

33
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
If Dao continues to mention,

34
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,300
Dao himself...

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,460
There could be a problem as well.

36
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,980
That's OK.

37
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,820
I won't tell anyone about this.

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,380
Knife!

39
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,340
Free tonight?

40
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,060
Idle.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
Let me come pick you up.

42
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
That day, Dao just passed by to see.

43
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,860
I'm sorry, Mes.

44
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,020
Dao really sorry!

45
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,860
So why hasn't anyone said anything lately?

46
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm a person... please
don't tell anyone about this.

47
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,500
I don't want to tell
anyone about this either.

48
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,580
I'm afraid.

49
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,380
I am afraid it will
affect my further study.

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,059
- You! - HEY! Mess! Mess!

51
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,779
Mess! Mess! Calm down first, Mess.

52
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,340
Calm down, Mes. Mess!

53
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Calm!

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,820
Is education more important
than human life? Huh?

55
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,660
We are doctors,

56
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,020
The most important thing is to save lives.

57
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,980
But what is this? Huh?

58
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,060
You guys are endangering someone's life.

59
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,499
Then how much pain he
caused those around him.

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,460
Did you ever know?

61
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,300
The most important is...

62
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,419
This person is your aunt's friend,
isn't he?

63
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Huh?

64
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Phum.

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,260
Mess! I'm sorry!

66
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,180
I will make up for it all for you.

67
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,780
Including hospital treatment fees,

68
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,300
waste of time,

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
will make up for you.

70
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,340
Sorry!

71
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,820
- I'm sorry! - No need!

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,380
Go apologize to my parents.

73
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,340
That's the only thing I need from you.

74
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,260
Mess! Wait.

75
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,820
I'll go apologize to your parents.

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,860
But now,

77
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,460
You are healthy as well.

78
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,580
Can we go back to being
friends like before?

79
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,820
Are you strong?

80
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,900
Back to being friends?

81
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,780
You don't know how what
you did affects Dr. Mes.

82
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,380
But in a few days you will know.

83
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,940
And then by that time,

84
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
You will feel more guilty than this.

85
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,900
There is memory loss.

86
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,540
I really didn't do this on purpose.

87
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,740
Only one day left.

88
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,100
Although Doctor Mes'
accident mission is over,

89
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,340
But his mission is not yet there.

90
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,179
It's okay, man.

91
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,700
When you're done with your mission, Mes,

92
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,180
Can't you just go back to being an angel?

93
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,419
The thing is... I won't
need to stop seeing ghosts

94
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,980
to continue to see him.

95
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,340
My mission is to make
you stop seeing ghosts.

96
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,700
If the mission fails,

97
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,460
I will no longer have merit points
to continue to stay as an angel.

98
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,100
And stop talking like
you're flirting with me.

99
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,300
- You know... - Is it Mes that likes me?

100
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,380
That's right. Would love to be different.

101
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,060
The more he said that,
the more distracted I became.

102
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,940
What about you?

103
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,540
Do you like me?

104
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,340
I asked him, in his feelings.

105
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,780
Angel Krist...

106
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,060
do you like me?

107
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,100
Ask what?

108
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,740
If you don't want to answer, don't answer.

109
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,420
So we must make the mission successful,

110
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,979
We have to find a way tonight.

111
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,180
Because our time is running out.

112
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,180
Hey, Phum.

113
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,899
Phum!

114
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,899
Oh! It turned out to be here.

115
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,899
Called without answering the phone.

116
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,539
I have an urgent case, I need your help.

117
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,700
Ca what?

118
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,899
Now there are 2 patients in serious
condition but I will go see the admission.

119
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,299
There is also 1 case of an obstetrician consultant who came to
see the case of a pregnant mother with many background diseases.

120
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,660
And now the condition is very bad,
please help me check this patient.

121
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Oh, ok, medicine.

122
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,700
So...

123
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,539
Let's go, there's no time.

124
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,419
Oh! Step on the foot. Hurry up! Go! Go! Go!

125
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,460
- Go. - What's wrong with her?

126
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Sorry for disappearing all night.

127
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,780
It's OK.

128
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,220
Position...

129
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
How is the patient pregnant with twins?

130
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,980
Dr Suti had an emergency
cesarean section to save her life.

131
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,420
Mother passed.

132
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
But...

133
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,260
Twins lost one.

134
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Pity the patient.

135
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,380
Or is...

136
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
Twin?

137
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,660
That's right.

138
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,099
Maybe not,
if the souls of the twins merge into one,

139
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,499
originally the soul of one person,
but divided into two.

140
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,099
Can it not Mr. Shan?

141
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,340
When Dr. PhakPhum can see ghosts because
there are twin souls still in the body.

142
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,659
But that does not explain why
Dr. PhakPhum can see ghosts.

143
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,499
Might as well be the twin's soul,

144
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,620
make Doctor PhakPhum see ghosts.

145
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,500
It is because there is still a
soul hiding in a human body until now.

146
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,300
Do you have dead brothers?

147
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,099
How do you know.

148
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,459
How? Who said?

149
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,500
Or is...

150
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,660
Maybe.

151
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,539
Can Mr. Shan help contact
the room for reincarnation?

152
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,420
See if there's PhuPha's name.

153
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,620
PhakPhum Maharahiran, alive.

154
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,339
PhuPha Maharahiran, passed away.

155
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,860
No soul found.

156
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,419
Is this Mr. Shan? The reason
why Dr. PhakPhum can see the soul.

157
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,859
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

158
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,260
Wait, angel Krit.

159
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,460
If you do this mission successfully.

160
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,900
You must return to take the
position of Guardian Angel I suggested.

161
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,260
And stop messing with humans.

162
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,620
If you promise to do so,

163
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,580
I will not tell this to the Chairman.

164
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,820
And... you won't be punished either.

165
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,700
All right, Mr. Shan.

166
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,580
I won't make Shan-san get
in trouble for me anymore.

167
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,820
Thank you Shan for always helping me.

168
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,660
You can go then.

169
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,259
- Hi Dad. - YES.

170
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,859
Oh,
Phum! Why don't you tell your mother that?

171
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,259
Hello Mom.

172
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,820
Is... Phum has something
to ask mom and dad.

173
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,780
River?

174
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,260
Mom was pregnant with twins.

175
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,540
A person named PhakPhum

176
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,300
and a man named PhuPha.

177
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,340
Mom and dad are very happy.

178
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,660
For having twins.

179
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,980
And mom and dad have everything ready.

180
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,780
But at birth,

181
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,900
Phu Pha did not survive.

182
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,580
The baby is gone.

183
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,460
Why...

184
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,500
Phun has never heard of this?

185
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,500
I don't want to tell Phum-in-law.

186
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,540
Because...

187
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Mother could not accept the truth.

188
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,260
I don't even want to go back home...

189
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,300
where mom and dad have
prepared rooms for two boys.

190
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Mother did not dare to return.

191
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,620
Mom keeps all of Phu Pha's things.

192
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,180
Mom never told Phum,

193
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,460
because I don't think
there's any use in saying it.

194
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,020
This is...

195
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Phu Pha's ashes.

196
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,540
Phu Pha is always here.

197
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,580
Didn't think it was that close.

198
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,980
Dear mother!

199
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,740
That may sound unbelievable.

200
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,660
But the fact that Mr. Phum
is still seeing ghosts,

201
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,700
is because the thing called...

202
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,980
That clinging.

203
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,220
Phu Pha's soul has never gone anywhere.

204
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,300
Because he cannot die peacefully.

205
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,220
Phu Pha!

206
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,740
Is Phu Pha still here?

207
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Yes.

208
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,500
He is always in Mr. Pham's body.

209
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,540
So Mr. Phum became the person
who... could see the world after death.

210
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,580
I think it's about time, mom.

211
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,940
When the mother had to let go.

212
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,580
To keep the child alive...

213
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,500
He doesn't have to suffer
from seeing ghosts anymore.

214
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,540
Mom sorry.

215
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm sorry mom, I was wrong.

216
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,460
Please forgive me for being selfish.

217
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm sorry... for making both of you suffer.

218
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,900
I'm wrong, baby, I'm sorry.

219
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,020
It's okay mom.

220
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,060
What mom does,

221
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,900
Mom has her reasons too.

222
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,020
For dad,

223
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,340
whether that's the right
thing... or the wrong thing,

224
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,860
but dad knows,

225
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,820
that my mother did this...

226
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,060
because of the love for both of you.

227
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,060
Mom tried to do the best.

228
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,700
It's okay, mom.

229
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,100
Alright.

230
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,780
If the quest is complete

231
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,340
I won't see you again, will I?

232
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,940
Is it time for me to change my mind? Huh?

233
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,740
What are you going to
change your mind about now?

234
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,300
Then doing all this is not for you?

235
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,300
It's because of me,
so I have the right to choose.

236
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,620
I still want to see you.
Can't you just leave me?

237
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,740
That's enough, man.

238
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,820
I can't be with you forever.

239
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,860
Don't make me like you like that again.

240
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,060
Do you know?

241
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,020
I don't want to leave you.

242
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,700
But I have to give up this body
and go back to being an angel.

243
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,020
It's the truth.

244
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,940
I can't bring something like this with me.

245
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
He kept it.

246
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,180
It's strange?

247
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,780
It's like you're saying goodbye to me.

248
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,420
So we really have to separate, right?

249
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,220
Don't say goodbye now,

250
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,980
One day we have to say goodbye.

251
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,620
That's enough, man.

252
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,900
No need to overdo it.

253
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,540
Give me your brother's ashes here.

254
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
This!

255
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,500
Sorry to have caused you trouble.

256
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,180
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have had a chance to live.

257
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,860
It's been a lot of fun.

258
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,740
Am I really always here?

259
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,740
Yes.

260
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,700
You still come often,
even if I don't know it, it's okay.

261
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,300
Doesn't taste good at all!

262
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,780
EH?

263
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,740
It's not good,
you don't have to throw it away.

264
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,699
Is there another script?

265
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,740
Yes.

266
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,779
How do you know?

267
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,139
Star? Who said?

268
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,260
Or is...

269
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,260
Oh my God! Is that one of your hands?

270
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,020
This guy is so cute.

271
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,619
If I were still alive,
I would definitely pursue you.

272
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,900
But that's okay,
let me visit you while at the Bodhi tree.

273
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,940
There's a chance we'll
see each other later.

274
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,740
Goodbye!

275
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,060
Hey you!

276
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,380
That's successful, man.

277
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,260
Thank you very much.

278
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,299
You've seen me as the face of Dr. Mes,
haven't you?

279
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,060
That means we have succeeded.

280
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,260
That's successful.

281
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,980
Congratulations to you.

282
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,300
Now you won't see ghosts or angels anymore.

283
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,180
There's nothing to worry about anymore.

284
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,900
You really have to go, don't you?

285
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,140
Um.

286
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,660
Then my task is done.

287
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,340
If...

288
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,140
If I want to see you again,

289
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,780
what should I do?

290
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,539
Come and find me at the big bodhi tree.

291
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,340
Where can I go bro?

292
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,820
But we probably won't
see each other like before.

293
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,300
Why?

294
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,380
Even if I still want to see you.

295
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,780
I want to see your face.

296
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,180
I accept to see ghosts again,
if I can't meet you.

297
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,500
Actually, just...

298
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,420
As long as you close your eyes,

299
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,860
As long as you close your eyes,
you will always see me by your side.

300
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,860
You know that right?

301
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,660
Was the mission successful?

302
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,620
Finished.

303
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,699
The one who made him fall
down the stairs was Intouch.

304
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,900
Intouch?

305
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,540
Intouch is my friend.

306
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,219
We are just friends,

307
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,180
and are still rivals.

308
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,220
I don't want to blame him
for making me like this.

309
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,260
Because of the pressure from around us,

310
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,820
causing the two of us to jump into
the battlefield to fight each other.

311
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,020
I'm so happy.

312
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,980
Because you don't hate him.

313
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,180
I want to let go and go to ecstasy.

314
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,700
And...

315
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,700
Now Dr. Phum can't see ghosts anymore.

316
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,420
His sacrifice was not in vain.

317
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,260
It gave new life to Dr. Phakphum.

318
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,460
At least dead people like me,

319
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,260
It can also be useful for
both living people and angels.

320
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,540
Dr. Phum also asked to thank you.

321
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,180
For having always had a crush on him.

322
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
And...

323
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,660
From now on, you don't have to
worry about your parents anymore.

324
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,060
Dr. Phakphum will visit often.

325
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
Yes.

326
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,060
Are you ready?

327
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,419
I can ask for one last thing

328
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,260
before you leave?

329
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,740
EH? What's wrong, son?

330
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
EH?

331
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,140
What's going on here?

332
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,620
I'm so weird today.

333
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,339
What's wrong, son? Is something wrong?

334
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,220
No, I just want to hug you.

335
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,740
And hug dad too.

336
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,900
Dad, I can't breathe.

337
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,499
You have to hug me tight.

338
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Huh? Mom is here too.

339
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,580
Love this person the most in the world.

340
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,140
Its father.

341
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm not with us anymore, dad.

342
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,260
Mes, my son.

343
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,940
Mes.

344
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,820
Mes.

345
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,419
Oh my God!

346
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,779
Our holy angel.

347
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,940
Can you go back to work?

348
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,660
Where did it go? Where
are you going to play?

349
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,540
This time I have returned
with a lot of merit.

350
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Tell me. What did?

351
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,459
Oh my God.

352
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,459
Pray for me to win the jackpot.

353
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,619
Win 30 million. Namo amitabud.

354
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,059
I don't know what time it is,
please come on time.

355
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,620
Is now the time to pray and beg?

356
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,499
How many times have I told
you not to use cold powder.

357
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,660
Goosebumps all over the duck skin.

358
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,460
Angel Krist.

359
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,500
Talk without answering. What's wrong?

360
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,420
Angel Krist?

361
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,859
Oh my gosh.

362
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,419
One dan, then call the fire,

363
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,860
On the one hand, do not listen.

364
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,059
Hello, Shan.

365
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,619
Your beloved brother is not
available to answer the phone.

366
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,620
I'm not convenient right now, if you
have anything, please leave a message.

367
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,140
What?

368
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,259
He really wasn't free to talk.

369
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
Boss brother...

370
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,220
EH?

371
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,180
Thanks.

372
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,860
In the end it still has to be like this.

373
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,220
Mr. Shan.

374
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,100
Merit points...

375
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,900
that you get from the quest,

376
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,980
To be...

377
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,060
That is destiny.

378
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,340
I can't be of any help to you.

379
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,740
I'm sorry.

380
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,900
Initial,

381
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,460
I think it's love...

382
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,980
by Dr. Mes.

383
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,580
Because I'm in his body.

384
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,500
But that's not it.

385
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,180
It's the feeling...

386
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,540
Love...

387
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,940
from myself.

388
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,820
As long as you still love that person,

389
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,380
Your merit points will
also slowly decrease.

390
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,420
Until it disappears.

391
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,740
Like the previous Angel Guardian.

392
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,260
This time,

393
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,740
You broke the law of angels very seriously.

394
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,740
He himself knows it.

395
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,420
How to save your life.

396
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,980
You have to be quick

397
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
remove emotions...

398
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
love that.

399
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,540
This is my command.

400
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,060
Because the feeling of love...

401
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,580
still.

402
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,459
What's wrong with her?

403
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,619
It's okay to split the shift.

404
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,180
Get so many jobs watch
out for that disease.

405
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Then I want to be busy,
I don't want to be free, I want to work.

406
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,220
Um.

407
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,900
Need any help just say.

408
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,779
Hey, what's wrong with her?

409
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,339
Worry.

410
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,540
It's not a dog.

411
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,540
If there's anything, give me a call.

412
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,620
Thank you dear friend.

413
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,140
Hey, it's charity.

414
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,979
Just kidding.

415
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,980
You can go to work then.

416
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,779
I'm here to visit you.

417
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,580
How are you?

418
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,820
Are you fine?

419
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,780
I'm... sure I'm fine

420
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
I...

421
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
I don't see ghosts anymore.

422
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,340
As for me, Mes...

423
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,460
everything was fine because

424
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,580
get help from me.

425
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,740
Intouch and Dao have already
apologized to Mes' parents.

426
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,340
Intouch did not intentionally
cause such a thing.

427
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:25,020
He took responsibility by
confessing and following the law.

428
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,820
And he gave up his position
as an internal medicine doctor.

429
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,499
So Mes's mother forgave him.

430
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,620
Because it was really an accident.

431
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,540
I miss you a lot.

432
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,700
Miss very much...

433
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,820
How are you?

434
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,300
Are you still tense about Mes?

435
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,940
She passed away peacefully.

436
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,820
Did she know?

437
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,540
I don't see ghosts like I used to anymore.

438
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,699
Really?

439
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,259
Can't you see?

440
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,580
Doesn't see mean can't see, don't hear,
don't smell, nothing more, right?

441
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,939
Hey, congratulations.

442
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,899
Did you find a treasure?

443
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,500
Why do you say you've tried
everything but it still doesn't work?

444
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,660
I no longer see ghosts,

445
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,100
It's thanks to Mes' sacrifice.

446
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,860
You Mes?

447
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,620
Huh? Angel?

448
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,500
I'm sorry, sorry. On behalf
of you I apologize to everyone.

449
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,620
- What... - Here.

450
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,379
Oh my gosh, why are you so loud?

451
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,980
- Wait. - Huh?

452
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,859
Is it really an angel?

453
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,860
Uh.

454
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,540
How can it be so fictitious?

455
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,499
So what? Don't you believe me?

456
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,819
Not.

457
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,699
I know you're not lying to me but...

458
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,220
But...

459
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,179
Well... then you've
never seen a ghost like me.

460
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,460
When you imagine it, it's like...

461
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,780
Hey!

462
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,899
Is this true?

463
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,900
Uh.

464
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,940
And that happened to her friend.

465
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,459
I see my friend seeing ghosts is the best.

466
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,020
Um.

467
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,260
- I also see angels. - Yes.

468
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,420
Too top.

469
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,140
Always best.

470
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,939
This is really over the top.

471
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,260
- Is it delicious? That brownie. - Huh?

472
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,340
- I mean this. - Oh, this.

473
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,420
Oh man.

474
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,820
If I also want to ask for
a wish from the angel Krit

475
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,420
Where do I have to go?

476
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,660
Want to know?

477
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,420
What are you going to ask for?

478
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,100
Huh?

479
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,700
Then, to send.

480
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,900
Arrived.

481
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:10,820
Wait, still haven't sent.

482
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
Oh!

483
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,180
Then, send it.

484
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,060
Here and there.

485
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,459
But he's so erratic,
it's hard for that wish.

486
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,060
- Really? - Um.

487
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,100
That means you have to find something
good and a little expensive to worship.

488
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,900
Not home.

489
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,660
The person who prays must be in the
top 1 list of beautiful boys and girls.

490
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,619
Yes!

491
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,980
The model doctor has a handsome
face like a Korean drama.

492
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,220
I have that crown too.

493
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,100
Yes. Past.

494
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,179
- Hey man. - Uh.

495
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,339
So what is it like when you
look directly at the face?

496
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,499
Handsome type with aura

497
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,980
Wings like this?

498
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Then...

499
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
It's not even that much.

500
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,260
But...

501
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,260
so cute.

502
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,260
Good at dressing up.

503
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,260
Eat well too.

504
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,900
Mood is also good.

505
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,700
But when it comes to acting cool,
it's cool.

506
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,340
How do you feel?

507
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,340
Am I handsome?

508
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,060
Important is...

509
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,220
I like to eat rice with
minced meat like omelette.

510
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,740
Wait.

511
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,059
I found it strange.

512
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,380
Are you kidding me?

513
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,540
Baby, no kidding baby.

514
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,140
Angel Krit is just like
normal people like us.

515
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,940
But...

516
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,139
Do you see ghosts now?

517
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
See.

518
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,859
- Really? - Real.

519
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,860
Which place?

520
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,260
To her left.

521
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,779
Right.

522
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,580
Back to the right again.

523
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:37,419
Below her. Up your feet. Up your feet. Up your
neck. Up to the neck. The red devil is on the neck.

524
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,660
Oh wait, wait. Feet down again.

525
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,980
Oh, forgot the belt.

526
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,380
Oh no time. Let's go back to get it.

527
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,180
Treasure of the..

528
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,380
My son!

529
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
My son!

530
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,339
My son!

531
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,380
Oh, mother's heart.

532
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,580
Take a deep breath!

533
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,659
No need to worry...

534
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,299
Oh! Warm! It's steamed up! Oh,
no need to worry. Let mommy help me.

535
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,180
Oh! Fight the people! Oh! Not keep up
anymore! Which direction are you going?

536
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,380
Why is a mother's love so strong?

537
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,340
Angel Krist!

538
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,580
No more. lest you hear and understand.

539
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,620
Angel Krist!

540
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,700
I'm not confident that

541
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,940
Am I beautiful enough for
you to accept my prayers?

542
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,620
But Phakphum, my friend who was
once saved by you, told me that

543
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,140
he likes people with good looks

544
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,860
And my favorite thing is to eat
minced meat, like omelet the most.

545
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,580
Hey!

546
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,980
Grilled skewers?

547
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,260
He likes.

548
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,339
When you eat, you may dry your throat

549
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,299
Red soft drink is a must have.

550
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,100
This you also like.

551
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,700
The main meal does not eat dessert.

552
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,580
Too bad!

553
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,500
Sir,
it is better to have an excess than a lack.

554
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,699
Milk tea?

555
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,780
End of all of you.

556
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,820
Love...

557
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,220
Is this word a very powerful word?

558
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,900
My life as an angel for the past 500 years

559
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,380
passed easily.

560
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,340
Angels are under my care

561
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,260
Always follow the rules
and regulations strictly.

562
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,580
Except...

563
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,900
HEAVEN 100 YEARS BEFORE

564
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,060
Mr. Shan.

565
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,740
How to turn into a human?

566
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,380
If you're an angel,
why would you want to be a human?

567
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,819
Then angels have everything

568
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,900
but love is something we don't have.

569
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,620
Because it's not necessary.

570
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,740
Is that true?

571
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,300
I find it magical when people fall in love.

572
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,339
Why can one person love another...

573
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,060
I want to donate my body and my heart.

574
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,660
It can be a good thing, can't it?

575
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,300
Why...

576
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,540
Angels have no love?

577
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:47,020
Angels shouldn't have love
because it's taboo for angels.

578
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,580
I know.

579
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,140
But if love is really good

580
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,460
Well, it's worth the risk, isn't it?

581
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,860
Angel Kristi

582
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,780
only gives headaches.

583
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,900
Although it always causes
me to have a headache.

584
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,579
But also make my angel work

585
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,740
not too boring.

586
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,020
But the whole story

587
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
must end here.

588
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,340
Fate cannot be changed,

589
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,140
whether angel or human

590
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,620
must also accept it.

591
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,060
There is no exception.

592
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,820
Do you really love that person?

593
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,860
That's right.

594
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,740
So

595
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,660
That's why my merit points drop so fast,
right?

596
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,180
Soon I will have to disappear.

597
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,060
But also good,

598
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,020
did not have to stay and accept
the position that Mr. Shan assigned.

599
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,580
Though your merit points are low,

600
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,300
but enough to be able to do something.

601
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,020
Are you ready?

602
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,660
What is it?

603
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,220
My last wish.

604
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,699
Has his face always
been like this until now?

605
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,940
But what else.

606
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,100
Angel Krist.

607
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,100
What do you mean, Shan?

608
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,260
Last wish...

609
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,980
So beautiful.
