1
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,140
Destiny can't be changed.

2
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,509
Whether angel or human,

3
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,900
we must accept it.

4
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,880
There are no exceptions!

5
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,530
Hello?

6
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,900
Okay, I'll be there right away.

7
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,420
Doctor?

8
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,660
Does the patient still have a pulse?

9
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,340
Doctor, the patient's condition
is starting to deteriorate.

10
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,950
Please come quickly.

11
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,470
What's the patient's blood pressure (BP)?

12
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,340
Go ahead and give the saline.
I'll be there in five minutes.

13
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,810
Hi, Doctor~

14
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,209
Doctor, come quickly.

15
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay... be right there.

16
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,860
Doctor~

17
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,080
I have trouble sleeping.

18
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,380
Hey, you can see me, right?

19
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,230
I know you can see me.

20
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,630
You see me, right?

21
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,460
Right?

22
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,509
Can you see me?

23
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,980
Doctor~

24
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,949
Look at me.

25
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,940
Just look at me.

26
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,269
Don't act indifferent.

27
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,080
I already know you can see me.

28
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,230
Doctor~

29
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,499
I know you see me.

30
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
So cute.

31
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm onto you.

32
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,170
Handsome guys are always like this.

33
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,499
This is the life of a shaman.

34
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,119
I mean, this is the life
of a doctor who sees ghosts.

35
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,260
Sometimes I can't even tell
if someone is human or ghost.

36
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,730
Damn.

37
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,650
We gave the IV injection but no
increase in BP and there is fever.

38
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,540
The patient also has difficulty breathing.
Oxygen Saturation at 90%. Unresponsive.

39
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,020
Patient, can you hear me?

40
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,980
Lungs don't sound good.

41
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,860
The patient has respiratory failure.

42
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,570
We need to intubate him so he can breathe.

43
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,930
- The 7.5 laryngoscope blade please.
- Okay.

44
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,190
Lower it now.

45
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,029
Doctor, please save my husband.

46
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,030
I'm willing to pay as much as you want.

47
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,630
Keep the money.

48
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,599
I just want my husband to survive, Doctor.

49
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,380
Let me die.

50
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,060
Please, Doctor.

51
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,980
No, don't save me, Doctor.

52
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,009
I have had lung cancer for a long time.

53
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,050
Just let me go in peace.

54
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,700
Doctor, please save my dad.

55
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,110
It's too soon for us.

56
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,450
Nan, I've lived too long.

57
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,349
I'm already 90 years old.

58
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,290
It's long enough.

59
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,099
Doctor, please let me go.

60
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,010
Don't hold me back.

61
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,680
It's torture.

62
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm too tired.

63
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,710
Doctor, you have to save my father.

64
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,850
Dad, you'll be okay.
I still need you.

65
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,860
Honey...

66
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,790
Dad, please wake up.

67
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,740
Please wait outside.

68
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,260
Your dad will be alright.

69
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,930
Please wait outside.

70
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,170
Can't we stay?

71
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,290
You can't.
We will try our best.

72
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,620
Please go wait.

73
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,600
Tube.

74
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,830
Catheter.

75
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,010
Remove the plug.

76
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,100
Pushing air.

77
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,940
Install the mount gag.

78
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,910
I'll put it on now.

79
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Sorry.

80
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,180
Trach tube.

81
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,030
Pump.

82
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,090
Pump.

83
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,750
Intubation successful.

84
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,870
- I'll go talk to the family.
- Okay.

85
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,329
He's going into cardiac arrest.

86
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,809
EKG shows eletrical activity but no pulse.
Start CPR.

87
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,490
Give 1 mg epinephrine.

88
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,990
Doctor, stop.

89
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,190
You can stop now.

90
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,440
I have already lived to this old age.

91
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,250
Just let me die.

92
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,480
Delivering 1 mg epinephrine.

93
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,469
Stop, don't hold me back.

94
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,060
I already said, let me die.

95
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,140
Don't save me.

96
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,430
No need to save me.
I want to die.

97
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,350
CPR at 2 minutes.

98
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,250
We have a pulse.

99
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,170
EKG showing ventricular fibrilation.

100
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,910
Prepare the defibrillator for 200 joules.
Continue CPR.

101
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,300
Charge.

102
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,250
Everyone stand back.

103
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,590
Shock!

104
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Restart CPR.

105
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,490
How is my husband?

106
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,330
We have finished intubating him.
He will be transferred to the ICU.

107
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,460
Thank you for saving my husband's life,
Doctor.

108
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,500
Thank you, Doctor.

109
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,750
If something happened to my dad,
our family would be devastated.

110
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,210
Thank you.

111
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,550
Excuse me, but...

112
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,060
has the patient ever talked
about not wanting to live?

113
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,409
If you know what he wants,

114
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,530
I think a good family would
respect his decision.

115
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,460
Today has been exhausting.

116
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,420
- The patients on every floor really drained my energy.
- Help me massage.

117
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,630
How's that?

118
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,370
Hey, look left, left.

119
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,990
Doctor Phum~

120
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,990
Are you tired today?

121
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,850
Um, I want to apologize for calling
during your meal time.

122
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,970
Don't worry about it.

123
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,100
- Well, the two of us are going...
- If there's a problem, call anytime.

124
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,000
- Do you wanna eat with me?
- Only the two of us.

125
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,540
It's okay...

126
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,999
- By the way...
- What?

127
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,370
Isn't it weird?

128
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,020
Wearing dark sunglasses at night.

129
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,419
Oh, have you never seen the celebrity?
They glue their sunglasses to their faces.

130
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,500
Doctor Phum probably didn't want
anyone to see his face.

131
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
Isn't his face handsome enough?
It's really a pity.

132
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,350
- He's handsome, so handsome...
- Right, he's so handsome...

133
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,450
But something's wrong with him.

134
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,590
Hey...

135
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,150
What's wrong with him?

136
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,850
- Who wears sunglasses at night?
- He's so handsome...

137
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,470
Do you think Doctor Phum has a girlfriend?

138
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,850
Why are you laughing so evily?

139
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,129
I saw him getting very
close to Doctor Nongning.

140
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,870
I think they must be together.

141
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,430
Really?

142
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,110
Doctor Nongning?

143
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,460
Nah, that's crazy.
What time does he have to flirt?

144
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,969
We work in the hospital.

145
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,109
They are both doctors, right?

146
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,089
- Right.
- So... what time does he have to flirt?

147
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,839
The two doctors work in the hospital
and see each other every day.

148
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,289
I see him every day, too.

149
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,390
But you are a nurse.
So, just keep sitting there and working.

150
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,140
But I love him.

151
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,160
Keep working.

152
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,020
Put your little heart in your pocket.

153
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, hey boys.
Come on in.

154
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,590
I think the doctor can see us.

155
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,040
Is it me again?

156
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,780
Do I have to get out of
the lift again?

157
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,850
Wait a minute!

158
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,700
You can see me?

159
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,510
Doctor, you can see, right?

160
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Doctor, help us...

161
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,120
What the hell is with today...

162
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,180
Doctor, don't go!

163
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,460
Are you stressed?

164
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,500
What's wrong?

165
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,030
Don't tell me...

166
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,890
Again?

167
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,070
Then tonight... the two of us...

168
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,570
will go see some men?

169
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,800
Let's go.

170
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,510
By the way... That being said...

171
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,590
How are his symptoms?

172
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,309
The symptoms are the same.

173
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,520
But there's a chance they might get worse.

174
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,750
It's still the final stage of cancer.

175
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,060
But you don't have to worry.
I'll help you take care of him.

176
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,520
- Thanks.
- Mhm.

177
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,000
Met has been sleeping too long.

178
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,329
He's been like that ever since the
fall down the stairs.

179
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,090
It's been 3 weeks he's been in a coma.

180
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,820
His outcome is looking worse and worse.

181
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,749
I wonder

182
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,850
if I should tell this young boy's parents
to prepare for the worst.

183
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,380
Well, let's go eat.

184
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,140
Eat what?

185
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,570
Food.

186
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,860
Fine, let's go.

187
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,210
You got it, Doctor!

188
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,909
You invited me out to eat, but...

189
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,489
You just poke around on your phone?

190
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,389
Hey, get your face out of the phone.

191
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,670
But...

192
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,569
But I want to vote my son
to win "Asia's Cute Boy."

193
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,019
Use your phone, too.

194
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,940
Your phone, where's your phone?

195
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,619
- Your phone!
- What are you doing?

196
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,020
Hey, hey, hey...

197
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,530
If you're going to be an overbearing mom,
you'll trouble me all the time.

198
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,570
Hey...

199
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,420
Motherly love is great.

200
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,120
We can't abandon our children!

201
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,690
You wouldn't understand...

202
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,940
A mother's feelings.

203
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,230
Wow.

204
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,150
You talk like he's my nephew.

205
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,340
Hey.

206
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,240
It would be great if that's the case!

207
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,210
Annoying!

208
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,030
Disgusting!

209
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,830
What's wrong?

210
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,799
You don't have to throw it away
even if it doesn't taste good.

211
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,220
I'll try it.

212
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,060
It's fine.

213
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,820
You made such a big deal,
I thought it went bad.

214
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,610
Delicious.

215
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,599
But so sour!

216
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,990
Where did you buy it?

217
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,990
You...

218
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,599
What are you saying?

219
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,750
Is it delicious?

220
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,829
I already said it's delicious.

221
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,300
- But...
- What? What?

222
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,990
Why are you throwing it away?

223
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,750
What?

224
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,020
You're so weird, super weird.

225
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,659
What do you mean?

226
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,309
I just ate a mango like normal.
What's weird?

227
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,110
What's weird is you.
What's wrong with you?

228
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,550
You've been like this
since voting for your son.

229
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,851
Why did you vote so much?
Your phone bill will be so high.

230
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,580
Whatever.

231
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,250
- Wait~
- What?

232
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,110
Are you ready?

233
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm always ready.

234
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,799
Today, I'll play the role of a spoiled
young lady and you'll be my bodyguard.

235
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,470
- Let's go!
- Wait, wait, wait...

236
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,030
You want to roleplay?

237
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,070
Of course.
Let's go.

238
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,530
Please go back.

239
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,250
This is not your responsibility.

240
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,649
I'm begging you.
Please give me a chance.

241
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,130
Let me go in and check it out.

242
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,500
Okay?

243
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,079
This is not within your area of duty.

244
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,910
What are you doing here?

245
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,820
Come on, just let me in.

246
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,070
I'll make sure you get
a lot of merit later.

247
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,090
Hey!

248
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,380
He still slipped right by me.

249
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,580
Cheers.

250
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,070
Hey...
What?

251
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,290
Can you take off the sunglasses?

252
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,539
It's dark and there are so many people.

253
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,090
Don't tell me you saw a ghost.
The ghost wouldn't see you.

254
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,900
I don't want any problems here.

255
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,829
But if it's a problem with people it
can be resolved.

256
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,999
But if you have a problem with a ghost...

257
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,580
it's difficult to resolve.

258
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,770
But if you're wearing sunglasses,
pretending to be famous,

259
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,190
you will definitely see a ghost.

260
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,259
I'm used to it.

261
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,699
But what about you?

262
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,810
What's up with the guy your
friend introduced you to?

263
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,580
- You mean Pete?
- Yeah.

264
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,470
He's so cute!

265
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,310
He even called me the
other day...

266
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,650
Speak normal language.

267
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,189
Jimmy is your brother.
(Chinese)

268
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,190
Come on...

269
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,170
He's so cute.

270
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,350
He even took me to a rooftop
restaurant for dinner the other day.

271
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,150
- Cute, sweet, and romantic.
- He's perfect.

272
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,140
Congrats.

273
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,210
I'm so happy.

274
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,800
How about you?

275
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,699
Still can't get over that guy?

276
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,660
That male nurse...

277
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,180
It's hard to forget.

278
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,600
Since I broke up with Perth,

279
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,900
I haven't met anyone I like that much.

280
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,369
Wow, so hard to forget.

281
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,100
When you meet such an adorable
and sweet little cutie

282
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,980
you forget right away.

283
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,770
- How about it?
- What?

284
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,650
You going after him?

285
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,209
He's by himself. Must be lonely.

286
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,550
Go.

287
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,010
Hurry.

288
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,690
What's wrong with you?

289
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,110
"What's wrong with you?"

290
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,050
Hey, what are you doing?

291
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,099
Don't you like it?

292
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,580
I can delete it.

293
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,459
Nevermind.

294
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,980
You already took it.

295
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,580
Then...

296
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,540
Give me your tag.

297
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,460
I want to post it on Instagram.

298
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,460
Actually, I don't want to give it to you.

299
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
But just because the
picture is already there.

300
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,130
Okay.

301
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,050
There.

302
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,170
Bank?

303
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Yes.

304
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,550
Cute name.

305
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,620
Thank you.

306
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,659
Oops,
I think I mistook you for someone else.

307
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,889
Thought you were my
primary school classmate.

308
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,650
I'm going back to my table now.
My girlfriend is over there.

309
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,140
Then, um...

310
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,050
You should do more merit.

311
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,540
Okay?

312
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,340
Okay.

313
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,910
They live in different worlds
but still not letting go.

314
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,540
Is love really that important?

315
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,980
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

316
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,970
- How'd it go?
- What?

317
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,770
Did you get his number?
Instagram?

318
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,370
- Did you get one?
- I got it.

319
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,490
Got his name and instagram.

320
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,670
- What's his name?
- Bank.

321
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,730
Cute, right?

322
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,580
Pretty cute.

323
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,310
Would be better if it was cranberry juice.

324
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,930
Love, love, love...

325
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,430
Human love.

326
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,460
Why did you drink so much?

327
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,800
Hey, careful.

328
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,870
I'm in a good mood.
You got the cute guy's insta.

329
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,770
Can you go down?

330
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,130
What's that kid's name?

331
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,940
His name is Bank, it's Bank.

332
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,230
- Cute name!
- Hey...

333
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,340
Can you make it?

334
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,680
You gonna throw up?
Hold it down.

335
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,080
- You taking me home?
- Yes, I'm taking you.

336
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,520
Don't scream.
Why are you screaming?

337
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,830
I was just scared by you.
Why are you screaming?

338
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,250
I wasn't scared by you.
Just thought I saw something.

339
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,070
You saw something?
Where?

340
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,410
Calm down...

341
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,169
- Please God...
- Not that way!

342
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,670
Go up, up.

343
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,720
( TN: Chanting Mantra )

344
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,370
You're still here?

345
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,370
Here I am.

346
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,220
Thank you for saving my
husband's life, Doctor.

347
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,019
Thank you, Doctor.

348
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,150
If something happened to my father,
our family would be devastated.

349
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,810
Here.

350
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,090
Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,910
I told you now.

352
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,440
- What time is the appointment?
- Right now.

353
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,909
From now on, let me know.

354
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,000
- Okay.
- That's it then. Bye.

355
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,979
How are you doing today?

356
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,209
I'm okay.
Just a little tired.

357
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,300
Okay.
Let me listen to your lungs.

358
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,620
Take a deep breath.

359
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,340
Take a deeper breath.

360
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,560
Even deep breath.

361
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,860
- Patient, please take a deeper breath.
- Any deeper and I'll suffocate.

362
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,850
Sorry.

363
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,330
Take a deep breath.

364
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,290
Okay, lungs are normal.

365
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,220
But I'm worried about your neck.

366
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,180
It looks a little bigger than normal.

367
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,840
Well, you may have hyperthyroidism.

368
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,079
Don't worry, I'll have the nurse
take you to the endocrine department.

369
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,259
That way,
you can have the specialist check.

370
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,990
So rest assured.

371
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,800
Nurse, will you please take the patient
to the fifth floor of the next building?

372
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
Okay.

373
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Here.

374
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,940
See you later.

375
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,810
I hope not.

376
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,450
Thank you.

377
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,620
Fifth floor please.

378
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,980
- I'm waiting in the garden -

379
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,220
Did you see a patient's ghost again?

380
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,380
How did you know?

381
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,929
Everytime I see you,
you're thinking about it.

382
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:15,580
I think you should really find a way
to stop seeing ghosts, okay?

383
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,430
What do you want me to do?

384
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,220
I don't know what to do.

385
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,780
There's no time to go out.

386
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,129
Well, I have to do rounds,
shifts in the ER and PD...

387
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,630
I'm busy enough just being a doctor.

388
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,150
Why don't we try together?

389
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
We're friends after all, aren't we?

390
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,920
I love my friend.

391
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,690
I'll take your shifts instead.

392
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,780
Then, you can go out and find a
way to stop seeing ghosts, okay?

393
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,920
- Is this really a good idea?
- Yeah, it is.

394
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,700
It's just a small thing to do for a friend.

395
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,349
I just need you to help me
with a little something, too.

396
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,700
Just a little extra money for my kid.

397
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,580
I knew it.

398
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,570
You just wanted money.

399
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,090
But whatever.

400
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,180
You'll help for a little fee?

401
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,500
Thanks, friend.

402
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,180
It's nothing much, my friend.

403
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,890
Transfer it?

404
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,450
- You mean this?
- Hey, not that!

405
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,860
Here, here...

406
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,940
That won't work.

407
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,500
Unbelievable,
do they all just copy each other?

408
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,210
None of that is useful.

409
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,380
I give up.

410
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,620
This isn't the first time I tried to
stop seeing ghosts.

411
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,590
It's been like this since I was a kid.

412
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,139
Don't go too fast.
Ride straight so you don't fall.

413
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,749
Hey, where are you going?
Can I go, too?

414
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,620
Sure, get on.

415
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,930
He's doing it again.

416
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,689
He'll have trouble if this doesn't end.

417
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,890
I want to walk with you,
wait for me, ride slower.

418
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,900
Hurry up.

419
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,840
- Wait a minute, Dad.
- Okay.

420
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,980
Wait for me. Slow down.

421
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,690
Wait for me.

422
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,530
Follow me.

423
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,229
Dad, Mom...

424
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,100
Isn't my friend cute?

425
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Yes.

426
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,159
Want to go have sweets?

427
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,810
Let's go.

428
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,110
Dad, can I take my friend to get sweets?

429
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,420
Sure.

430
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,580
He's like this often, Doctor.

431
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,780
Little Phum's blood test and
brain x-rays are all normal.

432
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,700
There is nothing for
you two to worry about.

433
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,780
We'll keep you for just a little longer.

434
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:36,920
Or could it be something
like an imaginary friend?

435
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,550
Little Phum...

436
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,749
Do you have a picture of your friend?

437
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,010
- Can I see it?
- Okay.

438
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,130
Hi there

439
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,690
Watch your step!

440
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,380
Don't step there.

441
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,790
My son Guma is lying down there.

442
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,070
You don't have the skills yet
so you cannot see him.

443
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,740
So... don't bother him.

444
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,280
Sit there!

445
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,120
There!

446
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Wait!

447
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,330
You...

448
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,150
suffer from doing bad deeds.

449
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,819
You want me to help you.

450
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,060
So that you stop seeing ghosts.

451
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,860
But you-!

452
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
You have made very little merit.

453
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,400
Your past sins will haunt you.

454
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,900
It doesn't matter what you do,

455
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,110
They will prevent you from being happy!

456
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,320
Spirits!

457
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,740
Spirits!

458
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,030
Spirits!

459
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,319
Spirits...

460
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,200
They follow you everywhere!

461
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,390
But its okay because you're here now.

462
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:14,440
I, the Tiger Master,
will help fix your karma!

463
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,980
Show him what he needs to do
to fix his karma!

464
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,820
No need to look at it.

465
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:48,410
Because people like you have a lot
of karma to be fixed.

466
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:15,070
Before telling others to waste
money and fix fake karma,

467
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:19,540
isn't it better to do a little merit
and exorcise your own first?

468
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,970
Do some merit.

469
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,430
I'm mad!
You, you! Come here!

470
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,450
How dare you insult me!

471
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,940
Isn't this a waste of time?

472
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,900
Huh? That's strange.

473
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,180
You can see me?

474
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,000
Well, it's good you didn't believe
that scammer in there.

475
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,659
If a young man like yourself
wants a blessing,

476
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,050
just go pray to the angel
of the big Bodhi tree.

477
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,790
Angel of the Bodhi tree?

478
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,280
- Is my basil fried rice ready? I've
been waiting forever.
- It's coming.

479
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,189
Basil fried rice, same as last time.

480
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,750
Alright!

481
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,940
- Another plate of the basil fried rice please.
- Got it.

482
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,220
What is it, P'Shan?

483
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,340
You asked the communications department
to reset the system for me again?

484
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,316
Only because you don't answer.
You ignore my calls and hang up.

485
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,660
Come to my office right now, Angel Krit.

486
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,770
I want to talk to you about the position
for the Angel Chief.

487
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,699
Can't you tell me later, Shan?

488
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,840
- I don't want it...
- Come now.

489
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,590
Fine.

490
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,500
Work is fun.
Look at all these stressed faces.

491
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,870
Hello!

492
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,290
Look over it carefully.

493
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,169
Hey, Auntie!

494
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,330
Have you been mopping?

495
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,750
It's so clean!

496
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,960
Hey, you have so much work.

497
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,090
Have other people do some, too.

498
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,620
Work must be tight, right?

499
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,190
P'Shan, you work too much.

500
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,430
Why don't you take some time off?

501
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,610
Can you stop calling me " p' " (brother)
around here?

502
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,340
I'm your boss.

503
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,070
How distant.

504
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:56,220
We're all brothers and sisters of
the angel code, right P'Shan?

505
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,340
Or should I call you... Oppa!
(TN: Korean for brother)

506
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,580
Oppa! Oppa! Oppa!

507
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,709
Like the girls like to call Korean boys.

508
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,010
It's very popular.

509
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,599
The position of Angel
Chief is now available.

510
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,689
The previous Chief just
left because he fell in love.

511
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,820
You will take that position now.

512
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,010
Oppa...

513
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,750
You're no fun.

514
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,059
I don't want to, P'Shan!

515
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,860
The chief position is so boring.

516
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,199
You have to deal with the angels
and send out the angel paperwork.

517
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,359
Then, when will I have time to play?

518
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,430
It's so boring.

519
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,060
Just going on simple missions
isn't worthwhile.

520
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,219
You've been here for 300 years already.

521
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,860
It's time that you take a position
in management.

522
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,830
Don't just play around watching humans
and run out of merit points.

523
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,780
If you ran out of merit, you can
just look for more.

524
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,830
Right? Right?

525
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,360
I'm a sacred Bodhi tree angel after all.

526
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,040
Okay? Okay?

527
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,510
See?

528
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,009
The merit is here!

529
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,030
Someone is asking a wish from me.

530
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,160
I'll be going now... Oppa!

531
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,170
Annyeong!
(Korean: Bye)

532
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,090
Wait, Krit.

533
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,270
What subordinate?

534
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:07,230
He never obeys and just brings me
headaches almost everyday.

535
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,550
Oppa?

536
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:35,710
- Angel Krit -

537
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,330
Young man.

538
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,430
Excuse me, Uncle.

539
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,570
What the heck?

540
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,980
According to that spirit eariler,

541
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,249
the angel of the sacred Bodhi tree
is extremely powerful.

542
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,070
And beautiful...

543
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,449
