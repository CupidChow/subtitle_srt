1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,770
   

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,220
   

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,310
   

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,970
   

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,860


6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,050
   

7
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,600
 It's an invitation. 

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,270
 They are setting up the biggest game in this country there. 

9
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,790
 Kim Yo Han received an invitation. 

10
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,070
 The Skin Nation listing ceremony. 

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,900
 So when you go there that day, 

12
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,470
 team up with Jang Seon Oh the way you did when you were here. 

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
 Go and win the Goldman slush fund and bring it to me. 

14
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,060
 What? 

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,720
 Did you think you were the only one working for me? 

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,150
 Jang Seon Oh is also my possession. 

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,980
 He works for me like you. 

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,490
 I'll do as you say. 

19
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,870
 Will you be okay seeing Jang Seon Oh? 

20
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,490
There'll be only one game table when you get inside the VIP room.

21
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,580
 In order to enable the VIPs to stay in the room and focus, 

22
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,890
there are always bartenders, cooks, and security guards there.

23
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,220
Staff from each department are always on standby.

24
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,110
Our first round of change in clothes can be taken from there.

25
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,810
And I've already transferred the promised deposit of 500 million that the dealer agreed to.

26
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,510
He'll also help you change into the second round of clothes.

27
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,150
Good work.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,080
Did Chief Prosecutor Mok agree?

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,750
What?

30
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,320
Are we going to do it here?

31
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
We haven't met like this in a while, right?

32
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,010
Take a shot.

33
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,030
Three o'clock, seven o'clock, eleven o'clock...

34
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,320
Who are these guys you dragged along?

35
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,390
They don't seem like investigators.

36
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,280
Part-timers.

37
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,620
Expensive part-timers.

38
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,510
Those guys have been following you before you even came in here.

39
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,270
Did you catch on?

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,180
Why didn't you run?

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,770
Well, really just to

42
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,460
have a talk with you.

43
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,270
It is Chief Prosecutor Yoon, isn't it?

44
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,360
The one that wants my head.

45
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,060
If it weren't for him, there'd no other reason for you to make a move like this.

46
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,910
If you get rid of me,

47
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,300
will he let you stay in Seoul instead of sending you to the Daejeon High Prosecutor's Office?

48
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,560
I've had my share of dilemmas.

49
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,640
For me to figure you out is one thing, but

50
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,610
why is Chief Prosecutor Yoon so eager to get at you?

51
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,800
Your life is already in shambles

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
although you were released from prison,

53
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,150
right?

54
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,190
Are you interested?

55
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,260
Is it a story worth listening to?

56
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,120
 Mr. Nam is already in Incheon? 
 (T/N: Nam Dae Moon) 

57
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
 I deposited the remaining balance yesterday. 

58
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,310
Isn't Goldman Casino for foreigners only?

59
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,700
The afterparty for The Skin Nation IPO will be held there.

60
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,460
We'll get in without an issue because the party is for local VIPs.

61
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,140
Goldman VIP, slush fund, and the

62
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,060
Bukyeongpa gang...

63
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,620
For a job of this scale,

64
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,090
instead of going back to prison if something goes wrong,

65
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,380
you might go into the Incheon sea and never come back out.

66
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,410
You don't need to worry about that.

67
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,240
If things get even slightly dangerous, withdraw right away.

68
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,610
The remaining balance of 300 million won out of the 500 million won that Yo Han promised you

69
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,810
will definitely be paid by me.

70
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,680
You can swim back out even with one arm for that much money, right?

71
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,170
Do you not trust me?

72
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,640
No, it's not you that I don't trust...

73
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,060
All right. There's that, but

74
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,810
how exactly are you going to fool Jang Seon Oh?

75
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,250
Jang Seon Oh?

76
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,020
As for Jang Seon Oh...

77
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,360
you're going to fool him, Mr. Nam.

78
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,560
 CEO. 

79
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,790
You can stay here.

80
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,970
It'll be dangerous.

81
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,710
It's okay.

82
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,640
I...

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,130
have this.

84
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,260
 Did you find the location post-processing? 

85
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,940
 What about the camera? 

86
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,590
 Do you see it? 

87
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,440
Right now, he is looking for a place to bury our bodies.

88
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,400
Since this place costs about 8 billion won...

89
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,970
Okay.

90
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,480
I call on 6 billion won

91
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,650
and raise a VIP room.

92
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,000
Call.

93
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,950
 A-9 full house for me. 

94
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,630
 That bastard has A-10 full house. 

95
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:55,030
All right, now then this is my place now. Right?

96
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,700
Aigoo, Mr. Nam.

97
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,780
Long time no see.

98
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,920
Yes, long time no see.

99
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,290
No hard feelings, right?

100
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,350
- Of course not. 
 - That's my man.

101
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,320
Always zipping it up nicely. 
  (T/N: Referring to his nickname, "Nam Dae Moon," slang for open fly) 

102
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,710
You heard the plan from Yo Han, right?

103
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,860
Yes.

104
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,780
Good. Now then, let's patrol around here as naturally as we can

105
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,140
until Director Jin goes home.

106
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,900
 This was filmed four days ago. 

107
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,780
 The destination... 
    

108
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,740
 He went to Japan. 

109
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,020
 That Mr. Woo Sang Ki. 

110
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,070
 CEO Yang, you aren't on good terms with the Japanese. 

111
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,450
 I'm guessing you can't go get him. 

112
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,310
 Ms. Stevens. 

113
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,500
 Yes. 

114
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,930
 How much of the Goldman slush fund do we have left? 

115
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,760
 Director Jin? 

116
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,470
   

117
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,790
It's 300 billion won.

118
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,570
 Then how long can we last? 

119
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
About one quarter?

120
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,600
 Director Jin. 

121
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,230
 Do you all know Enron, which was once the most innovative corporation in the U.S.? 

122
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,930
 Those guys pulled accounting fraud and the minute they lost all shareholders' trust, 

123
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,310
 it took them less than two months to go bankrupt. 

124
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,970
 You and your brother know what to do to retain trust, right? 

125
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,260
Don't stop...

126
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,640
Never stop the flow of money.

127
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,290
 Yes. 

128
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,490
 Never stop. 

129
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,930
 Money is like blood. 

130
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,900
 If it stops flowing... 

131
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,640
 you die. 

132
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,910
Director Jin will come out of there soon.

133
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay, no guards.

134
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,400
But what do we do if the Bukyeongpa gang comes out with her?

135
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,390
Wouldn't it be better to park outside, wait, and ambush?

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,750
- Hey, pull over. 
 - Here?

137
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,290
- Pull over. 
 - Wait, this place is a littlâ€“

138
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,570
I said pull over!

139
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,960
Wait here.

140
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,760
   

141
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,860
   

142
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,030
Sh*t.

143
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,750
 Got Director Jin. 

144
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,630
I'm out.

145
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
Betting? 
    

146
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,470
Nam Dae...

147
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,140
F*cking Nam Dae Moon!

148
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,910
 Jang Seon Oh is chasing geese. 

149
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,610
Betting?

150
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,750
Let me see, Chairman Yang...

151
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,930
I see there is a weight difference.

152
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,180
Lock the doors.

153
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,650
I apologize, Chairman.

154
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,180
Did you, by any chance,

155
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,730
make a deal with this f***er

156
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,260
without me knowing?

157
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,630
We're just having fun. What are you doing on a good day like this?

158
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,710
Acting like a crass clown.

159
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,670
CEO Cha, is there anything you want to tell me?

160
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,890
Chairmaâ€”

161
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,420
what are you doing right now?

162
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,840
Please help! Help!

163
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,540
Choose your words carefully.

164
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Otherwise, I'll make you want to die right here.

165
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,950
You're one of them, right?

166
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,330
Did you go over to their side?

167
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,880
Who is it?

168
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,090
Who?!

169
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,110
I don't know anything, Sir.

170
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,900
I really don't know!

171
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,090
When I use words, they always think

172
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,660
- it's just a warning. 
 - Stop.

173
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,230
Drop the knife and let the dealer go.

174
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,950
Soo Yeon!

175
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,990
What is that?

176
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,990
Is it real?

177
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,400
When I use words, they always think it's just a warning.

178
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,770
 And in a real emergency... 

179
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,610
 I have this too. 

180
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,880
 If you use this 

181
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,430
 you really can't go back. 

182
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,080
 If everything goes as planned, 

183
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,420
 that would definitely be great. 

184
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
 You know how a fight goes, no? 

185
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,190
 You never know what'll happen where. 

186
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,730
 We are so small and our enemy is massive. 

187
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,860
 This much... is needed for us to survive. 

188
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you done, Soo Yeon?

189
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,050
Yes, I am done.

190
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,900
One moment.

191
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,180
Let me go right now!

192
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,600
Untie me!

193
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,260
You two.

194
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,220
Since when did you plan this, huh?

195
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,180
Since wheâ€”

196
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,560
Hey!

197
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,670
Take care of this, please.

198
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,640
 Buster call, buster call. One male and one female. 

199
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,580
 The male's name is Kim Yo Han. 180 cm tall and in a bartender getup. 

200
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,920
 Lean muscles and short hair. 

201
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,770
 The female's name is Oh Soo Yeon. About 170 cm tall and in a casino staff getup. 

202
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,350
 Long hair and brown eyes. 

203
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,210
 Go get them. 

204
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,370
 Copy, over. 

205
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,240
Sh*t.

206
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
- A blackout? 
 - What's going on?

207
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,810
Turn the lights on right now!

208
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,810
Hurry up! Turn it on!

209
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,490
Hey!

210
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,690
Sh*t. Hey!

211
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,620
- Where did she go? 
 - Run and find her!

212
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,140
Sh*t.

213
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,570
Let's talk it out, man.

214
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,480
Don't you even care that I'm your sunbae?

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,630
Do you do whatever they tell you to do, huh?

216
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,910
Let's talk, let's talk.

217
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,730
Step on it, Hyung. That's how you dig.

218
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,920
That's why you bastards are out digging

219
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,100
in the middle of the night on the mountain!

220
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,420
- You f***ers! 
 - So loud!

221
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,610
Go, dig.

222
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,710
Who are you, huh?

223
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,250
Who is that?

224
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,750
A car's coming.

225
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,150
You motherf***ers!

226
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,980
Get them!

227
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,380
 F***ers! You want to die?! 

228
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,970
Seya... 
  (T/N: How Jo Hae Do addresses his victims before torturing them) 

229
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,290
Seya...

230
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,390
Is this how you do it? Seya.

231
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,960
What is it that you want?

232
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,870
An alliance.

233
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,670
What do I get in return?

234
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,850
The Bukyeongpa gang.

235
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,670
   

236
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,930
We are connected, right?

237
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,250
 Yes. We're starting now. 

238
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,910
There are people building slush funds through a casino.

239
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,740
Chairman Yang guards the casino.

240
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,170
The ones protecting Chairman Yang are Hong Sang Wook and Yoon Byung Wook.

241
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,330
Finally, the one managing the slush fund account

242
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,020
is Director Jin.

243
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,540
While I distract Chairman Yang,

244
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,790
please go and get Director Jin Soo Min.

245
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,270
Get her, and then?

246
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,740
Then Oh Soo Yeon will hack Jin Soo Min's phone into the account

247
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,030
and use Director Jin as a hostage in case

248
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,230
I can't escape the casino.

249
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,240
 If all this is true, 

250
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,390
 then Yoon Byung Wook, Hong Sang Wook... 

251
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,530
 The CID will crumble. 

252
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,940
What is this umbrella doing here?

253
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,820
We're trying to identify the license plate.

254
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,670
Jang Seon Oh, Kim Yo Han...

255
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,230
and Oh Soo Yeon.

256
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,940
- You ordered their capture, right? 
 - Yes.

257
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,310
I sent all of our men besides the ones who are on the casino shift.

258
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,700
I also notified the police with a bounty on them.

259
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,910
How much?

260
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,690
Twenty million won per head, Sir.

261
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,670
Raise it to 100 million won each.

262
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,180
What about Hyung?

263
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,860
   

264
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,890
Hey, what about the police? 
    

265
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,200
One hundred million?

266
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,450
Contact the men at the

267
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,820
industrial park and the dockside as well.

268
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,680
Yes. Same 100 million won.

269
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,480
The meeting ended just now.

270
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
I'll be right there. What about Chairman Yang?

271
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,690
Shot by a gun?

272
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,050
Long time no see.

273
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,190
Why did you take Director Jin?

274
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,740
I wanted to try logging into the slush fund account.

275
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,110
Looks like Woo Sang Ki failed?

276
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,520
Let me ask you something.

277
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,740
Min Ho...

278
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,330
The boy you killed with your car...

279
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,090
Did he ever visit you at night?

280
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,860
Nope.

281
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,960
Not yet.

282
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,200
Why?

283
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,940
Do you want to try me?

284
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,420
Yeah.

285
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,500
   

286
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,650
Where is Woo Sang Ki?

287
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,020
Where is Director Jin?

288
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,930
Just how much did you plan

289
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,230
with Jang Seon Oh and Do Won Bong?

290
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,040
Sh*t.

291
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,940
We worked our a**es off

292
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,200
to get us this far.

293
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,580
Do you think we'll let you take it all?

294
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,510
You bastard.

295
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,240
 Soo Yeon, the drug. 

296
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 How much of this do I apply? 

297
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,310
 About half of your pinky nail's size. 

298
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,030
 It's an animal tranquilizer. 

299
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,370
 They may be conscious, but will be completely paralyzed. 

300
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,390
 Thank you. I know you are risking your license for this. 

301
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,140
 I got my license, thanks to you. 

302
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,840
 And the revenge that you are trying to get 

303
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,100
 would also avenge me. 

304
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,640
 Put it on your fingertips. 

305
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,640
 Director Jin's Labuan Bank account credentials...
   

306
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,740
 You must get it without Chief Prosecutor Mok knowing. 

307
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,570
 So why go through the trouble to bring him to Incheon then? 

308
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,540
 Just setting things up in advance. 

309
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,800
Stay still.

310
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,820
 Fortunately, the ID and password cache are here. 

311
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,090
   

312
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,350
 It's okay. It's okay. 

313
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,670
Hey, reinforce the face covering.

314
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,200
Hyungnim.

315
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,830
Chief Prosecutor.

316
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,790
Could you make sure the multi-tab is plugged in?

317
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,150
The connection is not stable.

318
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,700
   
   

319
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,370
 The way to log into the Goldman's slush fund account in Labuan Bank 

320
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,000
 is to type in the ID and password first 

321
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,520
 and then pass the iris recognition. 

322
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,470
 You are saying we need Director Jin's eyes, right? 

323
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,400
 There are two registered irises. 

324
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,870
 Director Jin's... and Yang Hwa's. 

325
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,180
   

326
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,730
   

327
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,950
   

328
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,420
   

329
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,270
 Why not just get Director Jin's iris? 

330
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,340
 Why are you putting yourself in danger? 

331
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,770
 You think Jin Soo Mi will let us use her eyes that easily? 

332
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,140
 It'll be impossible without hurting someone. 

333
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,230
 And if I have to hurt someone... 

334
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,590
 I'll help you. 

335
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,470
Hey...

336
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,740
I'll transfer this money to an account for

337
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,820
that kid you killed.

338
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
   

339
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,600
   

340
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,590
   
   

341
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,220
Hey, you.

342
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,840
Did you try to ditch me?

343
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,020
- No, the situation was... 
 - Sh*t.

344
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,860
Whatever.

345
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,130
Somebody else got to Director Jin first.

346
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,660
- What did you say? 
 - Geez!

347
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,500
Sir, stop there!

348
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,090
Hyungnim, Hyungnim! 
    

349
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,170
   
   

350
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,340
Hey, hey!

351
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,680
The one that Goldman's looking for. 
    

352
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,180
We lost him.

353
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,390
Hello? Yes.

354
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,500
We found one of the people that Goldman is looking for.

355
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,850
Yes, yes.

356
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,180
 Move it. 

357
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,220
 Split up and find him. 

358
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,940
 We'll go this way! You guys go that way! 

359
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,430
 Go now! 

360
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,490
 Try some dumplings. 

361
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,360
 Have some dumplings. 

362
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,220
 Take a look. 

363
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,060
It's him! It's him! 
    

364
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,770
- You, stop! 
 - Get him!

365
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,690
Over there! Get him!

366
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,300
Stop right there, Bastard!

367
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,640
- Come here. 
 - Sh*t!

368
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,630
- Sh*t. 
 - Let's go, son.

369
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,750
- We got him now. 
 - Stay still.

370
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,050
- Hold him! 
 - F***.

371
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,790
That way. Get him!

372
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,410
Run.

373
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,870
Get him!

374
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,290
- Get him! 
 - D*** it!

375
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,330
I'm from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division.

376
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,030
Kim Yo Han, you're arrested for violating the Capital Market Law and

377
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,800
the Securities Exchange Act, illegal gambling, tax evasion,

378
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,440
bribery, and instigated murder.

379
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,270
Jang Seon Oh is coming in.

380
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,170
Give them the reward.

381
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,230
Where is Director Jin?

382
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,130
I don't know...

383
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,000
I really, really don't know.

384
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,380
I'm asking where Director Jin is.

385
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,940
I don't know. I swear.

386
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,580
You heard, right? We're on the same boat now.

387
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,400
   

388
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,520
Transferring the hard-earned

389
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,610
Skin Nation stocks to Dosan Holdings right after they go public...

390
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,350
I did hear that Chairman Do's nickname is Dosan-ro Polar Bear.

391
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,600
But Dosan Holdings?

392
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,890
He's just boasting.

393
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,870
Saying, "This is a gift from me."

394
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,400
As thanks for

395
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
overlooking his takeover of the Yang brothers' territory.

396
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,300
He's willing to take and hand over the legal corporation that

397
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,470
those thugs finally achieved through their entire lives.

398
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,940
Chairman Do's intentions to gift it

399
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,530
and the Seocho-dong prosecutors readily accepted it...

400
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,210
Why are prosecutors like that?

401
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,770
When the smartest bastards of this country

402
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,750
fight for advancement in their career in a single organization,

403
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,230
what do you think they need to win?

404
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,630
They need money and connections,

405
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,900
but the deciding factor is none other than achievements.

406
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,800
We, thugs, only need two weeks

407
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,550
for what the prosecutors would take two years to do.

408
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,740
So you should make amends with Hong Jae Sun for now.

409
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,810
You'll be seeing him often.

410
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,600
   

411
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,610
How did you know I was there?

412
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,470
There was a GPS on your body.

413
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,830
The suspension of execution for your Chairman Do will pass soon.

414
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,810
The inspector general will sign it soon.

415
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,520
How much of Seocho-dong did Chairman Do buy?

416
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,370
That oldie is your chairman, not mine.

417
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,610
I was only told to bring your a** to Seoul if it

418
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,100
looked like you would kick the bucket.

419
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,220
This is the life of a junior prosecutor like me, Yo Han.

420
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,910
Pull over here.

421
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,130
- What? 
 - I said pull over here.

422
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,980
I'm not done with work yet.

423
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,280
I'll get to Seoul on my own.

424
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,980
But still that oldie is my chairman, not yours.

425
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,560
   

426
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,790
All right, Sir.

427
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,860
Here, we have the contract.

428
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,790
All we need is a sign right there.

429
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,840
   

430
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,410
Yes.

431
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,780
Down here on the left, and we have that in the box.

432
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,350
350 million dollars.

433
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,950
He should pay more, actually.

434
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,460
Enough. We just transfer from a corporate account

435
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,440
to a personal account with the same name.

436
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,830
   

437
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,350
Yes, Yo Han.

438
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,970
By chance, is "Sinkhole" ready right now?

439
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,690
 Yes, but are you already in need of it? 

440
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,730
I'll give you the signal in 30 minutes.

441
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,790
If I don't give you the signal in 30 minutes,

442
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,530
please initiate it anyway.

443
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,910
I hope that won't be the case.

444
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,360
- What about Jin Soo Mi? 
 - Jin Soo Mi is over there.

445
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,730
She's in the car.

446
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,410
Hey. How did you make it out on your own?

447
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,490
I hid like a dead man and ran like the one about to die.

448
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,990
First of all, we need to leave Incheon.

449
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,270
It looks like the Bukyeongpa gang put bounties on our heads.

450
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,590
Even the police are after us.

451
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,860
Chief Prosecutor, please take Jin Soo Mi as far as possible

452
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,160
- and let her go. 
 - Why?

453
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,100
After all that hard work to capture her, we haven't got any info.

454
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,780
Since we got her phone, we can try hacking the account again.

455
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,180
Bringing Jin Soo Mi everywhere you go

456
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,300
creates the risk of you or Soo Yeon being exposed.

457
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,030
She hears and sees well.

458
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,320
And you?

459
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,110
Are you riding with Soo Yeon?

460
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,530
Yes.

461
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,400
I can't reach Nam Dae Moon right now.

462
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,770
I'll look for him with Soo Yeon as much as we can

463
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,160
- and go back up. 
 - Understood.

464
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,600
- Let's hurry. 
 - Okay.

465
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,550
What about Mr. Nam? Is he on standby?

466
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,570
Yes. Just like your plan.

467
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,200
But Yo Han,

468
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,790
pushing our luck to catch Jang Seon Oh like this mightâ€”

469
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,780
It's okay.

470
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,140
I think it's more than possible if Woo Sang Ki helps us.

471
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,570
I also have a backup plan just in case this was to happen.

472
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,770
Is it...

473
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,570
Sinkhole?

474
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,520
Yes.

475
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,140
We have to catch Jang Seon Oh.

476
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,050
Obtain the slush funds, too.

477
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,760
Those are the reasons why we came to Incheon.

478
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,330
Seon Oh...

479
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,020
Director Jin...

480
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,920
I don't know. I really don't know!

481
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,400
I just did what I was told to do.

482
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,540
Only Chairman Do knows what's going on. Really. Please...

483
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,070
I don't know anything...

484
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,710
   

485
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,490
This motherf***er.

486
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,840
   

487
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,840
Hello.

488
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,650
What is it?

489
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,100
He's asking for this guy in return for the slush fund.

490
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,710
- What? 
 - That's what Kim Yo Han said.

491
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,990
Crazy bastard.

492
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,860
   

493
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,700
Here.

494
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,070
You're walking into a tiger's den. You should at least have a gun.

495
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,450
Even if there are a hundred tigers in there,

496
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,220
they can't do anything against this money.

497
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,940
I will be back.

498
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,520
He did become a good sword, but...

499
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,730
Go tell them... 
      

500
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:13,440
that Woo Min Ho is back. 
    

501
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,380
Did you come here to kill yourself?

502
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,710
Not at all.

503
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:46,400
Try anything funny and all this money will be donated.

504
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,720
If I donate 300 billion won with my name before I die,

505
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,760
all the Deep Pockets will also know it's their money, right?

506
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,980
This one is worth 300 billion won?

507
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,800
What do you really want?

508
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,380
I'm just doing what I'm told.

509
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,110
You should ask Chairman Do Won Bong about that.

510
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,540
Do you mean he directed all this to be done?

511
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,790
Why else would I come here?

512
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,800
If he's that important, send the money first.

513
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,170
Give me Jang Seon Oh first, "Sir."

514
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,300
Then I'll give you the phone and the account. Everything.

515
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,780
He'll die if you keep up.

516
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,070
Can you handle this?

517
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,850
Hey, this isn't the poker table.

518
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,330
Quit the bluffing.

519
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,540
Bluffing, my a**.

520
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,530
Kill him then.

521
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,250
Jang Seon Oh, come here.

522
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,060
Do you need me to really show you what I mean?

523
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,530
Come out, Jang Seon Oh.

524
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,580
Come if you want to live, Jang Sun Oh!

525
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,930
Well then, I'll be on my way to donate.

526
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,590
Hyung, Hyung...

527
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,400
Let them go.

528
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,920
Hyung!

529
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,590
Take him with you.

530
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,320
Here it is.

531
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,980
Hey. Bring that f***er's eyeball.

532
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,890
   

533
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,980
Hey.

534
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,480
What's with you?

535
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,810
What is this?

536
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,710
What are you doing?

537
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,660
Hyung!

538
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,940
They're going to be on our tails soon.

539
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,440
Trust me, I got this.

540
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,720
I'll also switch to a cab in the middle.

541
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,340
Okay then.

542
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,810
How are you going to tell Chairman Do about the Goldman slush funds?

543
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,350
"The funds..."

544
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,210
"are secured."

545
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,970
That's what I'll say.

546
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,950
Although Director Jin managed the money laundering at the casino,

547
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:16,070
the one to create a foreign tax haven

548
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:19,660
was Woo Sang Ki, who was an expert on Southeastern Asian underground financial transactions.

549
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,530
Anything is possible there with money and connections.

550
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,390
Woo Sang Ki can make a corporate account with Min Ho's name,

551
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,530
or a personal account with Min Ho's name.

552
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,370
Then the "Sinkhole" is...

553
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:38,400
transferring the 300 billion won in Min Ho's corporate account

554
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,710
into Min Ho's personal account?

555
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,280
   

556
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,960
 Well, for an amount like 300 billion won to be moved, 

557
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,700
 it takes some time because the bank also has to go through a verification processes. 

558
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,300
Moving from one corporate account to a personal account under the same name, however,

559
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,790
the bank also suspects nothing much.

560
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,100
One click is all it takes.

561
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,420
   

562
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,610
   

563
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,890
   

564
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:28,330
Those bastards must feel pushed off a cliff right now.

565
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,990
   

566
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,140
What the f*** are we going to do?!

567
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:43,650
   

568
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:50,860
   

569
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,810
And you taking that money back into your hands.

570
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,370
Yes.

571
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,020
For all of our revenge...

572
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,660
The sinkhole was actually planned for taking down Do Won Bong,

573
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,980
but it'd have been such a shame to lose Jang Sun Oh.

574
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:18,200


575
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,110
It's about time we get Jang Seon Oh's confession.

576
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,860
 I'm not... 

577
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,910
 done yet. 

578
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:40,670
â™«  The night is becoming darker  â™«

579
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,750
   

580
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,620
â™«  I will not stoop so low  â™«

581
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:54,760
â™«  Who was the justice for?  â™«

582
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,570
â™«  There was no one, not anywhere  â™«

583
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,300
â™«  Nowhere like heaven  â™«

584
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,820
â™«  Nowhere, nowhere  â™«

585
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,320
â™«  Couldn't you swallow it?  â™«

586
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,630
 What exactly can this prove? 

587
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,110
 Do you know who killed Inspector Kwon? 

588
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,320
 We can reach Yoon Byung Ok if we just break this shackle. 

589
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,320
 Then why do you hesitate? It's dangerous. 

590
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,370
 If the law could change the world, we wouldn't have even met. 

591
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,990
 Please give me some more time. 

592
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:28,870
 Why does it seem like it's only natural that I kill you? 

593
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:34,440
 If Seocho-dong can help us a little, we can restore everything in 24 hours. 

594
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,710
 I know. 

595
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:40,100
 Please upload all the data you have for managing the account. 

596
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,020
 Why do you seek to work for us? 

597
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,770
 To hold the handle of sword called the law, and slaughter all the f***ers 

598
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:50,440
 who messed up my life this way. 

599
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,650
â™«  I'll keep going toward the end of life  â™«
