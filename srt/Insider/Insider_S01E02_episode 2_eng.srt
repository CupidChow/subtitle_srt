1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,540
   

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,880
   

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,270
   

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,770
   

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,050
   

6
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,450
Arms.

7
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,340
Next.

8
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,080
Kim Yo Han.

9
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,150
 You know, we took my car when we went there. 

10
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,160
 I guess the record of it came out. 

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,420
 I'm sorry to say this, 

12
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,670
 but can you say that you borrowed the car from me that day? 

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,380
 If I stay out of jail, 

14
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,960
 I could ask my dad to save you somehow. 

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,600
 But if I get caught with you and go to jail, 

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,290
 I'll be the only one who'll be released, man. 

17
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,680
 Then it'd be hopeless for you. 

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,800
 This is a matter of life and death now. 

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,690
 You, me, and your grandma. 

20
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,340
 For the three of us to stay alive, 

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,370
 we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly. 

22
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,890
Give me your car key.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,970
Hey, here.

24
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,550
Come on in.

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,030
 Yellow. 
 (T/N: A gangster gets a yellow name tag.) 

26
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,060
 This is a room for gangsters. 

27
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,280
Give me your stuff.

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,900
Introduce yourself.

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,140
 ...with sunshine. 

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,540
I'm Kim Yo Han. I'm here for illegal gambling.

31
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,920
 This is like a painting. 

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,170
How did a gambler end up in our room?

33
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,240
Hey, you.

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,350
Do you know Jang Seon Oh?

35
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,390
I don't think he's one of them.

36
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,050
I don't know Jang Seon Oh, but do you know Lee Tae Gwang?

37
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,550
 These are perennial plants. 

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,300
 Orange flowers blossom like a reddish sunset burning... 

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,410
What's going on?

40
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,190
From now on, we ask the questions.

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,080
You only have to answer honestly.

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,620
Wrap him up.

43
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,910
 The beautiful view reminds you of... 

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,200
Attention, everyone!

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,630
The dean is coming!

46
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,500
 With its tenacious vitality, 

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,100
He still has more time in solitary confinement, though.

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,350
 Now it's— 

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,600
Sit down, everyone.

50
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,710
The Crows are here. 
  (T/N: Crows: Nickname for prison guards) 

51
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,420
- Tools? 
 - They're in the workroom.

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,090
Open the door.

53
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,750
Freeze.

54
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
Sang 1, Room 8, inspection.

55
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,700
Come out, everyone.

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, didn't you hear we are going to inspect the room?

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,780
So-called "Hyungnims" tattled on me to the correctional department.

58
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,460
What a waste of tattoos.

59
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,810
Shut your f*cking mouth.

60
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,420
Let's have a ceremony.

61
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,920
I came back alive even after getting stabbed in the back.

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,200
- How did you get out? 
 - What do you mean?

63
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,100
I got to play.

64
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,630
With one bet, even a kitchen servant at the Ministry of Justice becomes Cinderella.

65
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,630
Isn't that the beauty of gambling?

66
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,850
♪ Shaba Shaba I Shaba ♪ 
  (T/N: Cinderella song for children) 

67
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,130
Your tag isn't yellow. What did you come in here for?

68
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,050
Gambling.

69
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,510
Right on. Even your number is Yangbang.
  (T/N: Yangbang: what comes before or after the card, making a straight.) 

70
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,430
Your face has the Five Blessings of a gambler. 
  (T/N: Confucianism: Longevity, Wealth, Health, Love of Virtue, Peaceful Death) 

71
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,860
The living room of Room 8 is clear.

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,050
Chicken is here.

73
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,060
Let's go, Chief.

74
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,800
Let's go home.

75
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,740
   

76
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,410
He's the Judicial Institute trainee who was caught at the gambling house in Gunae Mountain, right?

77
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,970
Yes.

78
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,270
Unity.

79
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,390
Come and eat before it gets cold.

80
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,490
How are the new guys?

81
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,770
They all seem quite dumb.

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,770
Sh*t! It's all fried batter and no meat.

83
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,990
How about Kim Yo Han?

84
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,370
He just went into the oil. 
  (T/N: Metaphorically speaking about him as a chicken) 

85
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,570
We'll see...

86
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,160
how he turns out.

87
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,770
You take care and do it well.

88
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,660
No accidents in Seongju Prison.

89
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,220
You know, right?

90
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey, Newbie! You'd better have it.

91
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,520
 There's this guy Lee Tae Gwang. 

92
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,130
 Whenever Chairman Yang goes on vacation to Macau, he's in charge of Yang's rolling. 
 (T/N: Rolling: Keeping his customer happy) 

93
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,550
 Can you get close to that Lee Tae Gwang and get that video? 

94
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,510
Hey, 2345. You have a visitor.

95
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,040
Who...

96
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,850
Wasn't I going to the visiting room?

97
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,720
Go inside.

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,470
Have a nice visit.

99
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,330
Hey, 2345!

100
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
Hey, Mister.

101
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,060
Are you seeking peace?

102
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,780
You vicious prick!

103
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,450
Our boss told me to tell you this.

104
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,090
First, compensation for the suspension of our house.

105
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,070
Second, compensation for us who can't work and

106
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,330
are rotting here because of you.

107
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:31,720
Third, compensation for embarrassing us in our line of work!

108
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,860
Including all that, 1 million won per week.

109
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,490
Our boss is telling you to pay that.

110
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,650
- Who is our boss? 
 - Ok!

111
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,500
Jo Hae Do. Unexpectedly, he is not all that stubborn.

112
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,020
He understands that there is a limit to your ability to make money here.

113
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,150
That's why he'll accept 1 million won a week in installment payments.

114
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,100
So say thank you and bow toward

115
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,730
that direction over there where Mr. Jo is.

116
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,570
What if I say no?

117
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,820
If you say no, then

118
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,550
the supermarket that your grandmother runs...

119
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,300
That supermarket where the land price jumped due to redevelopment. That supermarket.

120
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,180
   

121
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,730
- You'll have to hand it over to him. 
 - What if I don't want to do that, either?

122
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,260
If you don't like this and that and everything else,

123
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,880
then she is absolutely of no use.

124
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,460
Forget about the money.

125
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,720
Just consider her gone.

126
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,880
Gone.

127
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,180
You know what that means, right?

128
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,440
Grandma, are you crazy?

129
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,190
Bastard! How dare you come in here?

130
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,180
Get out of my house right now!

131
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,690
I said your grandson, who went to prison for gambling, owes me the deed to your house!

132
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,370
I came here to collect my money.

133
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,980
Bunch of bullsh*t!

134
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,580
Why would you look for my grandson's deed?

135
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,750
Get out of here! Get out right now!

136
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,130
Does this granny have rabies or something?

137
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,790
Come here.

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,060
You got it?

139
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,960
Let this go. Let Hae Do go!

140
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,560
It's over now. It's mine!

141
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,540
Where is it?

142
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,080
Sh*t!

143
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,800
Hot water.

144
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,610
 2345 has financial obligations. 

145
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,250
 Please send him to the kitchen at 11 p.m. tomorrow. 

146
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,480
Gil Sang.

147
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,870
Yes, Hyungnim.

148
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,280
We're going to the sauna today, right?

149
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,190
Hey, hey, hey!

150
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,480
Go away!

151
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,350
Damn!

152
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,810
F*ck off!

153
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,170
Do you want to croak?

154
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,440
Hey, I'm washing right now!

155
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,760
Can't you clean later?

156
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm asking if you can clean here later! Answer me!

157
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,600
Let's use words.

158
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,650
Are you insane?

159
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,710
 I'm sorry I meddled without thinking. 

160
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,920
 I learned it thanks to my mom. 

161
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,900
Hey, newbie.

162
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,610
Stop washing.

163
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,340
Come out.

164
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,520
Certain people know how to take a beating.

165
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,510
Were you a pretty good player outside?

166
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,050
It's not like that.

167
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,700
Hey.

168
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,670
What would you do if I taught you how to make a million won?

169
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,210
I-Is that possible?

170
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,520
Was it two years ago?

171
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,670
Some assh*le came in here crawling

172
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,460
and muddied the school water. 
  (T/N: school is slang for prison) 

173
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,060
That guy...

174
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,120
captured all the guards with this one thing.

175
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,290
That punk didn't win money,

176
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,270
but people.

177
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,730
Because of him, this isn't a prison but a gambling house now.

178
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,050
The winner of this game can be tiger fur or dog fur here. 
  (T/N: Tiger fur is someone wealthy, Dog fur is someone poor.) 

179
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,190
I'll pay you the stake so try to catch his attention.

180
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,810
Then stay next to him and do me a favor.

181
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,020
Then I'll take care of Hae Do for you.

182
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,200
I heard you blew away his gambling house and ended up here.

183
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,180
Don't be scared.

184
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,430
Hae Do is my hoobae. Many years junior.

185
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,610
That much I can resolve on my own.

186
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,690
Think about it carefully.

187
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,350
Got it?

188
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,390
   

189
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,730
- Congratulations! See you later! 
 - Thanks, good job.

190
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,800
Congratulations on being at the top of the class.

191
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,320
Thank you.

192
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,720
Knowing your father, he must be elated.

193
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,400
His son received the Chief Justice Award that he couldn't even get.

194
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,770
I owe it all to you.

195
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,240
Oh, right. I'm supposed to have lunch with my father later.

196
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,090
My father asked me to bring you there.

197
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,490
Your father said that?

198
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,800
I thought I should buy him jjajangmyeon, at least, since he completed his practicum.

199
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,450
You did a good job teaching my son, Chief Mok.

200
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,030
Thank you.

201
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,210
It's a pity that Director Noh passed away like that.

202
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,360
Then what will you do now?

203
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,000
Why don't you come to the Central District Prosecutors' Office from the Northern District?

204
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,730
We have a shortage of mid-level prosecutors.

205
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,820
There's Director Noh's case,

206
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,130
and there is that f*cking Corruption Investigation Agency.

207
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,030
At times like this, it'd be nice if someone from the 26th judicial class would smooth things over.

208
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,490
When you watch team sports such as soccer,

209
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,920
it's a battle of the strongest waists.

210
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,950
You have to be strong in the middle so that

211
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,310
the front and rear can show off 200 percent of their skills

212
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,840
and eventually, the whole team wins.

213
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,330
We need that kind of victory now.

214
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,430
What if...

215
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,070
I say I'd stay in the Northern District Prosecutor's office?

216
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,000
Then I'll have to look for someone else.

217
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,430
How can we live without a waist?

218
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,120
Is there anyone from the 26th class in the countryside somewhere?

219
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,480
But if we do that, you should fill that vacancy in the countryside.

220
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,480
Hey, Mok Jin Hyung.

221
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,490
Aren't you being too selfish if you won't even do that?

222
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,070
Bring more pickled radish.

223
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,300
Me?

224
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,480
And also that Kim Yo Han.

225
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,530
Make sure to sort things out on his case responsibly so we don't hear anything strange about it later.

226
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,120
Being one class ahead of you still makes me your sunbae.

227
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,200
You'd better use honorifics.

228
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,070
Or next time, Sunbaenim...

229
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,900
you'll have to go get pickled radish.

230
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
As promised,

231
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,020
you'll give me the list of Korea Customs Service employees

232
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,100
who engaged in sex trafficking abroad.

233
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,020
I guess there are various ways to sell alcohol,

234
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,840
But what will you do with that list?

235
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,280
I need it to sell even more alcohol.

236
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,460
Aren't you afraid of people pointing fingers at you for working with a Japanese man?

237
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,950
I'm just a bar girl. Why would I be afraid of such a thing?

238
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,510
Are you a good person or a bad person?

239
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm...

240
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,740
just a businesswoman.

241
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,860
Hello, welcome.

242
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,420
Dean, it's been a long time.

243
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,440
CEO Oh, long time no see.

244
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,270
Thank you.

245
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,480
   

246
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,500
   

247
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,580
   

248
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,880
   

249
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,100
   

250
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,070
 Do you want a ride to the bottom of the mountain? 

251
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,430
 No. I just can't stand losing. 

252
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,270
I'm the head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's security department, Cha Bong Won.

253
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,980
 Excuse me. 

254
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,520
 You'll accept a deed, right? 

255
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,870
 It looks like he can get whatever price he asks for. 

256
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,650
 But he went to gamble with this as collateral? 

257
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,440
Congratulations in advance.

258
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,100
Thank you.

259
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,020
Pull up a car.

260
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,420
Where are the men's socks?

261
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,200
How much is it for three pairs?

262
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,240
   

263
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,730
My gosh...

264
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,880
Thank you.

265
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,500
How do you know my grandson?

266
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,300
I met with him for pro-bono legal consultation.

267
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,090
For my work.

268
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,180
What kind of work do you do that you're so gutsy?

269
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,770
Oh, lawyer?

270
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,590
You haven't even visited your grandson because you're busy, right?

271
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,060
I heard it's freezing in prison even in the middle of the summer.

272
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,210
Get 2345 for me.

273
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,860
At it again?

274
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,260
Go.

275
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,750
Make it short.

276
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,140
   

277
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,180
 Hello. 

278
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,050
Grandma.

279
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,320
Dear! How do you feel?

280
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,370
Good.

281
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,240
What about you? I heard thugs keep coming over. Did you get hurt?

282
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,380
Gosh, I'm fine.

283
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,180
How is it there?

284
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,280
Isn't it cold? Or hot?

285
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,900
No.

286
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,180
They turn fans on during the day.

287
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,200
It's cool at night.

288
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,840
They feed me well.

289
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,670
I see.

290
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,600
Grandma.

291
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,110
Grandma.

292
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,190
Why don't you come and visit me?

293
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,610
There is something wrong, right?

294
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,660
That punk from that time...

295
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
He did something to you, didn't he?

296
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,340
Grandma.

297
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,950
Grandma...

298
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,240
 Hello, Yo Han. 

299
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,340
 I think it's almost time to hang up. 

300
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,950
Who are you?

301
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,730
 Let me get straight to the point. 

302
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,880
Your grandmother has been through all the things you're thinking.

303
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,530
 Please pay off what you owe to Mr. Jo for your grandma's sake. 

304
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,440
What the hell am I supposed to do in here?

305
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,560
 Mr. Jo is doing this because it's possible to pay it off from there. 

306
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,070
Who are you?

307
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,850
 We'll meet each other soon. 

308
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,630
 - Bye.  
 - Hey.

309
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,890
Hey!

310
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,650
Shut up.

311
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,610
Go back to your room.

312
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,950
 I'll pay you the stake 

313
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,400
 so try to catch his attention. 

314
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,540
 Then stay next to him and do me a favor. 

315
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:15,390
 Then I'll take care of Hae Do for you. 

316
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes, Hyungnim.

317
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,580
If you say so, then I have to obey, Hyungnim.

318
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,910
So if I let Kim Yo Han go,

319
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:41,280
are you sure you'll give me your Sangju Corporation stock?

320
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,170
Right. Then I'll assume we have an agreement.

321
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,860
I got it.

322
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,040
Yes, yes. Take care, Hyungnim.

323
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,200
Geez, this motherf*cker...

324
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,890
It's not enough with just Sangju.

325
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,310
Happy now?

326
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,410
I put a deposit down with this.

327
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,390
And the balance is that Lee Tae Gwang you asked about.

328
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,270
As for that, after you finish your part...

329
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,350
I'll introduce Lee Tae Gwang to you after that.

330
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,050
Everything will be fine if you're a good gambler.

331
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,960
It's all about money.

332
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,610
Be a goose that lays the golden egg.

333
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,420
Then he'll be blinded by gold and get close to you.

334
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,160
When I get next to Jang Seon Oh,

335
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,220
what are you going to ask me to do?

336
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,030
Why?

337
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,980
You won't do this if you hear about it and don't want to do it?

338
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,140
No. I'll do it.

339
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,870
The food used to be too greasy in the past, but it's okay nowadays.

340
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,400
The warden is crazy about gambling, and he lost all his pension.

341
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,290
The kingpin in the country had bitten off the back of his head,

342
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,090
and he was about to die.

343
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,620
That kingpin put his henchman here and opened a gambling house

344
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,420
to collect the warden's debt.

345
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,140
That henchman is the Lee Tae Gwang you're looking for.

346
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,580
- And then? 
 - And then...

347
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,140
that Lee Tae Gwang was swallowed up by this freak, who came in later.

348
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,160
No one knows where Lee Tae Gwang is right now.

349
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,960
The freak is?

350
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,670
The freak is Jang Seon Oh, you met yesterday.

351
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,140
If the warden acts as a house owner and attracts customers,

352
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,270
Jang Seon Oh plays as a player.

353
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,560
And they put them

354
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,250
in the positions of Folding Screen, Ashtray, Tail, and Pants. 
  (T/N: Servers, players, loan) 

355
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,530
Wait. What happens if the rumor leaks out?

356
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,040
Through released prisoners?

357
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,880
Look up there.

358
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,210
I hear the security manager is a house manager.

359
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,750
All the staff here are in cahoots.

360
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,350
And there are three leagues in total in this Seongju Prison.

361
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,150
 The lowest third league is the changing room. 

362
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,330
 Cigarettes are used as chips here. 

363
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,350
Sh*t! What the hell!

364
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,470
 If you play well there, 

365
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,430
 the staff will take you to the staff lounge. 

366
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,900
 Why? 

367
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,320
 - For a dogfight. 
 - A dogfight? 

368
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,620
 From the second league on, it's a cash game. 

369
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,970
 They sometimes bet on prisoners while watching them play. 

370
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,930
 Or they sponsor good players and 

371
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,090
 share the money that the players win. 

372
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,560
 All the guards are crazy, trying to win a lot 

373
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,370
 while the warden is here. 

374
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,930
 And if you stand out from there, then where would you go? 

375
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,940
 You'd go to the first league. 

376
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,830
 The leading battle in the Seongju Prison gambling house. 

377
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,080
 Next to the dean of the Seongju school, Jang Seon Oh. 

378
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,850
What kind of person is Jang Seon Oh?

379
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,010
 A genius. 

380
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,010
 They say he's a genius who appears once every few decades in the gambling scene. 

381
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,260
 Geez, that young punk. 

382
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,700
Who is the warden bringing in today?

383
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,890
They're Hanguk University professors.

384
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,360
Hanguk University?

385
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,480
Stop.

386
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,110
Oh, my. What's wrong?

387
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,300
Don't you know that if you screw over the nerds with bets, they'll get a tilt right away? 
  (T/N: tilt - emotional breakdown from losing too much) 

388
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,720
These punks!

389
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,610
Don't Hanguk University professors poop?

390
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,140
Do Hanguk University professors have three brains?

391
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,600
Put your hands together.

392
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,770
Gambling is all about spirit! Spirit!

393
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,280
Now, count to three.

394
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,380
One, two, three!

395
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,040
Seongju, Seongju, Seongju! Go! Fight! Win! Hey! Seongju School! Yay!

396
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,100
They're dead.

397
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,220
Hello.

398
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,910
This is Professor Park of Physics at Hanguk University.

399
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,850
Nice to meet you!

400
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,810
Good to see you.

401
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,690
Yes. He's an IT professor.

402
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,870
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Good to see you.

403
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,330
Here he comes.

404
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,510
Sending a player today, right?

405
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,940
- This newbie? 
 - Yes.

406
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,010
With 3369's detention money?

407
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,900
   

408
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,640
Hi, Hyungnim!

409
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,080
Sit over here.

410
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,910
Check the four cartons of cigarettes.

411
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,060
- Correct? 
 - Okay.

412
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,830
 One cigarette is 25,000 won. 

413
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,150
 Four cartons are 

414
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,510
 - 20 million won.  
 - A new face.

415
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,030
- Who is his sponsor? 
 - Song Doo Cheol paid for him.

416
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,310
Bukyeongpa Song Doo Cheol?

417
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,040
Newbie. Good luck.

418
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,760
Okay, school's out.

419
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,490
Let's play.

420
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,400
 Texas Hold'em. 

421
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,950
 It's in the same family as Seven Poker. 

422
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,160
 The difference is that each player is dealt two cards, and 

423
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,750
 the other five community cards are shown to all. 

424
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
 Each person gets two cards and makes a bet. 

425
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,060
Call.

426
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,660
Out.

427
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,570
Call.

428
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,700
Flop. 
  (TN: flop: the first three of the community cards are dealt) 

429
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,570
 They bet again whenever the community cards are dealt. 

430
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,970
Call.

431
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,380
Call.

432
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,180
 Every time you see a card, 

433
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,670
 you pay for a chance. 

434
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,450
For two cards, I pay.

435
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,570
- Call. 
 - Pay.

436
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,950
Pay.

437
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,550
Call.

438
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,580
One pair of sevens.

439
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,430
Wow. You sailed a deep-sea fishing boat, but you only caught trout.

440
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,170
Trout.

441
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:15,000
 If I keep this up, I'll find Lee Tae Gwang very soon. 

442
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,140
 One pair of Kings. 

443
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,620
 Good. Let's go. 

444
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,120
Raise.

445
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,440
- Die. 
 - Die.

446
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,400
- Die. 
 - Good job.

447
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,990
Out.

448
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,230
 Was I in a rush? 

449
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,820
 All right. 

450
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,770
- Call. 
 - Out.

451
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,990
- Out. 
 - Out.

452
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,950
 Still not following me? 

453
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,940
 Then I'll bluff this time. 

454
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,200
- Raise. 
 - Raise.

455
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,070
Call this time.

456
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,960
- Okay. 
 - Call.

457
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Call. Raise one more pack.

458
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,370
Call.

459
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,120
 How do they know? 

460
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,200
 You were going to do this, right? 

461
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,950
Give me some good cards.

462
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,520
 Nine-Double. No, I mean one pair of nines. 

463
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,870
Let's see. Call.

464
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,860
 Isn't this good enough to go for it? 

465
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,730
Raise.

466
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,980
Out.

467
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,490
- I'm out. 
 - I'm out, too.

468
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,980
Call.

469
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,760
Raise two packs.

470
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,080
 Raise? 

471
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,440
 Who the hell are you? 

472
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,670
 Is he holding a higher ranking hand than 9-Double? 

473
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,670
Call.

474
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,180
Flop.

475
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:28,260
 Jack, Queen, King, and Ace haven't been exposed. 

476
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,410
Three packs.

477
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,910
 What can it be? 

478
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,260
 If the final card is 9, then I'll get 9 three-of-a-kind. 

479
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,590
 If the final card is 3, 4, or 8, then I'll get two pairs. 

480
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,390
 There's a chance. 

481
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,070
Call.

482
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,910
 King. 

483
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,730
Check. 
  (T/N: check - pass the action to the next player, but keep their cards) 

484
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,570
 Why did he stall just now? 

485
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:17,690
 Is he finishing with a check just in case I have a king? 

486
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,340
 Then I'll go safely. 

487
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,990
Check.

488
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,460
River. 
  (T/N: The final community card is dealt) 

489
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,550
Raise one carton.

490
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,800
- What the? 
  - One carton? 

491
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,570
 If he had a King, he'd have done this earlier. 

492
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,740
 I don't think he'd pay one carton for a pair of 10s. 

493
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,160
 Or is he bluffing? 

494
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,150
Action. 
  (T/N: All actions such as folding, calling, or raising) 

495
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,970
Call.

496
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,790
Look at that punk. Call my a**.

497
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,880
 He was baiting me with a King from the beginning. 

498
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,070
I had a good dream last night for some reason.

499
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,750
That was an easy win.

500
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,630
Why didn't you cut us some slack?

501
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,090
Hey, Kim!

502
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,550
How did you play the game like that?

503
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,620
It's over.

504
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,900
It's over. Hey, what the hell is this?

505
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,270
Are you a philanthropist?

506
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,680
I can't help it.

507
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,400
This field is...

508
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,790
Your prison labor starts with that thing, f*cker.

509
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,170
I keep getting a good hand.

510
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,440
Raise.

511
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,720
- Call. 
 - Call.

512
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,990
- Call. 
 - Out.

513
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,440
- Out. 
 - Out.

514
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,430
Raise.

515
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,800
Raise.

516
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,430
I should call this time.

517
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,130
All in.

518
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,900
All in?

519
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,620
All in, too.

520
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,590
What's going on here?

521
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,220
- Three-of-a-kind. 
 - Wow.

522
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,580
Wait. Wait. Wait!

523
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,380
2345.

524
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,950
It's Yangbang.

525
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,600
This 234 is also Yangbang!

526
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,170
Yangbang! Yangbang!

527
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,630
The meat is burning.

528
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,470
Sorry, Hyungnim.

529
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:42,790
It's hard to win with Western painting* since you only dealt with Asian painting* before, right? 
 (T/N: Poker vs. Hwatoo, referring to art styles on the cards)

530
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,110
I'll get used to it quickly.

531
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,910
All right.

532
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,960
Let's start over again.

533
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,730
Why don't we start over and win back everything we lost?

534
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,840
Don't strain too much standing on the edge of the cliff.

535
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,560
People don't die in a fight.

536
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,220
They die because they fight on the edge of the cliff.

537
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,310
Got it?

538
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,800
Thank you.

539
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,960
   

540
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,860
Why don't they answer the phone?

541
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,980
I think it was around here.

542
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,980
Granny.

543
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,070
Granny, please find my home.

544
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,860
Hey, Baby. What's your name?

545
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,050
Yo Han.

546
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,440
Yo Han?

547
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,380
I heard that you're busy every night these days.

548
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,610
Did you enjoy gambling last night, too?

549
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,370
Where the hell did you get that money?

550
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,110
Our room leader paid for me.

551
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,290
And I'm sure he spoke to your Mr. Jo.

552
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,160
I haven't heard anything from him.

553
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,150
So where is all the money you received?

554
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,780
Do you not have any?

555
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,880
Did you lose it all already?

556
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,700
You should've come to us as soon as you got some money.

557
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,460
That's being conscientious and right, isn't it?

558
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,060
How about 1 million won for this week?

559
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,500
Don't expect to be treated like a human.

560
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,610
- Let's catch this mutt. 
 - The Buddhist Goddess of Mercy.

561
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,060
Who gave you the name?

562
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,680
My dad.

563
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,000
I see.

564
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,960
What does your dad do?

565
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,550
Hey, Mutt. Put it down.

566
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,820
Good Boy. Put it down.

567
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,890
Take it easy.

568
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,970
Hey, hey. Get that punk!

569
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,420
Hey! S***!

570
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,690
- Let go of me. Let go of me. 
 - I'll go that way.

571
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,560
Hey! Hey!

572
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,770
Do you know what your name means?

573
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,030
It means merciful God.

574
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,590
It has a very good meaning.

575
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,980
Only good things will happen to you in the future.

576
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,560
Where are you going?

577
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,590
You'll be a good student.

578
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,360
You'll get a good job.

579
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,100
You'll meet a good person and get married.

580
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,830
Let's go.

581
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,100
Come out.

582
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,290
Hey, 2345!

583
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,410
Yo Han!

584
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,550
If I do this, do I go to solitary confinement?

585
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,150
 2345! Detention for 20 days for an unauthorized departure and disobeying orders! 

586
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,560
 Excuse me. 

587
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,650
 I'm in the next room. 

588
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,470
If you don't like it here,

589
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,970
 you could always leave if you have money. 

590
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,420
By chance, do you play poker?

591
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,300
 You know they gamble in here, right? 

592
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,360
 You can win money there. 

593
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,610
You must have lost money.

594
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:05,450
 Even if it's gambling inside the prison, 

595
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,570
you should memorize the hand range, at least. 
  (T/N: a set of hands that either you or an opponent might hold in a particular situation) 

596
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,460
You know, the first two cards you get.

597
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,380
They have good or bad rankings.

598
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,530
You need to know that to decide whether to continue the game or not.

599
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,430
I guess you didn't know that.

600
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:37,320
So do you want me to teach you?

601
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,780
No, thank you.

602
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,540
2345.

603
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,050
Come out.

604
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,370
   

605
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,770
 I'm Inspector Kwon from Seoul Yongmoon Police Station, Criminal Affairs Division. 

606
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,810
 There's no specific traumatic injury on the corpse. 

607
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,510
 We assume it's suicide. 

608
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,270
   

609
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,680
   

610
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,130
We retrieved what she had swallowed in her mouth.

611
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,310
   

612
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,620
Can you recognize what it is?

613
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,410
   

614
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,130
You...

615
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,030
Don't you have anything to say to me?

616
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,140
Say what?

617
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,680
I've been thinking in there, you know.

618
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,890
I don't think it was Jo Hae Do.

619
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,710
He's not the type to kill when there is no money in it.

620
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,630
He's too simple.

621
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,600
The people who know about my house deed are me, Grandma, Jo Hae Do...

622
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,820
 But you shouldn't use the deed to your house, man. 

623
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,900
and you.

624
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,580
Now that you've been commissioned, you just have to fly high.

625
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,060
But murder?

626
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,570
Why?

627
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,030
And you're still suspicious of me?

628
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,620
Do you know why?

629
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,670
At the temple that day,

630
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,730
I heard that you were targeting

631
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,000
my uncle Chairman Yang and even my father?

632
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,650
 Yes. 

633
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,170
   

634
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,400
 Can Yo Han really get out? 

635
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,300
 Yes. 

636
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,200
 I did some research. 

637
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,200
 If you make an agreement with those thugs, 

638
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,730
 - Yo Han could get out early. 
 - Really? 

639
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,990
 But the agreement means the deed to this house. 

640
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,950
 Right. 

641
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,430
 But what if I go out to deal with them myself and 

642
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,040
 get the deed to the house taken away? 

643
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,650
 So I asked them to meet you in front of the Northern District Prosecutors' Office. 

644
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,430
 I thought I'd bring Chief Mok there. 

645
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,230
 Mr. Jo Hae Do? 

646
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,360
   

647
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,330
   

648
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,950
   

649
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,550
 Why don't you answer? 

650
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,620
 What brings you here? 

651
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,050
That was...

652
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,690
all your doing?

653
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,740
You started first.

654
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,080
Be human about it, and think what goes around comes around.

655
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:22,640
Then who killed my grandma?

656
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,800
Can you handle it?

657
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,070
Your grandma...

658
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,820
was killed by you.

659
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,380
You killed her, Bastard.

660
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,090
You started a fight you couldn't win to begin with, trusting in your own intellect.

661
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,500
While your innocent grandmother got...

662
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,440
What did you say, f*cker?

663
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,220
Don't blame other people.

664
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,690
Just think, "I'm paying for killing my grandmother"!

665
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,310
After you send her off to burial, then go back...

666
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,590
Hey!

667
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,020
What are you guys doing?

668
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,320
What are you doing?

669
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,110
Kim Yo Han!

670
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,010
Kim Yo Han!

671
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,450
- Yo Han! 
 - Chief!

672
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,470
- Are you okay? 
 - Gosh...

673
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,210
What are you going to do with this punk?

674
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,090
I'll take care of it here. Leave.

675
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,130
Doesn't he know that it's all over for him?

676
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,340
Hey!

677
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,520
I ought to!

678
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,320
Hurry up and go!

679
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,200
I'll leave now.

680
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,470
Chief.

681
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:21,130
What was that about just now?

682
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,100
- Yo Han. 
 - Am I...

683
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,480
still doing the investigation...

684
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,790
Am I still carrying out official duties?

685
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,160
- Yo Han. 
 - Chief!

686
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,210
Yo Han...

687
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,200
If you bear it and survive,

688
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,510
you'll live through it.

689
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,940
Yo Han, I'm sorry.

690
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,130
Are you...

691
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,150
abandoning me?

692
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,600
It's not what you think.

693
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,080
There was a brief setback in the operation.

694
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:05,620
We pray she rebirths in an earthly paradise after she goes to Amitabha's world.

695
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,190
Oh great, compassionate Buddha! Please accept our sincerest prayer!

696
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,430
 I'll decide... 

697
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:16,090
 whether the investigation is over or not. 

698
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,780
 Hong Jae Sun might have prepared for murder, but he's not the culprit. 

699
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,140
 Someone like him would've never gotten blood on his hands. 

700
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,260
Sir.

701
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,210
 What is it? 

702
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,250
Texas Hold'em.

703
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,850
Please teach me.

704
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,890
 Why? 

705
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,480
 As long as human greed is alive and well, 

706
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,970
 the game is not over. 

707
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,990
 Then why... 

708
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,340
 Why did you change your mind? 

709
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:10,070
 Hong Jae Sun, Mok Jin Hyung, Yoon Byung Wook, 

710
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:15,050
 and the murderer who killed my grandmother, are still out there somewhere. 

711
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,640
 I'll finish them all with my own hands. 

712
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,780
 Why? 

713
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,760
Because I'm not...

714
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,080
finished just yet.

715
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,110
♫  I'm getting tired in the  ♫

716
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,800
   

717
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,700
♫  dark night  ♫

718
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,300
♫  I will stand up again  ♫

719
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,010
♫  I won't give in  ♫

720
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:54,380
♫  Who was the justice for?  ♫

721
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,070
♫  There was no one, not anywhere  ♫

722
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,990
 Please give me one more chance. 

723
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,920
 When are you going to move up to the 2nd league? 

724
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,180
 It won't take long. 

725
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,090
 How can I go up to the front battle? 

726
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,960
 You should catch the warden's eyes. 

727
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,660
 You're good enough to go up to the front battle. 

728
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,180
 Is your offer to help me still valid? 

729
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,650
 I'll get you whatever you want. 

730
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,720
 Is it okay if I watch from here? 

731
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,040
 If I win, you should take me to the front battle. 

732
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,900
 By chance, are you Lee Tae Gwang? 

733
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,720
♫  Bring it on, bring it on  ♫

734
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,930
♫  Another me who hid myself  ♫
