10
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,030
Stop here for a second.

11
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,710
Let's go.

12
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
It's okay. Get in the car.

13
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Hey! Get him! Get him!

14
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
Get him! Sh*t!

15
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,220
Stop!

16
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,140
Stop right there!

17
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,660
Get him!

18
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,420
Hurry! Hurry! Get him!

19
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,210
Over there!

20
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,820
Get him! Stop!

21
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,740
- Yes. 
 -  Where are you right now? 

22
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,220
I'm being chased. Why?

23
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,900
 I'll pick you up now. 

24
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,690
 Where should I go? 

25
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,640
 Cheers! 

26
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,260
 Here! 

27
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,710
 Sit here! 

28
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,990
 It'll be tough on your own. 

29
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,710
 I'll head over there. 

30
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,710
 Give me your location right now. 

31
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,540
 This place is famous for chicken feet. 

32
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,280
 Run! 

33
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Run! Run!

34
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,600
   

35
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,340
Wow! Yay!

36
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,570
Hey! What are you doing? Bring a blanket here.

37
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,580
- Ddeng! 
 - Ddeng! 
  (T/N: "Ddeng" means double) 

38
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,450
I see "Spring" is good for you this year.

39
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,750
Ten-double!

40
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,940
Big pot!

41
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,840
She won!

42
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,460
- How the hell do you make that face? 
 - My face?

43
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,640
If I had a poker face like yours,

44
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,040
I'd have two hands to wash my hair.

45
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,820
There's no such a thing.

46
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,950
Consider it giving me a bit of a tip and let me know.

47
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,660
Now, here are your cards.

48
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,350
Monk Sir, I'm going to reach nirvana while waiting.

49
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,470
Bbing. 
  (T/N: A small betting amount) 

50
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,220
Call.

51
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,150
Raise 3 million won  (~$2,370 USD)  more. 
  (T/N: 1 million won ~ $790 USD) 

52
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,130
 Let's make it bigger. 

53
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,650
Call.

54
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,380
Four million.

55
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,580
What's going on?

56
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,320
Did everyone get Double except for me?

57
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,930
I'm out.

58
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,730
Call.

59
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,640
Raise 6 million.

60
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,890
Call.

61
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,660
Raise 9 million more.

62
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,930
 Drop the bait right about now. 

63
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,740
Fifteen million. Call.

64
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,400
Call.

65
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,780
Let's see.

66
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,860
The Buddhist Goddess of Mercy.

67
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,880
Oh, gosh.

68
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,320
Big pot! Big pot! Big pot!

69
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,630
This handsome gentleman got a big pot!

70
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,210
Hey, Washer.

71
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,970
Wash out that game over there, okay?

72
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,630
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

73
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,410
Well.

74
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,800
Even though you were holding an 8-double, you still called it.

75
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,810
There's nothing wrong with being careful, is there?

76
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,870
- Let me borrow some money and come back. 
 - Okay.

77
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,230
 Let's go race this time. 

78
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,560
 He's the real deal. 

79
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,290
Wait a minute.

80
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,170
Can't we try to be cautious?

81
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,160
This is on the house.

82
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, my God!

83
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,760
 What the heck? 

84
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,460
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

85
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
Go ahead.

86
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,450
Here I go.

87
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,600
Bbing.

88
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,350
Call. Raise 3 million.

89
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,290
Call. Raise 4 million.

90
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,250
Call.

91
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,890
Raise 6 million.

92
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,170
All right, if you are done giving your offering, please just call it.

93
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,210
Call.

94
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,590
Call.

95
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,700
Call.

96
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,410
 I'll lose all my fish if I rush. 

97
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,120
Call.

98
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,370
Raise 9 million.

99
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,550
Call.

100
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
Raise 13 million.

101
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,060
Call.

102
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,460
Call.

103
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,870
Call and raise 20 million.

104
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,830
Svaha!

105
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,810
Oh, boy, you're going to reach nirvana soon.

106
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,800
I'll just call.

107
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,350
Call.

108
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,310
Raise 30 million.

109
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
- Call. 
 - Wow.

110
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,870
You young guys are such hotshots.

111
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,340
Hey, Sister, will you join in on this fiery game?

112
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,670
Well. Since I don't have extra underwear,

113
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,710
I'll call with this small amount.

114
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,310
Is 77 million won a small amount?

115
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,480
Sister, that's an adorable way to say f*ck you.

116
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,760
Call.

117
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,330
Me, too. Call.

118
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,010
Call.

119
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,190
Raise 30 million.

120
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,480
All in.

121
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,010
I can't keep up with this.

122
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,940
I'm out.

123
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,090
All in, too.

124
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,210
Die.

125
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,670
My heart is trembling.

126
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,150
All in.

127
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,450
Now, let's open.

128
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,270
Somehow,

129
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,230
two-tens came into my hands.

130
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,980
 Two-fives, two-nines, and it ends with two-tens? 

131
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,240
Aigoo.

132
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,290
Big pot!

133
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,330
Excuse me.

134
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,420
You accept a deed, right?

135
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,530
   

136
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,300
   

137
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,640
- Yo Han. 
 - Yes?

138
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,120
Just use my money. You shouldn't borrow rashly.

139
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,770
You said gambling is all about how much you can spend.

140
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,450
But you shouldn't use the deed to your house, man.

141
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,470
I heard your grandma's supermarket is going into a redevelopment.

142
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,100
That's worth a lot. Why risk it?

143
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,880
Go to my spot and take as much money as you need.

144
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,110
Okay.

145
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,750
Thanks.

146
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,380
I need to go to the restroom.

147
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,240
 When spring comes after this fall and winter, I'll come and pick you up. 

148
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
 Do you have to go, Dad? 

149
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,340
 If I don't do anything, nothing changes. 

150
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,630
 So I must go. 

151
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,660
 I treasure this watch a lot. 

152
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,830
 Keep it safe until I come back to get you. 

153
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,030
 Sri Sri Maha Sri. 

154
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,000
 Sri Sri Svaha. 

155
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,090
 Sri Sri Svaha. 

156
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,850
 Sri Sri Maha Sri. 

157
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,510
 Ma Ha... 

158
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,430
 Ban Ya... 

159
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,800
 This is a phrase from "The Heart of Prajna Paramite Sutra." 

160
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,060
 If you memorize all of these, I'll let you call your father. 

161
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,120
 "When Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound Prajna Paramita", 

162
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,760
 "he illuminated the five skandhas and saw that they were all empty" 

163
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,960
 "and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty." 

164
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
 "Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness;" 

165
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
 "emptiness does not differ from form." 

166
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,550
 "Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form." 

167
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,370
 "So too are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness." 

168
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,410
Yes. On my way.

169
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,270
So you're a judicial trainee?

170
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,010
Will you keep playing?

171
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,530
Yes. I'll just get back what I lost.

172
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,870
The cops are on their way.

173
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you want a ride to the bottom of the mountain?

174
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,820
No. I'll stay a little longer.

175
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,930
You could've gotten off at Seocho-dong if you waited a bit. 
  (T/N: Seocho-dong: Where prosecutors' offices are located) 

176
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,380
Why are you trying to ruin it all?

177
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,580
I just can't stand losing.

178
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,960
Who are you looking for?

179
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,980
Oh, never mind.

180
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,720
Bbing.

181
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,610
Call.

182
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,590
Call.

183
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,050
Raise 1 million.

184
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,260
Call and raise 2 million.

185
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,790
Call and...

186
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,310
- raise 4 million. 
 - Call.

187
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,250
Raise 6 million.

188
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,450
Call.

189
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,970
 It's 10... 

190
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
Excuse me.

191
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,300
Sir, you have better hands than me, right?

192
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,610
How would I know that?

193
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,450
Don't you know that filming is prohibited here?

194
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,700
Hey. Mister.

195
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,010
Monk Sir, this is fraud, right?

196
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,550
No. This is not fraud.

197
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,150
Can you be held accountable for saying such a dangerous thing?

198
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,750
Now, let's see.

199
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,640
All right. Eight-double!

200
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,860
Here comes an 8-double.

201
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,800
To beat me, the only options are 9-double, 10-double, or kwang-double.

202
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,900
But kwang-double is over.

203
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,680
And since I have a 10, 10-double is over.

204
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,070
Ahjussi.

205
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,500
You have 9-double, right?

206
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,520
Wow, this punk is writing a novel here.

207
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,680
- Sh*t! 
 - Mister...

208
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,930
Hey, young man!

209
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,860
Nine-double!

210
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,660
It is 9-double, Ahjussi!

211
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,680
Add fraud to gambling.

212
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,760
 What's going on? 

213
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,590
Freeze!

214
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,460
They all gamble like that!

215
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,270
Hello. Hello.

216
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,540
Geez...

217
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,000
Name.

218
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,850
Sit over here, please.

219
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,250
Name.

220
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,480
I'm Kim Yo Han.

221
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,000
- Occupation. 
 - I'm a judicial trainee.

222
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,710
You're a judicial trainee?

223
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,260
Please hand me a pen and a piece of paper.

224
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,180
This is the number for the head of the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

225
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,700
He must be waiting for your call right now.

226
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,940
Grandma! I'm home!

227
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,560
Why are you so late?

228
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm so sorry.

229
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,380
Professors wouldn't let me go. Must be the fate of being at the top of the class?

230
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,570
- Did you buy an ink stick? 
 - Yes.

231
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,920
The ink stone...

232
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,910
Is it here?

233
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,470
Grandma, where was the ink stone?

234
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,500
They just sell the black ink too.

235
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,750
Grandma, we have to do everything with sincere devotion with our own hands.

236
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,380
Dashing off with one stroke of a brush.

237
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,180
   

238
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
   

239
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,040
Grandm–

240
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,760
You're here.

241
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,610
Oh, Director!

242
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,560
Prosecutor Mok.

243
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,830
I'll take it.

244
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
"The time has passed, and it is the Year of the Yellow Tiger, the 24th of July."

245
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,800
"Son, Yo Han, commemorates his father as a prosecutor of the Gyeongju Kim clan."

246
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm running out of cigarettes.

247
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,430
But how did Chairman Yang find that out?

248
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,080
 Chairman Yang wasn't the only one. 

249
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,430
 - I need to go to the restroom. 
 - The cops are on their way. 

250
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,870
A few people knew the police were coming.

251
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,330
Have a drink.

252
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,590
There should be at least one clearheaded man in the run-up to something big.

253
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,660
   

254
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,810
   

255
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,680
 You'll start practical training as a prosecutor starting next month, right? 

256
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,410
 Yes. I've been assigned to the Seoul Northern D-District P-Prosecutor's Office... 

257
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,130
 Do you know Chairman Yang Jun? 

258
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,950
 The Skin-nation. 

259
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:51,580
 There's a rumor that he's actually the leader of the Bukyeongpa gangs nationwide. 

260
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,340
 Did you also know that your colleague Hong Jae Sun's father, 

261
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,530
 Chief Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook of the Central Investigation Division is behind him? 

262
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,240
 Then the reason he was cleared of all the gambling abroad was that... 

263
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,790
 I heard Hong Jae Sun likes to play cards with Chairman Yang every night. 

264
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,670
 While hanging out with Hong Jae Sun, if you all get together with Chairman Yang, 

265
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,390
 just send me a text. 

266
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,130
 Then we will catch Chairman Yang on the spot and put a bell on his neck, 

267
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,350
 and if he runs over to Chief Hong for help, then 

268
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,150
 I'll catch them at the scene and grab Chief Hong's weakest spot! 

269
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,480
 I'll grab his weakest spot. 

270
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,520
 So why... 

271
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,310
 Corruption Investigation Agency. 

272
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,370
 The CID is at the center of the opposition to the Corruption Investigation Agency. 

273
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,410
 With this one-shot, we can drive a nail into their coffin. 

274
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,970
 Isn't this type of undercover investigation 

275
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,100
 illegal? 

276
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,700
 Fool, you only know how to fight in suits during the day, don't you? 

277
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,560
 This is how you fight in the dark. 

278
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,030
 There are only three of us in this room who know about this. 

279
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,180
 Even if something goes wrong, 

280
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,430
 do you think we'd ignore you? 

281
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,190
 If things go wrong, your career will be over before it even starts. 

282
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,120
 If you think it's not right, you can refuse. 

283
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,650
 Career? 

284
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,700
 Are you rich? 

285
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,670
 I guess you're confident that you'll be above those law school brats. 

286
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,100
 Seventy percent of your Judicial Training Institute colleagues are from Gangnam District 8, 

287
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
 or they'll succeed their parents and enter Seocho-dong.  
 (T/N: Seocho-dong: Where powerful people are) 

288
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,690
 Since you don't have money or connections, 

289
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,560
 you'll run around the countryside for 20 years and be done. 

290
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,470
 No matter how much work you put in, you'll just benefit the rich guys. 

291
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,150
 But Yo Han, 

292
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,070
 if you ride the wind of the Inwang mountain (houses the Blue House), why bother with the countryside? 

293
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,300
 You'll automatically enter the Supreme Prosecutors' Office. 

294
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,630
 Yo Han, think about your grandmother. 

295
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,430
 Right. That's right, Yo Han. 

296
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,800
 Think about your grandmother. You should make her happy. 

297
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,520
 All in. 

298
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,130
 Geez. 

299
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,630
 Hey. I go all-in with this, too, right? 

300
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,010
 Okay. 

301
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,510
 Wow. 

302
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,130
 I got a 10-double. I should die. 

303
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,870
 Let's see yours, Yo Han. 

304
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,360
 Isn't this catching kwang? 

305
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,430
 Oh, it's the Secret Royal Inspector. 

306
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,220
 Yo Han won. 

307
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,410
 Sorry, Jae Sun. 

308
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,080
 Wait a minute. Take this. 

309
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,220
 Gosh, thank you! 

310
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,060
 While hanging out with Hong Jae Sun, and if you all get together with Chairman Yang, 

311
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,710
 just send me a text. 

312
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,630
 Where is his identification guarantee data? 

313
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,460
 I kept it safe in Sajik-dong. 

314
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,930
 Wasn't the Sajik-dong investigation team disbanded? 

315
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,610
 They're very much alive and well. 

316
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,880
 Who cares about people? 

317
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,190
 We just need to keep the information alive. 

318
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,640
   

319
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,220
 Whether police or prosecutors, 
     

320
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,860
 they won't be able to find Sajik-dong. Rest assured. 

321
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,030
   

322
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,050
   

323
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,920
Yes.

324
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,970
That's that.

325
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,660
Have you ever heard of Lee Tae Gwang?

326
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,320
- Lee Tae... 
 - Hey!

327
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,320
Well, is there any other way?

328
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,400
- Lee Tae Gwang? 
 - Yes.

329
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,150
There's this guy Lee Tae Gwang.

330
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:11,140
Whenever Chairman Yang goes on vacation to Macau, he's in charge of Yang's rolling. 
  (T/N: Rolling: Keeping his customer happy) 

331
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,670
So Chairman Yang got out of going to prison thanks to the CID Chief pulling strings

332
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,580
and since he served his sentence alone,

333
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,360
he brought a video of Chairman Yang gambling and

334
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
offered us a deal to get him out as well.

335
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,460
But after that, this guy completely cut off contact.

336
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,580
Yo Han.

337
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,400
Can you get close to that Lee Tae Gwang and get that video?

338
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,860
Where is Lee Tae Gwang right now?

339
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,990
Seongju Prison.

340
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,100
If you go a little further out of Seoul...

341
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,400
You know, right? Seongju Prison.

342
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,340
Are you telling me to go to prison and come out?

343
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,750
We can't reach him at all.

344
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,430
We can't even visit him.

345
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,940
The CID might be hiding Lee Tae Gwang tightly too.

346
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,640
Yo Han.

347
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,220
Since you've already started, why don't you take one more step forward?

348
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,050
Are you done?

349
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,640
Go ahead.

350
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,240
You'll be in jail for just a little bit.

351
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Done.

352
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,680
Yo Han.

353
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,410
You don't have to answer right now.

354
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,340
No.

355
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,940
Don't answer right now.

356
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,870
Wait for him.

357
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,400
He thought no one would find it.

358
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,420
But when he woke up to the dog barking,

359
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,570
the cops were coming from over there.

360
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,510
And the reporters also found out somehow.

361
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,140
They were also running with their cameras.

362
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,190
So he ran away to the mountain.

363
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm talking about your younger brother.

364
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,410
Stop it.

365
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,220
In this day and age?

366
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,500
Do you think you'll be okay doing this to me?

367
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,110
This little punk. Where do you think you are?

368
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,600
The regime lasts only five years, but you guys are forever powerful?

369
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,870
Are you the only ones forever powerful?

370
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,530
I'm the one who put your father in a wheelchair five years ago.

371
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,420
I'm the one who told the reporters that your younger brother was hiding there at dawn.

372
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,290
Do you think the world belongs to you because you were born with a golden spoon in your mouth?

373
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,610
But what do we do about this?

374
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,280
I'm the one the country chose to catch you guys.

375
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,880
To stop from you guys messing around the country,

376
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm the one that the country chose to be sheriff.

377
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,090
Financial and Tax Crimes Investigations Unit 2.

378
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,450
Here is the place to discipline you chaebols that 
  (T/N: Chaebol - Wealthy families who own corporations) 

379
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,780
built the country with tax money, you bastard.

380
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,680
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

381
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,390
Why are you still investigating what happened more than 10 years ago?

382
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,510
My father collapsed during the last investigation and is still being treated at a hospital.

383
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,420
It's not a show, but it's a fact.

384
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,130
If it doesn't work with your brother,

385
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,310
then I'll say that your daughter is about to swallow up a person.

386
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,560
You sure tried your best to save the child who was close to dying.

387
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,390
She's been to cardiology since she was three for childhood heart failure.

388
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,980
I heard you found a suitable person and are waiting for surgery?

389
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,630
It's very weird.

390
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,920
It usually doesn't work that fast.

391
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,840
Hey, you punk!

392
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,030
- But still, this is wrong! 
 - Wrong? You assho*e!

393
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,570
One person is going to die instead to save your daughter's life.

394
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,240
It's so sad not to have any money.

395
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,980
Right?

396
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,880
   

397
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,470
It's totally different from 2014.

398
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,180
Corruption Investigation Agency is mainstream! Mainstream!

399
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,510
If we put our guard down, we'll be gone at once.

400
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,220
Even if they're weak,

401
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,300
we're up against the CID of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

402
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,230
That's why

403
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,640
I planted a "bomb" at their feet.

404
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,990
A bomb?

405
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,910
But if something goes wrong, are we the ones who will die?

406
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,450
If something comes up, I'll throw myself and contain it.

407
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,070
We're doing well right now, but aren't we going too far?

408
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,290
Just call it a courageous decision.

409
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,610
If the head flies away, the tail will scatter.

410
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,180
This Mok Jin Hyung will do all the dirty work.

411
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,210
So, Elders, please trust me and follow this cause.

412
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,350
All right, cheers!

413
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,660
Cheers!

414
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,190
My father said he would attend.

415
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,430
Be responsible and bring him in.

416
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,750
Otherwise...

417
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,890
   

418
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,690
Got them. These punks.

419
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,820
This punk!

420
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,520
After all, I grew up in Sajik-dong, man.

421
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,100
Who sent you?

422
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,030
   

423
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,970
   

424
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,590
   

425
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,030
 Since you've started, why don't you make one more step? 

426
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,730
 You don't have to answer right now. 

427
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,720
 No. 

428
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,260
 Don't answer right now. 

429
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,730
Hey.

430
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,600
Are you awake?

431
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,560
Why did you do that?

432
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,300
I'm the owner of the gambling house that you blew away.

433
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,920
But thanks to you, I don't "own" anything anymore.

434
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,710
I just collect things now.

435
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,840
Oh, right. Before I started to run the house,

436
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,830
I worked for a while to get back money from the people

437
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,740
who borrowed loans and didn't pay them back.

438
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,330
Back then, my nickname was "Ok Jo Hae Do."

439
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,050
Overdue debt was okay. Bad debt was also okay.

440
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,040
I was okay with everything.

441
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,840
You don't seem to believe me, I guess?

442
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,790
Okay.

443
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,720
This is how I collected what I needed.

444
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,680
Let's gargle your mouth.

445
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,730
So how will you pay for my house?

446
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,300
I don't have any money.

447
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,910
Sir, you live with your grandma, right?

448
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,570
Your address is 68-gil, 1123, right?

449
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,100
I heard it's getting redeveloped.

450
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
No!

451
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,370
Aigoo, Sir! Do you think it's a matter of you saying yes or no?

452
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,890
If you say no, do you think I can't take it?

453
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,650
Do you think you can prevent that somehow?

454
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,500
Sir.

455
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,870
You can't stop me.

456
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,050
You're not afraid of the law, are you?

457
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,340
What are you saying?

458
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,960
Sir, this has nothing to do with the law.

459
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,000
State Public Officials Act, article 33, clause 1.

460
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,030
"The grounds for disqualification of a public official..."

461
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,840
"In the case of acting in ways that undermine his/her dignity,"

462
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,300
"the trainee can be dismissed."

463
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,370
Did I memorize it correctly?

464
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,640
See? I'm good at this.

465
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,090
Is it possible to transfer the title on the deed tomorrow?

466
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,060
No matter how great a person is,

467
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,920
you're just 100 geun of meat and 6 liters of blood. 
  (T/N: Geun: Unit of measure used in Korea) 

468
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,360
Surprisingly, quite a few things in this world can't be done with one's willpower.

469
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,010
Relax your mouth.

470
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,570
Say "Ah" one more time.

471
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,090
   

472
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,580
Nothing is free in this world, right?

473
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,150
Look.

474
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,000
With the Blue House's backing, the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, CID, and even Special Counsel.

475
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,590
Not just anyone could go down this road.

476
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,820
If you could go,

477
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,950
you only live once, right?

478
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,370
Does it hurt a lot?

479
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,870
I kind of...

480
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,920
expected it.

481
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,260
I expected the worst-case scenario to go down like this.

482
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,730
But after experiencing that worst-case scenario for real,

483
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,230
I'm...a bit stunned.

484
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,250
You expected it?

485
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,870
And you still did it?

486
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,860
Yes.

487
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,160
Like father,

488
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,390
like son.

489
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,690
What do you mean?

490
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,590
Your father was also

491
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,520
that kind of person.

492
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,440
Yo Han.

493
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,700
Our conviction leads us to the right path,

494
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,890
but sometimes it sends us to dangerous places.

495
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,080
What happened today could be just the beginning.

496
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,610
The prison will be a completely different world

497
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,980
so... if you want to stop,

498
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,270
let me know anytime.

499
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,440
Okay.

500
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,370
All right.

501
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,250
My goodness, you'll have a sour stomach.

502
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,400
Come and eat.

503
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,360
Okay. Thank you.

504
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,030
Come.

505
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,250
Excuse me.

506
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,260
Yes, Grandma.

507
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,850
 Yo Han. 

508
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,000
Grandma!

509
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,670
You're home.

510
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,780
Grandma, are you okay?

511
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,760
You aren't hurt?

512
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,230
Aigoo, why all the fuss? I'm fine!

513
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,740
Hey, what happened to your face?

514
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,570
It's nothing.

515
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,270
My wisdom tooth.

516
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,420
Why did they pull out a wisdom tooth so recklessly?

517
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,760
Look at your swollen cheek.

518
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,790
- Where is the dentist? 
 - No, no, Grandma.

519
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,140
Is someone inside?

520
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,900
What a mess. A mess.

521
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,220
Here comes your grandson.

522
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,390
Are you done?

523
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,960
Thank you so much.

524
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,210
Not a problem.

525
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,190
And the frames and clock that fell on the floor?

526
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,790
They won't move at all, even if there's an earthquake.

527
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,170
Aigoo, look at you sweating.

528
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,220
Wait a minute. Have some Naju pear before you go.

529
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,530
Oh, no! That's okay!

530
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:40,330
- Aigoo. 
 - Aigoo, I said that's okay.

531
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,520
Grandma!

532
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,270
Where are you going?

533
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,120
Then give me some pear, please.

534
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,500
Grandma, you're so generous.

535
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,700
- Complicated, right? 
 - Get lost.

536
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,140
Come on. Then your grandma would be disappointed.

537
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,010
Get lost.

538
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,550
Hey.

539
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,020
Why?

540
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,410
Do you want to gargle one more time?

541
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,720
You know what will happen next time, right?

542
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,680
Let's stop everything.

543
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,750
Are you joking?

544
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,780
If we stop before the trial,

545
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,830
you'll be able to re-enter the institute naturally.

546
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,160
Hey, Kim Yo Han.

547
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,500
Are you saying you can't carry out the mission

548
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,200
from higher-ups because of that gangster?

549
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,650
Were you going to become a prosecutor without any guts in the first place?

550
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,020
Are you the only one involved in this?

551
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:57,100
What you're doing is screwing not only me but all of our colleagues. Do you know that?

552
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,350
My apologies.

553
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:04,210
It seems something happened to those colleagues.

554
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,890
I haven't been able to reach a few people since last night's meal.

555
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,890
What are you talking about?

556
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,970
This is the first time I've heard of it.

557
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,950
It's natural that human affairs don't go as planned

558
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,620
so clear your mind quickly.

559
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,990
I'll meet the judge in charge of his case.

560
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,100
So get rid of the thug who keeps sticking around him.

561
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,810
Yo Han.

562
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,730
I'll protect your grandma.

563
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,400
Chief.

564
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,550
I'm sorry.

565
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,440
There might be eyes on us, so let's leave separately.

566
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,640
D*mn it!

567
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,330
You've done enough.

568
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,120
Let's go back to...

569
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,570
Let's go back to the way it was.

570
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,600
Yes.

571
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,430
 Chief Park. 

572
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,360
 Remember the guy I mentioned before? 

573
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,260
 - Kim Yo Han?  
 - Yes, Kim Yo Han.

574
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,760
Can you spare me a minute?

575
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,940
I'm almost in front of the court.

576
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,730
 I can't right now. Can you wait a little bit? 
    

577
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,950
 I just need to finish one thing. 

578
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,250
- I'll call you. See you. 
 - Okay. Okay.

579
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,600
   

580
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,070
Hello.

581
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,520
 The person you have dialed is not available this time. 

582
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh, geez.

583
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,620
Give it to me. Give me. Let me hold it. Let me hold it.

584
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,100
I can hold it.

585
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,180
Yes.

586
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,760
 He was so healthy... 

587
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,250
Hey.

588
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,240
   

589
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,140
These people share our conviction.

590
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,820
Before a few of our colleagues went missing,

591
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,330
they all received a call from the same number.

592
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,240
 It seems something happened to those colleagues. 

593
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,780
 I haven't been able to reach a few people since last night's meal. 

594
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,100
Hyung Young Gook also received a call from him. 
    

595
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,450
He's Yoon Byung Wook from the Financial and Tax Crimes Investigations Unit 2. 
    

596
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,500
There's a rumor that Hong Sang Wook became the chief of the CID thanks to him.

597
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:03,160
Actually, some f*cker was waiting for me by my car yesterday, too.

598
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,930
I was able to catch on since something similar had happened to me before.

599
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:16,130
As soon as Hyung Young Gook left the meeting with us, he lit a charcoal briquette inside his car. 
  (T/N: His death was covered up as suicide) 

600
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,490
Yo Han,

601
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,360
this is a matter of life and death now.

602
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,450
You, me, and your grandma.

603
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,700
For the three of us to stay alive,

604
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,000
we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly.

605
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,770
I'll protect your grandma!

606
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,940
Hey.

607
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,890
For Hyungnim Young Gook's sake, shouldn't you do this?

608
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,420
 Yo Han, 

609
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,670
 our conviction leads us to the right path, 

610
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,680
 but sometimes, they send us to dangerous places. 

611
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,630
 Do you want me to tell you who killed your father? 

612
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,400
 Hey! 

613
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,670
 It's us. 

614
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,340
 Our office. 

615
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,270
 We, the prosecutors. 

616
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,020
 Your father doesn't drink at all. 

617
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,930
 Yet he died on the street with a blood alcohol level of 0.3. 

618
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,200
 Autopsy? Bullsh*t. He was cremated right away. 

619
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,100
 How come that day, the police, the hospital, and the crematorium 

620
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:54,310
 passed your father's corpse like a baton and made a series of administrative mistakes. 

621
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,950
 Only two entities could create such coincidence in this world. 

622
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,400
 One is the Almighty God. 

623
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,000
 The other is us, the prosecution. 

624
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,650
 Was anyone in the prosecution held accountable for that? 

625
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,540
 No one, right? 

626
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,700
 The one who got him killed by conducting a poor investigation. 

627
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,850
 The prosecutor who let that happen. 

628
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,370
 Has anyone been punished? 

629
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,520
 No, right? Of course not. 

630
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,970
 Who dares punish the prosecution in this land? 

631
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,900
 Let's go down and talk. Head down! 

632
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,500
 If you don't act, the world will never change! 

633
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:37,900
 If I don't do anything, nothing changes. 

634
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,210
 So I must go. 

635
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,670
 A group of people who ran an illegal gambling house at a temple in Seoul were caught. 

636
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,400
 The Seoul Regional Investigation Team arrested the general manager, Kim 

637
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,560
 and 54 men and women who participated in the gambling on the spot. 

638
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,900
 It was the largest illegal gambling ring ever arrested in Seoul. 

639
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,030
 Among them was a Judicial Training Institute trainee, 

640
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,500
 and it's becoming even more controversial. 

641
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,090
You have a guest.

642
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,430
Who?

643
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,960
Why did you do it?

644
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,790
What are you talking about?

645
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,810
Cheeky punk.

646
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,570
I was a 26th judicial trainee.

647
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,870
Crazy...

648
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,480
The guy called Kim Yo Han.

649
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,850
He's your bomb, right?

650
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,150
Who?

651
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:37,750
Did you make the prosecutor trainee conduct an undercover investigation or something?

652
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,710
When that one blows up, you're the one who'll die.

653
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,720
F*cker...

654
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,240
You think your sunbae is...

655
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,020
a stupid idiot, right?

656
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,820
It would be faster to ask Kim Yo Han himself.

657
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,290
He's going to prison today, right?

658
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,550
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

659
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,940
Taxi!

660
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,100
Sir, hurry. Please go to the Metropolitan Police Department.

661
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,710
Sir, please go faster.

662
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,350
This is good. Good.

663
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,430
You know who I am, right?

664
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,430
 He's Yoon Byung Wook from the Financial and Tax Crimes Investigations Unit 2. 

665
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,800
Yes.

666
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,500
If you tell me the truth about everything right now,

667
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,000
I won't let you go to prison and get you back to the training institute.

668
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,990
What did you say?

669
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,660
   

670
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,850
   

671
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,050
 Did you make the prosecutor trainee conduct an undercover investigation or something? 

672
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,060
 When that one blows up, you're the one who'll die. 

673
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,800
   

674
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,050
Move!

675
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,020
   

676
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,740
   

677
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,880
Babies are here.

678
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,210
   

679
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,760
   

680
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,750
Look who is here.

681
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,980
Oh?

682
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,090
How do I look?

683
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,970
Does this look good on me?

684
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,920
Do we look like we're having fun?

685
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,480
Cat got your tongue?

686
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,620
Say hello and answer my question!

687
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,350
Hey.

688
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,930
Hey!

689
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:45,510
I'm here because of you. Do you think I'll sit back?

690
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,160
Hey!

691
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,750
Fine.

692
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,130
I'll give you lots of good memories.

693
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,220
   

694
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,530
   

695

 Please pay off what you owe to Mr. Jo for your grandma's sake. 

704
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,360
 What would you do if I taught you how to make a million won? 

705
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,670
 Is that possible? 

706
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,500
 Why don't you come to the Central District Prosecutors' Office? 

707
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,480
 Is the investigation ongoing? 

708
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,590
 There's been a brief setback in our operation.

 Since she's of no use, she said just pretend that she doesn't exist. 

710

 Don't you have anything to say to me? 

711

 Can you handle it?
