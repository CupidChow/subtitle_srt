6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,960
   

7
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,790
 Boy, don't you dare cross the line. 

8
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,970
 Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here? 

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,050
 Guard! 

10
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,570
 Boy, don't you dare cross the line. 

11
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,100
Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here?

12
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,600
You bastard, what are you doing?

13
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,850
It's you in the video, right?

14
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,720
Put that away, you bastard!

15
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,800
Then what was that video of?

16
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,300
   

17
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,780
   

18
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,290
   

19
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,150
What is this?

20
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,600
GPS?

21
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,180
Sh*t.

22
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,330
   
 (T/N: Calling the police) 

23
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,830
   

24
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,150
   

25
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,890
 Don't you get it? 

26
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,120
 I don't know who recorded that video, 

27
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,100
but he's trying to drive a wedge between us!

28
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,900
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

29
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,690
I'm not moving to the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

30
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,880
Man, our plan and you!

31
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,230
I still haven't given up on either one!

32
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,090
 Until I can find the person who recorded that video, 

33
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,300
 I need this guy. 

34
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,690
Put that away, you bastard.

35
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,440
 I have to put on a mask and act this out. 

36
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,310
I'm sorry...

37
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,680
I was scared.

38
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Stuck in here and dealing with the same thing day after day.

39
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,350
I feel like I'm going crazy, Chief.

40
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,680
Please, save me...

41
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,720
Man!

42
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,070
I understand.

43
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,880
Hey.

44
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,050
I understand the pain you are going through.

45
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
But Yo Han,

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,240
justice does not change.

47
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,410
We may not have the power right now,

48
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,590
but something that is bound to happen will happen,

49
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,040
and those who should fall will be destroyed.

50
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,560
Right now, this is where you are the safest.

51
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,860
Consider it as if you're recuperating here.

52
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,180
Just lay low for a little bit.

53
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,690
As soon as I settle the things outside, the first thing I'll do is get you out of here.

54
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,860
Yo Han...

55
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
let's not give up on each other.

56
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,880
Got it?

57
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,640
   

58
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,600
   

59
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,000
   

60
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,140
 Go! 

61
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,470
 Here we go again. 

62
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,410
 Let's start again! 

63
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,430
 Let's see. 

64
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,060
 Why do you keep getting beaten up? 

65
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,480
 Hyung, you should hit back! 

66
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,260
 The offense is the best defense. 

67
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,970
 Have you never heard of that? 

68
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,680
 Geez. 

69
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,110
 - Don't fake it. 
 - Hold on, hold on! 

70
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,490
 Nam Dae Moon... what does he do? 

71
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,770
 - At times... 
 - What are you doing right now? 

72
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,720
 that ahjussi acts like the dean around here.  
 -  What? 

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,390
 This is a gambling place. That's why I'm holding the ground. 

74
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,490
 If it were another kind of place, I'd been pushed out already. 

75
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,210
 Why? 

76
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,420
 Drink it. 

77
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,580
 It's okay. 

78
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,430
 Get some rest. 

79
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,450
 Hyung, can you do me a favor? 

80
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,690
 There should be a ledger. 

81
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,570
 Nam Dae Moon's slush fund ledger. 

82
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,180
 If you look at all the guys in the first league, 

83
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,590
 they all got bribed by him 100%. 

84
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,890
 But it's not possible with what Nam Dae Moon earns. 

85
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,850
 If that's the case, it means Nam Dae Moon has hushed away money behind my back. 

86
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,000
 In which case, there must be a ledger with a record of it. 

87
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,230
 Find out where that ledger is for me. 

88
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,910
1128.

89
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,290
Lend me a hand.

90
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,390
The partition that needs to be replaced is too heavy.

91
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,430
If you don't want to do it, then lend me this guy, at least.

92
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,440
Sit down.

93
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,270
   

94
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,760
   

95
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,910
   

96
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,780
   

97
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
   

98
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,010
1128.

99
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,160
The ledger...

100
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,090
The ledger... ledger...

101
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,400
1321...

102
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,440
7721.

103
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,250
   

104
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,760
   

105
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,830
D*mn it...

106
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,840
   

107
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,350
What's this?!

108
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,610
I'm sorry. My cut started bleeding again.

109
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,690
S***!

110
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,830
I'll be right behind you after locking up the detention storage.

111
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,790
- Take him to the infirmary. 
 - Me?

112
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,630
- Thank you. 
 - Hurry!

113
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,320
   

114
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,090
When I looked at the inspector's account,

115
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,900
I notice that he never missed out on monthly alimony payments even after your divorce.

116
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,830
But since last July,

117
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,550
 the amount has increased a bit. 

118
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,110
Oh, that...

119
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,970
 There's not much of a difference. 

120
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,870
 Actually, my husband had used 

121
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,860
 a cell phone that was under my name 

122
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,030
for his investigations. 
    

123
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,790
 And he asked me to make one more. 

124
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,510
Do you still have that cell phone?

125
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,920
 He told me that if something were to happen to him, 

126
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,280
 I should sell off all the cell phones. 

127
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,140
 Perhaps whatever he was investigating may jeopardize me as well. 

128
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,040
 And he also told me that I should sell the digital camera that he had too. 

129
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,740
 That was also used during the investigation. 

130
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,460
 Welcome. 

131
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,710
- Maybe he knew we were coming? 
 - What?

132
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,800
I'm talking about Inspector Kwon.

133
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,420
If something happened to him,

134
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,460
someone who would investigate his death,

135
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,150
would have looked into his account transaction history.

136
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,440
Just like we did.

137
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,210
And discovered that there were cell phones under his wife's name.

138
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,670
And as she sold her cell phones...

139
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,680
She'd even talk about the existence of digital cameras.

140
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,210
As for the item we bought on the 19th,

141
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,770
we sold it yesterday.

142
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,750
Do you have a record of who you sold it to?

143
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,900
But shouldn't you have... a warrant for something like this?

144
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,250
We just want to see the sales receipt. Please cooperate with us.

145
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,170
Yes, Chairman, this is Soo Yeon.

146
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm in Namdaemun now. 
  (T/N: Namdaemun - the Great South Gate, in a street market in the area) 

147
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,230
I need assistance from one of the shop owners.

148
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,480
   

149
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,180
Yes, hello?

150
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,500
Yes...

151
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,570
   

152
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,610
   

153
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,460
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

154
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,540
   

155
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,920
   

156
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll just go.

157
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,610
Just by the looks of it, he must be a karaoke server.

158
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,100
What if he runs away?

159
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,110
I can tell right away you're a cop.

160
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,820
I don't look that obvious.

161
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,360
Are you sure you'll be okay?

162
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,830
What?

163
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,410
Just don't be late if you hear a scream.

164
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,210
Take it if you think you can, right?

165
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,310
What can I do?

166
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
Go for it even if you can't have it.

167
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,540
I found it.

168
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,110
 CEO? 

169
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,680
 Lose the camera and hide! 

170
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,660
That's going to be hard.

171
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,750
- You okay? 
 - Camera! Camera!

172
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
 He goes to throw away all the newspapers that were read 

173
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,280
 during staff's meal time. 

174
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,400
 Into the staff room.
  

175
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,540
   

176
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,760
 If he hid the ledger in-between the newspaper pages... 

177
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,160
Sh*t.

178
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,090
 Throws it away... 

179
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,440
What's this?

180
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,010
I was looking for something to read.

181
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
No...

182
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,210
I mean, what are you doing here?

183
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,500
What?

184
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,690
I don't know what you were trying to do, but

185
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:51,500
if you get caught by a staff member, we all could get punished.

186
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,960
Understand?

187
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,090
Go outside.

188
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,220
   

189
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,750
   

190
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,430
What are you doing?

191
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,830
Nothing.

192
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,100
Hurry and leave now.

193
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,220
You are going back to your room.

194
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,680
Okay.

195
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,470
Guard, who caught 4471?

196
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,680
I don't know.

197
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,290
Please tell me.

198
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,040
Don't touch me. Seriously.

199
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,360
Tell me, please.

200
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,870
Come on. So gross...

201
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,040
Let's go...

202
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,780
2345.

203
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,670
Are you in any pain?

204
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,320
No.

205
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,800
11735, you're okay, right?

206
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,270
 Yes. 

207
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,720
 End of inspection. 

208
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,020
 You can just tell him to go. 

209
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,650
 You can just write it down. It's okay. 

210
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,030
 But... 

211
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,710
 Aigoo... 

212
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,410
2345, visitor.

213
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,860
 It wasn't... 

214
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,850
 It wasn't a dream. 

215
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,630
This video was on Inspector Kwon's camera, the one who committed suicide.

216
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,550
Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung.

217
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,430
There is a talk of him being promoted to Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office,

218
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,240
Public Security Division, from the Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

219
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,980
Yo Han.

220
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,680
Ms. Oh Soo Yeon.

221
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,140
Yes?

222
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,490
Could you find out if Inspector Kwon Dae Il sought out help from others before he died?

223
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,170
What about Mok Jin Hyung?

224
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,770
I'll confirm it myself.

225
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,680
   

226
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,830
What's this?

227
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,000
Sh*t!

228
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,310
Who parked in my spot?

229
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,750
D*mn it!

230
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,950
Yes?

231
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,540
 Warden, Goldman's Director Jin is here. 

232
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,660
My goodness. Director Jin, it's been a while.

233
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,090
As for Chairman Do's case...

234
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,340
 Oh, watch my tongue... 

235
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,700
 Warden, it's been awhile. 

236
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,610
 When will it be possible to visit Chairman Do? 

237
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,300
   

238
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,680
Actually, if the inmate refuses a visit,

239
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,320
there is nothing we can do.

240
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,110
It puts me in a very difficult situation in the middle.

241
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,990
 Chairman Yang is planning to come himself. 

242
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,290
Chairman Yang Joon will come here himself?

243
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,730
 I can't seem to get through to you. What do you expect? 

244
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,290
 By the way, 

245
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,830
 when the Chairman comes, bring the kid along, too. 

246
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,010
He says to make sure you are taking your medicine.

247
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,180
Is the dean back?

248
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,500
Just take your medicine.

249
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,600
Why...

250
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,880
Why do you hate me so much?

251
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,450
   

252
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,010
Is it because I'm a dirty SOB?

253
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,080
Because I was an informant...

254
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,400
because I betrayed my cellmates?

255
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,510
What's important isn't whether you lied or not.

256
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,310
What's important is why you did it.

257
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,300
I revealed all my cards before coming in here.

258
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,700
What's so funny?

259
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,730
Then who is that person who keeps visiting you?

260
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,630
That VIP?

261
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,030
A business partner.

262
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,310
I'll get going...

263
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,950
I'll get...

264
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,210
 They got to Lee Tae Gwang like this, too... 

265
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,850
 No... 

266
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,460
 I can't fall down like this yet... 

267
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,410
 Guard... 

268
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,820
 Guard... 

269
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,120
 But why? 

270
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,390
You dirty SOB...

271
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,220
 How long has he been unconscious? 

272
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,200
 Acute heart failure? 

273
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,110
 Oh, no...What are you doing now? Where did you get soju? 

274
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,350
 Why did you give soju to a heart failure patient? 

275
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,790
 What, what's wrong with him? 

276
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,240
 He needs to be transported to an outside hospital right now. 

277
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
 Are you crazy? What will you write on the report?! 

278
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,510
 Man, what will you write on the report?! 

279
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,880
 So save him here! 

280
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,370
 You need to save him here! Get to it! 

281
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,510
Don't worry.

282
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,610
I won't kill you here.

283
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,320
For now.

284
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,820
What happened?

285
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,080
Just think you had a bad case of diarrhea from drinking bad water.

286
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,950
Just go back to where you came from.

287
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,230
Go back and spend your last remaining year quietly and leave.

288
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,440
This is not a place for you.

289
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,710
This is Yo Han.

290
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,930
 I'm right outside. 

291
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,640
I found it.

292
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,340
The video.

293
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,690
I found it.

294
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,070
 Really? 

295
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,890
 When did you find it? 

296
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,570
Two, four...

297
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,950
six, eight...

298
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,570
Eleven.

299
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,990
It's a cell phone.

300
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,560
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

301
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,250
Yes.

302
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,800
Yes.

303
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,590
Who was it?

304
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,080
 - Thank you.  
 - Sure.

305
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,400
At first, I saw the child's father often.

306
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,120
But since it's a long-term rental,

307
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,330
I didn't say anything.

308
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,240
 The cell phone number that was last registered under Inspector Kwon's wife 

309
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,240
 and the last call on that phone was made from here. 

310
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,400
   

311
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,410
   

312
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:38,370
   

313
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,130
   

314
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,430
   

315
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,250
I found it. 
    

316
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,900
 2345, you have a visitor. 

317
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,250
What's wrong?

318
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,630
I need to change my gauze.

319
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,470
They should've taped it better.

320
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,760
Go!

321
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,210
Thank you.

322
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,600
What is it?

323
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,600
It's heavy.

324
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,670
Looking for this?

325
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,570
Or...

326
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,450
this?

327
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,880
You, dumba**!

328
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
  I don't know who recorded that video, 
   

329
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,680
 but he's trying to drive a wedge between us, man! 

330
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,110
 I'm sorry... 

331
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,510
 I was scared. 

332
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,410
 Man! 

333
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,760
 I understand. 

334
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,880
 Hey... I understand the pain you are going through. 

335
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,940
 Yo Han, justice does not change. 

336
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,300
 We may not have the power right now, 

337
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,400
 but something that is bound to happen will happen, 

338
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,940
 and those who should fall will be destroyed. 

339
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,430
 Right now, this is where you are the safest. 

340
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,710
 Just consider it as you recuperating here. 

341
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,090
 Just lay low for a little bit. 

342
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,720
 Got it? 

343
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,510
What did Chairman Do say?

344
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,520
Is he still refusing a visitation?

345
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,490
He won't even answer me anymore.

346
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,110
- He just stares at me without a word. 
 - Aigoo... What are you going to do?

347
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,820
What do you mean what am I going to do?

348
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,210
I'll have to do my best and beg if I don't want to end up as a pile of dust.

349
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,280
You. I know there was something between you and Chairman Yang.

350
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,380
The weather's already foul today, don't you add to it.

351
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,970
Don't cause any problems, got it?

352
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,890
- What is it? 
   - Director Jin and Chairman Yang have arrived. 

353
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,350
Aigoo, President Heo...

354
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,800
It's not President. It's Warden. 
  (T/N: President and Warden sound similar in Korean) 

355
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,390
Warden Heo.

356
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,340
As for Chairman Do, I asked him just now,

357
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,840
but maybe it's because of the weather.

358
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,890
He says he's not feeling well, especially today.

359
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,710
I asked him to call you as soon as he feels better.

360
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,850
But considering Chairman Do has

361
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,070
the support of Sinseon-dong...

362
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:01,710
Lately, I'm in a real bind caught between the two Chairmen.

363
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,340
I see.

364
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,770
As for Chairman Do's case, it is my brother's business affairs.

365
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,440
You should take it up with my brother.

366
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm here to visit Lee Tae Gwang.

367
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,670
Pardon?

368
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,580
I heard you poisoned Lee Tae Gwang with Clorox

369
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,910
and are hiding him in this prison somewhere.

370
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,260
Hi-Hiding?

371
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,580
Wait a minute...

372
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,850
It's been a while since I've seen you,

373
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,420
but that luster on your face...

374
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,920
Every pore on your face is filled with collagen.

375
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,070
Your complexion is like a bright rainbow.

376
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,190
This kind of shine can't be from cosmetics.

377
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,810
It's brushed with money.

378
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,100
- Chairman Yang, actually... 
 - Shhh.

379
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,220
You shut up!

380
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,660
Director Jin, how was my pronunciation?

381
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,980
Yes, it was good.

382
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,990
It was good.

383
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,190
I had such affection for this place.

384
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,100
A gambling house in prison.

385
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,900
Now, this is called an industrial revolution.

386
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,510
I mean, who would ever think...

387
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,370
No one is coming here to crack down on you.

388
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,500
Even if you wanted to run after ripping off someone's money you are surrounded by walls.

389
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,460
This is what you call a real thing!

390
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,100
It'll excite the gamblers the moment they enter this place.

391
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,940
Before they even touch the cards,

392
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,350
their eyes will flip out from the excitement. But this...

393
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,170
This daebak item, you know?

394
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,280
With one shot of Clorox, you know?

395
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,930
Sh*t.

396
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,590
That motherf***er.

397
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,940
Hey.

398
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,650
This is Mr. Jang.

399
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,460
The one you asked us to bring.

400
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,050
Mr. Jang?

401
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,660
He's not referring to you by your number,

402
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,850
so you must have some respect around here.

403
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,620
Around here, Mr. Jang is... this.

404
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,540
Under King Yeonsangun in the Joseon Dynasty, there was a man named Kim Ja Won.

405
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,060
- Why Joseon Dynasty all of a sudden— 
 - When Kim Ja Won went to the Office of the Royal Secretary,

406
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,810
all dignitaries had to bow their heads,

407
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,420
and if Kim Ja Won was going through the market in a procession,

408
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,290
even the generals on horseback had to get off their horses,

409
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,070
even the Left State Minister and Right State Minister.

410
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,160
They say one couldn't meet the king without Kim Ja Won's permission.

411
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,270
So who was this Kim Ja Won?

412
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,220
He was a eunuch.

413
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,770
 So why bite the hand that feeds you? 

414
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,620
 I'll go without the anesthesia. 

415
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,730
In the countryside, they castrate obstinate animals. Hey!

416
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,030
Do you still sit down to pee?

417
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,790
Wow! They say all your energy gathers at the mouth when you get old.

418
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,950
You got quite good at this.

419
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,610
F***er...

420
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,140
   

421
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,770
   

422
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,330
Okay.

423
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,560
Thank you for the meal.

424
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,620
Who are you?

425
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,420
A customer.

426
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,320
   

427
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,780
Min Ho...

428
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,670
   

429
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,550
We're on the same side.

430
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,020
Let's talk for a little bit.

431
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,120
Who are you?

432
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,310
I'm looking for the person who hurt Inspector Kwon.

433
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,980
Let me ask you a question.

434
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,740
Why did Inspector Kwon give you a cell phone?

435
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,220
And that room.

436
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,950
He set you up a room too.

437
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,880
That grandmother... Do you know she passed away?

438
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,790
Oh, my! Oh, no. Are you okay?

439
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,830
I'll take care of myself.

440
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,950
   

441
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,690
What did the Chief Mok Jin Hyung say?

442
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,150
   

443
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,830
 The person who texted me the most 
   

444
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,740
 was 0637. This bastard. 
   

445
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,580
 And the one who communicated a lot with this bastard is 5863. 

446
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,070
 Between these two, 

447
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,770
 one of them has to be... 

448
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,990
Why?

449
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,460
Why did you come?

450
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,900
I was wondering how the food was in the Central District Prosecutor's Office. 
    

451
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,020
I came here to have a taste of it.

452
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,950
You should've called ahead,

453
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,840
Sunbaenim.

454
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,400
Right?

455
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,630
I'll come back next time.

456
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,150
I'll see myself out.

457
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,990
But still...

458
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,080
I just started eating.

459
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,970
Let's go out. There's...

460
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,490
a nice fish grilling baekban place out front. 
  (T/N: baekban - traditional Korean home-cooked style meal) 

461
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,490
It'll be my treat.

462
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,240
 One f***er who videotaped me after killing a person ...

463
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,920
 And another f***er, 

464
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,760
 and finally, Yoon Byung Wook. 

465
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,860
One motherf***er.

466
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,300
He tried to make Kim Yo Han and me go up against each other.

467
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,550
Yoon Byung Wook, that bastard...

468
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,200
When I catch the bastard who videotaped me,

469
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,410
that'll be the end of you, Yoon Byung Wook. You're finished.

470
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,370
Let's see who wins. You or me.

471
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,360
I wonder if the person who recorded the video could be the culprit who killed my grandmother.

472
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,450
The video was recorded for you to see.

473
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,120
Is there anything more you can find out about the video?

474
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,730
 I don't think so. 

475
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,370
But don't lose too much hope.

476
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:14,950
Inspector Kwon had hidden something else besides the camera.

477
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,520
Have you heard of a kid named Woo Min Ho?

478
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,370
Woo Min Ho?

479
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:23,170
He's an 11-year-old boy whom Inspector Kwon had secretly hidden in a motel room.

480
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,370
 He seemed to know your grandmother. 

481
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,000
 If we find that boy, 

482
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,260
 maybe we can find the culprit quickly. 

483
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
This way, please.

484
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,970
   

485
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Did you have a nice visitation?

486
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,490
Yes.

487
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,430
The blade should face up so you don't hurt your hands.

488
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,800
Is he your boy?

489
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,550
It's not what you are thinking.

490
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,690
What are you doing right now?

491
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,770
Remove your hand from the inmate.

492
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,580
Let's go.

493
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,890
Why did you do it?

494
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,570
What's this?

495
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,980
If you are looking for a knife right now,

496
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,310
 you are simply planning for revenge. 

497
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,770
 Against the bastard who put you away here 

498
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,670
 or to avenge your family member. 

499
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,910
 But if you came for this recorder, 

500
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,630
 that means you are trying to get a confession out of the person you'll meet. So, why? 

501
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,580
 For instance, you sent out a message through the VIP visitation, 

502
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,690
 but something... 

503
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,250
 didn't go your way. 

504
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:32,370
 Unlike what was promised, you have to stay locked up here. 

505
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:35,540
 If that's not it, you wouldn't need any of these. 

506
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,410
 Here. 

507
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,580
 Which is it? 

508
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,350
   

509
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,530
There's nothing here.

510
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,510
Come in.

511
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,030
This place...

512
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,690
is where morons who only know how to hang tight onto their dealt hands gather.

513
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,830
It's the ultimate end of the underground tunnel.

514
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:32,670
But because of this one bastard, all our livelihoods are threatened.

515
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,140
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

516
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,390
2345! You said you are here unjustly.

517
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,210
Then why aren't you making appeals?

518
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,860
Especially one who used to be a Judicial Institute trainee.

519
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,380
Maybe because he was thrown out from the Judicial Institute?

520
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,650
Let's say that then.

521
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:51,230
Still, he gets weekly VIP visitations.

522
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:57,220
To have that kind of privilege, you have to be a Sinseon-dong senior around here.

523
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,110
2345...

524
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:07,690
Is he a Sinseon-dong member?

525
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,610
So...

526
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,870
The thing that you wanted to do...

527
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,550
Did you do it?

528
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,760
 Nam Dae Moon's slush fund ledger. 

529
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,290
Was it there?

530
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,940
   

531
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,910
Don't be too resentful.

532
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,210
Taking a knife for visitation? That's crossing the line.

533
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,000
Set up the pendulum.

534
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:54,010


535
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,870
   

536
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:05,420
♫ The night is becoming darker ♫

537
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:12,720
♫ Did I lose myself, I will not stoop so low ♫

538
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:18,480
♫ Who was the justice for? ♫

539
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,960
 Hyung, if I save you this time, you'll do me a favor, right? 

540
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,630
 What are you doing? Hurry up and find it! 

541
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:26,900
 Where is Kim Yo Han? 

542
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,250
 This is Sinseon-dong. 

543
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,320
 I will have to confirm it myself. 

544
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,850
 Wow, I feel competitive. 

545
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,670
 Do you understand the reason for my impatience? 

546
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,790
 What are you going to do here now, Yo Han? 

547
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,530
 Take over. 

548
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,200
 This is the last chance. 

549
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,400
 It's all over. 

550
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,760
 No one from the 1st league will follow you. 

551
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,600
 If I tell you all my secrets and truths, will you accept me then? 

552
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,200
♫  Bring it on, bring it on  ♫

553
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,700
♫ Another me who hid myself, no one knows ♫
