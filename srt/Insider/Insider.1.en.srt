(Keeping his customer happy)

326
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,072
So, Chairman Yang got out of going to prison, thanks to the CID chief pulling strings

327
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,982
and since he served his sentence alone,

328
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,762
he brought a video of Chairman Yang gambling and

329
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,002
offered us a deal to get him out as well.

330
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:50,862
But after that, this guy's completely cut off contact.

331
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,982
Yo Han.

332
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:02,802
Can you get close to that Lee Tae Gwang and get that video?

333
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:10,262
Where is Lee Tae Gwang right now?

334
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,392
Seongju Prison.

335
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:16,502
If you go a little further out of Seoul...

336
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:19,802
You know, right? Seongju Prison.

337
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:27,742
Are you telling me to go to prison and come out?

338
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,152
We can't reach him at all.

339
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,832
We can't even visit him.

340
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:36,342
The CID might be hiding Lee Tae Gwang tightly, too.

341
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:39,042
Yo Han.

342
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:44,622
Since you got started, why don't you take one more step?

343
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:49,452
Are you done?

344
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,042
Go ahead.

345
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,642
You'll be in jail for just a little bit.

346
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,362
Done.

Yo Han.

348
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:02,812
You don't have to answer right now.

349
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,742
No.

350
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:07,342
Don't answer right now.

351
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:11,272
Wait for him.

352
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:21,802
He thought no one would find it.

353
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:23,822
But when he woke up to the dog barking,

354
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:27,972
the cops were coming from over there.

355
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:31,912
And reporters also found out somehow.

356
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:34,542
They were also running with their cameras.

357
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:37,592
So he ran away to the mountain.

358
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:39,762
I'm talking about your younger brother.

359
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:45,812
Stop it.

360
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:47,622
In this day and age?

361
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:49,902
Do you think you'll be okay doing this to me?

362
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,512
This little punk. Where do you think you are?

363
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:56,002
The regime lasts only five years, but you guys are forever powerful?

364
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,272
Are you the only ones forever powerful?

365
00:33:57,272 --> 00:34:00,932
I'm the one who put your father in a wheelchair five years ago.

366
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:05,822
I'm the one who told the reporters that your younger brother was hiding there at dawn.

367
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:09,692
You think the world belongs to you because you were born with a golden spoon in your mouth?

368
00:34:09,692 --> 00:34:11,012
But what do we do about this?

369
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:13,682
I'm the one that the country chose to catch you guys.

370
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:16,282
To stop from you guys messing around the country,

371
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:19,412
I'm the one that the country chose as a sheriff.

Excuse me, Prosecutor.

376
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:36,792
Why are you still investigating what happened more than 10 years ago?

377
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,912
My father collapsed during the last investigation and is still being treated at a hospital.

378
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,822
It's not a show, but it's a fact.

379

If it doesn't work with your brother,

then I'll say that your daughter is about to swallow up a person.

You sure tried your best to save the child who was close to dying.

She's been to cardiology since she was three for childhood heart failure.

I heard you found a suitable person and are waiting for surgery?

384
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:05,032
It's very weird.

385
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:09,322
It usually doesn't work that fast.

Hey, you punk!

387

- But still, this is wrong!
- Wrong? You a**hole!

One person is going to die instead to save your daughter's life.

389
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:22,642
It's so sad not to have any money.

[Corruption Investigation Agency...]

we're up against the CID of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

That's why

I planted a "bomb" at their feet.

A bomb?

But if something goes wrong, are we the ones who die?

If something comes up, I'll throw myself and contain it.

We're doing well right now, but aren't we going too far?

Just call it a courageous decision.

Why did you do that?

426

I'm the owner of the gambling house that you blew away.

427

But thanks to you, I don't "own" anything anymore.

428
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:43,112
I just collect things now.

429
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,242
Oh, right. Before I started to run the house,

430
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:48,232
I worked for a while to get back money from the people

431
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:51,142
who borrowed loans and didn't pay them back.

Back then, my nickname was "OK, Jo Hae Do."

433
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,452
Overdue debt was okay. Bad debt was also okay.

434
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:59,442
I was okay with everything.

435
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:04,242
You don't seem to believe me, I guess?

436
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:06,192
Okay.

437
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:09,122
This is how I collected what I needed.

438

Let's gargle your mouth.

439
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:15,132
So, how are you going to pay for my house?

440
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,702
I don't have any money.

441
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:23,312

Aigoo, sir! Do you think it's a matter of you saying yes or no?

Do you think you can prevent that somehow?

What are you saying?

452
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:59,362
Sir, this has nothing to do with the law.

Our conviction leads us to the right path,

but sometimes it sends us to dangerous places.

489

What happened today could be just the beginning.

490

The prison will be a completely different world.

491

So...if you want to stop,

492

Aigoo, why all the fuss? I'm fine!

Hey, what happened to your face?

It's nothing.

My wisdom tooth.

Why did they pull out a wisdom tooth so recklessly?

Look at your swollen cheek.

Not a problem.

And the frames and clock that fell on the floor?

They won't move at all, even if there's an earthquake.

Are you the only one involved in this?

There's a rumor that Hong Sang Wook became the chief of the CID thanks to him.

Actually, some f***er was waiting for me by my car yesterday, too.
