1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,790
   

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,900
   

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,340
   

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,920
   

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:27,680


6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,090
   

7
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,140
 Arrived in Korea on November 15. 

8
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,870
 It was college examination day in Korea. 

9
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,540
 Dad said it was something like the SATs in the US. 

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,200
 How was the sightseeing in Korea? 

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,730
 I had a great time! 

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,010
 What would you like for dinner? 

13
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,200
 Pork cutlets. 

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,850
 Pork cutlet— 

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,470
 Driver? 

16
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,920
 What's going on? 

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,380
 Driver? 

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,000
 We were kidnapped that day. 

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,290
 At first, it was somewhere underground near a railroad. 

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,860
 And they kept asking us... 

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,440
 Casino... Money... Laundry... 

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,300
 They said if I wanted to save my dad, I should do as they asked. 

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,790
 Grandmother. 

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,170
 Oh? 

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,340
 Grandmother, can you help me find my house? 

26
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yo Han? 

27
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,610
   

28
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,560
   

29
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,770
Does Chairman Do have any weaknesses?

30
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,340
Don't confront the Chairman.

31
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,810
 I'm sorry. 

32
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,570
 I looked into it. 

33
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,800
 I can't do anything to stop you from getting transferred. 

34
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,460
 Even during hibernation... Do you know anything at all? 

35
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,400
 Do you think they call him Dosan-ro "White Bear" because of his appearance? 

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,890
 To a hunter, the hardest prey to catch is a bear, and the second hardest is a shark. 

37
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,840
 That's why he's called the White Bear. 

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,890
Instead, get on your knees and plead with him.

39
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,010
 I'm sorry. 

40
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,330
 Aside from the initial 13-year sentence he received when he came in here... 

41
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,690
 Hey, 2345! 

42
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,090
 Yo Han hyung, come, hurry! 

43
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,950
Ah!

44
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,260
 Instead, get on your knees and plead with him. 

45
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,450
 Yo Han hyung! 

46
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,350
 Is your guilty conscience bothering you? 

47
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,980
 Are you going to quit? 

48
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,200
 Do you want forgiveness? 

49
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,710
2345, what's wrong?

50
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,510
- Leave him alone. 
 - Please...

51
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,000
 You are not supposed to cry during a revenge. 

52
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,450
 I'll help you. 

53
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,140
 You have to save my dad, Hyung. 

54
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,370
You are causing quite a scene.

55
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,480
Accept... Accept...

56
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,300
Please accept me.

57
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,170
Everything... Everything...

58
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,780
I will abandon everything.

59
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,260
I'll only do your bidding.

60
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,130
Please...

61
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,900
Please take...

62
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,670
take me in as your possession, Chairman.

63
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,450
Please...

64
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,250
The child that was killed...

65
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,710
Does he visit you day and night?

66
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,140
You're the one calling out to the child.

67
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,440
The part of you seeking out the child

68
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,950
is your so-called conscience.

69
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,780
In the end, that'll be the death of you.

70
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,180
In a given year, do you think more people die from car accidents

71
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,280
or because of their conscience?

72
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,440
You need to overcome yourself.

73
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,290
You need to overcome that soft weakness inside of you.

74
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,110
Only that way can you achieve what you want.

75
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,090
Are you asking me to kill someone?

76
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,540
Living is supposed to be cruel and disgusting.

77
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,430
You can do penance when you get to hell. It's still not too late, then.

78
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,880
Aren't you afraid of the law?

79
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,150
The law? Justice.

80
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,680
The law is not a scale.

81
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,570
It's a knife.

82
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,160
One who has the power will hold the handle,

83
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,170
and the powerless will hold the blade.

84
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,580
I thought you were supposed to be book smart...

85
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,590
Who do I have to kill?

86
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,340
Woo Sang Ki.

87
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,080
The father of the kid you've been searching for.

88
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,290
 Woo Sang Ki. 

89
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,000
 He's Woo Min Ho's father. 

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,900
 You have to save my dad, Hyung. 

91
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,250
Why?

92
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,890
I'll do what you ask.

93
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,970
Yang Joon and Yang Hwa, those brothers

94
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,650
had lost Woo Sang Ki, who was an indispensable part of the money laundering process.

95
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,140
And the laundering has been halted for over half a year already.

96
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,460
The slush funds from the account

97
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,800
cannot sustain us for long, so everyone is very anxious.

98
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,580
The rumor is that some are even eyeing the slush funds for themselves

99
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,000
and have started their own business.

100
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,950
Although I want to try something,

101
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,430
the situation in prison has been turned upside down, as you know.

102
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,920
I can't send anyone outside the prison for the time being.

103
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,880
So if you can allow my errand boy

104
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,870
to be released on time,

105
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,780
I'll make plans to remove the two brothers and recapture the Casino's manager position,

106
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,250
so I can make sure the funds of the elders are protected.

107
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,580
I'll make sure the casino's business is normalized

108
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,410
including, of course, the money laundering.

109
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,880
   

110
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,320
 Kim Yo Han will be released on time? 

111
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,250
How about Song Doo Cheol's death?

112
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,030
 They all... 

113
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,170
changed their statements?

114
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,940
   

115
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,550
   

116
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,400
   

117
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,030
   

118
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,890
   

119
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,550
   

120
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,930
   

121
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,100
   

122
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,490
   

123
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,160
CEO?

124
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,500
The payment for management has been made under the Foundation's name.

125
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,200
Okay.

126
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,290
Yes.

127
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,070
That's really good news.

128
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,670
How did you know I was here?

129
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,870
I turned the car around when I saw you.

130
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,010
If you were getting out early, you should've called me.

131
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,610
I was going to call you once I got down there.

132
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,680
You went through a lot in there.

133
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,160
All thanks to you.

134
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,980
No...

135
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,530
It's because of your decision to go all-in in that situation.

136
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,960
And it worked on him.

137
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,980
That's why you and I are both here.

138
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,400
 Jang Seon Oh... 

139
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,500
 The only way for you to get out of here... 

140
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,620
 is through Do Won Bong. 

141
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,230
  The job that 6650 had to do... 

142
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,840
 Now, you'll have to do it. 

143
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,900
 Here... 

144
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,290
 Without Do Won Bong's permission, 
   

145
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,510
 there is no way to leave the prison. 

146
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,100
 In other words... 

147
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,900
 the killing of my grandmother by Jang Seon Oh was also 

148
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,180
 ordered by Do Won Bong. 

149
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,880
 But why? 

150
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,170
 Why would Do Won Bong do that to me? 

151
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,750
 Should I put a marker on Jang Seon Oh? 

152
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,310
 No. 

153
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,880
 Right now, it's not Jang Seon Oh we have to check out. 

154
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,750
 It's Do Won Bong. 

155
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,590
 Due to the latest outing, he'll try to avoid getting mixed up with you, Yo Han. 

156
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,340
 Then I'll have to make him follow. 

157
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,160
 You have visitation with Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. 

158
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,220
 I refuse. 

159
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,470
-  I refuse.  
 -  I refuse. 

160
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,110
 I refuse. 

161
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,340
 Hong Jae Sun will make a move. 

162
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,700
 The deposit's been made. 

163
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
 Throw them the meat... 
   

164
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,550
   
 (T/N: Level and cell room number) 

165
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,050
   

166
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,590
 Did you send this? 

167
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,010
 Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun met with the professor. 
 (T/N: The slang for prison is school) 

168
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,040
 This is a search and seizure warrant. 

169
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,570
 Look around! 

170
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,050
 Where is everyone? 

171
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,230
 - Where the hell are they? 
 - Sh*t! 

172
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,130
 and take away the bones. 

173
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,100
 The prison's warden has been replaced because of corruption 

174
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,680
 so under these circumstances, even Chairman Do 

175
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,480
 won't be able to send people out to do his bidding for some time. 

176
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,300
 He has to send someone outside besides Jang Sun Oh... 

177
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,120
 Help me. 

178
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,900
 In front of Chairman Do who is in that predicament... 

179
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,460
 I only want one thing. 

180
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,820
 Please stop Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun. 

181
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,940
 That's a no deal. 

182
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,950
 My release date isn't too far off. 

183
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,090
 If I plead with him with my arms outstretched... 

184
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,310
 Take me... 

185
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,220
 in as your possession, Chairman. 

186
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,640
 Chairman Do... 

187
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,220
 couldn't bear to reach out and grab my hand. 

188
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,220
 So, starting with Do Won Bong... 

189
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,830
 I'll have him sit at my game table. 

190
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,020
Here's the thing you wanted.

191
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,730
Thank you.

192
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,750
And that other thing is also ready.

193
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,880
I put some furniture and some clothes for you in your room.

194
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,060
I'd like to stop by my home first and go there later.

195
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,090
 Next in the news, 

196
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,730
 Attorney General Um Dong Soo, who was inaugurated this morning, 

197
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,080
 expressed his neutral position about the establishment of the Corruption Investigation Agency. 

198
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,620
 Attorney General Um stated to the reporters that the law is equal for all people 

199
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,440
 and that the task of reforming the organization will be accomplished based on principles— 

200
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,780
They're putting on a show while they've already staged everything around the CID. 
  (T/N: Central Investigation Division at the Prosecutor-General's Office) 

201
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:05,860
   

202
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,200
 This group was definitely set up to hunt someone down. 

203
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,370
 But how come there is no slayer among them? 

204
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,900
 Sh*t. 

205
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,150
 I can't get stuck here. 

206
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,990
 Before I'm pushed out of Seoul, I have to catch the guy who made the video 

207
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,920
 and find Yoon Byung Wook's weakness. 

208
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,730
It's a fight.

209
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,570
 Grandmother, I'm home! 

210
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,470
 Why are you so late? 

211
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,350
I'm back.

212
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,410
 Don't worry about me. 

213
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,280
 Even if I don't have any money, 

214
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,550
 I have no problem living my life. 

215
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,680
   

216
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,190
   

217
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,640
 Is it hot and cold over there? 

218
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,010
 If I don't do anything, 

219
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,680
 nothing changes. 

220
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,360
 Grandmother, please wait a little longer. 

221
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,480
What did the Attorney General say?

222
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,200
In order to establish the Corruption Investigation Agency,

223
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,500
we keep getting hit from the outside.

224
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,930
In times like this, he says we need to show solidarity.

225
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,280
Whenever our organization faced a crisis,

226
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,980
the ones who defended the organization with their life

227
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,950
has always been us, the CID.

228
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,050
He says he'll fight in the forefront and take the blame.

229
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,980
He says to make sure I take care of all the juniors and set them straight.

230
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,750
The Attorney General is not like a battery.

231
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,760
They keep replacing them. Does this make sense?

232
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,520
Every time they replace Attorney General,

233
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,350
our spirits at the Prosecutors' Offices go down.

234
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,440
They want to keep bringing us down

235
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,120
so that they can weaken us even in the courts.

236
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,420
The administration in power lasts five years, but

237
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,280
our spirits are immortal.

238
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,040
We just have to close our eyes and stand our ground.

239
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,270
The next general election will come around soon enough.

240
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,040
Let's stand our ground

241
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,310
and inherit the Prosecutors' Office

242
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,970
with a future for our next generation!

243
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,750
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

244
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,510
- Nice. 
 - Come on in.

245
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,760
- Whom? 
 - This is Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Woo Jae,

246
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,800
who investigated the chairman's son's slush fund on the HC Airline acquisition case.

247
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,430
I'm Kim Woo Jae, the 36th class, from Criminal Division 4 of the Western District Prosecutors' Office.

248
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,650
I see.

249
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,350
Since they lied and said it's executive and staff salary,

250
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,520
it must've been hard to find them.

251
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,790
Still, thanks to Chief Prosecutor Yoon's help, I was able to wrap up the case.

252
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,780
We are alumni.

253
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,500
You also studied under Professor Park Yong Won, right?

254
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,070
- Yes. 
 - I see...

255
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,420
Does Professor Park still teach?

256
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,880
Yes.

257
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,730
He's the one I was referring to earlier. Our next generation.

258
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,230
The next generation.

259
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,740
Did you eat?

260
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,380
I'm sorry, but I was in the middle of preparing for a hearing.

261
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,810
I need to get back to it.

262
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,080
Aigoo, what food...

263
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,670
I'd get sick just drinking water with that workload.

264
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,310
Get back to work. I'll cover for you.

265
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,040
Go on.

266
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,840
Mok Jin Hyung.

267
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,000
The chief prosecutor is a bit busy right now.

268
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,090
Tell him I said congratulations on his promotion.

269
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,220
Congratulations?

270
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,360
The people in those positions...

271
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,450
While you were trying to figure out what to do,

272
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,320
their predecessors tried to protect the organization unsuccessfully. They're filling those positions.

273
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,380
And you want to congratulate them?

274
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,210
But still...

275
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,030
the fight's not over.

276
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,770
What do you think you can do?

277
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,600
Whatever you tell me to do, Assistant Prosecutor,

278
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,950
I will do it all.

279
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,810
Just tell me what to do.

280
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,100
The Corruption Investigation Agency... It's an extremely ill-conceived idea.

281
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,150
I will uncover it to the public.

282
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,560
Our people in the department all realize I had supported the Corruption Investigation Agency.

283
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,130
But if I stand in the forefront and speak up in opposition,

284
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,430
it will be... greatly effective.

285
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,400
So please...

286
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,820
save me.

287
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,570
Okay.

288
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,400
Let's hear it. Where do you want to go?

289
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,190
I'd just like to stay in Seoul.

290
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,600
How could I... possibly dream of a promotion?

291
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:04,250
Can you really do everything I command?

292
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,640
Anything.

293
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,180
Everything.

294
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,660
I will do it.

295
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,700
Then take care of Kim Yo Han first.

296
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,010
I told you so before, but... he looks even more healthy now.

297
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,400
If you take care of him before the official personnel announcement,

298
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,690
I'll let you remain in Seoul.

299
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,960
By "taking care of him," you mean...

300
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,220
Sh*t! Really?

301
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,880
I understand.

302
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,280
I'll take care of Kim Yo Han.

303
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,690
It's safe here, right?

304
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,230
As long you weren't followed.

305
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,760
I come and go without being noticed,

306
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,670
so feel at ease here.

307
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,790
This is your...

308
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,310
A lot, isn't it?

309
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,510
I only imagined it.

310
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,940
   

311
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,880
What is it?

312
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,510
Is something strange?

313
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,780
It's... like a very luxurious

314
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,160
prison room.

315
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,750
Even though it's a rental,

316
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,130
it lacks a sense of humanity.

317
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,870
Give me a minute.

318
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,180
Here. Sense of humanity.

319
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,740
When was this taken?

320
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,790
This was...

321
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,020
Well...

322
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,440
When all this started.

323
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,100
But the name... 
    

324
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,200
She's Yeon Soo.

325
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,110
   

326
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,810
 I was 16 at the time. 

327
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:35,180
 There was a huge scandal that got the world talking at the time, an investment fraud case. 

328
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,550
 My mom was said to be the mastermind behind the case. 

329
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,980
 They said she committed suicide. 

330
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,130
 But it was oddly too neat, 

331
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,440
 as if it wasn't the first time she had tried. 

332
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,080
 Even though she made a living by selling liquor, she was a very smart person. 

333
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,800
 Just in case of her own death... 

334
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,330
 and the investment fraud case... 

335
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,800
 She had prepared a piece of evidence 

336
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,400
 that could reveal the reason behind all of it. 
    

337
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,880
 Let's do our best. 

338
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,040
   

339
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,590
   

340
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,450
 But the world doesn't give you a break because you are young. 

341
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,080
Gosh...

342
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,720
 Aside from this, I don't have any other piece of humanity left. 

343
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,860
I took all the unpleasant memories and burned them.

344
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,970
And here I am now.

345
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,490
- What about Jang Seon Oh? 
 - Not yet.

346
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,510
Actually... it would be better if nothing was associated.

347
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,710
Later on... let's take all this down together.

348
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,670
Lee Yeon Soo.

349
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,050
Is this the life of an ex-convict?

350
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,320
Even though I'm released, it doesn't seem like it.

351
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,110
 The outside world and a prison cell are not all that different. 

352
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,550
What did you do with the watch?

353
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,010
I was in a rush and forgot.

354
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,970
I told you before,

355
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,200
even if you fall into a fire pit, don't ever take off the watch.

356
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,610
Okay.

357
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,500
So what do I have to do starting today?

358
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,140
Woo Sang Ki used a credit card last night in the Gangnam area.

359
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,740
It takes money to stay hidden.

360
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,580
Today, you dab some ink on your hand

361
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,400
and declare, "I belong to the Chairman!"

362
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,770
and put your thumbprint seal on it.

363
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,080
See that building over there?

364
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,080
There's a sauna on the sixth floor.

365
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,900
Woo Sang Ki?

366
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,100
Woo Sang Ki?

367
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,230
Woo Sang Ki...

368
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Woo Sang Ki? One minute.

369
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,660
Sh*t!

370
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,100
Woo Sang Ki!

371
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,860
Hold on, Woo Sang Ki!

372
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,280
Hold on!

373
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,160
Hold on!

374
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,440
Please listen to me. I have something to tell you.

375
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,200
Can you give me a hand?

376
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,150
I'm done.

377
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,660
Let's lift him.

378
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,510
People who use knives in the kitchen have their biases.

379
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,720
There isn't a better knife that won't chip or break easily than this one.

380
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,280
Here.

381
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,700
You get shy the first time,

382
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,670
and it is especially tough if someone is watching.

383
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,180
Use it to open the lid of the ink pad and seal it. 
  (T/N: Metaphorically speaking, seal the deal by killing the man and prove yourself) 

384
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,550
I'll drive around and will be back.

385
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,490
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

386
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,570
Are you even giving me a time limit?

387
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,040
If you can't do it in that time, you couldn't do it even if you had a year.

388
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,160
Spare my life, please.

389
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,210
Please let me live.

390
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm sorry.

391
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,000
You need to die...

392
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,780
so...

393
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,490
we all can live.

394
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,180
What do you mean?

395
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,900
Please, please let me go.

396
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,660
Please let me go!

397
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,510
Please let me go, sir. Please...

398
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,590
Please let me live. Please!

399
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,470
 At 6 a.m. this morning, on a hillside near Annam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 

400
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,700
 a man was found dead. 

401
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,150
 The body was extensively damaged 
   

402
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,010
  that the face was not recognizable. 
   
 

403
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,720
 Based on the ID found near the area, the police 

404
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,420
 confirmed the victim to be Woo, an American national. 
   

405
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,600
 The police are checking through the local CCTV cameras. 

406
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,410
 The police will also check with the locals and launch an extensive investigation. 

407
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,340
I think we can use Kim Yo Han for further tasks on the outside.

408
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,160
My promise to you doesn't change.

409
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,750
The fact that you secretly stole casino slush funds

410
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,530
in order to drive out the Yang brothers.

411
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,680
And for not reporting those facts to the Sinseon-dong,

412
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,820
you promised to share all the profits later. Do you mean to keep that promise?

413
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,230
Yes.

414
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,930
What? Are you anxious?

415
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:50,350
That slush fund doesn't entirely belong to the Sinseon-dong's elders alone.

416
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:55,380
One-third of the Goldman funds' account is held by Sinseon-dong.

417
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,840
And another third by the outside elders of the Sinseon-dong.

418
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,960
And the remaining third by Macau.

419
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,470
We may hide this from the Sinseon-dong,

420
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,940
but the other Deep Pockets...

421
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,500
If you get caught...

422
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,950
That's why I said release Kim Yo Han to the outside.

423
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,010
So if it turns out that

424
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,880
Do Won Bong can take over the Yang brothers...

425
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,000
Are we out then?

426
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,480
If we get cast aside,

427
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,390
I'll go after Annie first.

428
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,360
I mean, the Yang brothers should take responsibility for Woo Sang Ki's death.

429
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,140
This is how I feel, Sunbae.

430
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,200
Yang Hwa, Yang Joon, or Annie...

431
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,790
We gave them the okay.

432
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,240
That's how they've been making a living until now.

433
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,990
How dare she tells us to come and go?

434
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,560
Byung Wook...

435
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,180
If you are going to change the line-up, wait until I'm retired.

436
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,430
I want to live out my old age as comfortable

437
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,990
and as quiet as possible.

438
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,250
They're here.

439
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,190
I set the meeting here because I thought the casino would be uncomfortable for you two.

440
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,990
Oh, yes. Thank you.

441
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,120
Due to the Corruption Investigation Agency, we do need to be cautious.

442
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,360
I understand you'll be promoted to assistant prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

443
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,700
Congratulations on your promotion.

444
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,520
Thank you.

445
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,240
So when did you arrive in Seoul?

446
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,820
I came as soon as I heard of Woo Sang Ki's death.

447
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,570
I flew directly from Macau.

448
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,960
It's an emergency.

449
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,520
Am I the only one who thinks that?

450
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,950
Since Woo Sang Ki's disappearance until now,

451
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:29,080
Goldman Casino was unable to launder 260 billion won.

452
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,370
In other words, the Goldman slush fund is short by 260 billion won.

453
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,290
Now that Woo Sang Ki is dead,

454
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,490
if this trend continues, it will be 60 billion won next month,

455
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,780
then another 90 billion the month after—

456
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,660
A third of the Goldman account belongs to the Triad of Macau.

457
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,040
And it's chairman election season over there.

458
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,690
The Goldman fund is seeing daily withdrawals of more than 1 billion each time.

459
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,700
Macau is starting to ask who is responsible for this.

460
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,320
This is an emergency, right?

461
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,550
Isn't that right?

462
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,040
Actually Director...

463
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,580
This is all because Do Won Bong, who used to manage the casino previously,

464
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,130
abducted Woo Sang Ki...

465
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,500
In order to take care of problems like that,

466
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,440
we put you in your position.

467
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,760
So that you'll prevent issues like that from happening.

468
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,330
That's why you are all positioned where you are now.

469
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,240
Since earlier, you keep insinuating

470
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,700
and placing us in the same league as these thugs.

471
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,820
Do you think prosecutors are a joke?

472
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,230
Of course not.

473
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,290
Prosecutor Yoon...

474
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,880
Hey.

475
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,500
You need to wise up.

476
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,910
All this is because you guys

477
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,460
usurped Do Won Bong and didn't do a good job of wrapping things up.

478
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,500
Wasn't it your wish to keep Do Won Bong alive?

479
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,610
What?

480
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,160
When Do Won Bong was put away in Seongju Prison,

481
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,640
you said if he sends out prisoners to put them to work,

482
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,390
there won't be criminals even if they kill people.

483
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,440
And if there was a problem, it would be easy to handle.

484
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,630
I'm saying, wasn't it you who said that?

485
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,990
Thanks to that, you were also

486
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,180
able to do a businessman cosplay without getting blood on your hands.

487
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,140
So...

488
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,640
in this situation,

489
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,630
what makes any of us different from each other.

490
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,810
You bastard...

491
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,420
You look very tired.

492
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,560
No, I'm fine.

493
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,390
Come and sit.

494
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,800
Come. Come.

495
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,780
Black or white cat.

496
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,800
As long as it can catch a mouse.

497
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,210
When you go to Incheon,

498
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,020
you'll find a casino called Goldman.

499
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,090
I was managing it before.

500
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:15,750
But I was forced to hand it over to some gangsters.

501
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,470
And now... I'm planning to get it back.

502
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,370
What do you need me to do first?

503
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,460
Go play some games.

504
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,570
Go where I tell you to go.

505
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,330
If I tell you to win, you win.

506
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,130
And lose when I tell you to.

507
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,760
Yes, Sir.

508
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,230
What's the game he's referring to?

509
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,890
A game you need to win if he tells you to.

510
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,350
And a game you need to lose if he tells you to.

511
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,470
Aren't we on the same side now?

512
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,550
Aren't you going to meet the guys from the first league before you go?

513
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,940
No, I'm not.

514
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,160
While you're doing all this,

515
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,370
they are most likely still playing the same games.

516
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,520
You are more cold-hearted than you look.

517
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,950
- Aigoo. It's been a long time. 
 - Welcome.

518
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,570
Water, please.

519
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,080
Diabetes?

520
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,710
How about you?

521
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,590
Not yet?

522
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,600
The last time I had a health checkup was...

523
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,650
over ten years ago.

524
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,150
You're going to croak if you keep that up.

525
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,340
Thank you.

526
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,410
What are you looking for?

527
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,170
Everything.

528
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,750
How many players are there?

529
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,930
Now...

530
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,610
six former prisoners?

531
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,760
Then all of them plus

532
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,840
three fixed cards plus

533
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,790
three to five fixed phones plus

534
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,350
one vehicle set up with communication interception equipment.

535
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,070
You have to tell me if the target is a government agency.

536
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,400
Our guys are all criminals.

537
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,790
If they're to attack their original gangs, I have to pull them out.

538
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,990
It's the Central Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

539
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,610
One person running a private foundation and...

540
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,540
and one ex-convict

541
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,520
On the condition of working for more than two months and that other thing we discussed.

542
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,660
Including wages and rental fees, the total is

543
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,880
500 million.

544
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,500
The payment in bearer bonds.

545
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,710
Hey...

546
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,240
Do you even have money?

547
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,920
I took out a mortgage loan against my house.

548
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:25,160
Aigoo, you're nuts, trying to get yourself killed.

549
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,990
They say if you put your life on the line,

550
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,360
you'll live.

551
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,150
Crazy.

552
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,780
Yes.

553
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,330
That I did a good job.

554
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,250
He's telling me to enter a game now. It looks like it's about to start.

555
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,750
Did you arrive, CEO?

556
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,860
I arrived early and have been waiting here.

557
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,340
I'll be there shortly. Please wait just a little longer.

558
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,910
 Who do I have to kill? 

559
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,680
 Woo Sang Ki. 

560
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,520
 The father of the kid you've been searching for. 

561
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,280
   

562
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,610
 Min Ho, call me. 

563
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,190
 CEO. 

564
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,270
 We need to secure Woo Sang Ki. 

565
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,250
 Here's that thing you wanted. 

566
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,220
 - Thank you. 
 - And... 

567
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,750
 that other thing is also ready. 

568
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,670
 Find me a corpse that can't be identified. 

569
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,890
 Please save me. 

570
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,240
 Please! Let me go! Please! 

571
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,440
 Please let me live! 

572
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,710
 Woo Sang Ki, listen to me very carefully. 

573
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,190
 Run for five minutes toward that direction. 

574
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,900
 You'll find a car there. Get inside the car. 

575
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,510
 Who are you? 

576
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,200
 Min Ho... 

577
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,930
 I was there that day. 

578
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,920
 What had happened to Min Ho... Min Ho... 

579
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,420
 If you want to find out what happened to Min Ho, 

580
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,070
 you need to do as I say. 

581
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,160
 Please. 

582
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,170
   

583
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,500
If it weren't for me,

584
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,280
Min Ho...

585
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,540
would still be alive.

586
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,980
Just...

587
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,050
What happened?

588
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,370
 What happened? 

589
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,850
 It's safe here, right? 

590
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,200
 As long you are not followed. 

591
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,390
Did you find a solution?

592
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,790
 I come and go without being noticed, 

593
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,960
 so feel at ease here. 

594
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,030
 This is your... 

595
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,140
 A lot, isn't it? 

596
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,300
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

597
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,260
And Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

598
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,510
Both of them at the same time.

599
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,640
Woo Sang Ki.

600
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,620
The day you escaped from the kidnappers...

601
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,390
 Do you remember the date? 

602
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,980
 That was... 

603
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,560
 June 9th. 

604
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,510
When were you aware of the wiretapping?

605
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,950
You tracked my location. What would stop you from wiretapping me?

606
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,800
   

607
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,920
   

608
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,000
   

609
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,550
   

610
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,410
Woo Sang Ki escaped from Jang Seon Oh on June 9th.

611
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,800
I went to pick you up after Chairman Do Won Bong gave me the address the day after.

612
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,230
That day, Chairman Do intended to kill you and me both.

613
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,030
He wanted to kill us both.

614
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,270
 When was this taken? 

615
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,230
 This was... 

616
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,150
 Aside from this, I don't have any other piece of humanity left. 

617
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,330
 I took all the unpleasant memories and burned it. 

618
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,640
 And here I am now. 

619
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,950
Why does Chairman Do want you dead?

620
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,720
Attorney Koo.

621
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,810
If we want to live through this,

622
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,600
how about we combine our efforts?

623
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,170
   

624
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,810
Did you prepare the corpse to burn as a substitute?

625
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,230
Yes.

626
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,410
Then you can take that car and go down.

627
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,920
Don't take the watch off.

628
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,760
Attorney...

629
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,050
There has to be a source to edit it.

630
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,570
♫  You got me wrong  ♫

631
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,840
   

632
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:19,680
♫  Wrong, who is driving the wheel of fate? 

633
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,440
♫  I cannot stop even though my entire body will breaks  ♫

634
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:34,810
♫  Wrong, we will now break you down  ♫

635
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,800
 Attorney Koo might not work under Chairman Do. 

636
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
 If Sinseon-dong is using him to monitor Chairman Do... 

637
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,670
 They say you can die from having too much on your mind. 

638
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,030
 Bring me the Goldman slush fund. 

639
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:48,270
 Don't think that I had deceived you. 

640
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,540
 You just have to do your job. 

641
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,300
 You'll regret it if you let an important person get away like this. 

642
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,590
 Why is Prosecutor Yoon so anxious to kill Kim Yo Han? 

643
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,250
 Don't go up against the prosecutors. 

644
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,750
 How about working with me? 

645
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:01,700
 Are you senile? 

646
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,080
 They used at least six people. 

647
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,370
 That means he wants you dead. 

648
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,650
 No one will blame you even if you quit now. 

649
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,460
 Right? People just don't change. 

650
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,780
   

651
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,510
 Hey kid, what's wrong? 

652
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,490
 524-5474. 

653
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,430
 Please help me find my mom. 

654
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:18,970
