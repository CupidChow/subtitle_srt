1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,960
   

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,940
   

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,440
   

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,990
   

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:23,010


6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,050
   

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,420
The Buddhist Goddess of Mercy...

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,090
- Then river! 
 - Hold!

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,660
As for the river, I'll open it.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,210
Okay, monk.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,100
I don't see it... no side...

12
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,330
No side! It's an ace!

13
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,380
Oh, yes!

14
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,930
   

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,780
   

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,080
Yangbang is the winner!

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,960
   

18
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,980
1648, come out.

19
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,800
1648!

20
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,640
 Yangbang is the winner! 

21
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,780
 Why did Jang Seon Oh help me? 

22
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,370
I met Jang Seon Oh yesterday.

23
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,630
Good work.

24
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,940
You need to pick up your medicine today, right?

25
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,850
Yes.

26
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,520
   

27
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,170
 - How about a drink after?  
 - Sure, sounds good.

28
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,920
 It's the best for us. 

29
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,030
 Emotion... What is emotion? 

30
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,780
 It's a phenomenon in which a feeling occurs towards another. 

31
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,530
 For something that's more light in nature, you call it a feeling. 

32
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,860
 To put it simply, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. 

33
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,520
 Well... 

34
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,120
Welcome.

35
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,150
Why did you help me?

36
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,500
Must there be a reason for helping out a man in need?

37
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,650
Why? Does it hurt your pride?

38
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,540
Isn't having an ego a luxury for you right now?

39
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,680
Then at the repair shop, why...

40
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,670
It's kind of my own personality test.

41
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,780
If you look, it's always the ones who don't bathe who put on cologne

42
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,070
and ones with skin problems who always wash their faces.

43
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,100
Finding one you can trust is a priority in the world of scams.

44
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,340
- That guy earlier, too? 
 - 5464?

45
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,950
He's a professor in the theatre and film department.

46
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,550
A former child actor.

47
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,560
It was all an act.

48
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,120
We wrote the script, and we rehearsed to make things go right.

49
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,250
So from solitary confinement...

50
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,160
Why me?

51
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,930
You are smart and gutsy.

52
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,300
When I get out of here...

53
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll take over the gambling scene in Korea.

54
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,070
The gambling scene. The entire scene.

55
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,300
Not just a gambling den, like the one you destroyed before coming in here.

56
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,980
The one who collects taxes from all the dens in the country.

57
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,570
I'll become the top in this arena in the country.

58
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,020
That's bigger than passing the bar exam.

59
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,090
Once I reach the top of the gambling world in our country, the judges and prosecutors in Korea?

60
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,090
They'll all be in my pocket.

61
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,580
But since the scale is so massive, it's a little tough for me to do it alone.

62
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,820
So I'm gathering all the talented people in here.

63
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,830
If you're interested in playing in the higher league, come on up.

64
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,860
You can make money and learn the skills too.

65
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,850
I'm giving you a chance to enjoy wealth and glory by my side.

66
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,220
You are not a Judicial Institute trainee anymore.

67
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,750
You're a criminal.

68
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,590
When you get out of here, the reality will wash over you like a wave.

69
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,730
No one will want to get involved with you.

70
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,730
For me, nothing's different from when I came in here,

71
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,380
but you'll be treated like a bug because you have a criminal record.

72
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,660
Guys like us have to take control of our own future.

73
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,520
Geez! Is it a go or stop?

74
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
2345 confirmed.

75
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,690
Geez...

76
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,030
   
 (T/N: Excessive sweating) 

77
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,170
Hyung!

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,690
You're here.

79
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,390
How is the room? Do you like it?

80
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,580
This isn't free.

81
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,520
You have to earn it, Hyung.

82
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,470
Since we are on the subject of money...

83
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,890
I heard you split all your shares to get here.

84
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,430
Sixty percent to the security manager and 40% to our professor.

85
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,250
All right. Listen up.

86
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,030
For any profit from first league, 60% goes to the Warden.

87
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,620
The rest, the 40%, is for us.

88
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,040
But I will do the math. I do that.

89
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,120
In other words, no one knows how much you make besides me.

90
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,430
You get what I mean, right?

91
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,430
Yes.

92
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,770
So you go to the security manager to give his share first.

93
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,180
And tell him this is the 60% you promised him before.

94
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,480
And the share you promised the professor...

95
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
You don't have to give it to him.

96
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,670
What? But...

97
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,860
I told you I told him to do everything.

98
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,600
You don't have to honor it. Keep the rest for yourself.

99
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,210
- Answer me! 
 - Thank you.

100
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,720
Okay.

101
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,780
The movie is about to start.

102
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,510
Okay, we'll be right there.

103
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,440
Oh, and...

104
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,770
I said we'll be there.

105
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,000
And I got a move-in present for you.

106
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,590
This is Lee Tae Gwang, the one you've been desperately searching for.

107
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,360
 But do you know Lee Tae Gwang? 

108
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,940
 That Lee Tae Gwang was swallowed up by this freak who came in later. 

109
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,550
 No one knows where Lee Tae Gwang is right now. 

110
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,870
 The freak is? 

111
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,730
 The freak is Jang Seon Oh, you met yesterday. 

112
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,890
Why is he like this?

113
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,000
They said someone put something in his food.

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,970
Was it Clorox or detergent?

115
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,900
Anyway, after he ate a bowlful of it,

116
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,290
he became a completely different person.

117
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,800
But Mr. Lee...

118
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,140
Why were you so desperately looking for Lee Tae Gwang?

119
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,920
 There is this guy, Lee Tae Gwang. He brought a video of Chairman Yang gambling and 

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,200
 offered us a deal to get him out as well. 

121
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,190
 Since you got started, why don't you take one more step? 

122
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,900
 You, me, and your grandma. 

123
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,810
 For the three of us to stay alive, 

124
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,210
 we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly. 

125
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,950
 It's not what you think. 

126
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,240
 There was a brief setback in the operation. 

127
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,430
I asked why you were looking for him so badly.

128
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,520
Is that a hard question?

129
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,130
He...

130
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,440
He...

131
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,560
This bastard owes me some money.

132
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,410
With that, I can pay off some of my gambling loans too.

133
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,220
I see...

134
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,940
Is that right?

135
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,220
Is that it?

136
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
Yes.

137
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,560
There should be an IOU back at home.

138
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,310
Should I get someone to bring it in?

139
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,500
No, no.

140
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,710
No need for that.

141
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,150
Then by chance,

142
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,610
can I see his belongings?

143
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,040
Just in case there is something worth money.

144
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,010
He's a gambler. What belongings?

145
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,040
Really, not even a penny...

146
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,590
Wait, no...

147
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,110
Well...

148
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,190
I think there was a little cash and a USB?

149
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,410
If he had the skill to make money gambling, he wouldn't even be in here to begin with.

150
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,030
Right?

151
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,650
Look at the time...

152
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,050
Sh*t! The movie is starting.

153
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,500
Okay, are you satisfied with the present?

154
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,200
- Yes. 
 - Okay!

155
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,080
   

156
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,690
   

157
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,180
 That's what I'm saying. 

158
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,680
 I really can't talk to you. 

159
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,910
 Right? 

160
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,440
 Just treat you casually? 

161
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,830
 Can I see his belongings? 

162
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,690
 I think there was a little cash and a USB? 

163
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,820
 So you took my things and ran. 

164
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,060
 Just say you don't remember! 

165
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,820
A prison guard is looking for you.

166
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,910
They say that spring comes even to hell.

167
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,880
It must be the start of spring today.

168
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,990
Please go on.

169
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,110
I wanted to call you and Jang Seon Oh out

170
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,320
and talk to you both about taking you away without my permission.

171
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,540
I did some calculating this morning

172
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,120
and learned that you owe 800 million won.

173
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,270
If I said one stab with this is worth 800 million won,

174
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,140
isn't that a good deal for you?

175
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,580
Right?

176
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,190
 What are you sorry about, man? 

177
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,860
 Why do you think Father was so devoted to me? 

178
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,620
 I'm the oldest son of the family. 

179
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,770
 I didn't want to come here, either! 

180
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,970
Stop hiding, and come on out!

181
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,260
I have to get back and see the ending.

182
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,220
Man, this old man...

183
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,590
He should send a memo if he has something to say.

184
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,690
I can't adequately express my feelings in a memo.

185
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,360
I think I know how you feel,

186
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,170
but a memo would've been enough so put away the knife.

187
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,190
You don't know one-millionth of how I feel right now.

188
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,050
Hyung, you should run away.

189
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,350
Strike him.

190
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
Wasn't it your plan to get rid of the Dean and then me? 
  (T/N: Dean - Seon Oh's nickname) 

191
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
How did you know?

192
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,560
Hey!

193
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,860
What the—

194
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,740
2345, help him clean up.

195
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,400
Oh, man. They need to suffer.

196
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,310
   

197
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,720
   

198
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,590
   

199
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,490
 If it's really my life on the line, 

200
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,260
 I'll give you whatever you want. 100 million won. 

201
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,700
   

202
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,950
 If I croak, you get nothing. 

203
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,260
 There is no time. What is it? 

204
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,050
   

205
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,330
   

206
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,850
He electrocuted him in the car repair shop.

207
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,570
You're saying... he electrocuted Jang Seon Oh?

208
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,220
 I went to look for him in his solitary cell. 

209
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,800
 Actually, he was just coming out of the room. 

210
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,970
 I wasn't in any more danger, thanks to you. 

211
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,440
 Jang Seon Oh was directing the dealer and let 2345 win. 

212
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,260
 Do they seem close? 

213
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,460
 Yes, they seemed close. 

214
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,570
 So you are saying the room chief is planning to kill me? 

215
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,000
 Gil Sang, make sure you clean up the dishes thoroughly after the party. 
 (T/N: party: Killing Jang Seon Oh and Kim Yo Han) 

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Are you referring to Kim Yo Han?

217
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,170
 Everything, including the spoons we used. 
 (T/N: spoons = weapons) 

218
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,750
You moron! How could you?!

219
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,680
You mutt.

220
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,320
D*mn it...

221
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,700
They should be here already.

222
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,950
How dare you walk around by yourselves!

223
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,970
We'll end this quickly, Hyungnim.

224
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,340
All right.

225
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,510
Let's finish them up quickly!

226
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,580
Let's go!

227
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,890
You f***er!

228
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,190
Ta-da!

229
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,700
You f***er!

230
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,080
How dare you boss me around!

231
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm Song Doo Cheol of the Bukyeongpa gang, you f***er!

232
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,780
You're all dead now.

233
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,130
You, gambling bastard, shut the f*ck up!

234
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,570
Do you know why I've been only playing with cards?

235
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,830
F***er...

236
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,930
Die, you motherf***er!

237
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,900
 Ninety. I'll give you 90% of my earnings. 

238
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,210
Hidden made. 
  (T/N: The last hidden card that makes a complete hand in 7-Card Stud Poker) 

239
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,890
 Come on! Let's go! 

240
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
You a**hole!

241
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,090
You're all dead!

242
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,700
Got it!

243
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,930
Let's do the pendulum tonight.

244
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,930
Yes, Sir.

245
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,330
Stay still.

246
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,520
Dean!

247
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,790
Hey, Yangbang!

248
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,980
Tell him what you told me.

249
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,200
 I told you I told him to do everything.
 

250
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,760
 You don't have to honor it. 

251
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,120
 Keep the rest for yourself. 

252
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,470
Later... if you keep it in neutral gear,

253
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,310
I'll give you 50% of my earnings.

254
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,620
 If you keep it in neutral gear later, 

255
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,000
 I'll give you 50% of my earnings. 

256
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,040
Seong Bum!

257
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,120
Seong bum...

258
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,290
Fifty for me and 50% for Instructor Park.

259
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,170
Isn't that too much?

260
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,630
Seong Bum...

261
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,650
You should have at least 10% of that for your conscience.

262
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,900
If you are going to kill him, make sure you have a good story to back it up.

263
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,000
Seong Bum! Security Manager! It's a misunderstanding!

264
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,610
I didn't say anything to Instructor Park!

265
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,840
You, f***ing bastard!

266
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,220
You f***, I recorded you saying you'll give me 50% on my cell phone!

267
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,890
No, why would you do that, Instructor Park...

268
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,540
Wait, it's all a misunderstanding!

269
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,380
Instructor Park!

270
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,680
You moron, I told you you needed to watch your mouth.

271
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,710
I'll say the three died in a fire while working here. An accidental death.

272
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,770
He stumbled on the roof while trying to escape and died instantly on the spot.

273
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,900
Look at his cheeks trembling.

274
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,490
Starved to death in prison from anorexia induced by andropause depression.

275
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,400
How long would it take to kill him by starvation?

276
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,690
A long time, I bet.

277
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,700
Yes, this is Jang Seon Oh.

278
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,370
Oh, Warden...

279
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,270
I can do it. I'll make sure word doesn't spread.

280
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,390
You know that well—

281
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
Okay.

282
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,710
Sinseon-dong is telling me not to go any further with this.

283
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,110
They never said anything before. Why meddle now?

284
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,820
Sinseon-dong. What is that?

285
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,860
Those in the annex building.

286
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,220
Are they Beomtul? 
  (T/N: Beomtul: Literally means tiger fur, but it means felons with ample detention money in prison) 

287
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,490
Tigers...

288
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,010
They are pythons.

289
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,920
One thousand-year-old snakes.

290
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,760
 They are crouched down in the mud right now, 

291
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,940
 but given a chance to have dragon balls, 

292
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,390
 they'll transform into dragons and ascend into the sky. 

293
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,800
Even the scale of their trouble-making is different.

294
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,250
They didn't make general news like us.

295
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,620
They made top news in political and economic news pages.

296
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,560
You may even recognize some of them.

297
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,250
Hey! Bring down the pendulums! 
  (T/N: Pendulums: referring to the prisoners hanging upside down) 

298
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,140
- And unplug the tree outlets too. 
  - Yes, Sir! 

299
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,640
Did you take care of yesterday's commotion? 
    

300
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,940
Yes.

301
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,670
Is Jang Seon Oh staying quiet?

302
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,020
Yes.

303
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,230
Where is Song Doo Cheol now?

304
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,940
He went into solitary confinement.

305
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,470
 The same room that Jang Seon Oh was in before. 

306
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,670
   

307
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
The dean is coming!

308
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,980
 Our Father who art in heaven, 

309
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,140
 hallowed be thy name... 

310
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,490
 Thy kingdom come... 

311
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,250
One gangster, two gangsters...

312
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,440
one prosecutor, two prosecutors...

313
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,850
Six percent of the bank account is full, flop and 36 families of victims.

314
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,920
Corruption Investigation Agency, Tokarev.

315
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,720
Turn and Seongju Prison and river, river, river...

316
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,420
As long as I get the river, the small blind will die.

317
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,730
And they'll fall asleep...

318
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,100
I brought something better than a file.

319
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,670
Hello, I am Inspector Park Ro Sa from the Inspector General Office Headquarters.

320
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,660
The Shin Dal Soo case. I've been digging into the case as well.

321
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,920
After that mess, you don't even have an injury.

322
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,020
Do you know how to fight, Yo Han?

323
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,950
- No. 
 - Are you just lucky then?

324
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,360
You can never catch up to the lucky guy.

325
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,340
Are you keeping an eye on me?

326
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,710
Well, let's just say I have good intelligence capabilities.

327
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,400
What is it that you want?

328
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,310
   

329
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,780
Unofficially, another police officer...

330
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,410
 Hello, I am Inspector Park Ro Sa from the Inspector General Office Headquarters. 

331
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,950
has suggested this could be a murder case.

332
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,070
 The preliminary report has ruled this as a suicide.
  

333
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,280
 But If you look at it from a slightly different point of view, you could suspect murder. 

334
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,190
 If you look here, it says that the direct cause of death was a severe head injury due to a fall. 

335
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,170
 However, there was a comminuted fracture to the face, according to the autopsy record. 

336
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,550
 The bruises on the back of the head were covered by her hair. 

337
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,020
 If you look closely here, you can see polyester fibers on Shin Dal Soo's clothes. 

338
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:04,040
 The autopsy also found similar fibers in Shin Dal Soo's nose and mouth. 

339
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,930
And Inspector Kwon, who was in charge of your grandmother's case. 
    

340
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,750
 I'm Inspector Kwon from Seoul Yongmoon Police Station, Criminal Affairs Division. 

341
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,960
As soon as the case was closed, he took sick leave.

342
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,020
 Inspector Kwon? 

343
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,940
 When I checked, it turned out to be a lie. 

344
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,230
That detective killed himself.

345
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,860
Do you still think there's nothing I can help you with?

346
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:39,730
Why are you going this far to help me out?

347
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,460
Revenge.

348
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,390
There's one person I want to shred to pieces to relieve my anger.

349
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,130
You might say I'm missing the final piece to a puzzle.

350
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,150
Are you asking me to be your assassin?

351
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,150
No.

352
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,010
I need you to be my dagger.

353
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,700
Don't worry. I'll do the stabbing.

354
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,790
I've planned this for 20 years.

355
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,830
For 20 years,

356
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,240
I searched for an opportunity, looking around,

357
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,420
pulling together people...

358
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,090
Doing whatever to increase the odds of success.

359
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,460
That's how I've been living.

360
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,950
The probability of my failure is arguably

361
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,360
lower than that of your revenge on your own.

362
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,050
So?

363
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,350
Who do you plan to stab, Oh Soo Yeon?

364
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,200
Yoon Byung Wook.

365
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,280
The chief prosecutor of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

366
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,170
In order to get Yoon Byung Wook,

367
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,280
I was also chasing Chairman Yang Jun.

368
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,310
Why?

369
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,500
When I was 16...

370
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,270
That bastard had killed me once.

371
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,350
For the past 20 years, I lacked the power to get Yoon Byung Wook,

372
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,520
but I can at least capture the culprit for your grandmother's death.

373
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,250
I have a plan.

374
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,340
I'll capture the culprit first.

375
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,150
I'm sure of it.

376
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,500
Yoon Byung Wook is involved in this case too.

377
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,020
You've got nothing to lose with a deal like this. Isn't that right?

378
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,970
Join me. I'll carry you.

379
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,040
No matter how exceptional you are, you are still here.

380
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,720
If you join me,

381
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,760
I'll carry you and run with it.

382
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,170
The culprit who killed your grandmother,

383
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,960
and whoever is behind it.

384
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,020
In order to catch him, I'll go all-in for you. My past 20 years.

385
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,990
Do you need time to think?

386
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,820
What do I need to do first?

387
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,770
Seoungju prison.

388
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,490
Take it over.

389
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,960
You need to be strong.

390
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,830
As long as you stand your ground like that,
   

391
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,910
the culprit who killed your grandmother...

392
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,330
I'll catch him and bring him to you.

393
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
What? Is it so so?

394
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,050
No.

395
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,060
It's good.

396
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,500
We make our food separately.

397
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,650
Where was it?

398
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,390
This guy used to run a restaurant in Seohwa-dong and came here for beating up a drunk.

399
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,760
Wow, his cooking skills are really top-notch.

400
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,720
Get plenty to eat. Lessons will start today.

401
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,570
Lessons?

402
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,190
- This is... 
 - Hyung.

403
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,290
You know it's over if you turn your back on them when guys gang up on you, right?

404
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,820
Here.

405
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,810
Go.

406
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,710
He wants to learn to fight so please help him out.

407
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,240
What?

408
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,720
Hold on... wait... Dean! Dean!

409
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,580
Guard, guard! Guard!

410
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,420
Hey, there!

411
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,960
Did you want to learn to fight?

412
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,130
Well, here are your teachers.

413
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,780
Come now!

414
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,740
Listen to Buddha!

415
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,030
Please step on him very carefully, instructors!

416
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,570
That's it. A good kick to the head. Right on!

417
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,410
Wait, wait.

418
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,300
What is it?

419
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,640
Carp.

420
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,420
Some guys brought it in after working out in the rural areas.

421
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,810
Bottoms up.

422
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,200
Take this.

423
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,610
They say if you want to be reborn, you have to die first.

424
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,990
Who said that?

425
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,660
Go to the second period and ask yourself.

426
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,380
What?

427
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:24,390
   

428
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,780
Where did he go?

429
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,510
Mr. Nam!

430
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,680
This is Nam Dae Moon. Mr. Nam. 
  (T/N: Namdaemun: Sounds like the Great South Gate) 

431
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,950
A corporate crime. An elite like you, Hyung.

432
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,700
He used to work for a securities firm until he got addicted to gambling.

433
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
He was caught embezzling company funds and received...

434
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,900
- How many years? 
 - I got four years.

435
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,120
Wow. He only got four years for stealing 10 billion won.

436
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,530
Hey, Mr. Nam is going to teach you how to scam from now on.

437
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,790
Is he also in the first league?

438
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,660
He's our number two. Number two.

439
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,400
Hold the cards.

440
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,070
You do speak.

441
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:00,530
You still don't get what I'm saying, right?

442
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,160
Don't you know how to hold the cards?

443
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,310
What do you mean?

444
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,110
I asked you if you knew how to hold the cards in your hand.

445
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,330
Flip them.

446
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,770
Don't you know how to do stuff like this?

447
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,170
Take a break.

448
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,050
Aren't you going to clean the floor?

449
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,790
I'm only doing it because the dean told me to.

450
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,040
And here in the first league,

451
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,800
if the dean tells you to show it, you show it. If he tells you to die, then you die.

452
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,640
That visitor who comes to see you...

453
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,060
That VIP, I mean.

454
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,590
Is she your girlfriend?

455
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,560
Or family?

456
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,800
Let's eat!

457
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,750
How was the second period?

458
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,270
He's not it.

459
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,860
What?

460
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:27,870
It took me more than a day to hold the cards in my hand, too!

461
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,440
Let's eat. We have to get to third period.

462
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,500
Th-Third period? What's that?

463
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,350
Field training.

464
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,920
 Every Friday, they have a gambling hall in the Warden's office. 

465
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,510
What are you doing?

466
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,090
Hey, lift this.

467
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,770
- Lift it together. 
 - Geez...

468
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,200
One, two, three!

469
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,100
 Six players to a table. 

470
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,190
 They collect a fee of 100,000 won per person per hour. 

471
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,330
 To keep the games tight, the players are Nam Dae Moon, 

472
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,120
 the warden... 

473
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,220
Two hundred.

474
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,880
Two hundred...

475
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,760
 and me. The three of us. 

476
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,580
Thank you.

477
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,180
Wishing you good luck.

478
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,890
 And including you, Hyung, the rest are servers. 

479
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
 Big pot! 

480
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,540
 On a given night, the tips alone are several millions won. 

481
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,360
 Add to that, a percentage of each person's winnings. 

482
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,540
Did you add salt, Sweetie?

483
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,330
Yes, two pinches.

484
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,270
Where is your pocket?

485
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,090
Here it is.

486
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:53,930
- Thank you, Sweetie. 
 - Wishing you good luck.

487
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,980
 That alone can add up to a sizable gain. 

488
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,830
However, the real money is in the loan.

489
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,410
Come on.

490
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,380
IOU, and more IOUs.

491
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,120
Forfeiture declarations of real estate, body parts...

492
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,100
Hyung, you are no longer running away because of your debt, but

493
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,020
one who gives out loans.

494
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,620
 This is how I collected what I needed. 

495
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,180
You have to work hard.

496
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,430
If you do this well, you can do everything, including taking revenge.

497
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,160
What are you doing right now?

498
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,400
What?

499
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,210
I mean...

500
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,580
Are you showing him everything?

501
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,320
So what?

502
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,290
This is all my money.

503
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,230
Everyone is very concerned.

504
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,730
I've been busy.

505
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,900
Do you know who did that?

506
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,340
There wasn't even a fingerprint.

507
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,460
Even the karaoke employee was threatened to keep her quiet

508
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,660
so she claims to know nothing.

509
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,550
Still, we have a cop on our side.

510
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,700
You went through a lot.

511
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,580
Is this for real?

512
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,680
They don't see any signs of fabrication.

513
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,540
Yo Han.

514
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,920
 Even if something goes wrong, 

515
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,270
 do you think we'd ignore you? 

516
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,200
 I'll protect your grandmother. 

517
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,410
 I'll protect your grandmother. 

518
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,090
I thought...

519
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:46,710
that Lee Tae Gwang's video would be a lifeline for me.

520
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,410
 For the three of us to stay alive, 

521
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,790
 we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly. 

522
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,870
I thought that once I found Lee Tae Gwang's video,

523
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,850
I would find my grandmother's culprit and recover my life.

524
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,780
Because...

525
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,580
Because...

526
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,590
if that's the card I hold,

527
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:09,790
Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung would reinvestigate.

528
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,160
Investigate?

529
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,260
2345, you have a visitor.

530
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:31,780
   

531
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:40,820
By now, I'm sure any evidence that I was following orders for an undercover investigation

532
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,440
has been deleted and can't be found in Sajik-dong.
  (T/N: Sajik-dong - Area where major government institutions are located in the heart of Seoul) 

533
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,850
A person's life is at stake.

534
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,760
How can they so easily...

535
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,100
Because it's a matter of survival.

536
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,930
I can't blame someone for wanting to survive by using camouflage.

537
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,960
But this...

538
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,950
But this is...

539
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,330
Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung.

540
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,060
There is a talk of him being promoted to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

541
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,030
Public Security Division from the Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

542
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,780
Ms. Oh Soo Yeon.

543
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,440
Yes?

544
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,880
Inspector Kwon Dae Il could have been chased just like you.

545
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,350
Could you find out if Inspector Kwon Dae Il sought out help from others before he died?

546
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,910
What about Mok Jin Hyung? What should I do about him?

547
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,580
I'll confirm it myself.

548
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,410
Yo Han...

549
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:10,390
So where is Lee Tae Gwang's video?

550
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,560
Before I tell you, please reinstate me.

551
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,540
Of course, man.

552
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,490
That's that.

553
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,360
Where is the video?

554
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,910
Can't I get reinstated?

555
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,550
Your investigation plan documents are safely in Sajik-dong.

556
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,840
Is something the matter with you?

557
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,000
 When people lie, there are certain habits people display. 

558
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,150
 It's a physical reaction that shows up, like locking and loading right before lying. 

559
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,320
 But with you, that comes out of your hand. 

560
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,210
 He's lying. 

561
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,190
I heard you're moving up to Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

562
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,960
What was the cost?

563
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,380
Was it erasing me out of the system?

564
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,280
What are you talking about, man?

565
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,620
December 8th, 15:20. On the northern end of Paldang Bridge.

566
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,260
The video of you abandoning my grandmother's body.

567
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,290
I saw it all.

568
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,390
Where did you see it?

569
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,020
Well?

570
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,240
Where did you see it, man?

571
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,770
Did you kill my grandmother, Chief Prosecutor?

572
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,790
Are you crazy?

573
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,710
Hong Jae Sun caught on that I approached him for an investigation

574
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,450
and went to my grandmother to reveal everything about this investigation.

575
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,390
And my grandmother went to see you to ask questions.

576
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,030
You used her grandson and abandoned him. She demanded that you put everything back,

577
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,670
but you knew that was impossible because you'd already deleted me from the Sajik-dong's servers.

578
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,530
And...

579
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:58,350
because you've been lying to me all this time to avoid taking responsibility.

580
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,680
Is that why you argued with my grandmother?

581
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,290
Is that why you killed her?

582
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:07,610
- Hey, Kim Yo Han. 
 - Then...

583
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,080
was it Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook?

584
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,430
Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook ordered someone to kill Director Noh Young Gook

585
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,590
and my grandmother

586
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,360
because I was looking for Lee Tae Gwang's video?

587
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,650
And the person who Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook hired to kill...

588
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,760
Was it you, Chief?

589
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,360
For that, he offered you the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

590
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,140
Boy, don't you dare cross the line.

591
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:55,060
Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here?

592
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,670
Guard!

593
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,980


594
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:19,710
♫  The night is becoming darker  ♫

595
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,940
   

596
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:28,160
♫  Did I lose myself, I will not stoop so low  ♫

597
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:35,340
♫  Who was the justice for?  ♫

598
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:40,280
♫  There was no one, not anywhere  ♫

599
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,010
♫  Nowhere like heaven  ♫

600
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,250
♫  Nowhere, nowhere  ♫

601
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,240
♫  Couldn't you swallow it?  ♫

602
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,980
♫  Nowhere, nowhere  ♫

603

♫  Look carefully  ♫

604
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,410
 This is no place for you. 

605
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,070
 I came in showing all of my cards. 

606
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,430
 Why do you hate me so much? 

607
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,410
 There should be a ledger. 

608
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,480
 Nam Dae Moon's slush fund ledger! 

609
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,890
 Find out where that ledger is. 

610
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,100
 Him and you! 

611
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,470
 I didn't give up on either one of you, man! 

612
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:25,600
 Inspector Kwon was hiding something else besides a camera. 

613
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,500
 Don't worry. 

614
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,000
 I won't kill you in here. For now. 

615
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,380
 Chairman Yang will be here personally. 

616
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,730
 He wants you to bring him also. 

617
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:37,970
 Is he the bastard? 

618
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,810
 It's not what you think. 

619
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:44,390
 The blade should face up so you won't hurt your hands. 

620
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,500
 I found the video. 

621
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,080
♫  Nowhere  ♫

622
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,350
♫  Couldn't you swallow it?  ♫
