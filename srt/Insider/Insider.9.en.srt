It's...

328
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,098

You even give me a time limit?

If you can't do it in that time, you couldn't do it even if you had a year.

I think we can use Kim Yo Han for further tasks on the outside.

428
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:51,608
My promise to you doesn't change.

429
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:56,298
The fact that you secretly stole casino slush funds

430
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:58,978
in order to drive out the Yang brothers.

431
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:01,128
And for not reporting those facts to Sinseon-dong,

432
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:05,268
you promised to share all the profits later. Do you mean that promise?

433
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,678
Yes.

434
00:42:06,678 --> 00:42:09,178
What? Are you anxious?

435
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:16,798
That slush fund doesn't entirely belong to the Sinseon-dong's elders alone.

436
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:20,128
One-third of Goldman funds' account

437
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:21,808
is held by Sinseon-dong.

438
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:25,288
And another third by the outside elders of Sinseon-dong.

439
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:27,608
And the remaining third by Macau.

440
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:30,918
We may hide this from Sinseon-dong,

441

but the other Deep Pockets...

442

If you get caught...

443
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:42,698
That's why I said release Kim Yo Han to the outside.

444
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,558
So, if it turns out that

445
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:52,328
Do Won Bong can take over the Yang brothers...

446
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:54,148
Are we out then?

447
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:58,428
If we get cast aside,

448
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,738
I'll go after Annie first.

449
00:43:01,738 --> 00:43:06,808
I mean, the Yang brothers should take responsibility for Woo Sang Ki's death.

450
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:08,588
This is how I feel, Sunbae.

451
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:10,748
Yang Hwa, Yang Joon, or Annie...

452
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:12,338
We gave them the okay.

453
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,588
That's how they've been making a living until now.

454
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:17,638
How dare she tells us to come and go?

455
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:20,108
Byung Wook...

456
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:23,528
If you are going to change the line-up, wait until I'm retired.

457
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:27,878
I want to live out my old age as comfortable

458
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:29,938
and quiet as possible.

459
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,198
They're here.

460
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:07,738
I set the meeting here because I thought the casino would be uncomfortable for you two.

461
00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:09,538
Oh, yes. Thank you.

462
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:14,368
Due to the Corruption Investigation Agency, we do need to be cautious.

463
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,908
I understand you'll be promoted to the assistant prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

464
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,148
Congratulations on your promotion.

465
00:44:21,148 --> 00:44:22,668
Thank you.

466
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:28,988
So, when did you arrive in Seoul?

467
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:32,268
I came as soon as I heard of Woo Sang Ki's death.

468
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:35,018
I flew directly from Macau.

469
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:37,208
It's an emergency.

470
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,668
Am I the only one who thinks that?

471
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:51,598
Since Woo Sang Ki's disappearance until now,

472
00:44:51,598 --> 00:44:55,628
Goldman Casino was unable to launder 260 billion won.

473
00:44:55,628 --> 00:44:58,218
In other words, the Goldman slush fund

474
00:44:58,218 --> 00:45:00,858
is short by 260 billion won.

475
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:02,838
Now that Woo Sang Ki is dead,

476
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:05,038
if this trend continues, it will be 60 billion won next month,

477
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:06,328
then another 90 billion the month after-

478
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,308
A third of the Goldman account

479
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:10,268
belongs to the Triad of Macau.

480
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:12,588
And it's chairman election season over there.

481
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,538
Goldman fund is seeing daily withdrawals of more than 1 billion each time.

482
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:21,148
Macau is starting to ask for who is responsible for this.

483
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:22,668
This is an emergency...

484
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:24,718
right?

485
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:25,898
Isn't that right?

486
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:27,388
Actually Director...

487
00:45:27,388 --> 00:45:32,128
This is all because of Do Won Bong, who used to manage the casino previously,

488
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,678
abducted Woo Sang Ki...

489
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:35,948
To take care of problems like that,

490
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:38,988
we put you in your position.

491
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:42,308
So that you will prevent issues like that from becoming.

492
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:45,778
That's why you are all positioned where you are now.

493
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:53,988
Since earlier, you keep insinuating

494
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:57,648
and placing us in the same league as these thugs.

495
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,568
Do you think prosecutors are a joke?

496
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:03,678
Of course not.

497
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,438
Prosecutor Yoon...

498
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,428
Hey.

499
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:09,948
You need to wise up.

500
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:11,558
All this is because you guys

501
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,508
usurped Do Won Bong and didn't do a good job of wrapping things up.

502
00:46:16,748 --> 00:46:21,048
Wasn't it your wish to keep Do Won Bong alive?

503
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,058
What?

504
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:25,708
When Do Won Bong was put away in Seongju Prison,

505
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:29,188
you said if he sends out prisoners to put them to work,

506
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:31,938
there won't be criminals even if they kill people.

507
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:34,888
And if there was a problem, it would be easy to handle.

508
00:46:34,888 --> 00:46:39,078
I'm saying, wasn't it you who said that?

509
00:46:39,078 --> 00:46:40,538
Thanks to that, you were also

510
00:46:40,538 --> 00:46:42,728
able to do a businessman cosplay without getting blood on your hands.

511
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:44,988
So...

512
00:46:47,028 --> 00:46:48,988
in this situation,

513
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:51,678
what makes any of us different from each other.

514
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:55,158
You bastard...

515
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:06,368
You look very tired.

516
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:10,508
No, I'm fine.

517
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,938
Come and sit.

518
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:14,948
Come. Come.

519
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:24,328
Black or white cat.

520
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:27,148
As long as it can catch a mouse.

521
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,758
When you go to Incheon,

522
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:34,468
you'll find a casino called Goldman.

523
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:36,638
I was managing it before.

524
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:42,198
But I was forced to hand it over to some gangsters.

525
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:46,218
And now, I'm planning to get it back.

526
00:47:46,888 --> 00:47:49,018
What do you need me to do first?

527
00:47:49,018 --> 00:47:51,008
Go play some games.

528
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:53,118
Go where I tell you to go.

529
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:54,878
If I tell you to win, you win.

530
00:47:54,878 --> 00:47:57,078
And lose when I tell you to.

531
00:47:58,548 --> 00:47:59,908
Yes, sir.

532
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:11,578
What's the game he's referring to?

533
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,238
A game you need to win if he tells you to.

534
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,498
And a game you need to lose if he tells you to.

535
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:20,718
Aren't we on the same side now?

536
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:25,598
Aren't you going to meet the guys from the first league before you go?

537
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:28,788
No, I'm not.

538
00:48:29,928 --> 00:48:31,708
While you're doing all this,

539
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,418
they are most likely still playing the same games.

540
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:38,468
You are more cold-hearted than you look.

541
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:54,398
- Aigoo. It's been a long time.
- Welcome.

542
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,918
Water, please.

543
00:48:59,328 --> 00:49:00,528
Diabetes?

544
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,158
How about you?

545
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:04,838
Not yet?

546
00:49:07,538 --> 00:49:11,048
The last time I had a health checkup was

547
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:14,098
over 10 years ago.

548
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:16,298
You're going to croak if you keep that up.

549
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:17,688
Thank you.

550
00:49:18,718 --> 00:49:20,358
What are you looking for?

551
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,218
Everything.

552
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:28,698
How many players are there?

553
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:32,578
Now...

554
00:49:33,518 --> 00:49:36,058
six former prisoners?

555
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:39,208
Then all of them plus

556
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,288
three fixed cards plus

557
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:43,238
three to five fixed phones plus

558
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:46,398
one vehicle set up with communication interception equipment.

559
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:52,418
You have to tell me if the target is a government agency.

560
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:55,648
Our guys are all criminals.

561
00:49:56,888 --> 00:50:00,438
If they're to attack their original gangs, I have to pull them out.

562
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:02,138
It's the Central Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

563
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:05,958
One person running a private foundation and...

564
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:09,288
and one ex-convict

565
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:25,968
On the condition of working for more than two months and that other thing we discussed.

566
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:30,108
Including wages and rental fees, the total is

567
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:31,428
500 million.

568
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,548
The payment in bearer bonds.

569
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:37,758
Hey...

570
00:50:38,988 --> 00:50:40,988
Do you even have money?

571
00:50:41,808 --> 00:50:43,768
I took out a mortgage loan

572
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:45,128
against my house.

573
00:50:47,518 --> 00:50:51,408
Aigoo, you're nuts, trying to get yourself killed.

574
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:55,838
They say if you put your life on the line,

575
00:50:57,578 --> 00:50:59,508
you'll live.

576
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:07,198
Crazy...

577
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,328
Yes.

578
00:51:17,328 --> 00:51:18,878
That I did a good job.

579
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:22,698
He's telling me to enter a game now. It looks like it's about to start.

580
00:51:22,698 --> 00:51:24,298
Did you arrive, CEO?

581
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:28,408
I arrived early and have been waiting here.

582
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:31,588
I'll be there shortly. Please wait just a little longer.

583
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,438
<i>Who do I have to kill?</i>

584
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:18,208
<i>Woo Sang Ki.</i>

585
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:21,748
<i>The father of the kid you've been searching for.
</i>

586
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:26,708
[Min Ho, call me.]

587
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,838
<i>Min Ho, call me.</i>

588
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:44,718
CEO.

589
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:47,898
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

590
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,778
Here's that thing you wanted.

591
00:52:49,778 --> 00:52:52,148
- Thank you.
- And...

592
00:52:52,148 --> 00:52:55,278
that other thing is ready also.

593
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:57,298
Find me a corpse that can't be identified.

594
00:52:57,298 --> 00:52:58,418
Please save me.

595
00:52:58,418 --> 00:53:00,868
Please! Let me go! Please!

596
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:02,668
Please let me live!

597
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,338
Woo Sang Ki, listen to me very carefully.

598
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:15,818
Run for five minutes toward that direction.

599
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,528
You'll find a car there. Get inside the car.

600
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,138
Who are you?

601
00:53:21,138 --> 00:53:22,328
Min Ho...

602
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,758
I was there that day.

603
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,848
What had happened to Min Ho... Min Ho...

604
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,048
If you want to find out what happened to Min Ho,

605
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:34,098
you need to do as I say.

606
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,388
Please.

607
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:49,928
If it weren't for me,

608
00:53:49,928 --> 00:53:51,508
Min Ho...

609
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,868
will still be alive.

610
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,408
Just...

611
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:10,478
What happened?

612
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:22,698
<i>What happened?</i>

613
00:54:31,988 --> 00:54:34,478
<i>It's safe here, right?</i>

614
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:37,328
<i>As long you are not followed.</i>

615
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:40,418
Did you find a solution?

616
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:56,318
<i>I come and go without notice</i>

617
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:57,988
<i>so feel at ease here.</i>

618
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:02,658
<i>This is your...
</i>

619
00:55:02,658 --> 00:55:04,568
<i>A lot, isn't it?</i>

620
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:09,928
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

621
00:55:09,928 --> 00:55:11,888
And Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

622
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:13,538
Both of them at the same time.

623
00:55:25,638 --> 00:55:27,168
Woo Sang Ki.

624
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:31,248
The day you escaped from the kidnappers...

625
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,418
<i>Do you remember the date?</i>

626
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,208
<i>That was...</i>

627
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,888
June 9th.

628
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:55,138
When were you aware of the wiretapping?

629
00:55:55,138 --> 00:55:58,178
You track my location. What will stop you from wiretapping me?

630
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:17,228
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

631
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:21,548
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

632
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:25,628
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

633
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:28,988
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

634
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:40,938
Woo Sang Ki escaped from Jang Sun Oh on June 9th.

635
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:44,528
I went to pick you up after Chairman Do Won Bong gave me the address the day after.

636
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:48,558
That day, Chairman Do...

637
00:56:48,558 --> 00:56:50,828
intended to kill you and me both.

638
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,958
He wanted to kill us both.

639
00:56:55,738 --> 00:56:57,598
<i>When was this taken?</i>

640
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,558
<i>This was...</i>

641
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:08,778
<i>Aside from this, I don't have any other piece of humanity left.</i>

642
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:10,358
<i>I took all the unpleasant memories</i>

643
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:12,808
<i>and burned it.</i>
