Were you a pretty good player outside?

163
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,100
It's not like that.

164
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,750
Hey.

165
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,720
What would you do if I taught
you how to make a million won?

166
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,259
Is-is that possible?

167
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,569
Was it two years ago?

168
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,719
Some a♪♪hole came in here crawling

169
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,509
and muddied the school♪ water.
(A slang for prison)

170
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,110
That guy...

171
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,169
captured all the guards
with this one thing.

172
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,339
That punk doesn't win money

173
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,320
but win people.

174
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,780
Because of him, this is not a
prison but a gambling house now.

175
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:31,100
The winner of this game can be a tiger fur♪ or a dog fur♪ here. (Tiger
fur: someone with lots of money) (Dog fur: someone who's broke)

176
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:37,239
I'll pay you the stake, so
try to catch his attention.

177
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,860
Then stay next to him and do me a favor.

178
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,070
Then I'll take care of Hae Do for you.

179
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,250
I heard you blew away his
gambling house and ended up here.

180
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,230
Don't be scared.

181
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,479
Hae Do is my hoobae. Many years junior.

182
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,659
That much I can resolve on my own.

183
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,739
Think about it carefully.

184

186

- Congratulation! See you later!
- Thanks, good job.

187
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,899
Congratulations on being
at the top of the class.

188
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,419
Thank you.

189
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,819
Knowing your father, he must be elated.

190
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,500
His son received the Chief Justice
Award that he couldn't even get.

191
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,870
I owe it all to you.

192
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,339
Oh, right. I'm supposed to have
lunch with my father later.

193
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,190
My father asked me to bring you there.

194
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,590
Your father said that?

195
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,899
I thought I should buy him zzajangmyun at
least since he completed his practicum.

196
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,549
You did a good job
teaching my son, Chief Mok.

197
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,130
Thank you.

198
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,310
It's a pity that Director
Noh passed away like that.

199
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,460
Then now, what are you going to do?

200
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,099
Why don't you come to the Central District
Prosecutors' Office from the Northern District?

201
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,829
We have a shortage of
mid-level prosecutors.

202
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,919
There's Director Noh's case

203
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,229
and there is that f♪♪♪ing
Corruption Investigation Agency.

204
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:02,130
At times like this, it'd be nice if someone from
the 26th judicial class smoothes things over.

205
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,589
When you watch team sports such as soccer,

206
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,020
it's a battle of the strong waists.

207
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,049
You have to be strong in the middle so that

208
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,409
the front and rear can show
off 200 percent of their skills

209
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,940
and eventually, the whole team wins.

210
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,430
We need that kind of victory now.

211
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,530
What if...

212
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,170
I say I'd stay in the Northern
District Prosecutor's office?

213
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,099
Then I'll have to look for someone else.

214
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,530
How can we live without a waist?

215
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,219
Is there anyone from the 26th
class in the countryside somewhere?

216
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,580
But if we do that, you should fill
that vacancy in the countryside.

217
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,579
Hey, Mok Jin Hyung.

218
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,590
Aren't you too selfish if
you wouldn't even do that?

219
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,170
Bring more pickled radish.

220
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,400
Me?

221
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,580
And also that Kim Yo Han.

222
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,630
Make sure to sort things out on his case responsibly
so we don't hear anything strange about it later.

223
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,220
Being one class ahead of you
still makes me your sunbae.

224
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,299
You'd better use honorifics.

225
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,170
Or next time, Sunbaenim...

226
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,000
you'll have to go get pickled radish.

227
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,299
As promised,

228
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,119
you'll give me the list of
Korea Customs Service employees

229
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,199
who engaged in sex trafficking abroad.

230
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,119
I guess there are various
ways to sell alcohol.

231
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,940
But what are you going
to do with that list?

232
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,380
For me to sell even more alcohol.

233
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,560
Aren't you afraid of people pointing fingers
at you for working with a Japanese man?

234
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,050
I'm just a bar girl. Why would
I be afraid of such a thing?

235
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,610
Are you a good person or a bad person?

236
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,760
I'm...

237
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,840

Yes, yes. Take care, Hyungnim.

320
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,299
Geez, this motherf♪♪♪er...

321
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,990
It's not enough with just Sangju.

322
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,409
Happy now?

323
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,509
I put a deposit down with this.

324
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,489
And the balance is Lee
Tae Gwang you asked about.

325
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,369
As for that, after you finish your part...

326
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,450
I'll introduce Lee Tae
Gwang to you after that.

327
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,149
Everything will be fine
if you are a good gambler.

328
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,059
It's all about money.

329
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,709
Be a goose laying the golden egg.

330
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,520
Then he will be blinded by
gold and get close to you.

331
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,259
When I get next to Jang Sun Oh,

332
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,319
what are you going to ask me to do?

333
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,129
Why?

334
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,080
You won't do this if you hear
about it and don't want to do it?

335
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,239
No. I'll do it.

336
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,970
The food used to be too greasy in
the past, but it's okay nowadays.

337
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,500
The warden is crazy about gambling,
and he lost all his pensions.

338
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,389
The kingpin in the country had
bitten off the back of his head

339
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,189
and he was about to die.

340
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,719
That kingpin put his henchman
here and opened a gambling house

341
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,519
to collect the warden's debt.

342
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,239
That henchman is Lee Tae
Gwang you were looking for.

343
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,680
- And then?
- And then...

344
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,239
that Lee Tae Gwang was swallowed up
by this freak, who came in later.

345
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,259
No one knows where Lee
Tae Gwang is right now.

346
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,059
The freak is?

347
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,770
The freak is... Jang Sun
Oh you met yesterday.

348
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,239
If the warden acts as a house
owner and attracts customers,

349
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,370
Jang Sun Oh plays as a player.

350
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,660
And they put them

351
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,349
in the positions of Folding Screen, Ashtray,
Tail, and Pants.♪ (Servers, players, loan)

352
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,629
Wait. Then what if the rumor leaks out?

353
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,139
Through released prisoners?

354
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,979
Look up there.

355
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,309
I hear the security
manager is a house manager.

356
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,849
All the staff here is in cahoots.

357
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,450
And there are three leagues in
total at this Seongju Prison.

358
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,250
The lowest 3rd league is the changing room.

359
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,430
The cigarettes are used as chips here.

360
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,450
S♪♪♪! What the hell!

361
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,569
If you play well there,

362
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,529
the staff will take you
to the staff lounge.

363
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,000
Why?

364
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,419
- For a dogfight.
- A dogfight?

365
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,719
From the 2nd league, it's a cash game.

366
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,069
They sometimes bet on prisoners
while watching them playing.

367
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,029
Or they sponsor good players and

368
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,189
share the money that the players win.

369
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,659
All the guards have gone
nuts trying to make a killing

370
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,469
while the warden is here.

371
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,029
And if you stand out from
there, then where would you go?

372
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,039
You'd go up to the 1st league.

373
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,929
The leading battle in the
Seongju Prison gambling house.

374
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,179
Next to the dean of the Seongju
school♪, Jang Sun Oh. (Slang for prison)

375
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,949
What kind of person is Jang Sun Oh?

376
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,109
Genius.

377
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,109
They say he's a genius who comes out once
every few decades in the gambling scene.

378
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,359
Geez, that young punk.

379
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,799
Who is the warden bringing in today?

380
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,990
They are Hanguk University professors.

381
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,460
Hanguk University?

382
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,580
Stop.

383
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,209
Oh, my. What's the matter?

384
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,399
Don't you know that if you screw over the nerds with bets, they'll
get a tilt♪ right away? (Emotional breakdown from losing too much)

385
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,819
These punks!

386
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,709
Don't Hanguk University professors poop?

387
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,239
Do Hanguk University
professors have three brains?

388
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,700
Put your hands together.

389
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,869
Gambling is all about spirit. Spirit!

390
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,379
Now, count to three.

391
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,479
One, two, three!

392
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,139
Seongju, Seongju, Seongju! Go! Fight!
Win! Hey! Seongju School! Yay!

393
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,200
They're dead.

394
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,319
Hello.

395
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,009
This is Professor Park of
Physics at Hanguk University.

396
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,950
Nice to meet you!

397
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,909
Good to see you.

398
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,789
Yes. He's an IT professor.

399
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,970
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

400
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,430
Here he comes.

401
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,610
Sending a player today, huh?

402
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,040
- This newbie?
- Yes.

403
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,110
With 3369's detention money?

404
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,000
(3rd League)

405
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,740
Hi, Hyungnim!

406
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,180
Sit over here.

407
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,009
Check the four cartons of cigarettes.

408
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,160
- Correct?
- Okay.

409
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,929
One cigarette is 25,000 won.

410
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,249
Four cartons are

411
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,609
- 20 million won.
- A new face.

412
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,129
- Who's his sponsor?
- Song Doo Chul paid for him.

413
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,410
Bukyeongpa Song Doo Chul?

414
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,140
Newbie. Good luck.

415
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,859
Okay, the school's out.

416
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,590
Let's play.

417
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,499
Texas Hold'em.

418
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,049
It's in the same family as the Seven Poker.

419
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,259
The difference is that each
player is dealt two cards and

420
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,850
other five community
cards are shown to all.

421
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Each person gets two cards and makes a bet.

422
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,159
Call.

423
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,760
Out.

424
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,670
Call.

425
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,799
Flop♪ (The first three of the
community cards are dealt)

426
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,669
They bet again whenever the
community cards are dealt.

427
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,070
Call.

428
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,480
Call.

429
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,279
Every time you see a card,

430
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,770
you pay for a chance.

431
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,550
For two cards, I pay.

432
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,670
- Call.
- Pay.

433
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,050
Pay.

434
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,650
Call.

435
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,680
One pair of sevens.

436
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,529
Wow. You sail a deep-sea fishing
boat, but you only catch a trout.

437
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,270
Trout.

438
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:41,100
If I keep this up, I'll find
Lee Tae Gwang real soon.

439
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,239
One pair of Kings.

440
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,720
Good. Let's go.

441
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,219
Raise.

442
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,539
- Die.
- Die.

443
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,499
- Die.
- Good job.

444
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,089
Out.

445
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,330
Was I in a rush?

446
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
All right.

447
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,869
- Call.
- Out.

448
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,089
- Out.
- Out.

449
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,050
Still not following me?

450
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,039
Then I'll bluff this time.

451
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,300
- Raise.
- Raise.

452
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,169
Call this time.

453
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,059
- Okay.
- Call.

454
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,129
Call. Raise one more pack.

455
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,470
Call.

456
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,220
How do they know this?

457
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,300
You were going to do this, huh?

458
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,050
Give me some good cards.

459
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,619
9-Double. No, I mean one pair of nines.

460
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,969
Let's see. Call.

461
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,960
Isn't this good enough to go for it?

462
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,830
Raise.

463
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,079
Out.

464
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,590
- I'm out.
- I'm out, too.

465
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,079
Call.

466
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,859
Raise two packs.

467
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,179
Raise?

468
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,539
Who the hell are you?

469
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,770
Is he holding higher
ranking hands than 9-Double?

470
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,770
Call.

471
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,280
Flop.

472
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,360
Jack, Queen, King, and
Ace haven't been exposed.

473
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,510
Three packs.

474
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,010
What can it be?

475
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,360
If the final card is 9, then
I'll get 9 three-of-a-kind.

476
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,689
If the final card is 3, 4, or
8, then I'll get two pairs.

477
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,490

00:55:30,105 --> 00:55:33,414
But what if I go out to
deal with them myself and

639
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:36,024
get the deed to the house taken away?

640
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:39,634
So I asked them to meet you in front of
the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

641
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:42,415
I thought I'd bring Chief Mok there.

642
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,215
Mr. Jo Hae Do?

643
00:56:05,435 --> 00:56:07,345
(Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung)

644
00:56:10,525 --> 00:56:12,315
(Tae Su sunbae's mother)

645
00:56:17,815 --> 00:56:18,935
(Tae Su sunbae's mother)

646
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:23,534
Why don't you answer?

647
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,605
What brings you here?

648
00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:33,035
That was...

649
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:35,674
all your doing?

650
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,724
You started first.

651
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:42,065
Be human about it, and think
what goes around comes around.

652
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:48,625
Then who killed my grandma?

653
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:54,785
Can you handle it?

654
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:02,055
Your grandma...

655
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,805
was killed by you.

656
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:15,364
You killed her, bastard.

657
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,074
You started a fight you couldn't win, to
begin with, trusting in your own intellect.

658
00:57:19,075 --> 00:57:21,485
While your innocent grandmother got...

659
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:25,424
What did you say, f♪♪♪er?

660
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:28,204
Don't blame other people.

661
00:57:28,205 --> 00:57:31,674
Just think, "I'm paying for
killing my grandmother."

662
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:35,295
After you send her off to
burial, then go back...

663
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:50,004
What are you guys doing!

664
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:53,304
What are you doing?

665
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:55,094
Kim Yo Han!

666
00:57:55,095 --> 00:57:56,994
Kim Yo Han!

667
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:59,435
- Yo Han!
- Chief!

668
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:09,454
- Are you okay?
- Gosh...

669
00:58:09,455 --> 00:58:11,194
What are you going to do with this punk?

670
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:14,074
I'll take care of it here. Leave.

671
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:17,114
Doesn't he know that it's all over for him?

672
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:18,324
Hey!

673
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,504
I ought to!

674
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:22,305
Hurry up and go!

675
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:26,185
I'll leave now.

676
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:41,455
Chief.

677
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:47,115
What was that about just now?

678
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,085
- Yo Han.
- Am I...

679
00:58:55,385 --> 00:58:57,465
still doing the investigation...

680
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:02,775
Am I still carrying out official duties?

681
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:07,145
- Yo Han.
- Chief!

682
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:15,195
Yo Han...

683
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:20,185
If you bear it and survive,

684
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:23,495
you'll live through it.

685
00:59:56,085 --> 00:59:57,925
Yo Han, I'm sorry.

686
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,115
Are you...

687
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:03,135
abandoning me?

688
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:20,584
It's not what you think.

689
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:25,065
There was a brief setback in operation.

690
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:31,604
We pray she rebirths in an earthly paradise
after she goes to Amitabha's world.

691
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:36,174
Oh great, compassionate Buddha!
Please accept our sincerest prayer!

692
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,414
I'll decide...

693
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:42,075
whether the investigation is over or not.

694
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:56,764
Hong Jae Sun might have prepared for
murder, but he's not the culprit.

695
01:00:56,765 --> 01:01:00,125
Someone like him would've never
gotten blood on his hands.

696
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:08,935
Sir.

697
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:12,995
What is it?

698
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:16,035
Texas Hold'em.

699
01:01:18,335 --> 01:01:19,934
Please teach me.

700
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:21,974
Why?

701
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:24,464
As long as human greed is alive and well,

702
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:26,954
the game is not over.

703
01:01:26,955 --> 01:01:28,974
So why...

704
01:01:28,975 --> 01:01:32,324
Why did you change your mind?

705
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:36,054
Hong Jae Sun, Mok Jin
Hyung, Yoon Byung Wook,

706
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:41,034
and the murderer who killed my
grandmother, still out there somewhere.

707
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:43,625
I'll finish them all with my own hands.

708
01:01:45,325 --> 01:01:47,165
Why?

709
01:01:48,025 --> 01:01:49,645
Because I'm not...

710
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:53,865
finished just yet.

It won't take long.

How can I go up to the front battle?

721

You should catch the warden's eyes.

You're good enough to go
up to the front battle.

Is your offer to help me still valid?

Is it okay if I watch from here?

If I win, you should take
