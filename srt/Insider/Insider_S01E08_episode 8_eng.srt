1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,020
   

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,000
   

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,450
   

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,890
   

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,100
   

6
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,400
M-Min Ho?

7
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,020
Envelope?

8
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,990
The envelope that Chairman Do told you to give to me.

9
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,350
 Have you ever heard the name Yang Hwa? 

10
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,600
 Chairman Yang Joon's older brother. 

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,640
 He succeeded in conquering the Gangnam area with his younger brother. 

12
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,850
 The true leader of Bukyeongpa gang. 

13
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,490
Yo Han, get in the car!

14
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,670
Prosecutor Hong is here, too. Hurry!

15
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,300
Soo Yeon.

16
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,420
Hang on!

17
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,090
What! Stop!

18
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,780
Stop!

19
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,070
Get them!

20
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,490
Get them!

21
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,580
Stop!

22
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,390
Bingo.

23
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,800
Turn on the siren.

24
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,280
We lost her.

25
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,170
Who are you?

26
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,200
   

27
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,070
Will you be okay, getting caught with me like this?

28
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
I doubt it.

29
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,640
Even if you lose a tooth, sometimes you have to hang on.

30
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,110
   

31
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,700
 Get out, or else you'll get caught by Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun. 

32
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,610
What is it?

33
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,740
Stand here.

34
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,830
I told you not to do anything stupid when you went out there!

35
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,830
Why didn't you say I had to bring a person out with me?

36
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,360
You only need to know what I tell you,

37
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,100
and do what you're told!

38
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,000
His injury was too severe and...

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,490
I couldn't have escaped without getting help.

40
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,550
If something terrible happens to Oh Soo Yeon,

41
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,830
it's all your fault.

42
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,590
The envelope you asked me to deliver,

43
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,600
didn't you hear that I kept it secure from others' hands?

44
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,310
A child was killed!

45
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,820
Did you even know that Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun was tailing you?

46
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,930
He must be so pissed off. I'm sure he'll barge in here soon.

47
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,520
If you want to live a full life,

48
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,470
forget you ever met me.

49
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,810
 Koo Bon Chul... 

50
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,190
 The 24th entering class of Judicial Research and Training Institute. 

51
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,020
 Naval Logistics Command, First Fleet. 

52
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,400
It says he worked as a military prosecutor at the Incheon Defense Command.

53
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,490
There's no other record on him beyond 2000.

54
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
From 2000 until now?

55
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,210
 Yes, there's no record at all. 

56
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,020
 Not even a court record of who he was defending. 

57
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,770
He's a typical Chairman Do's guy.

58
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,390
You know... that child...

59
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,080
 He was taken to a nearby hospital after the parking lot security guard called in. 

60
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,070
 I told the police 

61
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,910
 that the child's name 

62
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,450
 is Woo Min Ho. I reported anonymously. 

63
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,250
 I'll help you... 

64
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,380
 I'll help you, so... 

65
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,050
 you have to save my dad, Hyung. 

66
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,100
 The police started... searching for his dad, Woo Sang Ki. 

67
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,570
 Do you want me to keep you 

68
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,410
 posted on the progress of things? 

69
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,170
How about that bastard from the parking lot?

70
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,350
I mean... the Skin-nation...

71
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,610
It's a rather well-known company.

72
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,290
The company's owner...

73
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,620
and his older brother are doing all this?

74
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes.

75
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,570
The two brothers...

76
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,010
That's how the two came out of the gutters.

77
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,690
 Hey! Come on now! 

78
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,470
   

79
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,390
 They started out as thugs selling fake cosmetics in Namdaemun Market. 

80
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,160
 Here comes another customer! 

81
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,870
 Come now! 

82
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,770
 Hey! Don't do this! 

83
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,100
 What are you doing? 

84
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,000
 At the time, Namdaemun was controlled by the Bukyeongpa gang from Busan. 

85
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,500
 Get out, you bastards! 

86
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,090
 Hyung. 

87
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,990
 That bastard from the parking lot... 

88
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,400
 In a short time, Yang Hwa took over the Bukyeongpa gang. 

89
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,350
 It's going to be successful. 
   

90
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,780
   

91
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,230
 However, living life as thugs was too much. 

92
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,150
 They tried to grow a company to lead a legitimate life, 

93
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,630
 but there's someone scarier than a gangster, and that's a loan shark. 

94
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,970
 The Goldman Casino's manager. 

95
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,050
 They clashed into a huge wall called Do Won Bong. 

96
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,040
 Chairman Do's power comes from the casino. 

97
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,890
 No... 

98
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,750
 Through that casino, 

99
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,730
 they realized that the money was being laundered for the slush funds 

100
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,040
 of the country's most powerful people called the "Deep Pockets." 

101
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,810
 They took over Chairman Do through sheer force. 

102
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,600
 Those guys... 

103
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,540
 Gosh, it's hot. 

104
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,480
 The casino manager position belongs to the one who wins the fight. 

105
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,690
 It's a position that manages funds for very important people. 

106
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,590
 If you simply show that you have the skill to maintain the position, 

107
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,600
 whether it's a thug or a loan shark, they didn't care. 

108
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,730
 Once the two brothers became the casino's new managers, 

109
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,340
 the Deep Pockets threw Chairman Do into prison. 

110
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,690
 And to protect the two brothers, 

111
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,740
 they bought the Seocho-dong prosecutors. 

112
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,000
I sent Kim Yo Han to Do Won Bong so he'd kill him,

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,890
but instead, he adopted him.

114
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,670
Why would he have done that?

115
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,400
Jae Sun? Give me your pictures.

116
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,610
You know Oh Soo Yeon, right?

117
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,220
Why would Soo Yeon...

118
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,520
I didn't hear Kim Yo Han's obituary from Seongju prison

119
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,010
so Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun here put a tail on her.

120
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,990
It turns out she had already partnered up with Kim Yo Han.

121
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,160
By then, Do Won Bong had begun to plan out his revenge.

122
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,550
All along, he was only pretending to go along with us.

123
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,720
We weren't trying to avoid getting rid of Chairman Do in Seongju Prison.

124
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,990
But right now, Chairman Do is staying too close to the

125
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,860
elders of Shinseon-dong, just like a cicada attached to a tree.

126
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,330
What's the Shinseon-dong?

127
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,720
There is an annex in Seongju Prison where former higher-ups are gathered.

128
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Out of the Deep Pockets who have Goldman slush funds,

129
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,790
a third belongs to the elders in Sinseon-dong.

130
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,340
You mean... money laundering is halted because of Do Won Bong.

131
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,360
You guys aren't doing anything about it?

132
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,010
So, the way Deep Pockets see it,

133
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,100
it's all our fault...

134
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,250
and it's our responsibility.

135
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,330
Then... are we getting in trouble with Annie?

136
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,100
Including me?!

137
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,840
Annie?

138
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,410
Yes, the proxy for the Deep Pockets.

139
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,480
Kim Yo Han's release isn't too far off, right?

140
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
Yes.

141
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,070
- So, until then— 
 - Shut up!

142
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,950
All your foul-ups from the other day is on the news. It's a mess.

143
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,920
I heard you killed a kid, too.

144
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,740
You shouldn't have made such a huge commotion trying to get a guy.

145
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,020
Stop acting recklessly.

146
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,700
Jae Sun... finish everything up at Seongju Prison.

147
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,070
When things get shaken up on the outside,

148
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,390
they'll naturally get smashed to death on the inside.

149
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,970
 What are you going to do about the kid who got killed? 

150
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,770
 Well, as for that... 

151
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,810
 if we scorch one of our guys... 

152
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,980
Yes, Hyungnim.

153
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,570
Yes, Sir.

154
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,740
Yes, Sir.

155
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,240
Yes... I understand.

156
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,010
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

157
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,650
Thank you.

158
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,900
Goodbye, Hyungnim.

159
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,380
   

160
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,610
Geez, Bastards...

161
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,040
Do they think I'm a pushover?

162
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,310
Sir! Sir!

163
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,660
   

164
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,650
   

165
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,660
 Woo Sang Ki. 

166
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,330
 It's Woo Min Ho's father. 

167
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,170
 He went to the US on a state scholarship and worked as an investment banker. 

168
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,050
 He met a Korean-American there, got married, and had a child. 

169
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,650
 Then he got assigned to a Hong Kong branch. 

170
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,870
 Then he lost his wife. 

171
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,740
 After retirement, he worked as a coin exchange trader 

172
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,940
 and lived alone with his child. 

173
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,480
 Last year, he returned to Korea after 15 years. 

174
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,650
   

175
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,090
 If there's internet, 

176
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,820
 we can communicate that way. 

177
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,120
   

178
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,300
   

179
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,970
 pepper17!! 

180
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,750
 It's our puppy's account. 

181
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,100
 pepper17!! 

182
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,110
   

183
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,360
I wasn't going to say this, but...

184
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,320
Here's the big news.

185
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,740
Me&amp;C Group plans to acquire Gwangil Pharmaceutical

186
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,430
and invest 30 billion won in new drug development.

187
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,990
   

188
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,870
Excuse me.

189
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,580
Yes, Yo Han.

190
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,890
What?

191
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,110
The Justice Department Inspector General has arrived.

192
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,280
What about the interview with the Jo Hae Do's people?

193
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,630
Eight of their gang members,

194
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,130
"Washer" Kim Woo Sang, "Monk" Eum Ik Soo.

195
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,640
A total of 10 people, including two cadres.

196
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
I scheduled it under my name.

197
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,540
No.

198
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
Put it under my name.

199
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
Then you'll be exposed.

200
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,120
That's right.

201
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,400
If word that a current prosecutor wants Kim Yo Han spreads in prison, who knows?

202
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,950
We might get something out of it.

203
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,890
   

204
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,210
Who reported me to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission?

205
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,250
I can't disclose the identity of the informant.

206
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,820
I suppose so.

207
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,730
But Prosecutor, the thing about the correctional administration is that

208
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,230
it is an endless fight with complainants.

209
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,990
It's bad enough that they got caught, how could they accept things positively in there?

210
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,920
By filing reports like this,

211
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,980
tons of guys want to get out for some fresh air

212
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,510
under the pretext of being investigated as a reference witness.

213
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,150
Oh, is that so?

214
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,960
So this report...

215
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,660
If you tell me who filed it...

216
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,190
I still can't do that.

217
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,960
What?

218
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,560
If I tell you, you're going to bury that informant.

219
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,330
Like that time.

220
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,920
"Informant OOO said the current warden together with inmate Jang OO"

221
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,960
"set up an illegal private gambling room in prison by taking illicit gains."

222
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,130
"Some guards, including the security manager, are also involved."

223
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,300
"However, the inspection result shows that a card game that was conducted as part of psychotherapy..."

224
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,780
Wow...

225
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,490
They called it psychotherapy.

226
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,530
Anyway...

227
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,700
"The card game that was conducted as part of psychotherapy was exaggerated."

228
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,160
- "The gambling site could not be confirmed." 
 - Hold... Hold on a minute.

229
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,030
Exactly one week after the filing of this report,

230
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,190
your daughter received one million won in her account.

231
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,380
And for 10 straight weeks, one million won was regularly deposited electronically

232
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,890
every week into the account of Son Noo Ri of Seollim elementary school, second grade, class 3.

233
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,970
I know this isn't just her allowance money.

234
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,320
Because we checked your wife's account history and

235
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,410
your father, mother, even the account history of your father- and mother-in-law.

236
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,420
But there weren't any withdrawals that matched this.

237
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,330
Your older brother and his wife, and your younger sister and her husband...

238
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,710
Oh, that brother-in-law. I heard he passed the police examination after eight attempts.

239
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,240
What is it that you want?

240
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,130
Tell me whatever it is.

241
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,450
I'll do whatever you ask.

242
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,410
There's not much to this.

243
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,500
 It's all true. 

244
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,120
 So we brought Jang Seon Oh in and investigated him. 

245
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,820
 Of all things, I found out that the head of our correctional department 

246
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,320
 was also a regular there. 

247
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,340
 Jang Seon Oh? 

248
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,580
 Since Jang Seon Oh has been released, who's the boss in there now? 

249
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,540
1648.

250
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,610
Today at 2 p.m., you have visitation with Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

251
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,620
I refuse.

252
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,000
Visitation from Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun.

253
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,070
I refuse.

254
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,140
1670, visitation from Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun.

255
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,430
I refuse.

256
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,650
Visitation from Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun.

257
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,620
I refuse.

258
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,940
1673.

259
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,650
Today at 4 p.m., you have visitation from Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

260
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,140
Okay.

261
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,100
Today at 4 p.m.

262
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,490
Yes.

263
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,690
Get back to work.

264
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,350
1673.

265
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,840
What is this?

266
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,460
What the hell.

267
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,640
1673. For possession of a dangerous object, you'll be taken to the investigation room.

268
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,370
Get him out of here.

269
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,360
Let me go. Let go! That's not mine!

270
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,450
This is entrapment. It's a trap! Let go of me!

271
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,470
Is this Kim Yo Han's doing?

272
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,940
I need to meet with Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun!

273
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,980
 Let go of me! 

274
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,040
Oh, man...

275
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,670
Prosecutor.

276
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,190
They all refused your request to meet with them.

277
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,170
All ten of them?

278
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,650
Yes.

279
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,980
All right.

280
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,040
 Kim Yo Han... 

281
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,340
 Bastard... 

282
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,150
Let's hurry up!

283
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,230
What's all this?

284
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,630
- Geez. 
 - We don't have all day here!

285
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,880
- Let's see. 
 - All the sorting is done.

286
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,810
Almost done.

287
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,660
- You didn't do it? 
 - No.

288
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,970
Geez.

289
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,010
Hey, sort these out.

290
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,420
Are you sure they all refused of their own will?

291
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,920
 Yes, that's correct. 

292
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,260
What's the reason?

293
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,200
 For personal reasons. 

294
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,640
   

295
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,780
I understand.

296
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,390
   

297
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,050
   

298
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,720
 Seongju Prison? 

299
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,220
   

300
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,810
Did you send this to me? 
    

301
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,440
   

302
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,160
   

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,190
   

304
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,440
   

305
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,510
Your price?

306
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,530
Nothing much.

307
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,500
Kim Yo Han, that bastard...

308
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,590
mess up his life.

309
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,250
 Gosh, so annoying! 

310
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,140
 Gosh, that's crazy. 

311
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,500
 Take a glass. 

312
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,460
 What the hell? 

313
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,340
Are you okay?

314
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,770
Hey, go outside and find out.

315
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,280
Geez, who could it be at this hour?

316
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,900
What's the reason for your visit?

317
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,040
This is Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

318
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,290
This is a search and seizure warrant.

319
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,390
Wait! Hold on! Let go of me!

320
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,000
 Please let go! There are iron bars here! 

321
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,270
 Please help! Wait a minute! 

322
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,030
Yes, this is the Warden's office.

323
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,090
Warden, they breached the checkpoint!

324
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,040
 What the hell! 

325
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,770
 Hey, hey, hey! Get that! 

326
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,510
 Move it! S***! 

327
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,840
Listen!

328
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,360
Quiet!

329
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,580
If you panic, you'll go to jail, but you'll go home if you stay calm.

330
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,290
You'll be escorted out through the emergency evacuation route.

331
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,510
You are on the third floor right now, the Warden's office.

332
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,990
Hey, what's up?

333
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,630
Gather all the men.

334
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,110
 - Warden! 
 - What are you doing? Go! 

335
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,190
 Hurry! Go! 

336
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,780
 - Hurry!  
 - Hey, hey, hey!

337
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,350
Hey! The record!

338
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,540
Security manager! Manager!

339
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,480
Hey, hey, hey!

340
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,170
What are these guys doing here?

341
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,290
Get rid of them!

342
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,100
Move it.

343
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,270
Move it!

344
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,880
 I'll just go to jail! 

345
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,430
 Geez, come on! 

346
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,500
Seongju Prison cares about the customers' safety.

347
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,990
Seoungju Prison will be with you to the end.

348
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,440
For the safe evacuation,

349
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,990
please follow the instructions of our staff.

350
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,280
Yes.

351
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,400
What?

352
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,970
What are you talking about?

353
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,510
S***! Now you are telling me?

354
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,140
What are they doing?

355
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,990
Chief, go in, please.

356
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,970
- Break it down! 
  - Yes, Sir! 

357
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,580
Hey! Open up!

358
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,000
Hey! Open!

359
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,000
Out! Out! Hurry!

360
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,100
Hey! Burn everything!

361
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,100
What are you doing? That's my lifeline!

362
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,340
I have that lifeline, too.

363
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,150
Hey! You bastard!

364
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,250
Warden!

365
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,910
You have to escape first.

366
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,710
That way, you'll survive. The school will survive too. 
  (T/N: School - slang for prison) 

367
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,670
Sh*t!

368
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,100
Hey, hey, hey! This way, this way!

369
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,390
Direct the light!

370
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,840
- Cut it! 
 - Okay!

371
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,870
Hurry up!

372
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,020
Hurry!

373
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,650
Okay, okay. Open it up!

374
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,830
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - What the hell is this?

375
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,310
Geez, what the hell are we doing...

376
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,680
Gosh, it's too low!

377
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,030
Hurry!

378
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,010
Hurry! Lower your head!

379
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,540
Chief, bring me the key from that guard at the gate.

380
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,040
Bring the key!

381
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,970
Hurry!

382
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,030
- Here's more! 
 - Hurry!

383
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,470
Over here!

384
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,100
Don't use your own cars.

385
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,890
Please use the vehicles we've prepared in advance.

386
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,750
Which one?

387
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,270
- Which one? 
 - That one!

388
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,670
Come on! Get out!

389
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,780
Hey, break it down!

390
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,490
Are you going to be at it all night?

391
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,300
Watch out!

392
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,290
There.

393
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,200
Look around!

394
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,700
Where is everyone?

395
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,630
S***!

396
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,360
Hey! Where?

397
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,530
 Move! 

398
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,280
 There's no one here. 

399
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,120
 Nothing here. 

400
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
 S***... 

401
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,300
What is it?

402
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,100
Hello, how do you do?

403
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

404
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,410
Yes.

405
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,330
Do you have an envelope for me?

406
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,130
 The envelope you asked me to deliver. 

407
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,250
 Didn't you hear that I kept it secure from others' hands? 

408
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,630
Even though times may have changed,

409
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,340
prosecutors are still the same as ever.

410
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,620
What's your dream?

411
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,460
Good health?

412
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,510
Good health. Nice.

413
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,640
Do you know what's most important for healthy living?

414
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,120
What you eat.

415
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,940
Before you put the food in your mouth, you have to know with a glance what it is,

416
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,780
so you can enjoy the natural span of life.

417
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,200
Your father was able to do that well.

418
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,520
That's why he is at where he is now.

419
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,850
Will you go and

420
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,020
send my regards to your father?

421
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,640
Now.

422
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,050
Let him in.

423
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,090
Boy, here's the dean.

424
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,890
Like old times, it was a good getaway.

425
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,340
Not too bad, right?

426
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,060
The real top of the class is different.

427
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,400
On the tenth,

428
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,060
did you go outside the prison to receive job training?

429
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,620
I'm getting a certificate in interior architecture.

430
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,070
You didn't ditch your class that day and hang out in Seongjeo-gu?

431
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,440
Me?

432
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,030
Do you have proof?

433
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,370
The envelope this man gave you to deliver that day.

434
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,540
If you give it to me,

435
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,090
your grandmother's killer...

436
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,790
I'll tell you who it is.

437
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,080
Even if you get out of here, do you think you can find the killer?

438
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,940
You'll have a tough time finding a job.

439
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,320
Even if you obtained an interior architecture certificate.

440
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,940
Oh, you know you are alone now, right?

441
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,830
Even Chief Prosecutor Mok wrote an apology letter and defected.

442
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,690
Love your colleague, love your country.

443
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,510
I'll help you.

444
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,910
Even your gambling in here, I can tack it onto another inmate.

445
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,400
You talk as if you're not guilty.

446
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,870
What are you talking about?

447
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,600
As far as I know it isn't just one person who killed my grandmother.

448
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,920
As for my grandmother's case,

449
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,230
I'll take care of it.

450
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,490
And an envelope?

451
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,750
I have no idea what you are talking about.

452
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,650
If I just change the door...

453
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,380
you said you'll make a way?

454
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,820
Then... I'm counting on you.

455
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,000
To all the correctional officers dedicated to the Seongju Prison, 
    

456
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,630
it's my pleasure.

457
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,810
 From now on, this prison will rise up through the current stigma 

458
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,660
 and become a completely new prison. 

459
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,300
 I, Shim Jae Chul, am committed to strict law enforcement and 

460
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,800
 the establishment of service discipline for correctional officials and 

461
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,820
 the creation of an honest public office culture. 

462
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,080
 To be trusted by the people 

463
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,010
 and be reborn as a correctional facility of hope, 

464
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,520
 I promise to do my best in my calling. 

465
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,770
Aigoo, aigoo! Welcome!

466
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,520
Welcome! Good to see you.

467
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,650
Please take a seat here comfortably.

468
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,610
Okay. Let's get along.

469
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,050
A person... should read books.

470
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,240
Help!

471
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
Laundry? 
    

472
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,790
Is it proper for lowly me to come here?

473
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,760
The new warden

474
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,330
drew lots to be fair to everyone.

475
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,490
So go inside.

476
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,840
Thank you.

477
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,390
Oh, no!

478
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,540
No!

479
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,750
Hold still!

480
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,090
No! No!

481
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,480
How dare you betray me, f***er...

482
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,000
No! No! No!

483
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,290
Did you see it?

484
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,730
What are you doing? Pick it up!

485
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,250
Pick it up!

486
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,100
Bastard...

487
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,610
Get him!

488
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,410
A gambling house in prison...

489
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,250
So that such nonsense will never happen again,

490
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,220
I'll make sure all the violations that have transpired

491
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,060
in these correctional facilities

492
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,140
are cleaned up.

493
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,220
I plan to clean them up according to the fundamental principles.

494
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,840
However...

495
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,980
the investigation is over.

496
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,240
So what brings you here,

497
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,000
Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun?

498
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,100
The Seongju Prison case was my first case, so I feel very attached to it.

499
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,070
So I wanted to ask that this place be well-taken care of.

500
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,320
I came to greet you properly, however...

501
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,820
Hello.

502
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,960
Aigoo. How nice to see you.

503
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,130
You've changed a lot.

504
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,770
Is that so?

505
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,030
 I blocked them all. 

506
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,470
 But how can I avoid exposing my back? 

507
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,780
 They catch you because all you're doing is blocking. 

508
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,690
 You have to attack! So they can't even think about catching you. 

509
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,000
You!

510
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,250
 How do I attack so many... 

511
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,870
 That's why people have... 

512
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,630
 vital points. 

513
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,600
I heard you attend the same church as the Chief Prosecutor of the Financial and Tax Crimes Investigations Unit 2

514
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,480
at the Central District Prosecutors' Office?

515
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,370
Do you know Elder Yoon Byung Wook?

516
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,200
I've known him since I was little.

517
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,330
My father was Chief Prosecutor Yoon's supervising prosecutor.

518
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,720
Your father is?

519
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,110
He is the Chief Prosecutor of the Central Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

520
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,630
I see...

521
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,340
Actually, the reason I came here

522
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,670
was in large part due to Elder Yoon's guidance.

523
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,170
I see.

524
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,620
When you have time, we should all get together for dinner.

525
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,840
Bastard...

526
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,240
 And at the end, the strongest will emerge. 

527
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,900
As for him...

528
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,940
Kill him!

529
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,600
That's the way to scare off the rest.

530
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,360
Gil Sang... Put the knife in his hand.

531
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,730
Hurry up and call the guard.

532
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,310
Or your boss will die here.

533
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,750
Hurry...

534
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,420
Hurry up and put the knife in his hand!

535
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,020
Hurry up and call the guard, you f***!

536
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,040
Guard!

537
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,740
S***.

538
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,910
Geez...

539
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,560
 The statements from the inmates in that room are different. 

540
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,550
 Kim Yo Han smuggled that knife in 

541
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,760
 and he stabbed Song Doo Chul. 

542
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,880
Is the fingerprint analysis report on the knife out yet?

543
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,460
There wasn't one fingerprint found.

544
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,300
Are you really suspicious of me?

545
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,290
I need proof that you didn't do it.

546
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,220
Considering witnesses alone,

547
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,410
it's four against one.

548
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,450
Before the week's over, you will be transferred to the Jangsong Prison.

549
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,890
And the trial for this case will be conducted there.

550
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,720
Why?

551
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,000
I hear the inmates call you the Dean?

552
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,230
The reason is that the gambling that occurred in the warden's office every Friday night

553
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:01,100
was run by you, and those testimonies are circulating among the inmates.

554
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,890
On top of that, there's this murder charge.

555
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,910
If we need to isolate you,

556
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,860
we should send you to the Jangsong Prison, don't you agree?

557
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,410
- Guard! 
 - Wait.

558
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,150
Before that happens, I need to see a lawyer first.

559
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,170
You can call one from the Jangsong Prison.

560
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,900
If anyone is arrested or under custody, he has the right to an attorney.

561
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,200
Isn't that article 12, clause 4 of the Constitution?

562
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,900
I believe the reason for my isolation is unreasonable.

563
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,280
Please allow me to see an attorney at once.

564
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,340
Constitution?

565
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,040
Help me.

566
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,190
I told you not to act like you know me.

567
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,530
The address on the business card in that envelope.

568
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,270
I will remain silent for you, Chairman.

569
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,000
I can add that you had other inmates,

570
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,480
including myself, run errands outside continuously, but...

571
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,550
And what else?

572
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,250
All the matters involving you,

573
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,300
I will forget everything as you wish.

574
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,730
The only thing I want is that you block Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun.

575
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,780
That's all I ask.

576
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,260
That's no deal.

577
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,660
Hong Jae Sun's plan

578
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,270
is to place the blame for the murder of Song Doo Chul on you

579
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:51,180
and keep you in prison for a long time.

580
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,180
You only had a few months to go, too.

581
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,290
You've already lost this game.

582
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,630
Fold this game and get up.

583
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:10,530
And as for your revenge, forget all about it.

584
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,430
Or else you'll drown in your regrets and die first.

585
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,720
What is it that you really want to say?

586
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,800
Be my possession.

587
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,090
You will only listen to me and look to me.

588
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,700
Then I'll get Hong Jae Sun and Song Doo Chul...

589
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,210
off of your back.

590
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,120
What...

591
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,280
will I have to do?

592
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,270
When you are released,

593
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,090
go and kill someone.

594
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:11,050
Human blood doesn't clean off well.

595
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:14,330
It's a perfect ink pad for stamps.

596
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,790
 The person who kidnapped my dad and me... 

597
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,540
 is the one who killed your grandmother. 

598
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,710
Mask...

599
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,350
I just need to unmask him.

600
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,030
 Peekaboo. 

601
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,410
 Ahjussi, are you Hyung Yo Han? 

602
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,930
 I'll help you. 

603
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,210
 I'll help you so... 

604
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,370
 you have to save my dad, Hyung. 

605
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,720
 Yes. 

606
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,690
 That's not it. 

607
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,080
 pepper17!! 

608
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,790
   

609
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,490
   

610
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,750
   

611
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,980
   

612
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,790
   

613
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,080
   

614
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,530
   

615
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,620
   

616
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,360
   

617
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,610
pepper17!!

618
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,550
 

619
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,050
 It's our puppy's account. 

620
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,760
 Only my dad and I know about it. 

621
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,770
 I've been busy. 

622
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,170
 3883. Did he go somewhere? 

623
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,550
 If you're interested in playing in the higher league, come on up. 

624
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,960
 I really can't do this without you. 

625
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,650
 Don't betray me. 

626
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,300
 What are you doing? 

627
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,980
 Memorial service. 

628
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,300
 What? 

629
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,850
 No. Maybe just praying? 

630
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,060
 Today is the anniversary of my father's passing. 

631
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,410
 Just wondering if he's doing alright over there. 

632
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,900
 Telling him that I'm about to leave here. Stuff like that. 

633
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,050
 I never prepared a memorial service. 

634
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,450
 I do this on this day every year. 

635
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,850
 Place it inside. 

636
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,780
 Pick up the glass. 

637
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,490
 Rotate it three times around the incense. 

638
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,580
 Put it down. 

639
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:44,230
 Do a big bow two and a half times. 

640
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,020
   

641
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,980
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

642
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,140
 Aren't you afraid of the law? 

643
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,200
 The law is not a scale. It's a knife. 

644
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,560
 One who has the power will hold the handle. 

645
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,030
 A knife held by powerless ones to kill me. 

646
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,860
 Who do I have to kill? 

647
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,220
 It's an emergency. Am I the only one who thinks that? 

648
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,590
 Do you think prosecutors are a joke? 

649
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,640
 All this is because you didn't do a good job of wrapping things up. 

650
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,950
 If you wrap things up by the day before the official announcement of personnel, 

651
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,230
 I'll let you remain in Seoul. 

652
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,390
 Should I put a marker on Jang Seon Oh? 

653
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,750
 We have to catch both of them at the same time. 

654
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,340
 Is this the life of an ex-convict? 

655
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,220
 The outside world isn't all that different from a jail room. 

656
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,480
 It takes money to stay hidden. 

657
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,620
 I think it's about to start. 

658
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,800
 Because of the latest outing, he'll try to avoid getting mixed up with you, Yo Han. 

659
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,650
 Then I'll have to make him follow. 

660
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,590
 How? 

661
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,380
 I'll have him sit at my game table. 

662
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,400
 Grandmother, please wait a little longer.
