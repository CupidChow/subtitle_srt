1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,760
   

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,860
   

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,360
   

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,750
   

5
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:45,450


6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,010
   

7
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,490
   
 Can you get close to that Lee Tae Gwang and get that video? 

8
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,520
 He brought a video of Chairman Yang gambling and offered us a deal to get him out as well. 

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,200
 But after that, this guy completely cut off all contact. 

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 - Where is he right now? 
 - Seongju Prison. 

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,290
 Are you telling me to go to prison and then come back out? 

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,630
 The CID is at the center of the opposition to the Corruption Investigation Agency. 

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,630
 This is how you fight in the dark. 

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,160
 Sir, you live with your grandma, right? 

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,960
 Is it possible to transfer the title on the deed tomorrow? 

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,000
 For Young Gook hyungnim's sake, shouldn't you do this? 

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,260
 Did you make the prosecutor trainee conduct an undercover investigation or something? 

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,320
 When that one blows up, you're the one who'll die. 

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
 He's going to prison today, right? 

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,370
 - One million won per week. Our boss is saying you have to pay that. 
 - What if I say no? 

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,050
 The land price has jumped due to redevelopment. You'll have to hand it over to him. 

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,720
 I'll pay you the stake, stay next to him and do me a favor. 

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,420
 Why don't you come to the Central District Prosecutors' Office? 

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,580
 - What if I say I'd stay in the Northern District Prosecutor's office? 
 - Who are you? 

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,100
 Please pay off what you owe to Mr. Jo for your grandma's sake. 

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,360
 What the hell am I supposed to do in here? 

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,750
 Mr. Jo is doing this because it's possible to pay it off from there. 

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,550
 Mr. Jo is doing this because it's possible to pay it off from there. 

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,180
 2345! Detention for 20 days for an unauthorized departure and disobeying orders! 

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,590
 We assumed it was suicide. 

31
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,760
 We retrieved what she had swallowed in her mouth. 

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,550
 Doesn't he know that it's all over for him? 

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,200
 Hong Jae Sun, Mok Jin Hyung, Yoon Byung Wook, and the murderer who killed my grandmother. 

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,160
 I'll finish them all with my own hands. 

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
 What is it? 

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,890
 Texas Hold'em. Please teach me. 

37
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,590
 You'll have to go to the outpatient today. 

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,910
 Outpatient? 

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,630
 If I win, you'll put me in the upper league. 

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,310
 - Song Doo Cheol sent you, right? 
 - No. 

41
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,080
 Shut it off! 

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
 I will become whatever you wish, Yo Han. 

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,250
 Is your offer to help me still valid?
   

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,300
 It's not Lee Tae Gwang. 

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,770
 There's a way to move up without Jang Seon Oh's permission. 

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,310
 Ace of hearts. 

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,370
 Was it you all along, Jang Seon Oh? 

48
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,620
 Why did you help me? 

49
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,640
 Why? Does it hurt your pride? 

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
 If you're interested in playing in the higher league, come on up. 

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,500
 You are not a Judicial Institute trainee anymore. You're a criminal. 

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,450
 Th-third period? What's that? 

53
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,990
 Field training. 

54
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,470
 Every Friday, they have a gambling hall in the Warden's office. 

55
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,050
 What are you doing? 

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,490
 This is all my money. 

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,390
 I thought that Lee Tae Gwang's video would be a lifeline for me. 

58
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,710
 If that's the card I hold, Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung would reinvestigate. 

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,780
 This is Yo Han. I found the video. 

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,810
 December 8th, 15:20. On the northern end of Paldang Bridge. 

61
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,140
 The video of you abandoning my grandmother's body. I saw it all. 

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,150
 I don't know who recorded that video. 

63
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,030
 But he's trying to put a wedge between us! 

64
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,320
 Man, our plan and you! 

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,630
 I still haven't given up on either one! 

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,380
 Until I can find the person who recorded that video, I need this guy. 

67
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,220
 Hyung, can you do me a favor? 

68
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,170
 There should be a ledger. 

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,920
 Nam Dae Moon's slush fund ledger. Find out where that ledger is. 

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,210
 They got to Lee Tae Gwang like this, too... 

71
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,070
 I go down like this just yet... 

72
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,680
 Don't worry. 

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,470
 I won't kill you here. 

74
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,420
 That motherf***er. 

75
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,120
 Each starts with 100 million won, and you're done if you go all-in. 

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,510
 And the winner is the one left at the end. 

77
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,490
 - Hey, Mr. Jang. 
 - Deal. 

78
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,170
 In playing cards or in life, 

79
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,440
 the winner is the one who waits until he gets the nuts. 
 (T/N: nuts - The best possible hand for any arrangement of cards) 

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,700
 I want to kill the bastard who put me away here. 

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,630
 Team up with me and play a game. 

82
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,630
 And Woo Min Ho. He was deeply frightened. 

83
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,740
 That grandmother. Do you know she passed away? 

84
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,080
 Perhaps Woo Min Ho saw the killing of Shin Dal Soo? 

85
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,880
 And Inspector Kwon found out. 

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,450
 Do you understand the reason for my impatience? 

87
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,510
 If we succeed just once, we can beat them tonight. 

88
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,280
 What are you going to do now? 

89
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,780
 Director Jin getting caught while cheating has all been recorded. 

90
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,030
 If you report us, out of all the gambling houses, sites, dens... 

91
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,380
 how many do you think will accept you? 

92
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,220
 I won't take my share. 

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,750
 I'll share all of it with you all. 

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,540
 What is it that you want? 

95
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,580
 You. Someone loyal to money to the end. 

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,830
 Do you know about the Sinseon-dong in here? 

97
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,500
 I'll have to find out for myself how powerful these pythons are. 

98
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,640
 That power... 

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,130
 How much stronger does it need to be? 

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,940
 Do you know... 

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,880
 about the Sinseon-dong in here? 

102
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,720
 Are they Beomtul?
 (T/N: beomtul - Literally means tiger fur, but it means felons with ample detention money in prison) 

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,100
 They are pythons. 

104
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,190
 A thousand-year-old snakes. 

105
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,250
 They are crouched down in the mud right now, 

106
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,220
 but given a chance to get dragon balls, 

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,270
 they'll transform into dragons and ascend into the sky. 

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,910
What are you doing?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,020
If your visitation is over, you should go back.

110
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,320
There is nothing to see here.

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,910
Is this the Shinseon-dong?

112
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,710
Why do you ask?

113
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,380
I just thought I'd get acquainted.

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,450
I don't think the warden would like that.

115
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,010
How much would it take?

116
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,180
Hey...

117
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,820
It's not the money.

118
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,780
Even the warden needs to be summoned if he wants to see them.

119
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,990
He's a warden to us only,

120
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,720
but here...

121
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,080
What else is he going to do now?

122
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,010
   

123
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,130
Yes.

124
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,090
 It's Kim Yo Han. 

125
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,960
Come in.

126
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,920
What is it?

127
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,560
I asked you, what is it?

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,990
Why? Did someone cause trouble again?

129
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,210
Warden.

130
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,560
Who is over at the Shinseon-dong?

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,770
What about it?

132
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,880
I got a call suddenly.

133
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,330
From whom?

134
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,580
I don't know. That's why...

135
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,010
Who is over at the Shinseon-dong?

136
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,340
When did you get the call?

137
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,710
I don't think I should say anything more.

138
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,360
They said not to tell anyone.

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,770
I guess it's you from now on.

140
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,250
Pardon?

141
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,620
When did they tell you to come?

142
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,850
They said you would know that.

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,330
Wait here.

144
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,920
Move!

145
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,920
   

146
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,990
   

147
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,550
Did you come here alone without a guard?

148
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,110
I'll help you.

149
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,440
Don't be nosy.

150
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,570
How are you going to do this all by yourself?

151
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,510
This is my job!

152
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,570
Oh, so you are that guy.

153
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,410
The guy who has the gambling scene.

154
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,030
Yes.

155
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,820
This is not a place for you to be.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,750
I want to meet the leader here.

157
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,490
Aren't you a helper here?

158
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,780
Stop causing trouble.

159
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,860
Stop, or else you'll get into trouble.

160
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,710
Go back.

161
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,000
Take care of your precious life.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,320
Life is precious to all of us.

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,340
Live well without any trouble.

164
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,800
- Don't you watch movies? 
 - Excuse me?

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,860
You know, the ones who ignore the warning of an old man living in a cabin

166
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,590
always get killed first.

167
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,960
Yes.

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,020
I got it.

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,470
Elder!

170
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,930
Aigoo.

171
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Oh, I heard you were asking for him.

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,680
That's why we are here.

173
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,480
Geez, I can't believe a warden got manipulated by rookies like him.

174
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,820
The elders must be getting hungry.

175
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Take him with you.

176
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,120
 Gangnam's king of the loan sharks, Do Won Bong. 

177
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,330
AATP Macau Championship.

178
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,180
Dosan-ro "The White Bear."

179
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,820
 He joined the company as a private investor 

180
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,650
 so he's very reluctant to be in the public eye. 

181
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,800
He must've been a pro at Hold'em.

182
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,620
But he doesn't like gambling.

183
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,050
Maybe he's very competitive?

184
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,100
He only enjoys winning.

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,260
King of loan sharks.

186
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,950
How rich is he?

187
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,610
 Money is not everything. 

188
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,320
 Ones with real money are elsewhere. 

189
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,500
Then...

190
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,400
 I heard that he creates a flow. 

191
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,270
A flow?

192
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,730
 Something that can't be influenced by money, personal connections, or information... 

193
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,810
 You also call it "Luck." 

194
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
It's hard to describe in words,

195
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,650
but if you see him in person, that's exactly how he does it.

196
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,720
Chairman Do, it's been a long time.

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes, Oh Soo Yeon.

198
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,040
Is that your man?

199
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,000
Wow. What kind of chocolate is so heavy?

200
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,990
Chocolate wrapped in gold tastes even better.

201
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,700
Gold wrapped in chocolate wrappers...

202
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,680
I wonder if it'll be my funeral right away if I take them.

203
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,640
Despite their appearance, they come with guarantees.

204
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,640
What if they do a room inspection tonight?

205
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,940
Is it that you don't like the gold...

206
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,530
or am I the problem?

207
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,570
I only came to see Soo Yeon for the first time in a while.

208
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,530
I don't deal with a gambler.

209
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,760
Gamblers, druggies. Same difference...

210
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,420
Chairman, please...

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
Chairman, please think of me, at least.

212
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,430
You are getting old, too.

213
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
 Thank you for everything. 

214
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,900
 Well...Please consider supporting this one also. 

215
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,390
 You should've just bought me some pho. 

216
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,350
 Hurry up and disrobe! 

217
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,750
 Your eyes were sparkly then. 

218
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,920
They've gotten pretty cloudy now.

219
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,260
 Hey, hey! You! 

220
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,180
 A person. 
 (T/N: He speaks the meaning of a Chinese character that means human being) 

221
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,020
 A person creates one's own life. 

222
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,510
 I mean, your life is altered by the person you meet. 

223
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,660
 Put the knife away. 

224
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,070
 And take my hand. 

225
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,200
 Your broken life... 

226
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,430
 I'll fix it for you so you can have a better life. 

227
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,440
Have a good life.

228
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,810
And don't contact me again.

229
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,250
Chairman!

230
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,610
   

231
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,810
   

232
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,790
Got you.

233
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,250
   

234
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,640
- Yes. How long was the visitation? 
 - About an hour.

235
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,210
Until she returns to the store, stay on her.

236
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,610
Yes.

237
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,810
Oh Soo Yeon.

238
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,210
The one you aligned with... is merely Madam Tenpro?

239
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,790
Hong Jae Sun.

240
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,550
Yoon Byung Wook.

241
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,500
Hong Sang Wook.

242
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,300
And...

243
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,840
Jo Hae Do.

244
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,180
The one who informed Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung

245
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,560
of your grandmother Shin Dal Soo's body

246
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,180
is 010-0757-1601. 
    

247
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,160
If that's the case, the one who recorded the video

248
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,300
and the one who killed your grandmother

249
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,400
 is very likely to be 010-0757-1601. 

250
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,700
010-0757-1601.

251
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,620
The one who had the most calls with 1601.

252
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,640
0637. Who could this be?

253
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,930
So... 0637 ordered 1601 to kill my grandmother?

254
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,400
 But my grandmother died... 

255
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,600
 after the Chief Prosecutor Mok blew me off. 

256
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,020
How likely is it that the prosecutors may have killed my grandmother?

257
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,160
I think we need to check all the frequently contacted numbers.

258
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,950
010-0999-9292.

259
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,790
0999-9292...

260
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,380
- 0999... 
  - 0812-8808.

261
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,960
Hold on.

262
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,010
0812-8808. 0812-8808.

263
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,310
0662-9876.

264
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,570
0662-9876.

265
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,580
0662-9876.

266
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,710
But these numbers...

267
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,340
indicate they are still in contact with Jo Hae Do.

268
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,080
Jo Hae Do.

269
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,850
And the number in the middle of it all, 5863.

270
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,740
We'll have to look and see whether this number belongs to him or not.

271
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,390
What? 5863?

272
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,800
0882-5863?

273
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,030
Yes, that number...

274
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,460
But...

275
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,350
I hope...

276
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,950
that Yang Hwa isn't involved here.

277
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,210
Yo Han.

278
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,790
 Yes. 

279
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,610
Have you ever heard the name Yang Hwa?

280
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,560
Yang Hwa?

281
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,820
Chairman Yang Jun's older brother. 
    

282
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,120
He succeeded in conquering the Gangnam area with his younger brother.

283
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,770
 The true leader of the Bukyeongpa gang. 

284
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,510
   

285
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
   

286
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
I think the Seongsu-dong case will be concluded that way. 
    

287
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,060
Lee Ji Hwan's transplant surgery went well, and

288
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,190
he has regained consciousness on Wednesday.

289
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,090
If you tell me a good time,

290
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,380
I can schedule a hospital visit for you.

291
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,590
Team Leader, proceed forward.

292
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,740
As for my visit, I'll have to postpone it for now.

293
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,210
Get ready. 
    

294
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,400
One, two, three. 
    

295
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,830
Fighting!

296
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,400
   

297
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,320
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

298
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,180
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,850
Do you want more?

300
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,390
Thank you.

301
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,610
   

302
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,740
Go to Seongjeo-gu.

303
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,380
CEO.

304
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,630
   

305
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,240
   

306
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,880
- Yes? 
  - I found where Min Ho is. 

307
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,590
Where?

308
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,630
I can't get there right now, though.

309
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,700
What? Why?

310
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,250
 He's next to the Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun right now. 

311
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,540
Prosecutor Hong has put a marker on me as well. 
  (T/N: Marker - Method of tracing someone) 

312
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,770
 Gosh, I'm so sorry about this. 

313
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,480
 I don't think I can do anything for the time being. 

314
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,070
   

315
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,640
   

316
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,730
She said the prosecutor put a marker on her.

317
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,650
In that case, even a phone call is risky.

318
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,030
Their server is in the US. Even if someone higher up than the prosecutor comes,

319
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,350
they can't crack it.

320
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,500
   
 (T/N: A messenger app) 

321
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,310
 Drag Jang Seon Oh into this? 

322
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,720
 Jang Seon Oh... Jang Seon Oh...
   

323
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,020
 Jang Seon Oh...
   

324
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,220
You know that timing is everything when buying a stock, right?

325
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,540
But it's not just with stocks.

326
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,880
Everything in this world is like that.

327
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,310
They want you up in the Warden's office.

328
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,950
   

329
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,680
- No such luck tonight. 
 - No, no...

330
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,040
Warden?

331
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,270
Manager Kim of Seoryeong Construction said he would repay the last loan

332
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,510
as soon as the bank opens in the morning.

333
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,210
I'll finalize the balance tomorrow morning after the deposit is confirmed.

334
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,210
You mean you'll return the laptop tomorrow?

335
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,290
I think I'll have to.

336
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,320
That's what you think.

337
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,940
Write it out by hand and input it tomorrow.

338
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,020
Okay.

339
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,950
I'm getting the feel for it.

340
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,970
Yes!

341
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,080
They are quick.

342
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,410
You heard about the Jincheon village fault-cracking job four years ago, right?

343
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,500
   

344
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,110
   

345
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,230
   

346
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,030
   

347
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,940
   

348
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
   

349
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,250
My stomach hurts.

350
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,740
It's here somewhere.

351
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,680
00_7620...

352
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,240
00_0570...

353
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,180
Isn't that Younghak Industries?

354
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,860
007620 Younghak Industries.

355
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,580
000570 Geojun Construction.

356
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,600
That's what I remember.

357
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
   

358
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,950
   

359
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,350
   

360
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,450
 Younghak Industries, Geojun Construction... 

361
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,220
 This is the number of the virtual account for the detention money. 
   

362
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,480
   

363
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,530
 To 6650. 

364
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,380
 The Warden regularly made deposits into the virtual account. 
   

365
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,880
   

366
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,700
Jang Chul Woo?

367
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,380
Do you know Shinseon-dong?

368
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
Last year,

369
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,580
on March 11,

370
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,750
April 29,

371
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,650
June 4,

372
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,210
and...

373
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,870
Every time you received 2 million won from the Warden,

374
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,910
you went outside, right?

375
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,990
What is it that you do?

376
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,040
Sunbaenim!

377
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,320
Can you bring me a brick?

378
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,510
What brings you here...

379
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,080
at this hour?

380
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,190
Him.

381
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,670
Let him go.

382
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,010
He won't be walking for a while.

383
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,010
On March 11th of last year,

384
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,490
Younghak's CEO, publicly wanted for allegations of stock manipulation, turned himself in.

385
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,000
April 29th, Park Kyung Jin of the ruling party Mujugap,

386
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,260
a member of the Environment and Labor Committee, changed to the opposition party.

387
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,760
June 4th, Shin Seung Yong, the managing director of Geojun Construction, dies in his home.

388
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,000
Presumed suicide. And on Feb. 22,

389
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,260
Jae Young Group's corporate governance restructuring plan was withdrawn.

390
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,350
That day when all these things happened,

391
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,520
our warden received a slush fund from someone.

392
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,200
And also that day, someone

393
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,940
deposited money into 6650's detention money account.

394
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:43,240
Elder, what did you ask 6650 to do?

395
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,380
 What do you want from me? 

396
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,810
I'm looking for a child.

397
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,820
He's been missing for about seven months.

398
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,690
But the child...

399
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,310
whether by legal means...

400
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,850
or money, can't be found.

401
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,930
- Maybe the child's dead. 
 - At the very least, I have to find the body.

402
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,500
And for that to happen...

403
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,860
I need your luck, Elder.

404
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,100
Spoken like a true gambler.

405
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,900
And?

406
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,120
Please be at ease and tell me.

407
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,470
 The job that 6650 had to do... 

408
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,350
 Now, you'll have to do it. 

409
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,390
Go ahead and tell me, please.

410
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,170
You just have to make a delivery to a location.

411
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,290
Is that all?

412
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,110
 A gentleman's revenge 

413
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,530
may take 10 years and still wouldn't be late.

414
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,630
 If you rush, you'll get sick while eating porridge. 

415
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,980
Revenge in people's affairs...

416
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,750
ends with a loss of life.

417
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm telling you not to do anything foolish when you go outside.

418
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,380
I'll make sure no one knows

419
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,120
and return quietly.

420
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,050
This is money for expenses.

421
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,140
And here.

422
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
   

423
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,360
   

424
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,070
Go on.

425
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm sure this wouldn't happen with you, but...

426
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,990
if anything goes wrong,

427
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,480
it's all on you.

428
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,640
   

429
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,660
   

430
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,660
 I could buy you something more delicious. 

431
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,790
I have to get back by 7 o'clock.

432
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,250
By that time, I need to complete Chairman Do's task

433
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,290
and find the child.

434
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,490
I have to eat when I can.

435
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,180
 You'll be out in a little while. 

436
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,600
 I don't know if you should risk being outside like this. 

437
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,330
The one who put a marker on you. Was it Hong Jae Sun?

438
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,400
Inspector Park checked it out

439
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,110
and it's him.

440
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,500
That Inspector Park...

441
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,310
Did she say she can come out today?

442
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,980
 She should be somewhere near you right now. 

443
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
 A pale and pretty girl. 

444
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
What?

445
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,430
Where?

446
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,620
Yes?

447
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,200
- Your name? 
 - Kim Yo Han.

448
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Kim Yo Han.

449
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,800
Seongju Prison?

450
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,570
Yes.

451
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,240
Please go to lecture room 201A.

452
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,870
201A.

453
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,190
   

454
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:41,600
   

455
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,600
   
   

456
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,640
   

457
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,820
 Who is it? 

458
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,180
I'm from Shinji Academy.

459
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,810
I'm from Shinji Academy.

460
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,970
I came to deliver a package.

461
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,880
Now that I've dropped off the package, aren't we done?

462
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,390
See ya...

463
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,670
Look who this is.

464
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,240
That's right.

465
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,030
It's me.

466
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,170
Why are you here?

467
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,190
This is how I'm making a living these days.

468
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,410
I'm so ashamed...

469
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,430
Kim Yo Han, this is all thanks to you.

470
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,870
Even if I want to open up a gambling den, I have no players.

471
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,560
By the way...

472
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,550
what did you do to my crew?

473
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,380
I can't get in touch with them no matter how hard I try.

474
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,570
So, when you get released

475
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,210
are you really going to come over to the gambling scene?

476
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,020
I guess it's not a definite "no"?

477
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,700
Well, I guess...

478
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,810
common people go into debt out there in the world these days,

479
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,250
while paying more to wealthy people.

480
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,120
People go crazy with gambling.

481
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,270
I've delivered the package, so I will leave now.

482
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,300
The lawyer...

483
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,790
You should take him with you.

484
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,720
Godd*** it.

485
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,120
What the—

486
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,880
Hey.

487
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,250
Geez, I'm going to lose it.

488
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,500
Chairman Do didn't tell you it was an exchange?

489
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,910
I wonder why he left out that important piece of information.

490
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,130
I guess you're not Chairman Do's person like the other guy,

491
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,200
but just a part-timer.

492
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,830
Guys... quietly take that lawyer outside.

493
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,510
Yes, sir!

494
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,900
Ever since I met you, nothing has been going right for me.

495
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,160
You are my destroyer who came to ruin my life.

496
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,700
My Tamago. 
  (T/N: Monster) 

497
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,860
My barricade.

498
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,810
Let's end this ill-fated relationship here and now.

499
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,970
What the?

500
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,010
Did Chairman Do Won Bong send you?

501
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes.

502
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Then come this way.

503
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,830
These crazy bastards. How dare you double up on me?

504
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,280
Geez, these bastards!

505
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,940
Motherf***ers.

506
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,440
Sir! Sir!

507
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,430
Yes, sir.

508
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,510
Did you locate Woo Sang Ki?

509
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,300
 Yes, I'm still in the process of finding him. 

510
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,040
Why?

511
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,970
Is there a problem?

512
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,460
No.

513
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,250
Yes, I'm...

514
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,080
I'm in the middle of taking care of some things.

515
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,700
Yes.

516
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,130
Sir? Sir?

517
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,840
Excuse me?

518
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,150
I'm Inspector Park Ro Sa from the Inspector General Office Headquarters.

519
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,310
Can I see your ID, please?

520
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,570
Me?

521
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,890
Why?

522
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,200
Isn't that blood on your raincoat?

523
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,510
Oh, this...

524
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,760
It's pig's blood. You shouldn't touch it.

525
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,510
And the knife behind your back?

526
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,630
Can you show me the knife?

527
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,350
The knife...

528
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,200
I don't have one.

529
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,720
Did you check with the Inspector General Office?

530
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,360
 Yes, she is an inspector. 

531
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,860
 Please come to the Samcheong Station. 

532
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,950
Understood.

533
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,360
What's that?

534
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,190
Hey, bastard!

535
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,950
Hold still!

536
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,990
Get him!

537
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,890
This way.

538
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,620
I think he's one of Chairman Do's people.

539
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,370
Is there someplace we can go besides a hospital around here?

540
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,700
Yes, there is. How are you, Yo Han?

541
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,590
I'm okay.

542
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,330
How about your marker?

543
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,310
Hey.

544
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,340
Go find the child. Hurry.

545
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,560
There isn't much time left.

546
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,100
   

547
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,210
Just focus on the child for now.

548
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,660
It's about whether or not we can secure the eyewitness.

549
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,850
All or nothing.

550
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,870
Hyungnim, let's go. Let's go.

551
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,610
Hyungnim!

552
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,580
Here.

553
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,070
Oh, the pictures are from our previous event. 
    

554
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,710
Can I meet the child in the picture?

555
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,030
Oh, I don't think he's one of ours.

556
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,750
Min Ho.

557
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,730
 It's my first time seeing him. 

558
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,090
We had so many outside guests that day.

559
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,170
I see. Is that right?

560
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,120
 Let's go! Hey! 

561
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,140
Min Ho.

562
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,120
Min Ho!

563
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,560
Oh, no. Are you okay?

564
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,540
You can't run around like a mouse.

565
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,710
Hey, hand over what you need to give me before you go.

566
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,380
How can you take that with you?

567
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,530
Let's talk outside.

568
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,490
Hey kid, go over there!

569
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,430
Hey kid, go! Hurry!

570
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,010
Bastard!

571
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,450
Who's that kid?

572
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,190
Go!

573
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,970
Min Ho, hurry up and go!

574
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,180
 This news bulletin just in. 

575
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,100
 The police vehicle returning to the station after arresting a man was attacked 

576
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,470
 by assailants in a van. 

577
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,250
 The man who was arrested has fled the scene. 

578
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,530
 Today at 2:30 p.m. in an alley in Sangji-dong, Seoul, 

579
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,520
 a man with a weapon was arrested by the police. 
    

580
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,790
 When the police vehicle carrying A approached a quiet area, 
    

581
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,590
 a van cut in front of the police vehicle and collided with it. 

582
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,460
 The men who got off the van and who showed up from the opposite side of the road 
    

583
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,600
 help A run away from the scene. 

584
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,800
 These men helped A's escape, and disappeared in a flash. 

585
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,900
   

586
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,390
 Koo Bon Chul. 

587
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,260
 Did you find the child? 

588
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,440
Yes. I'm with him now.

589
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,070
I'm being pursued by Jo Hae Do.

590
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,790
But... right now... I...

591
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,050
That's quick.

592
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,830
I can't reach Inspector Park.

593
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,270
I wonder if something happened.

594
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,510
Considering Jo Hae Do, that's a possibility.

595
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,390
What do we do?

596
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,110
Get over here quickly.

597
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,320
If you get caught outside like this, it's a jailbreak for you, Yo Han.

598
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,330
I can take care of Hong Jae Sun, but...

599
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,900
Send me the address. I'll leave right now.

600
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,120
All right.

601
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,890
Let's go.

602
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,880
Should I tail?

603
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,030
Do you think Kim Yo Han really came outside?

604
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,750
The visitation is not possible?

605
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,810
That's right.

606
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,190
We found a clue to the culprit of Shin Dal Soo's case.

607
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,750
Did you tell him that?

608
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,440
Yes.

609
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,110
If that wasn't the case, why did she lose the marker?

610
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,090
"I know I have a marker."

611
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,610
She's already revealing all that.

612
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,980
Tell them to lose her on the way.

613
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,170
And we'll be on her tail.

614
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,800
Yes, sir.

615
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,580
Are you hurt?

616
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,430
It's nothing.

617
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,360
People will come and help soon.

618
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,380
Let's wait a little bit. You can do it, right?

619
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,680
Ahjussi, are you Yo Han hyung?

620
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,350
You must've met my grandmother.

621
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,990
Yes.

622
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,330
I'll help you.

623
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,490
I'll help you, so...

624
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,600
you have to save my dad, Hyung.

625
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,740
Your dad?

626
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,570
The person who kidnapped my dad and me...

627
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,340
Is the one who killed your grandmother.

628
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,570
See ya...

629
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,810
Yes, sir.

630
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,710
I think he's around here somewhere.

631
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:50,290
 But these numbers are still in contact with Jo Hae Do. 

632
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,400
Yes. No, sir.

633
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,820
No, it's not that.

634
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,400
   

635
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,550
   

636
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,690
Let's go.

637
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,030
Peekaboo.

638
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,450
You bastards...

639
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,780
Let's go!

640
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,410
Min Ho...

641
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,250
Envelope?

642
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,730
The envelope that Chairman Do told you to give to me.

643
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:33,950
 Have you ever heard the name Yang Hwa? 

644
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,260
 Yang Hwa? 

645
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,930
 Chairman Yang Joon's older brother. 

646
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,180
 He succeeded in conquering the Gangnam area with his younger brother. 

647
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,900
 The true leader of Bukyeongpa gang. 

648
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,990
   

649
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,730
 Yo Han... 

650
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,860
 If you run into him just run away. 

651
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,450
Yo Han, get in the car! Prosecutor Hong is here also. Hurry!

652
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,430
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon!

653
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,090
   

654
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:16,920


655
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,760
 Jae Sun, end it in Seongju Prison. 

656
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,630
 The fact that a current prosecutor wants Kim Yo Han... 

657
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,560
 If the word spreads in prison, who knows? 

658
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,330
 We might get something on top of it. 

659
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:37,800
 You must run away first, Warden. 

660
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,420
 So that both you and the gambling house will survive, Warden. 

661
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,580
 If we leave like this, Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun will catch us. 

662
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,850
 We'll push on out from here. Contact me after you get inside. 

663
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:48,370
 If something goes wrong with Oh Soo Yeon, it's all your fault. 

664
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,840
 Kim Yo Han, you bastard! 

665
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,150
 Help me! 

666
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,760
 This is a game you've already lost! 

667
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,270
 Please stop Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun. 

668
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,000
 That's a no deal. 

669
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,280
 What is it that you really want to say? 

670
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,400
 Go and kill a person.
