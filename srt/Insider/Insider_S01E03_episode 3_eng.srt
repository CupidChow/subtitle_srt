1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,760
   

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,020
   

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,450
   

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,100
   

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,970


6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,130
   

7
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,130
 The trump card has a total of four pictures. 

8
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,250
 It has a total of 52 cards. 

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,450
 And those 52 cards can create for the first two cards a variety of 

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,130
 169 different hands. 

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,320
 After receiving a hand of the first two cards, 

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,980
 you have to know how your cards are stacked up against the other hands. 

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,390
- Raise. 
  - A pair of Aces is considered the top rank cards. 

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,600
 A pair of aces is considered the best hand in all the games, 

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,800
 but how about a 10-double? 

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,120
 How do you think a 10-double would rank? 

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,530
 Ace one pair, K one pair, Q one pair, J one pair. 

18
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,810
 Isn't that a fifth-place hand? 

19
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,930
 In Hold'em, a pair of tens is lower than a pair of A and K. 

20
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,010
 So starting now, from 1st to 169th, 

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,960
 I will recite it for you. 

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,630
A-All at once?

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,680
Why? Do you want me to do it in parts?

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,580
No, go ahead.

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,000
W-Wait...

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,080
 (TN: He chants the hands in the rhythm of Buddhist chant) 

27
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,230
 Do you know how to calculate a winning percentage? 

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,220
 Imagine I have a 7 and an 8. 

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,600
 The received hand has a 7 and an 8. 

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,670
 And the middle is lined up with a 5, 6, and an A. 

31
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,880
 If a 4 or 9 comes up, it's a straight. 

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,810
 Is this worth a match? 

33
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,910
There is a total of four 4's

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,410
and four 9's.

35
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,550
And there are 8 cards that can create a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

36
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,710
 You have only a few out of the 8 cards. 

37
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,690
You can say that your opponent has beat you in this game.

38
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,770
 If you subtract those 5 from the total of 52 cards, and out of the remaining 47, 

39
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,800
 if eight cards belong to me... 

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Eight out of 47 cards...

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,880
The probability of getting one of eight cards on the next turn is 17%.

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,570
If going all the way to the river, then it's twice that at 34%.

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,250
 In Hold'em, the position... 

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,980
 Your place is very important in this game. 

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,560
   

46
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,530
   

47
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,800
 Those who have to bet from the start like this 
    

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,300
 have no choice but to inevitably expose themselves 
    

49
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,880
 to others by how they bet. 
    

50
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,470
- Call. 
 -  Those who bet later 

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,240
 can plan their moves according to how the others made their bets 

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,970
 so it's very advantageous. 

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,710
 Even though they may have the same hands, 

54
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:23,200
 they can have a different result. 

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,770
I see...

56
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,660
I... think I'll be leaving shortly.

57
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,050
I've lost my sense of time.

58
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,610
Even though it may not be exact.

59
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,330
By any chance,

60
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,540
are you Lee Tae Gwang?

61
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,320
Are you asleep?

62
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,340
Sir...

63
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,180
Hey, 2345.

64
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,480
I called out to the one in the next room, but there was no response.

65
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,840
He went back to his room last night.

66
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
- What? 
 - You need to come out, too, 2345.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your twenty days are over.

68
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,120
What's with you?

69
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,400
Please give me one more chance.

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,440
I can even pay for the game myself with the detention money I received.

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,090
The money you lost before, I will get it back,

72
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,960
including interest.

73
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,500
And... I will go up to the 1st league

74
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,580
and will surely complete

75
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,250
what you asked of me.

76
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,510
Fold.

77
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,300
Fold.

78
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,370
Fold.

79
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,900
Fold.

80
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,980
 This, I can do. 

81
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,960
Raise.

82
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,770
Call and raise.

83
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,140
 I'm guessing he has a good hand. Let's check the flop. 

84
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,500
Call.

85
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,850
Flop.

86
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,950
Check.

87
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,720
Check.

88
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,040
 He also has a mediocre hand. 

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,600
 If he has even one Jack, he would've bet instead of checking, 

90
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,480
 but he raised before even seeing the first three cards. 

91
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,260
 He may not have a J, but he might have at least a pair. 

92
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,700
Turn.

93
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,600
 I got a J, 4, two pair. 

94
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
 Let's find out what he's got. 

95
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,720
Raise.

96
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,530
Call.

97
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,460
River.

98
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,290
 It's impossible to make a flush with five diamonds. 

99
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,290
 No straight either. 

100
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,790
 Let's bet aggressively and see how he reacts. 

101
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,490
Raise a carton.

102
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,880
- What a man! 
 - He's the bomb.

103
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay! Call.

104
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,730
All in.

105
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,270
That's right! Right on!

106
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,600
- Amazing! 
 - Look at that.

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Look at that.

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,300
 All right. Are you for real or are you bluffing? 

109
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,020
 What's certain is that you think I'm a pushover. 

110
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,480
 You're looking at me as someone beneath you. 

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,640
 You are bluffing. 

112
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,850
Call.

113
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,230
Another raise.

114
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,150
Is he raising again?

115
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,070
I'm getting chills. The chills...

116
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,750
What's this? 
    

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,630
Wow, what the heck?

118
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,360
Hey, what are you doing?

119
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,130
- If you've lost it all, get up. 
 - One second.

120
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,120
Wait!

121
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,750
D*mn it!

122
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,120
W-Wait...

123
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,080
Okay.

124
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,160
All of you should go to sleep.

125
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,530
It's time to start taking care of your physical condition.

126
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,830
Gil Sang, do you know what movie they are planning to show?

127
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,380
Yes, well, I'm not sure what it's about, but it's two and a half hours long.

128
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,390
That's enough.

129
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,060
He will be getting out soon. If you miss this day,

130
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,430
there's no next year.

131
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,180
Yes, Hyungnim.

132
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
   

133
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,210
Two.

134
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,190
Four.

135
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,770
Six.

136
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,670
Eight.

137
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,970
Each pack is 50 so it's 400 altogether.

138
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,330
This should be more than enough to cover the last three weeks' missed payment plus interest.

139
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,470
You freak, do you think this is money?

140
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,160
That's why...

141
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm including one extra for labor.

142
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,710
Wow, I'm dumbfounded.

143
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,290
You guys were also after my house instead of money.

144
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,660
Don't I just have to pay the price that matches the money I owe?

145
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,920
We do have a debtor-creditor relationship, but we are in jail.

146
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,880
For a person to leave as a cripple,

147
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,400
isn't strange at all.

148
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,120
What is it?

149
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,810
Paying for damages.

150
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,060
Hey!

151
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,120
Back off. Back off!

152
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,170
How dare you puny gamblers act like gangsters?

153
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,110
We can beat them 500,000 won worth, right?

154
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,350
I don't think this is enough, though...

155
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,340
Bite down, or you'll lose your teeth.

156
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,560
Does none of the prison staff want to take you to the break room yet? 
  (T/N: going up to the next league) 

157
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,820
No, not yet.

158
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,830
Then it'll take some time to see Jang Seon Oh's face.

159
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,890
As for these flowers, you have to keep looking at them, touch them.

160
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,770
That's how the friendship blossoms.

161
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,480
You'll have to go to the outpatient today.

162
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,950
- Outpatient? 
 - Yes.

163
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,570
That guy is pretty much in the infirmary all the time.

164
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,700
So go and smell some antiseptic and make some friends before coming back here.

165
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,430
Gil Sang will help you.

166
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,090
Come on!

167
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,680
Let go! Let go of me!

168
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,260
Come on!

169
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,190
If your hand is injured, it'll affect you holding cards at night,

170
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,460
but if we stab your stomach with the hoe or shovel,

171
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,970
we have to worry about you getting tetanus.

172
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,410
So, unfortunately, your ankle will need to be twisted in an unusual way.

173
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,250
- What? 
 - But it's going to hurt a lot.

174
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,500
Let me go. Hold on. Hold on, hold on!

175
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,150
Do you have to do this?

176
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,020
If your injury isn't convincing, then Jang Seon Oh will cause you even more pain.

177
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,990
Can you– Can you do it on one try?

178
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,410
Yes.

179
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,690
Sh*t.

180
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,750
Do what you want to do.

181
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,910
I didn't want to do this, but

182
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,040
here, bite down on this.

183
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,070
You can scream out as loud as you want.

184
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,470
Hey, scream as much as you want!

185
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,190
I'm going.

186
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,670
 That guy is pretty much in the infirmary all the time. 

187
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,770
Who is there? Who are you?

188
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,870
I'm hungry. Give me some bread.

189
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,910
Give me some bread. 
    

190
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,560
Give me some bread, I said!

191
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,720
   

192
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,190
   

193
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,150
   

194
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,200
What are you doing?

195
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,510
Sang 1, Room 8. It's Yangbang!

196
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,350
He was going through your room.

197
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,030
My room?

198
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
Why?

199
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,720
Please accept me into the first league.

200
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,330
I came in here with a gambling debt from the den.

201
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,810
That's why I need money.

202
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,580
I see...

203
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,420
Is that right?

204
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,110
What the...

205
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,560
Well, since you came this far, let's go for a massage. 
  (T/N: Massage: A one-on-one gamble) 

206
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,210
If you win, I'll consider your request.

207
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,360
Hey, did you fix the generator?

208
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,810
All right. Your hand?

209
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,140
Watch, this is level 1.

210
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,070
This is level 2.

211
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,420
Dean, Dean! 
  (T/N: Seon Oh's nickname, since slang for prison is "school") 

212
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,400
And we'll go for level 9.

213
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,310
The one who guesses his card first wins.

214
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,280
And the game money is

215
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,340
the truth.

216
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,250
If you get caught lying, this will drop into the bucket.

217
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,260
You'll be wearing a diaper for the rest of your life.

218
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,880
So make sure to guess correctly what's on your forehead

219
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,770
or only tell the truth.

220
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,990
If I win, you'll put me in the upper league.

221
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,530
- Song Doo Cheol sent you, right? 
 - No.

222
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,480
- Five of hearts. 
 - What did that old man say?

223
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,100
- I told you it's nothing like that. 
 - Ace of spade.

224
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,410
Ten of hearts.

225
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,950
How are you going to pay back the damages to Mr. Jo's gambling house?

226
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,720
Did Song Doo Cheol tell you he'll cover your debt?

227
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,900
Ace of hearts.

228
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,110
Ace of hearts.

229
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,130
If you move up to the front and stay by my side...

230
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,420
He must've instructed you to cut my head off while I sleep, right?

231
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,200
You just fell for your own lies, didn't you?

232
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,140
Stop right there.

233
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,150
You're holding the lie right now.

234
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,610
When people lie, there are certain habits people display.

235
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,700
It's a physical reaction that shows up, like locking and loading right before lying.

236
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,340
But with you, that comes out of your hand.

237
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,190
Why did you come here?

238
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,570
Shut it off!

239
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
 2345! 2345! 

240
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
 Are you awake? 

241
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,250
 It was an electrocution. He needs a complete physical exam. 

242
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,700
It's fine as long as he's awake. Come out now.

243
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,590
Geez, he needs to change his clothes too.

244
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,760
I said no.

245
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,990
He may look fine on the outside, but he could come down with septicemia.

246
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,340
This is a special VIP visit.

247
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,420
The VIP has been waiting for him for an hour in the Sinseon-dong.

248
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,990
Sinseon-dong? 
  (T/N: a new building, but it has a deeper connotation here) 

249
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,900
What are you doing? Hurry up and get up.

250
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,700
Get up.

251
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,970
Get up. Come on.

252
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,780
That way.

253
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,260
2345.

254
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,930
Change into this.

255
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,710
Hurry up and get changed.

256
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,980
 You'll have to go to the outpatient today. 

257
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,570
 - Song Doo Cheol sent you, right? 
 - No. 

258
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,250
 Did Song Doo Cheol tell you he'll cover your debt? 

259
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,060
 Then I'll take care of Hae Do for you. 

260
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,330
 You're holding the lie right now.
 

261
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,050
This is the lawyer consulting room.

262
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,240
You're going over there. To Sinseon-dong.

263
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,990
Hurry on over there.

264
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,920
One gangster, two gangsters...

265
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
one prosecutor, two prosecutors...

266
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,350
one avenger...

267
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
two avengers.

268
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Six percent bank account is full...

269
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,810
flop and 36 families of victims, Corruption Investigation Agency, Tokarev.

270
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,800
Turn and Seongju Prison

271
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,680
and river, river, river...

272
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,340
As long as I get the river, the small blind will die.

273
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,390
And the big blind...

274
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,610
 If you waited a bit, you could've gotten off at Seocho-dong. 

275
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,490
 Why are you trying to ruin it all? 

276
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,810
It's been a while.

277
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,090
 Hello, Yo Han. 

278
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,470
 We'll see each other soon. 

279
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,270
Well, it can't be because of the clothes.

280
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,080
You seem so different in such a short amount of time.

281
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,900
Who are you?

282
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,860
What do you know about my grandmother's incident?

283
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,470
If you want to hear my answer, you go first.

284
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,920
Why did you call the cops that day?

285
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,690
 The cops are on their way. 

286
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,590
 Do you want a ride to the bottom of the mountain? 

287
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,420
 You knew the cops were coming that night also. 

288
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,250
 No. I'll stay a little longer. 

289
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,470
For what reason did you turn that mountain upside down?

290
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,490
Chairman Yang?

291
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,520
 Welcome, Hyungnim. 

292
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,970
 It's good to see you, Mr. Jo. 

293
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,610
 Chairman Yang. 

294
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,450
 The Skin-nation. 

295
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,820
 It's nice here. 

296
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,390
 - Hello, Chairman Yang. 
 - Hey, Soo Yeon! 

297
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,710
 - How have you been? 
 - I've been well, of course. 

298
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,890
 Why are you standing in line? Looks so cheesy. 

299
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,460
He had been indicted a few times for gambling abroad but was released.

300
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,560
Why did you keep checking up on Chairman Yang?

301
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,220
 According to the tabloid rumors, 

302
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,720
Hong Sang Wook of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office is said to be behind it.

303
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,510
 Did you also know that your colleague Hong Jae Sun's father, 

304
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,850
 Chief Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook of the Central Investigation Division, is behind him? 

305
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,860
Does Mr. Jo still have a strangle on you?

306
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,930
I asked who you were.

307
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,660
   

308
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,910
   

309
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,500
I will become whatever you wish, Yo Han.

310
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,910
 Raccoon is missing. 
 (T/N: Code for "Missing target") 

311
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,900
 Looking around. 

312
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 Gosh, it's ticklish. 

313
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,550
 I'll just be your pushover. 

314
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,790
 I'll go to the Ladies' Room before I go. 

315
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,150
 I'll see you next week at the Palace. 

316
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,690
 Okay, I'll see you next week. 

317
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,100
 Yes. 

318
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,020
 5735. This one? 

319
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,810
 I pressed it. 

320
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,090
 Is that it then? 

321
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,960
 What about the camera? 

322
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,660
 Do you see it? 

323
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,440
 Yes? 

324
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,620
   

325
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,950
I brought in 2345.

326
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,500
Have a seat over there.

327
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,490
I understand you were about to graduate from the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

328
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,410
That's pretty intense.

329
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,120
So you're playing cards in here again?

330
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,620
No, no.

331
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,710
Don't worry. I'm not leading you with questions.

332
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,610
Hold'em is not gambling. It's a sport. A recreation.

333
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,730
Like a game of Go or Gomoku.

334
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,460
I think a recreation like that could be enjoyed

335
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,360
in here in our free time.

336
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,050
I think the human rights of prisoners are important.

337
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,930
However, you shouldn't become addicted to it.

338
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,680
Then that would become a problem for all of us.

339
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,030
So who was the visitor earlier?

340
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,200
No.

341
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,520
It's rare for the Department of Justice to directly request a change of venue,

342
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,430
unless it's by the higher-ups in Sinseon-dong over here.

343
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,790
Who was that VIP visitor?

344
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,440
If you return to your room like this, what will you tell Song Doo Cheol?

345
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,500
In order to maintain a gambling den here, you have to be extremely careful.

346
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,870
You have to be aware of everything that happens here.

347
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,400
That's the reason why I'm asking you.

348
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,700
So you can relax and just tell me.

349
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,410
Who was it?

350
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:51,730
Who was the Department of Justice VIP who came to visit you?

351
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,390
- May I? 
 - Sure.

352
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,070
At the gambling house, when I was outside,

353
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,030
she had faced some trouble there.

354
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,780
And I helped her with it.

355
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,060
A little bit.

356
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,010
Is that right?

357
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,680
So that's what happened.

358
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,770
So that's who that was...

359
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,350
Gosh, really.

360
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,420
Here. Have another one.

361
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,600
What do I need to do if I want to move up to the 1st league?

362
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,280
Actually, I hear you keep winning in 3rd league.

363
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,060
But the proper order is for you to be verified in 2nd league before moving up.

364
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,170
But let's see...

365
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,720
You are on good terms with Jang Seon Oh.

366
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,130
That concerns me a little bit.

367
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,480
Unless you can defeat Jang Seon Oh yourself.

368
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,710
That's right.

369
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,580
Then he has no reason to stand against you.

370
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,350
Yes, that's it!

371
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,830
Did you meet with him?

372
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,240
Yes.

373
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,960
How did you meet him?

374
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,290
Pardon?

375
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,950
Even if you went into the infirmary,

376
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,830
I don't think he'd just be anywhere.

377
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,900
I went to look for him in his solitary cell.

378
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,100
Did he open the door for you?

379
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,150
Actually, he was just coming out of the room.

380
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,020
And nobody was there to bother you?

381
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,430
No, I wasn't in any more danger, thanks to you.

382
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,760
All right.

383
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,660
When did they ask you to come in for a checkup?

384
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,130
They told me to come once a week to get medicine.

385
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,910
Good job.

386
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,840
Here he comes, Hyungnim.

387
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,670
Since you keep winning lately, even the warden wants to talk to you.

388
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,430
Mr. Hwang, in Occupational Training, even got a new car.

389
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,100
 Unless you can defeat Jang Seon Oh yourself. 

390
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,580
 Then he has no reason to stand against you. 

391
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,630
- I mean, look at you. 
  - Jang Seon Oh... 

392
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,250
- You have to win now. 
  - I have to beat Jang Seon Oh. 

393
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,300
- Geez, the gambling is so... 
  - But how? 

394
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,660
- But it doesn't seem... 
  - So, do you want me to teach you? 

395
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,930
 What if he is... 

396
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,970
 - Lee Tae Gwang?  
 - 2345.

397
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,380
How much is it to make a phone call?

398
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,040
- Fifty won, isn't it? 
 - Not the landline.

399
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,740
Your cell phone.

400
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,690
That's not allowed.

401
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,120
Yes, that's a violation.

402
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,180
Would a cost of a car be enough?

403
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,000
Here.

404
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,140
Enjoy your phone call.

405
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,550
Hello?

406
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,480
This is Kim Yo Han.

407
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,540
 Whose cell phone is this? 

408
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,550
What you said earlier about helping me, do you still mean it?

409
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,760
What do you need?

410
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,280
I need some money.

411
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,920
And Lee Tae—

412
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,860
 5735. This one? 

413
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,930
 Yes, I pressed it. 

414
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,730
 Is that it then? 

415
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,230
I don't know his name.

416
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,120
But when I was in solitary confinement, he was in the room next to mine.

417
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,870
I'm looking for him.

418
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,870
 Let me talk to the owner of this cell phone. 

419
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,680
 It's not Lee Tae Gwang. 

420
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,450
Is your name...

421
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,430
Just... call me Professor.

422
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:48,800
 So starting now, from 1st to 169th, I will recite it for you. 

423
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,000
I heard you've been looking for me rather desperately.

424
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,990
He's the one.

425
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,700
The one who was in the room next to you.

426
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,040
Why did you help me?

427
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,150
You needed my help then.

428
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,030
And back then,

429
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,750
this...

430
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,900
I was better than you.

431
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,060
This gambling thing needs more than just a theory.

432
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,150
You need to have guts.

433
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,480
So why were you looking for me?

434
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,770
It must've cost you some money to get help from the prison staff.

435
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,270
Lee Tae Gwang.

436
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,530
Where can I find him?

437
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,250
Lee Tae Gwang... Lee Tae Gwang?

438
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,490
Lee Tae Gwang...

439
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,430
He's in the infirmary now.

440
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,510
You can't go back there now.

441
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:10,270
Then can you set up a meeting with him outside the infirmary?

442
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,620
- That's going to be tough. 
 - I'll give you a commission.

443
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,990
Money is not the problem.

444
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,990
It's the Dean that's the problem, you know?

445
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,730
Jang Seon Oh.

446
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,540
I'm done.

447
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,280
Fold.

448
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,670
Raise.

449
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,990
Fold.

450
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,830
When will you get to the 2nd league?

451
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,540
It won't be long.

452
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,190
In business,

453
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,360
you have to go full force when you've got the momentum.

454
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,190
Look at this.

455
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,570
Once the flow stops, I can't start another game the way I want to play it.

456
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,030
I'll fix it.

457
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,030
I heard you're dilly-dallying at the gambling den lately.

458
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Are Mr. Jo's guys still bothering you?

459
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,320
No, Sir.

460
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,660
It's not like you have any family to worry about outside.

461
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,840
You just have to shape up.

462
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,310
Yes, I'll stay focused.

463
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,080
You are not alone anymore.

464
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,560
Gil Sang?

465
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,950
What! What is this?

466
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,020
It's because we are out of time.

467
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,070
- Time? 
 - Yes, something like that.

468
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,930
You'll find out soon enough.

469
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,290
Hyungnim, the fertilizer storage room is locked.

470
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,950
Hey, let's do it there.

471
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,280
Wait!

472
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,300
No! No!

473
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,310
It's hard to hurt yourself the first time, but the second time is...

474
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,360
- Put the tape on him. 
 - No, don't!

475
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,540
Don't!

476
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,620
I'm sorry. This greenhouse is not soundproof.

477
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,920
Hey, stop acting like amateurs. Hold him tight!

478
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,250
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

479
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,540
I'll get it done in one blow.

480
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,990
Okay...

481
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,740
What the hell are you doing?

482
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,970
Our newbie was messing around so we just wanted to scare him a bit.

483
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,420
You call this just scaring him? Looks like you're about to kill him!

484
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,510
Everyone who was holding down 2345, stand over there. Do it now!

485
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,710
2345, are you hurt?

486
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,210
I'm fine.

487
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,960
Get up. Get up.

488
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,350
Careful.

489
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,290
I should take you all in. D*mn it!

490
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,590
Let's go. You're fine now.

491
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,970
Excuse me...

492
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,640
Why did you help me again?

493
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,360
For a person to help another person,

494
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,190
should there be a reason?

495
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,430
- What about Lee Tae Gwang—  
 - Geez, I said I can't.

496
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,270
I didn't help you, so I can arrange a meeting with Lee Tae Gwang.

497
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,110
Actually,

498
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:00,770
there's a way to move up without Jang Seon Oh's permission.

499
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,850
You know...

500
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,350
You can get on the Warden's good side.

501
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,470
If Jang Seon Oh objects...

502
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,700
Not if your sponsor is more powerful than him.

503
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,060
In the 2nd league,

504
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,630
you know that the prison staff members sponsor the game fee

505
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,070
and take a cut of the winnings, right?

506
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,300
So if you keep winning in 2nd league and move on upward,

507
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,040
the sponsor keeps getting a cut of the winnings.

508
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,680
So it's important for the sponsor for his player

509
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,200
to play in the 1st league.

510
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,990
In other words,

511
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,600
as long as the player is skillful

512
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,480
and if the sponsor is powerful enough,

513
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,460
you can definitely move on upward.

514
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,430
Which sponsor is powerful?

515
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,800
In ranking order, after the warden,

516
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,590
it's the security manager.

517
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,430
 I hear the security manager is a house manager. 

518
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,770
And that security manager is

519
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,860
a hoobae from my hometown.

520
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:20,160
If you want, I can make the introduction, but...

521
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,340
But?

522
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,620
The commission you mentioned before.

523
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,460
How about 40% of your winnings?

524
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,990
My stomach is full, but why am I still hungry?

525
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,010
Hunger pang like that isn't good for you.

526
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,760
Food is dangerous,

527
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,850
but money doesn't make you fat.

528
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,950
I also have a debt to repay.

529
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,240
How about taking just 30%?

530
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,960
All the players I select give me 60%.

531
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,200
Same for all.

532
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,160
How about increasing it little by little?

533
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,200
You are the one who came looking for me.

534
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,170
No?

535
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,260
I'll get you the 60.

536
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,920
If you lose, you lose your own money.

537
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,490
If you win,

538
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,080
then it's mine.

539
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,740
I understand.

540
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,020
Lunch is on me.

541
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,030
Check, please.

542
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,750
Hey.

543
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,510
   

544
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,710
Call.

545
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,520
- Call. 
 - Call.

546
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,570
Call.

547
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,440
Call.

548
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,750
All in.

549
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,500
I'm out.

550
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,740
- Fold. 
 - Fold.

551
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,380
Where is the confidence you showed while playing Seotda? 
  (T/N: Seotda: Type of game played with Hwatu) 

552
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,570
How does it feel to be robbed blind?

553
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,720
Maybe because I was beaten silly.

554
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,470
I'm craving some meat. It's driving me crazy.

555
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,500
How about you, Monk? You can't eat tripe, can you?

556
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,760
Aigoo. Didn't you know that I'm a fake monk?

557
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,110
I go crazy for tripe.

558
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,670
Is that right?

559
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,990
If we have to afford your share of meat, Monk, we must have it out with him.

560
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,860
Hey, Dealer, why are you holding up the hand?

561
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,580
Wow, what's going on here?

562
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,470
All the enemies are gathered around one table.

563
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,370
Take a rest.

564
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,960
It's okay if I watch, right?

565
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,880
I just want to know how good you guys are.

566
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,350
Okay?

567
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,410
 You're holding the lie right now. 

568
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,980
By the way, Yangbang...

569
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,460
My body still smells like it's burnt.

570
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,180
All right...

571
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,020
What are you doing? Blind, come on.

572
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,940
How about you go first, ahjussi? Action!

573
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,850
Call.

574
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,380
Call.

575
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,640
Two 10s.

576
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,740
Call.

577
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,190
Raise 80.

578
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,820
I see you.

579
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,870
Call.

580
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,520
Call.

581
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,090
Call.

582
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,840
Call.

583
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,430
Call.

584
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,830
Flop.

585
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,240
I'm going all in.

586
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,090
Fold.

587
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,200
- Fold. 
 - Fold.

588
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,730
Fold.

589
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,450
Here you go. Aigoo.

590
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,960
All for me.

591
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,320
- Congratulations. 
 - Gosh, thank you.

592
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,050
There.

593
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,770
Flop.

594
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,330
Geez, my ear hurts!

595
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,730
If you keep doing that, I'll cut off your wrist.

596
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,060
I don't think I'm the one who should lose a wrist.

597
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,190
Oh, did you get some education already?

598
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,520
Also, do you know how to cheat?

599
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,660
 I should know it well. 

600
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,690
In a scam, several people group together to cheat against one.

601
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,200
They do it by exchanging silent signs amongst each other.

602
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,830
I use the color of the chips.

603
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,580
Colors?

604
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,460
 The quickest thing your eye catches are colors. 

605
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,470
 White chip is a diamond... 

606
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,220
 Green chip is a clover, 

607
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,910
 blue chip is a spade, 

608
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,580
 and red chip is a heart. 

609
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,900
 If you use your right thumb, index, and middle finger to push the chip, then it's K. 

610
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,920
 But if you do the same with your left hand, then Q. 

611
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,520
 If you use both hands to round up the chips and push forward, then J. 

612
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,260
 Q spade. 

613
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:11,700
 If you use your index and middle finger to push the chips in a V shape, then it's an ace. 

614
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,850
 Ace of hearts. 

615
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,700
 Was it you all along, Jang Seon Oh? 

616
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:27,500
 Faking you by making noise with the chips, 

617
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:34,500
 they're communicating through hand gestures holding the chips and the colors. 

618
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,710
Raise.

619
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,110
I see you.

620
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,690
Call it.

621
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,330
Call.

622
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,360
 Q spade and ace of hearts. 

623
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,040
 Did Jang Seon Oh just signal me the monk's hand? 

624
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,360
 Or... 

625
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,010
 Why did Jang Seon Oh help me from the adjacent room? 

626
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,110
 What does he get by helping me? 

627
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,540
 But when you fake out another fake... 

628
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,910
 The real sign is... 

629
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,620
 communicating through the amount of the exchanging bets. 

630
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,710
 1010. 

631
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,910
 Ten in a turn? 

632
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,400
 Is this a scam? 

633
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,240
Call.

634
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,560
Okay, call.

635
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,510
Turn.

636
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,890
Fold.

637
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,800
Here I go.

638
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,590
Fold.

639
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,050
Fold.

640
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,360
Fold.

641
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,320
Raise.

642
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,570
Call. 60.

643
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,530
I'm going all in.

644
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,480
Call.

645
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,210
Okay, all in from both sides.

646
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,860
I'll open the cards then.

647
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,420
Monk, you first.

648
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,110
Relieve my suffering and return to Buddha... 
  (T/N: Buddhist chant) 

649
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,000
Relieve my suffering and return to Buddha.

650
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,360
You, too, Yangbang. Open your cards.

651
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,960
There's still one more river.

652
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,180
If there's an ace from the river, it'll turn the table.

653
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,490
Then river!

654
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,080
Hold!

655
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,490
As for the river, I'll open it.

656
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,590
Okay, Monk.

657
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,180
 River. 

658
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,250
 To cross a river you can't return from. 

659
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,590
 To survive through this on the back of Jang Seon Oh... 

660
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,330
 or get killed tonight by getting hit by Jang Seon Oh. 

661
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:17,310
I don't see it... no side...

662
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,150
Please...

663
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,280
No side!

664
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,410
It's an ace!

665
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,090
♫  The night is becoming darker  ♫

666
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,500
   

667
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:54,350
♫  Did I lose myself, I will not stoop so low  ♫

668
00:59:54,350 --> 01:00:01,480
♫  Who was the justice for?  ♫

669
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,400
♫  There was no one, not anywhere  ♫

670
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,850
♫  Nowhere like heaven  ♫

671
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,920
 Why me? 

672
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,910
 Isn't having an ego a luxury for you right now? 

673
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,810
 Are you staking me out? 

674
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,900
 Kill him. 

675
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,880
 When I get out of here, 

676
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,360
 I'll take over the gambling scene in Korea. 

677
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,860
 In the world of scamming, finding one you can trust is a priority. 

678
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:30,010
 I'll give you what you want if it's worth my life. 

679
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,090
 I have a plan. 

680
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,040
 You have nothing to lose in a deal like this. 

681
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,010
 He'll reinvestigate if that's the card I hold. 

682
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,560
 I heard you're moving up to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. 

683
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,360
 What did that cost you? 

684
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,910
 Was it erasing me out of the system? 

685
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,460
 Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here? 

686
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,630
 You are not a Judicial Institute trainee anymore. 

687
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,400
 You're a criminal. 

688
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,190
 Seongju Prison. 

689
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,480
 Take it over.
