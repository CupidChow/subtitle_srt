1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,880
   

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,890
   

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,400
   

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,930
   

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,770
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

6
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,090
   

7
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,790
Are you going to scream if I take that off of you?

8
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,430
 Please take Jin Soo Mi as far as possible and let her go. 

9
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,660
 And you? 

10
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,240
 The guy who picked us out while we were tailing Kim Yo Han. 

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,570
I caught him while sniffing around Seongju Prison, as you said.

12
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,550
Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

13
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,280
He visits his client once a week.

14
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,440
There's an inmate named Do Won Bong.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,510
Do you know him?

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,700
A long time ago...

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,890
But still, Yo Han...

18
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,840
A person shouldn't fight with a bear.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,770
Kim Yo Han was going to get at Do Won Bong.

20
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,640
 Even if it's only during hibernation... 

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,190
 Do you know anything? 

22
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,400
He was going to attack the Dosan-ro White Bear.

23
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,360
 But... the fact that Kim Yo Han got released on time 

24
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,920
 means Kim Yo Han is working under Do Won Bong now. 

25
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,970
 Then does that mean Yoon Byung Wook is running into trouble with Do Won Bong? 

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,280
 A chief prosecutor is... connected to a loan shark rotting in jail? 

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,090
 So you're a prosecutor? 

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,840
 Won Bong. 

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,480
 I heard you have a brain tumor. 

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,940
 Yes. 

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,630
 You're a better actor than I thought. 

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,620
 I heard you requested the suspension of the execution. 

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,830
You can request that at any time.

34
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,940
 But why now? 

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,220
 Because I'm in much physical pain. 

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,750
 Not because of The Skin Nation? 

37
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,540
 You got a job for our Yo Han. 

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,410
 Is he Attorney Koo Bon Chul's intern or something? 

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,500
 When you go down to Daejeon soon, 

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,950
 it will have nothing to do with you, Chief Prosecutor. 

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
 What's going on between you 

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,120
 and Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook? 

43
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,350
 Why don't you ask him yourself if you're so curious? 

44
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,020
 They're on the same boat. 

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,690
 Do Won Bong is on the same side as Yoon Byung Wook. 

46
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,940
 Why? 

47
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,080
 Suspension of the execution. 

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,130
 He's trying to get out of prison and take Chairman Yang's position. 

49
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,620
 And not for The Skin Nation, 

50
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,540
 but he seems to be going for the Goldman Casino seat. 

51
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,560
Bring me a baseball pitching machine.

52
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,070
Jin Soo Mi.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm not a bad guy.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,990
I'll let you go. I will, but

55
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,100
let me ask you something I'm curious about.

56
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,090
At the Goldman Casino,

57
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,830
how much do they make a year laundering money?

58
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,440
Turn on the machine.

59
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,110
Quiet.

60
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,970
   

61
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,710
   

62
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,460
   

63
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,120
Take me to a hospital.

64
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,740
Something's wrong with my leg.

65
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,360
I haven't felt anything since earlier.

66
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,350
Since when?

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,540
I have no personal vendetta against you.

68
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,680
I just got my money

69
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,870
and I'm doing my job.

70
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,710
Not that.

71
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,210
How long have you been sick?

72
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,230
Did you get any sleep?

73
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,690
Will you stay?

74
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,780
Should I leave?

75
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
Well, it doesn't matter.

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,690
Then I'll watch.

77
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,200
It's not my revenge, but...

78
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,000
it's finally starting.

79
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,080
Fess up.

80
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,070
What?

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,770
That you killed my grandma.

82
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,770
I was also behind bars when your grandma passed away.

83
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,840
Chairman Do told you to do it.

84
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,330
Did Do Won Bong say that to you?

85
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,350
Why would he say that...

86
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,940
We can have a three-way confrontation then.

87
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,140
Min Ho recorded it. Woo Min Ho.

88
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,240
You remember Woo Min Ho, right?

89
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,090
 You know. The boy you kidnapped with Woo Sang Ki. 

90
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,930
Who?

91
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,250
 No! 

92
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,920
 That's not true at all! 

93
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,060
 Come on! I'm serious! 

94
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,610
 It's true. 

95
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,770
 I saw your call history, 

96
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,720
 and you've been in contact with Hong Jae Sun a lot. 

97
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,950
 In front of the Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office. 

98
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,850
 Geez, this is nuts! 

99
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,730
 Geez, it wouldn't feel so unfair if I actually did that. 

100
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,790
 Well, actually... 

101
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,090
 Actually, that day... 

102
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,750
 That's what I'm saying! 

103
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,540
 But you know... 

104
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,420
 I did promise a sunbae in my organization... 

105
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,250
 So will you leave that supermarket just like that? 

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,230
 If she dies, it becomes yours. 

107
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,410
 Prosecutor Hong said that your grandma's supermarket will be 

108
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,650
 worth top dollars due to redevelopment. 

109
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,530
 He mentioned I should scare her and take the supermarket away from her. 

110
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,600
 But then I saw your grandma there that day. 

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
 Then she suddenly disappeared! 

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,500
 The person who kidnapped my dad and me 

113
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,980
 is the one who killed your grandmother. 

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,970
So... just fess up, Seon Oh.

115
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,820
If you keep your mouth shut like that, you really could lose that leg.

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,610
Not only your legs...

117
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,970
I'll send you to the hospital if you spill everything.

118
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,870
I promise.

119
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,710
On Min Ho's social media account,

120
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,860
it's recorded in detail how you killed my grandma.

121
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,860
Woo Min Ho... I remember him now.

122
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,170
But...

123
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,020
he died, though.

124
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,140
There's no witness now...

125
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,620
and there are only a few posts that the kid uploaded.

126
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,420
And what about this video clip?

127
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,200
What can you prove with this?

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,710
Stop it, you a**hole.

129
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,620
- Do you know who killed Kwon Dae Il? 
 - You.

130
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,600
Mok Jin Hyung killed him.

131
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,450
And Lee Tae Gwang's USB you were so desperately searching for in prison,

132
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,620
do you know what's in it?

133
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,780
- Cut the bulls***. 
 - You'd better cut the bulls*** and untie me.

134
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,230
If I die, you'll never find out anything

135
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,420
and die by Do Won Bong or Yoon Byung Wook's hands.

136
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,910
I said just fess up to everything!

137
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,960
You'll never kill me!

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,470
Lately, for small brain tumors,

139
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,770
they don't have to open up your head. They are treatable by gamma-knife radiosurgery.

140
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,260
But since your condition is graver than that,

141
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,170
they'll open up your head and perform microsurgery for about four to five hours.

142
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,160
So that'll be... the official statement by the specialist.

143
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,610
Since your blood pressure is normal and you're very healthy,

144
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,660
you'll just get anesthesia and sleep for four to five hours tomorrow and then leave.

145
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,350
That's how I've arranged things.

146
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,030
Sounds good.

147
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,500
No news from Jang Seon Oh?

148
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,730
I think the battery has worn out now. 
  (T/N: Meaning Jang Sun Oh's time is up) 

149
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,500
Did he get caught?

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,770
Should I check on newly arrived unidentified corpses throughout the hospitals?

151
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,950
Don't make a fuss. Just look for a new guy.

152
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,800
He's reached the limits to his usefulness.

153
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,550
We'll have lots to do going forward.

154
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't be short on workers.

155
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,460
It's Kim Yo Han.

156
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,350
How about the money?

157
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,500
I've secured the Goldman slush funds.

158
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,950
 Chairman? 

159
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,320
Yes. Good work.

160
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
It's all thanks to you, Chairman, but...

161
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,980
I finished work just now.

162
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,310
May I visit you at the hospital tomorrow?

163
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,870
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

164
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,590
Yo Han...

165
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,800
Yes, Chairman?

166
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,730
I think I'll live 50 more years, all thanks to you.

167
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,000
 Enduring is the true power. 

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,140
Thanks for breathing life into me, who was dying away.

169
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll see you tomorrow, Sir.

170
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,190
 Okay, okay. 

171
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,550
Thank you... Thank you.

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,030
And next is... Chairman Do?

173
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,270
 Look for two people. 

174
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,100
Pardon?

175
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,280
Find one more person to work for us.

176
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,410
We should get rid of Kim Yo Han now, too.

177
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,600
 The Skin Nation stocks that doubled as soon as it went public successfully on the 18th 

178
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,140
 is stabilizing in its value faster than expected. 

179
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,500
 Regarding this matter, the insiders 

180
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,220
 are talking about selling off the unofficial holdings by the biggest shareholder Chairman Yang Joon...
   

181
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,590
Where is Attorney Koo?

182
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,340
I believe he's still wrapping things up at Seongju Prison.

183
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,430
 The share structures show that Goldman Company owns 32%, Taepyeong Plaza owns 12%... 

184
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,960
People at Seocho-dong...

185
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,500
must be desperately waiting for us.

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,840
So that we can gift them with what we promised.

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
Pay off the balance.

188
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,720
Now, you can put the name Dosan Holdings there.

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,300
I got it.

190
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,600
Mr. Do Won Bong!

191
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,450
You fasted yesterday, right?

192
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,940
You didn't smoke, either, right?

193
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,870
Of course not. I've been waiting for this day for so long.

194
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,090
You'll be entering the operating room soon.

195
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,020
So don't be nervous. Just lie down and relax.

196
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,390
Yo Han...

197
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,880
After I get out of surgery,

198
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,980
it'll be our world.

199
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,670
Let's have a big party, okay?

200
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,840
Yes.

201
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,010
All right...

202
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,340
   

203
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,600
   

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,050
 The Skin Nation's stock share structure was announced. 

205
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,800
 Chairman Yang Joon of The Skin Nation owns 36%, 

206
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,210
 YH Holdings owns 26%, and 

207
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,600
 Malay Investments owns 14%, 

208
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,170
 and miscellaneous corporations make up 11%.
   

209
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,560
 A total of 83% of majority shareholders 

210
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,490
 and the remaining 17% of minority shareholders make up the company ownership.
  

211
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,370
- How come Dosan Holdings isn't listed? 
  - A total of 83% of majority shareholders and... 

212
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,180
- Chairman, are you okay? 
  - the remaining 17% of minority shareholders 

213
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,000
 make up the company ownership. 

214
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,760
How about the balance?

215
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,530
I paid off the balance.

216
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,770
Oh, it won't be Dosan Holdings.

217
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,100
It will be called YH Holdings,

218
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,730
Malay Investments and... miscellaneous corporations.

219
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,960
I paid the entire balance under those names.

220
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,870
YH Holdings?

221
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,710
I imitated what I had learned from you, Chairman.

222
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,440
YH Holdings...

223
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,660
I'm not good at naming things.

224
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,780
So I used my initials.

225
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,520
   

226
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,340
   

227
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,750
   

228
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,390
   

229
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,130
   

230
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,110
   

231
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,170
Now, you can pay the balance on The Skin Nation under your corporate name.

232
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,640
   

233
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,750
 Start buying. 

234
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,140
 500 million won. 

235
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,560
Why did you do all this?

236
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm out of prison now.

237
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,090
And all I learned there was how to run a gambling house.

238
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,120
So I think...

239
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,520
I could run a casino rather well.

240
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,750
I thought I had crossed the bridge, but it looks like I'm still on the bridge.

241
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,300
Hey...

242
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,180
you have no inkling of what you've just done, huh?

243
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,010
You just gave the elders at the Sinseon-dong a big f*** you!

244
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,970
Attorney Koo is going to take care of all that for me.

245
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,510
Attorney Koo?

246
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,870
Oh, Attorney Koo... will start working with me now.

247
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,940
Chairman, the Sinseon-dong wanted me to deliver a message to you.

248
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,880
What?

249
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,240
"You're..."

250
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,680
"fired from Sinseon-dong."

251
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,830
   

252
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
Attorney Koo filled me in on the details.

253
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,910
I'll lead you inside.

254
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,390
You're returning to us what you stole

255
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,340
and asking us to pay extra for the other options as well?

256
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,420
I believe you have it wrong.

257
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,130
What?

258
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,920
Manager Yang is the one who couldn't protect and manage that money

259
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,160
and I... went through hell to get that money back to you.

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,220
So, what is it you want?

261
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,820
I heard that the Goldman Casino manager position goes to the most suitable person.

262
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,940
And?

263
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,020
The Triad of Macau* was running the chairman election using the Goldman slush funds 
  (T/N: Macau mafia) 

264
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,080
and they're stumped now that the money disappeared.

265
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,540
But if they find out the Sinseon-dong's Go-to man got that money back,

266
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,580
you'll be able to get the votes from Macau as well.

267
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,000
I didn't come here only to ask for Manager Yang's position.

268
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,640
If you would install me as the new Go-to man for the Sinseon-dong,

269
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,030
I'll do... my utmost best for you elders for the rest of my life.

270
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,810
The priority for the Goldman slush funds is to support the Triad of Macau election.

271
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,380
I mean that is such an absurd situation.

272
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,770
If I become the new Goldman Casino manager,

273
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,120
I'll prioritize investing...

274
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,820
in Sinseon-dong's businesses.

275
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,180
Why... do you seek to work for us?

276
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,090
I also...want to hold the sword handle of the law.

277
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll hold the sword handle of the law

278
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,040
and the f***ers who messed up my life this way...

279
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,370
Yoon Byung Wook, Yang Hwa, Yang Joon,

280
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,160
Hong Sang Wook, Hong Jae Sun,

281
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,380
Mok Jin Hyung, and even Do Won Bong...

282
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,160
I will...

283
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,110
slaughter all these f***ers.

284
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,840
If all of you would allow me to get a hold of that handle,

285
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,770
I don't need...

286
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,650
I don't need anything else.

287
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,470
Th-that manager position...

288
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,260
It might look like it's sugar-coated on the outside,

289
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,680
but it's like food that's been poisoned.

290
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,410
Those Seocho-dong morons you have to deal with...

291
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,790
They're not human. Those scumbags...

292
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,420
Those scumbags are the only ones who make money in all this.

293
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,880
With your head, they're no match for you.

294
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,390
You can't handle them!

295
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,870
More than anything, I will...

296
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,010
I'll never let you get to that position—

297
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,590
So...what will you do then?

298
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,540
Chairman, you didn't get released. You got a suspension of execution.

299
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,100
You have to return to prison when you regain your health.

300
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,820
Isn't that so?

301
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,460
Mr. Do Won Bong, how do you feel?

302
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,440
Keep talking.

303
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,980
Looking perfectly healthy.

304
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
I'll give you some more painkillers.

305
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,530
Thank you.

306
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,440
You'll feel fine very soon.

307
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,140
Your visitors' hours are usually 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

308
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,660
But one guardian can continue to stay with you.

309
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,460
Oh, come in!

310
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,840
Your nephew will be staying with you tonight.

311
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,270
So, don't worry and get some sleep.

312
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,590
Now, your life is...

313
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,860
up to my arithmetic.

314
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,790
But still, you've managed to come out.

315
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,810
Get plenty of rest.

316
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,610
If you need anything,

317
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,700
just tell the nephew.

318
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,480
Then, will you be personally taking care of finishing up Chairman Do?

319
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,200
He's lived a long time, and it's about time karma got to him.

320
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,960
He'll be taken care of naturally.

321
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,330
How about you, Yo Han?

322
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,320
Is Yang Hwa next for you?

323
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,290
Yang Hwa...

324
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,770
Yup.

325
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,370
Which hospital is Jang Seon Oh at?

326
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,350
Are you going to go?

327
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,500
No.

328
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,130
I'll just go over to CEO Oh's place.

329
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,170
Be careful.

330
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,940
You now know that your body doesn't belong to you, right?

331
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,530
I won't bring harm to the Sinseon-dong.

332
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,730
Don't be shocked. I didn't come here to kill you.

333
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,790
 I'm sorry for causing concern all this time. 

334
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,560
 Do Won Bong has been fired by theSinseon-dong as of today. I'll leave him here. 

335
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,630
Sinseon-dong's Go-to man has been changed to Kim Yo Han.

336
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,860
So, we have to get rid of Chairman Do today.

337
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,680
But I felt a little uneasy about you, Jang Seon Oh.

338
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,010
What about me?

339
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,730
 - Geez!
- I got it.
  

340
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,550
 You'll adopt the kid, Director Yang? 

341
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,720
 But that moron of a father 

342
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
 is asking a lot for the cost of the kid. 

343
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,490
 You're going to pay him? 

344
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,710
 What if I get rid of him, and the kid finds out later? 

345
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,890
What?

346
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,240
 You can't tell him he died, man. 

347
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,780
 You have to say that his dad abandoned him. 

348
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,160
 A person has to be lonely to look for someone to rely on. 

349
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,370
Let's go.

350
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,640
Why? Why?

351
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,180
No!

352
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,180
 So that the kid will come with me. 

353
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,740
 A person... has to be lonely to look for someone to rely on. 

354
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,130
You know that Chairman Yang is looking for you, right?

355
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,990
You're not feeling well and also running out of time.

356
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,290
I'll step away for a moment.

357
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,660
This.

358
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,660
I took one from the hospital earlier just in case you might need it.

359
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,710
Why!

360
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,240
I said I'd share all the profits with you once I became the casino manager!

361
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,060
You don't have to live as the Sinseon-dong's dog.

362
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,010
I said I'd help you, so you can lead a new life. So, why?

363
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,100
Once a dog, always a dog.

364
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,300
You know that people don't change.

365
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,060
You tried to have Jo Hae Do kill me.

366
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,060
You had lost Woo Sang Ki, but pretended you hadn't and sent over Kim Yo Han.

367
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,850
What were you going to do after you got rid of me and took over the casino?

368
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,010
After that, were you going to drive the Sinseon-dong elders out of Goldman?

369
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,130
And after that...

370
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,950
you didn't want to become a manager again...

371
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,950
but become a Deep Pocket like them, didn't you?

372
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,960
That can't happen.

373
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,950
 Dosan-ro White Bear played all the tricks, 

374
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,470
but...Kim Yo Han took all the money.

375
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
You go.

376
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,950
I'll go to Oh Soo Yeon and Kim Yo Han.

377
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,940
What are you talking about?

378
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,770
That woman must be with Kim Yo Han.

379
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,340
Our Chairman Yang, are you sure you won't make any mistakes?

380
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,940
Don't worry.

381
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,040
I'll bring her back alive.

382
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,360
Whether you kill her or not, you do what you want after that.

383
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,390
You don't have to listen to Attorney Koo.

384
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,770
H-he's mistaken about everything.

385
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,960
Right...

386
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,740
You said you were a casino manager at one point, right?

387
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,320
I guess Yang Joon and Yang Hwa...

388
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,410
had listened to you at one point.

389
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,800
Do you remember when we recruited Yo Han hyung?

390
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,920
Okay, 500.

391
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,630
Before I get older,

392
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,930
I've decided to get rid of the two, Yang Joon and Yang Hwa.

393
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,130
Call.

394
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,080
Chairman Do, who normally doesn't know how to give up, what happened to you?

395
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,970
What do you want me to do?

396
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,380
A man named Woo Sang Ki

397
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,720
will enter the country soon.

398
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,740
 So I kidnapped Woo Sang Ki and his son like that 

399
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,770
 and Yo Han came into the prison. 

400
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,220
I heard Chief Prosecutor Yoon asked to get rid of that kid.

401
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,070
The kid was investigating him and got caught.

402
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,570
He's just a Judicial Institute Trainee...

403
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,880
Is that kid holding something over his head?

404
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,110
He was looking for the video that Lee Tae Gwang had filmed.

405
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,770
Lee Tae Gwang?

406
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,540
Oh, that Chairman Yang's underling you messed up?

407
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,680
What kind of video is it?

408
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,720
Hey, Tae Gwang.

409
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,400
Yes?

410
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,290
Go and exchange more money.

411
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,640
Well, how much?

412
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,190
Just enough.

413
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,260
Okay. Got it.

414
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,090
Well, Yang Joon alone gambled abroad.

415
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,230
But they got caught together, yet Lee Tae Gwang was the only one who went to prison.

416
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,830
So I'm sure he felt it was unfair and got pissed off.

417
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,110
Then... make that Kim Yo Han...

418
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,130
become one of us.

419
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,420
Excuse me?

420
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,040
But how?

421
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,130
A person is bound to look for someone to rely on when he's lonely.

422
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:53,360
I heard he has only one family member left. So get rid of that person.

423
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,960
And only one person for him to rely on.

424
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,610
Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung of Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

425
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,460
Make a video that makes him look like the killer

426
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,360
and send it to the detective in charge of the case.

427
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,150
Must you take it that far?

428
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,270
Just like you and me, we have to make him

429
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,820
rely on nothing else but the idea of getting revenge.

430
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,840
 You said a person looks for someone to rely on when he's lonely. 

431
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,500
 I thought adults all thought that way. 

432
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,830
 But the reason I wanted to kill Yang Joon isn't because 

433
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,220
 of my father. But my father... 

434
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,750
I don't remember much about him anymore.

435
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,040
But to let it go makes me feel like such an idiot.

436
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,130
That's why I stabbed Yang Joon behind his back.

437
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,770
But that a**hole... He cut off part of my body.

438
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,060
So I was going to get revenge...

439
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,880
That's how I've lived.

440
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,010
But you...

441
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,450
why does it seem like it's only natural that I kill you?

442
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,060
Seon Oh... this is...

443
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,600
Even in arithmetic, there is an order to it.

444
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,050
My problem was my big mouth...

445
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,200
but Yang Joon is the actual one who knifed you and your father.

446
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,430
Why not settle the score with Yang Joon first

447
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,060
and settle the rest with me...

448
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,770
No.

449
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,590
Because someone like you exists, there's also someone like Yang Joon.

450
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm...

451
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,910
I'm already past 70 years old.

452
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,000
How many more years would I have to live?

453
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,580
They said not to look down on old people.

454
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,410
People who have lived decades

455
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,290
are all strong...

456
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,180
and cruel.

457
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,760
I'm cruel?

458
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,660
Do you know how cruel this world is?

459
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,570
Do you know how crappy this world and the laws are?

460
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,090
   

461
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,840
I got Oh Soo Yeon's home address.

462
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,150
 Seoul Sangui-gu, World Park-ro 79. 

463
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,270
 Perimese, Royal 63rd floor. 

464
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,970
Wow...

465
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,340
It's worth living a long life.

466
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,470
Chairman Yang...

467
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,170
Forgive me.

468
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,350
Looks like excessive bleeding.

469
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,320
Seon Oh,

470
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,590
I knew you'd die before me.

471
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,900
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 
    

472
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,550
There is no one who is pure in this world,

473
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,930
and no one who is completely tainted.

474
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,040
You have to launder people and use them.

475
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,640
Work on them again and—

476
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,100
Anyway, this old man is always trying to dance to a tune. 
  (T/N: Meaning he never misses a beat) 

477
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,480
Send the dead guy over to the incinerator

478
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,210
and as for this old man with a big mouth...

479
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,580
- Put him in the trunk. 
 - Yes, Sir!

480
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,810
Chairman Yang! Chairman Yang!

481
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,900
What's going on?

482
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,460
Who are you guys—

483
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,380
Hey, erase everything starting from an hour ago.

484
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,390
Security.

485
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,700
We received a complaint.

486
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,940
How do you do?

487
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,550
Mr. Yang Hwa.

488
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,000
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Jo Hae Do.

489
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,800
Please call my attorney.

490
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,710
 Let go! What are you doing? 

491
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,250
 Let's go! 

492
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,930
 Thanks for letting me use the house. 
   

493
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,730
He caught him.

494
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,340
Oh, my goodness...

495
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,030
I can't believe he actually arrested Yang Hwa!

496
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,030
The reason you couldn't readily attack Yoon Byung Wook

497
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,180
is because of Yang Hwa, who was behind Yoon Byung Wook, right?

498
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,800
 If you compare it to cards, Yang Hwa is an ace of spades. 

499
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,280
 His mere existence is dangerous. 

500
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,600
 The raw violence, shall I say? 

501
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,070
 He's so raw that I can't easily read his next move. 

502
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,020
 If we don't hold him down like this, 

503
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,720
we can't do anything.

504
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,620
And...

505
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,940
once we cut off these shackles,

506
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,350
it's finally Yoon Byung Wook's turn.

507
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,940
It's because of your medication, right?

508
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,220
Excuse my expression,

509
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,360
but we're housemates, after all.

510
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,400
I noticed that you take lithium.

511
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,620
After I was rescued from the red-light district,

512
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,530
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

513
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,000
But my brain slows down when I'm on medication.

514
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,930
I don't take it if I feel the urgency to stop.

515
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,570
But you don't have to worry.

516
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,060
What are you going to do with Jang Seon Oh?

517
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,080
Will you leave it to the law to punish him?

518
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,240
Yes.

519
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,440
You haven't gotten his confession yet.

520
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,110
Wouldn't it be difficult?

521
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,360
- It'll be difficult. 
 - Then why do you hesitate?

522
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,370
It's dangerous.

523
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,320
I also...

524
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,740
promised myself a hundred, a thousand times that...

525
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,510
if I ever found my grandmother's killer,

526
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,570
I'd kill him with my own hands.

527
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,160
As I hit the prison walls with my bare hands.

528
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,010
 And even when I got so close to killing Jang Seon Oh, 

529
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,990
that promise didn't change.

530
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,800
But...

531
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,920
 from Jang Seon Oh... 

532
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,490
 No! 

533
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,860
I saw myself.

534
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,580
And...

535
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,780
I also saw you...

536
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,310
in Jang Seon Oh.

537
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,090
If the law would've changed the world!

538
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,520
If the law would've changed the world,

539
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,630
we would've never even met.

540
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,210
- I know that. 
 - And?

541
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,200
I know that, but...

542
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,580
Please give me more time.

543
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,070
- Take it. 
   - The beginning of casino money laundering 

544
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,110
 starts with cash, exchanging currency, 

545
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,560
 settlement office, then safe. 

546
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,200
Lady...

547
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,150
Hey Brother...

548
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,420
Here you go.

549
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,250
Have fun!

550
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,760
- Who didn't get any?
 - Over here, here.

551
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,210
There's enough for everyone.

552
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,830
 Have fun! 

553
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,480
Oppa!

554
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,400
There's still more here.

555
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,840
Wait a moment.

556
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,800
He's so lucky!

557
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,580
Counted.

558
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,500
The settlement office.

559
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,940
Here's the safe.

560
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,870
Move.

561
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,510
Did you do it, Attorney Koo?

562
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,130
I should clean the house since a new tenant is moving in.

563
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,840
Attorney Koo, Jang Seon Oh was...

564
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,910
someone I desperately needed.

565
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,000
Yo Han, you're now the Sinseon-dong's Go-to man.

566
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,380
Go-to man...

567
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,770
What that means is that

568
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,720
you're not really out of prison even though you've been released.

569
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,430
Even though you're all dressed up,

570
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,020
you're forever an inmate.

571
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,880
Forget all your personal feelings or hopes for revenge.

572
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,370
In the Sinseon-dong, there are no penalty points or solitary confinement.

573
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,820
 Do you remember when we recruited Yo Han hyung? 

574
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,910
 You said this. 

575
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,370
 "Before I get older, I've decided to 

576
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,540
 get rid of the two, Yang Joon and Yang Hwa." 

577
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,450
 Around 4 p.m. yesterday, in a hospital in Seoul,
  

578
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,830
 Do, in his 70s, who was hospitalized for surgery, went missing. 

579
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,420
 Considering the CCTVs in the hospital were damaged, the police 

580
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,350
 believes that Do either ran away... 

581
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:12,520
 Send the dead guy over to the incinerator
   

582
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,120
 and as for this old man with a big mouth... 

583
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,470
 Put him in the trunk. 

584
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,960
I'd like to meet the Chief Prosecutor.

585
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,390
Our deputy chief is busy sitting in meetings.

586
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,890
She's here. Your boss.

587
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,420
You're Annie, right?

588
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,030
Hello, Prosecutor.

589
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,130
We're meeting for the first time, right?

590
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,640
   

591
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,210
I'll be outside.

592
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,070
Please call me when you're done talking to him.

593
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,170
Thank you.

594
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,740
Having handcuffs around your wrists...

595
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,520
It's been around 20 years, right?

596
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,170
But you've really had a long run at it if it's been 20 years.

597
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,510
What is it you want to say to me?

598
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,380
Well...

599
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,740
They told me to fire you.

600
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,270
The money that was in Labuan Bank...

601
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,960
They all know it's been stolen.

602
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,990
If Seocho-dong can help us a little,

603
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,890
we can restore everything in 24 hours.

604
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,850
Of course. I'm sure.

605
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,050
I'm sure you feel that way.

606
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,140
I get that.

607
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,750
But...

608
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,600
the people in Macau are extremely upset about it.

609
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,760
Macau...

610
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,060
Is there really no other way?

611
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,320
 (T/N: A cloud server link) 

612
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,860
Please upload all the data you have

613
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,440
for managing the account right here.

614
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,410
Did you already find my successor?

615
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,000
 Move it! S***! 

616
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,280
This! F***!

617
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,370
This is wrong...

618
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,010
That's not up to you to decide, Chairman Yang.

619
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,860
How about my hyung?

620
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,750
How about my hyung?

621
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,370
If you're that concerned about your hyungnim,

622
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,710
hurry up and move out.

623
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,920
   

624
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:06,320
 Open your eyes wide and look at the screen. 

625
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,430
So, Chairman Do is still missing?

626
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,840
Yes.

627
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,370
He broke away from his restricted area without reporting first.

628
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,690
So I heard the officers in charge are looking for him.

629
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,360
We may not be able to apply the crime of escape, but

630
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,850
we can definitely detain him again.

631
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,710
And did Annie say that firmly?

632
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,700
That Kim Yo Han is replacing Manager Yang?

633
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,990
Yes. And...

634
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,530
she told me to detain Manager Yang until she tells us to.

635
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,110
We have less than 30 hours out of 48 hours.

636
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,940
What should we do?

637
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,260
The Corruption Investigation Agency has been giving me a headache as is...

638
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,440
Why?

639
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,120
Did the Attorney General say something again?

640
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,880
The nominee to lead the Corruption Investigation Agency

641
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,790
is the key player at the Ministry of Justice, Kim Jung Gyu.

642
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,530
Kim Jung Gyu, the 24th class of the Judicial Institute.

643
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,420
That's tough.

644
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,210
I hear he's already recruiting prosecutors for the Corruption Investigation Agency.

645
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,880
The AG tells me to manage the people under me well.

646
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,820
That's why I'm at the Central District Prosecutors' Office

647
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,390
and you're at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

648
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,700
That Kim Yo Han. I'm sure he has ill feelings toward us, right?

649
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,290
They say people working in a warehouse are generous.

650
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,510
Managing our subordinates all takes money.

651
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,750
Of all days, Kim Yo Han happens to settle there.

652
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,920
Geez, the timing is so...

653
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,520
 Hey! 

654
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,100
 Let go of me! Please! 

655
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,960
I've been waiting for you.

656
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,110
I'm Kim Yo Han.

657
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,210
Based on the opinions of the Deep Pockets gathered,

658
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:47,510
Kim Yo Han, you've garnered more than half of the yes votes.

659
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,580
I install you as the new manager of our Goldman Casino.

660
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,370
I don't know how long it's been since Macau and the Sinseon-dong have come to an agreement.

661
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,530
 But... 

662
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,300
aside from the Sinseon-dong and Macau,

663
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,240
there are Deep Pockets who own a third of the shares.

664
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,080
Elders who are outside of the Sinseon-dong.

665
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,750
If you focus on only taking care of Macau and the Sinseon-dong

666
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:38,780
and forget about us, they say they'll kill you.

667
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,390
As you wish.

668
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,140
   

669
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,440
   

670
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:24,990

♫  Wrong, wrong, wrong, hey  ♫

678
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,170
 Looking at same thing outside the window all your life... 

679
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,020
 That's why we're stagnant. 

680
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,940
 I'll punish Yoon Byung Wook according to the law as well. 

681
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,870
 You'll expose everything as an insider? 

682
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,760
 Even if you die, I'll go on my way, Yo Han. 

683
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,000
 You must normalize this place for you to live, Manager. 

684
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,230
 - Let's just go.
 - What are you doing? 

685
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,810
 As long as you've got the Goldman Casino manager position, 

686
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:25,020
 you've inherited all of Do Won Bong's debt. 

687
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,970
 I'm thinking of exposing the Sinseon-dong next. 

688
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,420
 To fight against those heavy weights, shouldn't we have something more firm? 

689
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,590
 Byung Wook, we're running out of time now. 

690
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,100
 The thing you're doing right now. Did Kim Yo Han instigate it? 

691
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,210
 I think I'll abandon Kim Yo Han. 

692
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,390
 I think I'll become that Sinseon-dong Go-to woman. 

693
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,770
♫  Who is driving the wheel of fate?
