1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,150
   

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,000
   

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,230
   

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,820
   

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:28,040
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

6
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,060
   

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,040
   

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,190
   

9
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,090
   

10
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,530
What is this crap?

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,810
   

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,640
 Let's meet up with Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon. 
   

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,820
 The location is Goldman Casino Manager's room. 

14
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,150
The mutual help... is still in effect, right?

15
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,880
Then what? A mock trial?

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,120
Are you all playing house or something?

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Not a trial.

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,790
A judgment.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,200
To bring judgment to you for your crimes of exploiting and harming people

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,040
by using the law for your personal benefit.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,330
I intend to judge you here today.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,790
Sure. But how?

23
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,810
I finally have the sword handle of the law.

24
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,460
Do you have proof?

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,920
If you look at the flow of money here, 
    
   

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,670
Jang Seon Oh got paid by Chairman Do for murdering my grandmother. 
    

27
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,500
Then on the same date,

28
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,010
a withdrawal happened from Goldman Casino.

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,470
Yes.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,890
All that enormous amount of data surely

31
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,950
connects Jang Seon Oh, Do Won Bong, Yang Joon, Yang Hwa, and that's it.

32
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,470
What does that data have to do with me?

33
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,370
Don't bother.

34
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,480
Did you think about it?

35
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,860
 During Joongpyeong-gu Club incident and the 

36
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,830
 YBK Trading Accounting Fraud, 

37
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,210
 if someone high up there had something to get rid of quietly, 

38
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,700
 then at the time... 

39
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,640
Yoon Byung Wook would give us the orders.

40
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,650
Then we, in turn, ordered Do Won Bong.

41
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,100
He would then use one of the inmates

42
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,960
to get the job done secretly.

43
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,320
 By chance, do you have any data that you saved as insurance? 

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,070
Perhaps a commission fee?

45
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,230
Anything that can prove he gave orders to you?

46
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,000
He's not the type of guy to leave those things behind.

47
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,880
Sometimes, he would contact Do Won Bong directly without

48
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,610
going through us first.

49
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,720
For example...

50
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,650
That one on Paldang Bridge.

51
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,390
- Shin Dal Soo.
  - I heard that was Do Won Bong's work. 

52
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,670
Originally, I heard he was trying to kill Kim Yo Han.

53
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,430
Anyhow... Do Won Bong would've gotten a receipt somehow.

54
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,880
Your statements so far...

55
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,610
would you be willing to say them at court, too?

56
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,230
"My statements so far...

57
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,840
were not made by force or under threats."

58
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,960
You'll have to be happy with that.

59
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,010
Even so, all of them are missing or on the run.

60
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,300
You have no one to be a witness for that video.

61
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,650
A video with a witness...

62
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,200
I do have it.

63
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,360
 You're on a roll, Director! 

64
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,570
 It's going! 

65
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,320
 You're sweeping all the money here, Director. 

66
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,860
 You're here. 

67
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,040
The Director of the Land and Housing Corporation Balanced Development Division.

68
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,040
He's the one who actually selects the new town

69
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,580
redevelopment business operators nationwide.

70
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,020
In return for taking care of the casino, you got Annie to introduce him to you.

71
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,870
Then you managed to get all the jobs for your in-law's company, Yeonguk. Isn't that true?

72
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,000
 Since the Chief Prosecutor is here, shall we have a drink? 

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,300
 Yes, let's do that. Let's move there now and grab a drink. 

74
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,430
 Please leave now so the grown-ups can have their grown-up talk. 

75
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,110
 Let's go, let's go. 

76
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,180
 So Chief, what you're saying is... 

77
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,060
 you're saying if your wife's company gets the construction job, 

78
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,950
 the Urban Development Corporation will take the loan or the construction fee. 

79
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,870
 Then your wife's company will take all of 

80
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,900
 the ordinary shares that produce the most money... 

81
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,340
 You'll do the construction with tax money and 

82
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,450
 you'll take all the profit... That's what it is, right? 

83
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,420
 That's why he flew all the way here to ask you. 

84
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,450
 And that profit. He's not going to take and sit on all of it. 

85
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,280
 He'll also take care of your people, too. 

86
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,360
 Make money and save face as well. 

87
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,230
 What's to say no? 

88
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,900
 When the regime changes later and this is made known, 

89
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,120
 I could be subject to a special audit. 

90
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
 Can he cover a special audit, too? 

91
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,540
 They say "A regime is for five years, 

92
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,560
 but prosecution is immortal." 

93
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,870
 Chief Yoon here 

94
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,060
 will be the head of CID for the next decade. 

95
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,190
 It's hard to do by myself. 

96
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,030
 The casino... 

97
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,610
 Who are the big shots who said they will sponsor all of this? 

98
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,730
 Of course, I know the people that I know. 

99
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,130
 How great are those people 

100
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,180
 that all these things we're doing are made possible? 

101
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,220
 I came all the way here for this. 

102
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,230
 So spill it now. 

103
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,340
 Jeon... 

104
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,650
 Doo Hwan... 
(Only mouthing the name, a former president of Korea) 

105
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,620
As such, we the prosecution,

106
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,660
as mentioned on the arraignment,

107
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,320
in addition to the "Criminal Organization" that used Seongju inmates

108
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,340
to perform various crimes,

109
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,520
and taking into account the Deep Pockets that were mentioned in the video,

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,530
plan to request modification to the arraignment on the day of trial

111
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,540
to add Special Price Law and Special Dereliction of Duty to the charges.

112
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,480
How is it?

113
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,400
Your review of watching a video with a witness.

114
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,890
Witness? Me?

115
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,410
I'm going to testify for that video?

116
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,700
You think you won't?

117
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,900
If you expose this, you...

118
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,350
are going to die, not get locked up.

119
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,610
You don't know Annie that well, do you?

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,150
You became so blind to the news ever since

121
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,250
you moved up that high, didn't you?

122
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,190
Prosecutor.

123
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,180
   

124
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,750
Where are you going?

125
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,010
Hey, Kim Woo Jae!

126
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,640
Who's got their back that they can pull this crap?

127
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,400
Please say hello.

128
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,740
This is the Deep Pockets' new agent, Ms. Lam.

129
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,070
Have you made your decision?

130
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,290
 So? 

131
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,970
 You'll bury this... 

132
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,540
 if we hand over the prosecutor? 

133
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,730
 Avenging my family. 

134
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,740
 "Revenge." 

135
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,760
 I have to get revenge for ruining my life. 

136
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
 "For ruining my life." 

137
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,060
 Revenge? 

138
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,560
 Revenge is sweet. 

139
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,910
 Admit your guilt for all the crimes that he is charged with. 

140
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:05,070
Otherwise, your wife's company will go bankrupt within a month.

141
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,400
What?

142
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,190
In return for not exposing that Lee Tae Gwang video,

143
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,240
she's handing you over to me.

144
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,650
The responsibility for all the crimes you instigated through Seongju Prison's inmates,

145
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,210
for the Goldman Casino bloodbath,

146
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,920
and if money laundering-related suspicions rise,

147
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,690
you'll also take sole responsibility

148
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,670
of all that as well.

149
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,360
And if I decline?

150
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,290
Additionally,

151
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,270
the Junghoon Foundation victims as well.

152
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,440
You'll confess on your own at the trial about all the crimes that you committed

153
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,740
using the law as your weapon.

154
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,020
In the case you don't obey—

155
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,870
Chief Mok!

156
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,650
 You have those guys you use, right? 

157
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let me borrow them. 

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,480
 For what? 

159
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,650
 Get rid of Kim Yo Han when I give you the sign. 

160
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,970
That mutual help, let's use it now.

161
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,310
Her voice gives me a headache.

162
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,900
I'm not alone.

163
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,130
- At Seocho-dong— 
 - Hey.

164
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,360
You're next.

165
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,080
   

166
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,910
 The person you are calling is not answering the phone. 

167
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,920
   

168
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,400
 The person you are calling is not answering the phone. 

169
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,200
   

170
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,370
What happened?

171
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,040
 He said you're out. 

172
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,520
- Who said? 
   - Prosecutor General Hong. 

173
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,170
 I'll let the Prosecutor General know. 

174
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,600
 You go and check if Oh Soo Yeon is Lee Yeon Su. 

175
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
 I'll check right away. 

176
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,100
 I just need to head to Goldman, right? 

177
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,130
I've lived my life...

178
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,890
at least a hundred, thousand times harder than you all.

179
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,330
   

180
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,400
Why?

181
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,580
 Are you saying you'll quit? 

182
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,970
Are you watching me?

183
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,380
 I've always been watching you. 

184
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,240
Ever since finding out that you instigated my murder.

185
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,800
 Are you recording this? 

186
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
What is it that you want?

187
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,110
What I want?

188
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,920
You couldn't possibly have... anything that I want now.

189
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,930
 If you die there today, 

190
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,840
your wife's company will go down the day after tomorrow.

191
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,940
 Your family, your children... 

192
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,240
will spend the rest of their lives being pointed at by the whole world

193
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,700
just because they were your family.

194
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,430
 All because of me. 

195
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,580
Like how I went to prison because of you,

196
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,440
became an ex-convict and lost my family.

197
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,660
All because of me, you'll kill yourself and

198
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,110
 because of me, your family will 

199
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,190
live in agony from now until they die.

200
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,610
What goes around comes around, a**hole.

201
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,800
Are you doing this because you think I might die right now?

202
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,240
When you want to see me suffer for a long time?

203
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,690
 Fine. 

204
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,480
I did... try to kill you because you might get Lee Tae Gwang's video in your hands.

205
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,930
 What a shame, though. 

206
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,740
Do Won Bong, who got that order, or

207
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,550
the guy who cast your grandma off the bridge,

208
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,380
Jang Seon Oh, are both gone now.

209
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,050
It's a shame that I couldn't lock you up,

210
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,400
but I think I could be satisfied with the fact that I crippled your life.

211
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,610
 Now, you'll live in the prison, 

212
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,730
missing the people behind the walls,

213
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,010
telling yourself that you'll now live

214
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,980
ordinarily and diligently.

215
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,120
That's how you'll be waiting for your death.

216
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,640
A trial is long.

217
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,890
There are as many chances as long as it is.

218
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,460
 You want to see this to the end, huh? 

219
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,330
I've never lost.

220
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,540
Well, you were always the one with the sword in your hand.

221
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,830
 Isn't this your first time fighting with the sword pointed at you? 

222
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,760
If you can, try to take the

223
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,070
sword handle that's in my hand.

224
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,140
You son of a b****.

225
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,530
In addition to creating a private organization that

226
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,200
instigated crime using the prisoners of Seongju Prison,

227
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,990
the 1998 Chelin Investment Fraud Case,

228
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,150
the 2008 Jeong Mi Seon Disappearance Case,

229
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,580
the 2004 Prosecutor Kim Hong Ri Suicide Case,

230
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,690
the Sunshine Surgical Malpractice Case,

231
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,130
and the 2003 Bareum Market Murder Case.

232
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,400
You admit that all of this is true?

233
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,870
Defendant?

234
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,860
I do.

235
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,890
   

236
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,230
You committed all of these crimes by yourself?

237
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,560
Defendant.

238
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,360
Let me ask you not as a judge, but as another legal professional.

239
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,860
What exactly were you thinking?

240
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,600
 I won't die. 

241
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,420
 I'll get my revenge no matter what. 

242
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,090
If you don't read that now...

243
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,780
he said he'll release the details of the Yeonguk subcontractors' solicitation to the press now.

244
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,790
- Why you... 
 - I barely stopped them from exposing it before the trial.

245
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,940
Just read that.

246
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,600
That's your best option, Sunbaenim.

247
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,530
Defendant?

248
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,660
 I'll live and get my revenge no matter what. 

249
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,330
As a legal professional,

250
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,060
more so as a human being,

251
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,180
I would like to apologize for my evil crimes.

252
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,980
Because I'm—

253
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,290
I'm also a father of a family

254
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,490
who doesn't want his beloved children to

255
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,390
live in a world that is ruined by me.

256
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,060
Therefore, I hereby would like to

257
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,820
seek forgiveness from all the victims.

258
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,980
First, during the 1998 Chelin Case, as the prosecutor in charge,

259
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,610
I ill-intendedly framed the victim, Oh An Na, as the suspect.

260
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,160
Then, committed crimes of abduction and trafficking of her daughter, Lee Yeon Soo.

261
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,600
During the 2008 Park Han Sang Drug Case,

262
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,840
I received the complaint from the victim, Jeong Mi Seon,

263
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,500
but did not prosecute it due to a lack of evidence

264
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,950
because I had colluded with the suspect, Park Han Sang.

265
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,990
Jeong Mi Seon, who caught onto what I was doing,

266
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,480
was reported missing after she left her house to reveal the truth.

267
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,520
But she was actually killed by thugs I had hired.

268
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,390
And in 2014,

269
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,180
the Sunshine Surgical Clinic Malpractice Case, where the bereaved family of

270
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,940
Jang Se Deuk, who came to the hospital for a simple appendectomy,

271
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,470
died from a surrogate operation and sued the hospital.

272
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,910
I did not prosecute the case because the director at the time

273
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,950
was my colleague and made a request.

274
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,830
In 2003, the Bareun Market Murder Case, I forcibly got

275
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,620
three pages of testimony from a developmentally disabled person,

276
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,250
Mun Byung Seon, who can't even spell his name correctly,

277
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,360
and framed him as the murderer.

278
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,090
In 1998, during the Cha Man Geun gate incident,

279
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,880
Song Sang Cheol, the colleague of the then-assemblyman candidate Cha Man Geun,

280
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,570
was found to have killed himself during an overnight coerced investigation

281
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,360
for acceptance of money and goods.

282
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,170
But he didn't actually kill himself.

283
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,170
Finally...

284
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,570
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,050
- Finally— 
 - That's enough.

286
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,210
Fine.

287
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,660
I fully understand your intentions.

288
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,130
I'll consider them your last defense and

289
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,580
conclude the examination of evidence.

290
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,720
Prosecution, shall we proceed with your demand for punishment?

291
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,630
Your Honor,

292
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,640
I'd like to tell you something before I make the demands.

293
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,900
Proceed.

294
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,770
The center of Korea's power, the Prosecution,

295
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,880
among them,

296
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,990
the defendant Yoon Byung Wook was called the center of the CID.

297
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,790
The reason why he sought those crimes

298
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,650
despite his affluent power is

299
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,420
because of his endless desire for power.

300
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,330
So?

301
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,570
I have a piece of evidence here that I would like you to see.

302
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,040
 How great are these people... 

303
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
 Just how much power do they have... 

304
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,380
 that all these things we're doing are made possible? 

305
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,410
I heard that there's additional testimony to be made

306
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,910
regarding the "Deep Pockets" mentioned in this video.

307
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,280
Kim Yo Han?

308
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,040
   

309
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,000
As you saw, the defendant Yoon Byung Wook

310
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,300
did commit unforgivable evil using every

311
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,190
loophole of the law.

312
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,070
However, he is also just another foolish individual who at least

313
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,740
knows to admit to his crimes.

314
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,650
He only had bigger desires than

315
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,240
other people and the power to realize those desires.

316
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,460
The reason why those desires were able to be realized

317
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,570
was because of the Deep Pockets contamination of our society.

318
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,240
Laws... principles...

319
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,250
even prison walls mean nothing to those people. As long as they remain,

320
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,320
a second and a third Yoon Byung Wook will surely and definitely

321
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,260
reappear sooner or later.

322
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,180
In order to eradicate this vicious cycle of red-rooted evils,

323
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,630
I, the witness, Kim Yo Han,

324
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,820
as the insider of their vast connection,

325
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,290
hereby pledge to truthfully state all the facts that I know

326
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,090
without adding to or removing from the facts,

327
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,200
according to my honest conscience.

328
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,170
 This morning at 11:00 a.m., 

329
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,000
 in an intensive psychological trial of the Goldman scandal that has been going on for the past few days, 

330
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,640
 Lee Tae Gwang's video, which shocked the entire nation, has been released, 

331
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,450
 raising great controversies. 

332
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,320
 This video is a video of evidence submitted while interrogating Deputy Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook, 

333
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,940
 who was originally charged with a criminal organization and instigating murder. 

334
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,450
 According to the Lee Tae Gwang video,
   

335
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,250
 the amount of money laundering that was performed at the Goldman Casino 

336
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,320
 is about 400 billion won annually. 

337
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,900
 Among the "Deep Pockets" mentioned in the video are 

338
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,830
 the so-called big politicians of the ruling and opposition parties. 

339
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,070
 In response, each party was split into some 
   

340
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,670
 "dismissing it as nonsense" and others saying "there is no smoke without fire," 

341
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,270
 and even the theory of generational change has been raised. 

342
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,250
   

343
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,160
Whoa...

344
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,070
- Bon appetit. 
 - Thank you.

345
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,040
The Deep Pocket prosecution

346
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,450
will be conducted by the Corruption Investigation Agency.

347
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,340
Did they take it away from you then?

348
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm switching over.

349
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,140
The scale of this one is way too big.

350
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,950
The 24th Class Kim Jung Gyu sunbaenim

351
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,680
said that he'll make this the first case of the Corruption Investigation Agency.

352
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,780
At the national strategy level, with great support.

353
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,470
That... is great news.

354
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,450
This is delicious.

355
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,940
What about Chief Mok?

356
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,620
We should get him.

357
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,720
No.

358
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,220
We must.

359
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,790
With what?

360
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,090
 Do you know who killed Kwon Dae Il? 

361
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,220
 Mok Jin Hyung killed him. 

362
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,040
Murder.

363
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I think I found the location of Inspector Kwon's death.

364
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,090
Chief Mok's license plate.

365
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,000
This is the GPS that you expected.

366
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,010
How did you know about the GPS?

367
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,410
I learned my line of work in the same place as Jang Seon Oh.

368
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,710
And look at this, too.

369
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,070
On the day of Inspector Kwon's death...

370
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,660
there is record of Chief Mok's car being at this swamp...

371
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,430
and this is a place that only Inspector Kwon knows?

372
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,800
The time stamp, too.

373
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,750
Chief Mok's car comes here and

374
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,350
goes back to Seoul after an hour.

375
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,270
Chief Mok killed Inspector Kwon here.

376
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,590
Why?

377
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,350
Inspector Kwon...

378
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,010
lured Mok Jin Hyung out to this place?

379
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,860
Why did you ask to meet here?

380
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,130
In this place...

381
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,930
At least in this place,

382
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,000
I didn't think you'd lie.

383
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,200
Sure. As for me,

384
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,850
I do deserve those suspicions from you.

385
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,470
But I stayed by your side when Deputy Yoon asked me to

386
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,720
throw you over by force at the casino, right?

387
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,840
Don't I... earn some points with that?

388
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,580
Okay.

389
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,540
I just need to be better as we keep going, right?

390
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,200
Are you atoning for your sins?

391
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Yes. Since I've wronged you,

392
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm asking for your forgiveness.

393
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,310
Sure, you can ask for my forgiveness.

394
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,870
But what about Inspector Kwon Dae Il

395
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,330
whom you killed and his wife?

396
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,370
Who is Inspector Kwon Dae Il?

397
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,020
Yo Han?

398
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,080
Please save me just this once.

399
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,090
I was... afraid.

400
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,010
I was too... afraid...

401
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,640
 Why don't you come to the Central District Prosecutors' Office from the Northern District? 

402
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,650
 There's Director Noh's case 

403
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,100
 and there is that f***ing Corruption Investigation Agency. 

404
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,260
 GPS? 

405
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,780
 What made you so afraid? 

406
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,480
 Chief Mok, it's not like you killed my grandma. 

407
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,210
 Exactly. 

408
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,020
 Exactly, Yo Han. 

409
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,240
 After I got that weird video, 

410
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,210
 Inspector Kwon started stalking me around. 

411
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,640
 I thought he would at least know who filmed me. 

412
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,530
 So I followed him in reverse. 

413
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,380
 Then he caught on and lured me out there. 

414
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,410
 Inspector Kwon Dae Il. Why don't you come out now? 

415
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,320
 Hey? 

416
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,660
 Hey. 

417
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,580
 It was a mistake. 

418
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,450
Yo Han, it was a mistake.

419
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,750
I was afraid that everything I suffered through for would be gone.

420
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,670
I wanted to make it big just once in my life.

421
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,700
So I endured for that off chance of an opportunity.

422
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,840
All those years... could've been made nothing by that one thing...

423
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,830
Why would a person like that...

424
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,190
go to the Shinseon-dong again?

425
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,640
Because I'm powerless...

426
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,560
That's... the kind of stuff I need to do in order to persevere.

427
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,940
Is it a crime to want to make it for myself out here?

428
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,290
Wanting to stand at the top just once?!

429
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,330
Is there anyone who passed the Bar exam who doesn't have ambition!

430
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,890
I'll report you.

431
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,760
Yo Han!

432
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,260
Yo Han, please...

433
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,080
Please!

434
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,510
It was really just a mistake.

435
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,950
Chief.

436
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,330
Since when did murder become "just a mistake" to you?

437
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,790
A prosecutor, huh?

438
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,860
A civil servant!

439
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,600
Are you...

440
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,320
trying to kill me right now?

441
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,380
If you bear it, you'll live through it.

442
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,990
 Yo Han... 

443
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,750
 If you bear it, 

444
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,580
 you'll live through it. 

445
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,230
Let's have you go...

446
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,570
like a prosecutor at least.

447
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,270
Properly as a prosecutor...

448
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,050
Let's have you go.

449
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,200
   

450
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,790
- What ar— 
 - What are you doing, you bastards?

451
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,220
Let me go!

452
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,290
You f***ers!

453
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,380
My, my.

454
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,720
Aigoo. You must've been smothered, right, Deputy?

455
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,340
What are you doing right now?

456
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,760
Hey, what are you doing? Bring the keys. Hurry.

457
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,800
First of all,

458
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,030
Let me greet you first. My name's Jo Hae Do, Sir.

459
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,160
   

460
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,910
What the hell are you doing right now, I said.

461
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,100
Didn't you ask to be taken out?

462
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,290
This crazy...

463
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,940
You're crazy.

464
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,710
Please calm down.

465
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,140
Let me confirm something quickly.

466
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,810
CEO. Have you gone mad?

467
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,490
If you help a person with a greater sentence than fines escape,

468
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,110
it's a crime of concealing a criminal.

469
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,010
I can't be charged with that, you know?

470
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,960
This crazy...

471
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,350
Have you lost your senses?

472
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,720
S***!

473
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,010
F***!

474
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,470
Let me go!

475
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,220
Hey!

476
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,160
I have nothing to fear right now.

477
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,810
So run while you can.

478
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,380
Not going?

479
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,510
This... How are you going to wrap this up?

480
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,530
You think these people can report me?

481
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,110
That part is really sensitive to pain.

482
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,810
You have great endurance.

483
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,530
I guess I was right. Not everyone gets to pass the Bar exam.

484
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,270
You scored the highest, right?

485
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,070
A prodigy who made it to law school before graduation?

486
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,340
I admitted to everything!

487
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,240
The sentence will be bad enough for all of you to be satisfied!

488
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,610
A person of your stature...

489
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,730
wouldn't regret your past just because of some years behind bars.

490
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,150
Those knees of yours, give them to me now.

491
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,370
Knees are for kneeling. But you don't even kneel when you need to.

492
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,340
But there's a clear difference

493
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,110
in the quality of life between having

494
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,370
just one leg crippled or both legs.

495
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,970
So what?

496
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,220
What is it that you want?

497
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,650
I have to know what you want, so I can do what you say!

498
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,070
Are you really going to do as I want?

499
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,720
I'll do everything you ask for.

500
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,930
Why?

501
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,440
Why are you doing this to just me?

502
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,160
When you sold me off to the brothel...

503
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,530
When I was only 16,

504
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,340
I wasn't even through puberty, but I had to take so many customers every night.

505
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,250
I couldn't even walk after work.

506
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,300
I crawled for two years.

507
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,240
On that vinyl floor full of mold where you locked me up!

508
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,100
So what? What? What about it?

509
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,690
What? What about it?

510
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,210
Why only me?

511
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,460
Why just to me? Why?

512
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,460
You're the last one.

513
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,680
Don't resent me too much since I took both for all 20 years and the interest.

514
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,520
But what haunted me more than that was this.

515
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,160
You see, meth feels fine right after injection.

516
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,780
But the real deal... is when the high starts going away.

517
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,860
You're hot, but you keep feeling hotter.

518
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,460
You're cold, but you keep feeling colder.

519
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,860
Your teeth will melt from throwing up every day.

520
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Your breath will get shorter until you feel like your heart is going to rip apart, okay?

521
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,540
But all of that

522
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,800
goes away with just one shot of this.

523
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm sorry.

524
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,190
Go! Go away! Don't come closer!

525
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,250
I'll kill you!

526
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,250
Stop!

527
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,070
I'll give you one more shot when the withdrawal symptoms start dying.

528
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,400
Starting now, have a taste of my life thus far.

529
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,960
   

530
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,490
Yay! It's fun.

531
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,450
I'm going one more time.

532
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,050
   
   

533
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,680
While he was alive, 
    

534
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,710
Noh Seung Hwan had applied to our program for

535
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,460
you and your daughter.

536
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,370
Your story was made known through this trial

537
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:46,010
and your confirmation was decided by unanimous vote from the board.

538
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,260
The direct deposit account is this one, right?

539
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,250
Yes.

540
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,930
Ji Yeon.

541
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,810
 Is your name Ji Yeon? 

542
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,410
 Who are you? 

543
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,520
 I'm your father's student. 

544
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,910
 A person who is thankful to your father 

545
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,330
 and received help from him. 

546
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,530
 Really? 

547
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,880
Our bank launched it to save the environment.

548
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,860
   

549
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,540
This is your passbook.

550
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,800
Thank you for visiting us after a long time.

551
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,230
   

552
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:00,100
This is... the first payment.

553
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,380
Did you deliver it to her?

554
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,110
Yes, the foundation will be notified.

555
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,700
Will the Deep Pockets leave us alone?

556
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,370
Since their names are out, they can't make a move easily.

557
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,750
They're much more difficult people, so much that even the Shinseon-dong fears them.

558
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,630
I'll help you until the end.

559
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,930
It's dangerous by yourself.

560
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,140
No.

561
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,040
Your job is up to here.

562
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,870
Your revenge is complete.

563
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,460
Isn't it?

564
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,710
Soo Yeon.

565
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,200
When there's a chance to get out of the cycle of revenge,

566
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,310
make sure you grab it firmly.

567
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,110
You should... live on, caring for yourself only.

568
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,600
I'll be thankful if you can know

569
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,080
how much of a joy and consolation it would be for me.

570
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,730
If it weren't for you,

571
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,200
I wouldn't have been able to make it. Really.

572
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,470
Thank you, Yo Han.

573
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,760
Get inside!

574
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,110
I'm a little busy right now...

575
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:03,570
I'll call you back.

576
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,720
What brings you here, ma'am?

577
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm turning myself in.

578
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,750
A gun?

579
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,250
No.

580
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,030
A murder.

581
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,300
   

582
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,220
Wow!

583
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,210
What's the difference from...

584
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,710
a prosecutor's office? It's actually the same.

585
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,720
You say that because you didn't even finish the Judicial Training Institute.

586
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,800
Hey, at least I escaped Seocho-dong.

587
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,660
Oh, and also...

588
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,220
Look at this, eh?

589
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,700
   

590
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,170
Sure, sure.

591
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,600
But why'd you drop the honorifics?

592
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,340
I'm 12 classes ahead of you.

593
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,760
Oh, right.

594
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,480
It also seemed to me that

595
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,720
it's not impossible for you to return to the Training Institute.

596
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,370
Return. It'd be a waste.

597
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,000
Of course...

598
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,200
Even if you graduate, the prosecution will never accept you.

599
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,290
But anyway,

600
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,250
isn't this place pretty decent?

601
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,840
Look out the window.

602
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,860
This place really isn't Seocho-dong.

603
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,810
 Breaking news. 

604
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,600
 Kim Jung Gyu, the Commissioner candidate of the Corruption Investigation Agency, 

605
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,640
 who had been ambitiously prepared by the government to keep the 

606
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,490
 prosecution in check, was arrested today at 7:30 p.m. 

607
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,040
 for violating the Anti-Graft law 

608
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,000
 and Obstructing Execution. 

609
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,910
 An administration spokesman apologized for the inappropriate personnel changes and said he 

610
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:26,990
 would appoint Mok Jin-hyung, the chief prosecutor of the Northern District Prosecutors' Office, as the new candidate... 

611
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,040
I heard that you have been the herald

612
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,080
of the reformation of the organization through the establishment

613
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,660
of the Corruption Investigation Agency.

614
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,200
Aigoo, not at all.

615
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,830
How do you feel about being appointed as a new candidate?

616
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,320
Do you have ambitions about the kind of world you want to create?

617
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,900
 Am I... really getting transferred in the end? 

618
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,290
 It's not Daejeon. 

619
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,100
 It's Yeosu, actually. 

620
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,700
 You want to move to the Corruption Investigation Agency? 

621
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,590
 The Corruption Investigation Agency must make a good start in order to survive. 

622
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:02,530
 And... I'm thinking of 

623
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,350
 the Shinseon-dong as the next target. 

624
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,630
 The Shinseon-dong... 

625
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,870
 vanished. 

626
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:14,380
 Why are things flowing... so smoothly like water? 

627
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,380
   

628
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,300
 How come that day, the police, the hospital, and the crematorium 

629
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,650
 passed your father's corpse like a baton 

630
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,320
 and made a series of administrative mistakes. 

631
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,740
 Only two entities could create such coincidence in this world. 

632
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,060
 One is the Almighty God. 

633
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,000
 The other is... 

634
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,790
 us, the prosecution. 

635
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,730
   

636
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,080
 This is a trap. 

637
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,870
 What do you want from me? 

638
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,920
 We know each other now. 

639
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,570
 Yoon Byung Wook is not the only one at Seocho-dong. 

640
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,890
 I need to make my own preparations. 

641
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,360
Even if you laboriously flip hwatu cards like this every day,

642
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,020
how much can you even make.

643
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,640
Will you keep hesitating and

644
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,020
live as a goose or...

645
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,150
will you try and become a phoenix?

646
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,070
"Know your place."

647
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,480
The ones who failed to do that...

648
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,640
ended up in their graves early...

649
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,800
Don't you see the royal foxglove tree right below the phoenix here?

650
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,140
I'll be your parasol tree.

651
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,100
They say if a phoenix nests on the branches of a parasol tree,

652
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,830
the world will be at peace.

653
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,990
 I need to collect my cards. 

654
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,270
 Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon are on the same team. 
   

655
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,390
   

656
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,070
   

657
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,710
   

658
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:31,050
 If Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon put on a show... 

659
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,220
 it means they're after me, too. 

660
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,080
 What does Kim Yo Han need the most right now? 

661
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,580
 Yang Hwa's testimony that will bind Yoon Byung Wook. 

662
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,410
Everyone, stop.

663
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,520
 Kill Yang Joon, not Kim Yo Han. 
    

664
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,350
 Kim Yo Han would 

665
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,430
 get Yang Joon and make a deal with Yang Hwa. 

666
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,920
 He needs to make a deal with Yang Hwa in order to get Yoon Byung Wook. 

667
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,570
 And he has to get Yoon Byung Wook to open up a position for me. 

668
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,020
First of all,

669
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,750
I would like to apologize as a successor for the fact that Kim Jung Gyu,

670
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:19,180
who was mentioned as a senior candidate, stepped down due to an unsavory incident.

671
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,780
Even more so for this happening's significance,

672
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,110
as the first case of the Corruption Investigation Agency, which will write the new history of the Korean legal field,

673
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,350
I think the Deep Pockets in the recent Goldman incident seem fitting.

674
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,420
The thing that the nation desires as a whole,

675
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:39,110
I'll bring to our citizens.

676
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,050
 All of you elders... 

677
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,540
 I'll get you all out by suspension of execution. 

678
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,860
 How will you do that? 

679
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,180
 I still have Sajik-dong. 

680
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,050
 Although the Sajik-dong team disbanded a while ago, the server is still alive. 

681
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,960
 What's more important than people is the data. 

682
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,340
 The information. 

683
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,610
 The corruption of high-ranking government officials 

684
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:07,060
 and presidential relatives that Sajik-dong's team had dug up a long time ago. 

685
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,730
 In other words, the Deep Pockets outside the Shinseon-dong. 

686
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,940
 The corruption of political and political figures who are intertwined like cobwebs. 

687
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,990
 I have organized all of that nicely. 

688
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,730
 So... 

689
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,060
 you'll get rid of those guys personally? 

690
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,030
 Yes. I'll catch them and lock them up here and 

691
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:33,610
 work to make the outside world yours with my entire life. 

692
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,220
 What is it that you want? 

693
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,090
 I would be so grateful if you can just grant me 

694
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:43,930
 a shield as I head out to fight... 

695
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:52,360
 The newly launched Corruption Investigation Agency, for example. 

696
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,430
You mean to say...

697
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,050
I'll do my best.

698
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,570
We need to get rid of the old ways

699
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,000
and make a new world, you know?

700
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,400
Jang Seon Oh?

701
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,730
It's a newbie.

702
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,350
 Started eliminating Kim Yo Han. 

703
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,320
 Started eliminating Oh Soo Yeon. 

704
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,960
Who is it?

705
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,790
Get out here, f***er.

706
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,870
What is it? Hey, go out and check!

707
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,980
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

 Thanks to our Editors: damiechan (Chief), jadeheart (General), laks_727 (Translation) 

712
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:50,970
 Thanks to all other language moderators. 

713
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,940
Who are you?

714
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,420
Pretty good face.

715
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,860
Where do you belong?

716
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:03,620
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

717
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:07,230
   

718
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,110
Why would the National Intelligence Service...

719
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,210
You know this person, right?

720
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,150
She needs to be caught as soon as possible,

721
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:24,760
but the only one who can approach her right now happens to be you.

722
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,560
Why don't you pull off one more job with us?

723
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,390
 It's just an empty chair that keeps spinning. 

724
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,470
What's that glare for?

725
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,370
Life is...

726
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,740
take...

727
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,550
or fold.

728
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,240
Either one, no?

729
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:50,910
 When the seat empties someone takes it again. 

730
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,730
 No matter how many times it's destroyed... 

731
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:56,460
 nothing changes, ever. 

732
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,540
 However... 

733
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,560
 if you don't do anything... 

734
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,750
 nothing changes.
