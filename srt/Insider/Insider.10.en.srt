00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,730
Are you going to use him?

161
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,160
If not, let's get rid of him.

162
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
Please spare me! Just spare me!

163
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,970
That Kim Yo Han. I know everything about him.

164
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,310
I'm the only one who can catch him.

165
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,690
- Hyung!
- What?

166
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,530
Are you going to use him?

167
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,440
D***...

168
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,740
Our stock is going public in a couple of days. What are you doing?

169
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,550
I'll take care of it.

170
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,690
Don't do anything stupid.

171
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Are you... acting like this because of that woman?

172
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,360
Why is Soo Yeon doing this...

173
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,150
It turns out she had already partnered up with Kim Yo Han.

174
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,730
Geez...

175
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,340
Don't waste your time on a woman who's already left you.

176
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,160
You are just causing double the pain.

177
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,970
This is no fun.

178
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,840
Where are you going?

179
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,250
Chairman Yang...

180
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,950
Hey, Joon!

181
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,110
Geez, that guy...

182
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,170
Manager, please spare me.

183
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,910
Let's see...

184
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,430
Gosh, Manager!

185
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,870
Please spare me!

186
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,350
Please!

187
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,070
Please spare me!

188
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,470
Made in Korea.

189
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,160
[Burj Nadiyya]

190
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,390
Chairman Suh of Dongdaemun Taepyeong Plaza.

191
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,720
He was released 10 years ago after serving time for embezzlement.

192
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,560
He got caught stealing 350 billion won from 3,000 investors.

193
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,630
Aigoo, he sure is greedy all right.

194
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,250
Playing cards? Is he into things like that?

195
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,040
It's been rumored that out of the 350 billion won he embezzled,

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,270
he lost 80 billion won playing Hold'em.

197
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,780
So he's a player, too.

198
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,130
Consider he took all the negative aspects of Do in prison or Yang who took over Namdaemun.

199
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,570
You can look at it that way.

200
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,310
He's no second fiddle to Do or Yang.

201
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,060
- He's that much of a bad guy?
- Right.

202
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,580
When Yang took down Do in Gangnam and took over entire Seoul,

203
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,370
the only one who withstood through it all is Suh.

204
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,800
Chairman Suh.

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,310
Sounds good.

206
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,470
Good, bad, and ugly. He's got it all.

207
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,660
[Chairman Yang Joon]

208
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,320
Excuse me.

209
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,660
Hello, Chairman Yang.

210
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,800
Aren't you busy with the listing ceremony?

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,980
Hey, Soo Yeon.

212
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,590
Are you... available during our listing ceremony?

213
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,130
available during our listing ceremony?

214
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,140
Of course.

215
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,040
I already prepared my dress for that day.

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,030
I'm sure you'll be pretty.

217
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,200
After the ceremony,

218
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,540
we plan to have a bash with some of the VIPs.

219
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,380
Sounds fun.

220
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,990
Am I invited, too?

221
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,370
Of course.

222
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,050
There's always a place for you, my Soo Yeon.

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,060
I'll also save another place.

224
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,670
So if you have a good friend, come together.

225
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,720
But don't you need 10-20 million won minimum to play there?

226
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,050
Well...

227
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,060
Who can I bring who won't get rattled, and

228
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,740
enjoy a place like that?

229
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,080
Abduct Woo Sang Ki...

230
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,550
get to The Skin Nation's finance director this time

231
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,690
and buy up convertible bonds.

232
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,780
Yo Han takes the shares from the equity holders by playing Hold'em.

233
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,010
Gather all that in the Dosan Holdings

234
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,760
and take The Skin Nation entirely, huh?

235
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,450
What's after that? The casino?

236
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:26,260
Let's say... this is the Goldman Casino in Incheon.

237
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,350
I said you have to take over this place to be number one in Korea's gambling scene.

238
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,460
But actually, this is just a cover.

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,810
Cover?

240
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,340
The game that makes real money is not the casino,

241
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,390
but what happens in the casino hotel's upstairs suites.

242
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,350
It happens in the VIP suites where only the ones with invitations are allowed in.

243
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,180
The real power behind the Goldman Casino is not the casino

244
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,360
is not the casino

245
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,460
but the slush fund, the money that was laundered from the casino.

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,570
Goldman slush fund.

247
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,410
The one who manages the slush fund becomes the casino's manager.

248
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,780
Anyway, if you can control the slush fund

249
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,660
you can acquire the casino also.

250
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,470
So, what's the scenario?

251
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,910
In a given year, there aren't many games held in the VIP suite.

252
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,550
Unless a super VIP wants it or the game happens on a special occasion.

253
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,360
the game happens on a special occasion.

254
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,430
But you know Yang Joon's The Skin Nation?

255
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,730
I hear they might go public real soon.

256
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,620
It's highly likely that a game will take place in the VIP suite on the day of the listing ceremony.

257
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,860
I can't play because I've been marked by Yang Joon.

258
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,690
But you go in and win tons of Yang Joon's money.

259
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,760
If you'll tie up Yang Joon there that night,

260
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,600
I'll get to Director Jin, the one in charge of the slush funds, in the meantime.

261
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
I'll get Director Jin.

262
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,210
I'll twist her and get the slush fund in my hands.

263
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,940
You said you need an invitation to get into the room.

264
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,070
How will we get that invitation?

265
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,810
That's the crucial issue here.

266
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,640
Work on someone who's got the invitation

267
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,260
and pretend to be his proxy and get in.

268
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,900
I'll come up with something after my release tomorrow.

269
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,210
Everything is... coming together at Goldman Casino.

270
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,120
All our plans are entangled.

271
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,200
If one thing goes wrong, then the rest will falter.

272
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,770
Don't worry too much.

273
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,710
If things go according to my plan...

274
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,630
Yes.

275
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,640
Good job.

276
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,460
See over there?

277
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,950
Make that more visible and center it around new products.

278
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,330
Yes, sir.

279
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,700
Good job.

280
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,750
- That drum. Am I hitting it?
- Yes.

281
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Does it make a sound?

282
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,730
Yes, the audio is fine.

283
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,700
Have you tried it?

284
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,530
I'll check it again.

285
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,050
I heard Kim Yo Han was the dean at Seongju Prison.

286
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,750
Oh, man. It was a s***ty period.

287
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,600
He used to be such a baby back then.

288
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,010
What did he eat to get so big?

289
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,310
Jang Sun Oh taught him?

290
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,130
I know, huh?

291
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,990
He took him as his successor.

292
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,750
He picked him and made him play cards day and night.

293
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,660
And no one knows what happened to him after he was released?

294
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,840
I did hear that he did visit the school* a few times after his release.
(Slang for prison)

295
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,880
Sweep that up, too.

296
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay.

297
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,060
Sweep over there, too.

298
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,850
Don't you have to go to the visitation room?

299
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,880
I heard your boss is in Sinseon-dong.

300
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,530
Kim Yo Han is back here?

301
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,120
What?

302
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,310
You didn't know?

303
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,660
When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable.

304
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,610
He totally ignores you as soon as he's released?

305
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,430
Oh, my. Kim Yo Han...

306
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,110
He's not the person I thought he was.

307
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,520
He's as cold as dry ice.

308
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh, this, too. Take it.

309
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,140
Whoa!

310
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,380
I think I can find out if I asked a few people.

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,630
Do it right.

312
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,090
Yes, sir.

313
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,680
- Hello. Hello, hello.
- Welcome.

314
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,820
Let's get started.

315
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,130
The winner of this hand

316
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,740
looks like it's me.

317
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,070
3 K's...

318
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,930
4 K's.

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,280

[Stock Transfer Agreement]

321
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,570
Nice to meet you.

322
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,180
You look familiar.

323
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,000
Even if you are tired, don't go straight home.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,390
Like this...

325
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,420
You should always go around twice before going in.

326
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,560
Bye now.

327
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,060
This is how to tell if you are being followed.

328
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,480
Even if you allowed enough time and distance,

329
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,130
a person or a car keeps popping up. You have to figure that out.

330
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,550
Every time you change direction,

331
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,570
typically a new tail would take over.

332
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,480
The best way to beat them

333
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,860
is frequently changing directions and make the tail get up close to you.

334
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,620
Then,

335
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,810
go into a place with many entry points, like a department store or subway station,

336
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,100
and make the tail follow you in.

337

Hey!

338
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,010
So, you knew all this in advance earlier?

339
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,300
Have you ever seen me talking gibberish?

340
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,680
Was that Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung?

341
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,540
He's used at least six people to catch you.

342
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,300
That means...

343
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,410
he's trying to kill you.

344
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,680
Is he the one you were talking about earlier?

345
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,910
Yeah.

346
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,270
He circled around widely and spotted all of us.

347
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,020
I'm certain I've been exposed.

Most of these guys here also.

349
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,870
You could've been photographed also.

350
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,040
Geez! I can never get it right!

351
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,650
Geez!

352
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,900
Lost again!

353
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,360
Nothing works out.

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,310
Geez!

355
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,030
Look at this!

356
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,190
Look!

357
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,700
I'll win the lottery next!

358

You must be hurting bad...

359
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,650
What is it?

360
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,230
Just follow me.

361
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,220
Don't be scared.

362
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,470
Why is your name Nam Dae Moon?

363
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,410
So that I'm not too stiff, easily open and close.

364
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,540
So that I could live like that. That's why it's Nam Dae Moon.

365
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,410
How long have you been out?

366
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,580
It's been 20 days.

367
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,580
Life is like a melodrama. I'll speak to you casually.

368
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,260
Do you know where Kim Yo Han is?

369
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,020
After his release, he was eager to make some money.

370
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,290
So he was looking for some games where he can make some money.

371
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,820
That's what I heard...

372
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,530
Really?

373
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,690
How come I haven't heard that?

374
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,970
Maybe because...

375
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,560
he's using an alias, Mr. Koo, to enter the games.

376
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,140
He wants to find whoever killed his grandmother and he needed money for that.

377
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,810
That's what I heard.

378
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,170
Who killed his grandmother?

379
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,430
I'm not sure. That's...

When a tumor grows in the pituitary gland, it is called prolactin.

383
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,310
It causes an abnormality in hormone secretion.

384
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,680
This drug can mimic similar symptoms.

385
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,800
You have to make it look like you have a real brain tumor.

So your meal menu will be changed accordingly.

To receive a suspended sentence,

388
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,980
you'll need to become sickly that you can't hold a spoon.

When is the PET scan scheduled for?

How about the head of the Brain Tumor Center?

Did you bribe him?

402
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,110
Yes, his daughter is studying art in college.

403
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,440
We offered to set up an exhibition for her.

After that,

the only thing remaining is for the DA to sign off on the suspension of execution.

So all that remains is

What do you think about that?

The biggest factor that influences the cosmetics market is...

413

What are you going to do?

In the instance of The Skin Nation...

416
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,300
I am a little worried...

417
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,520
that I might get indigestion.

418
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,830
But you know, it takes a lot of money to keep our guys in line.

419
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,410
I mean, it looks like

420

no matter who sits in that seat, we won't have to quit our positions.

So if that's the case,

422
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,670
wouldn't it be better to go with that old man?

You don't really care for Manager Yang.

That's true, but

428
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,140
Yeah...

Thanks to you.

433
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,890
I came out after serving time that was never meant for me.

434
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,610
Well, then go and play.

Oh, my! Your winning streak is going straight up at the end.

I heard you are desperate for money these days.

- What's this?
- An invitation.

They are setting up the biggest game in this country there.

How about it? Do you want to play big?

443
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,570

Jang Sun Oh is also my possession, who works for me like you.

458
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,580
Don't think that I had deceived you.

459
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,380
You just quietly...

460
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,990
do what you have to do.

461
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,020
I will do as you said.

Just as I expected...

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,230
Jang Sun Oh was working for Do Won Bong.

467
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,540
Then...

468
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,340
my guess that Jang Sun Oh killed my grandmother is true.

Not as good as you.

473

So, how did you do it?

To find someone to get that invitation,

475

I've been doing everything I could since I got out.

But it didn't work out.

477
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,180
Maybe it's because too many people know what you look like.

True...

479

Not many people out here know you were the dean at Seongju prison, right?

00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,860
So, you got an invitation now.

481
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,600
Did you find out how money laundering is done at the casino?

482
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,230
Okay.

483
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,760
In the last five years,

484
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,600
the 50,000 won bills that the banks couldn't recover is worth 12 trillion won.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,980
Move it.

486
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
What do they do if they want to spend that money?

487
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,090
They have to launder it all.

488
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,450
Enjoy!

489
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,860
The Goldman Casino in Incheon

490
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,540
is operated jointly by Macau Goldman Casino Group and Yang Joon, Yang Hwa.

491
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,730
It's a foreigners-only casino.

492
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,310
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

493
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,350
They'd say the cash slush funds that the Deep Pockets handed over

494
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,370
came from the foreign tourists who come to gamble here.

495
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,120
It all becomes casino's revenue

496
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,030
and if it's withdrawn from the Macau head office,

497
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,930
the international wiring of the funds is completed.

498
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,170
Out of today's revenue at Incheon Goldman, designate 850 million won as Macau Goldman's revenue.

499
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Should I withdraw it as cash like before and deliver it to Woo Sang Ki?

500
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,820
Set it aside for a while in a separate account.

501
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,050
Finally, the money is exchanged for bitcoins in Hong Kong

502
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,510
and wire it to a tax haven where it sits in a business account under a borrowed name.

503
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,500
Exactly.

504
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,070
As expected of a model student, you studied everything already.

505
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,000
People don't really change, right?

506
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,270
Right.

507
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,270
People don't change.

508
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,700
The Skin Nation, a cosmetics company that has attracted a lot of interest among investors,

509
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,200
is about to be listed at 9 a.m. today.

510
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,490
There was some controversy over the high valuation...

511
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,450
Now, let's check today's final closing price

512
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,950
on the first day of the historic listing of The Skin Nation.

513
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,420
They anticipate a very successful opening day doubling the price.

514
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,480
Five, four, three, two, one!

515
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
[The Skin Nation]

516
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,300
Congratulations!

517
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,430
The offering price was 39,000 won.

518
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:17,890
The final stock value is 101,400 won, an increase of 160%.

519
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,810
It's more than double, everyone!

520
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,690
Let's go!

521
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Yang Joon! Yang Joon!

522
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,600
- Yang Joon! Yang Joon!
- CEO, I'm Seok Hong.

523
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,200
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

524
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,840
Congratulations, CEO Cha.

525
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,180
It looks like you will make some money this time.

526
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,010
As for me, I'm sure I'll just get some crumbs.

527
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,100
Will you be coming to our after-party planned for this evening?

528
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,030
Who goes to school to study?

529
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,230
You go there to eat your lunch.

530
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,270
Security check, please.

531
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
A VIP is entering.

532
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,830
Hey...

533
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,970
Why is Kim Yo Han here?

534
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,620
Geez, I told you not to stir trouble.

535
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,440
Don't you stir trouble, Hyung.

536
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,900
Don't go up against the prosecutors.

537
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,210
They can kill several with just a phone call.

538
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,470
[Annie Stevens]
Would it be possible to hold a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets?

539
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,140
Annie Stevens...

540
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,710
She wants a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets. S***...

541
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,630
Man...

542
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,050
Geez...

543
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,750
One Gangster, two gangsters, one prosecutor, two prosecutors...

544
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,570
One avenger, two avengers...

545
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,270
Here.

546
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,780
Slush fund in the full...

547
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,020
If an avenger catches a slush fund in the full flop of the account...

548
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,330
Sinseon-dong, Sinseon-dong, Goldman, Goldman...

549
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,300
Turn and Chairman Do...

550
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,190
If Chairman Do deals big, the cards and button

551
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,700
Call, call , call...

552
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,330
And then river...

553
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,490
Soo Yeon.

554
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,070
Chairman.

555
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,140
Kim Yo Han has won another hand.

556
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,920
8,000 on this game.

557
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Today's total is 723 million won.

558
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,140
Let's go in.

559
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,050
Ladies first.

560
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,380
All the VIPs inside have been informed, right?

561
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,970
That I will kill Kim Yo Han tonight.

562
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,200
Yes, they said they'll all cooperate.

563
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,510
Of course...

564
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,990
Chairman Suh, you are here also.

565
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,230
CEO Cha, long time no see.

566
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:28,100
All right, how are your winning streaks tonight?

567
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,020
This is just the start.

568
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,570
This new guy is something else.

569
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,660
Is that so?

570
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,480
Everyone, take caution.

571
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
For an entertaining evening,

572
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,760
[Devil: A slang that means a cheater in Poker]
he's a special 'devil'* I invited tonight.

573
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,930
[Devil: A slang that means a cheater in Poker]

574
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,980
It's been a long time, Kim Yo Han.

575
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,210
Thank you for the invitation, Chairman Yang.

576
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,630
Gosh, Yo Han...

577
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,880
You are shameless.

578
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,620
I invited the elders, so they'll have a good time.

579
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,600
But if you keep winning like that, they'll say you're rude.

580
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,030
Oh, my.

581
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,170
I'm sorry.

582
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,060
I guess I didn't read the room.

583
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,910
I heard this was a major league, so

584
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,950
I swung my bat pretty hard.

585
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,280
Chairman Suh? Chairman Suh, right?

586
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,780
Shall I...

587
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,730
tone it down a bit?

588
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,110
Hey.

589
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,040
Even being rude and talking cheap is part of this culture.

590
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,770
Misly a few million won. We'll just say we chewed it out to stay awake.

591
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,370
Right now is just perfect.

592
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,770
Just right.

593
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,380
Now is just right, he says.

594
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,840
What's your name there?

595
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm Oh Soo Yeon. It's nice to meet you.

596
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,470
It's my first time meeting you. I'm very pleased to meet you.

597
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,500
Are you seeing anyone?

598
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,610
If there is,

599
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,290
- does anything change?
- As for introduction...

600
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,350
I think that's enough.

601
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,420
Okay. Let's resume the game.

602
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,970
I've been looking forward to this night all day long.

603
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,310
I can't bear to wait any longer.

604
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,060
Call!

605
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,970
Who are you looking for, sir?

606
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,050
Is there a VIP room?

607
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,610
Where the stakes are higher.

608
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,100
The high betting room is over there.

609
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,410
Did you see Kim Yo Han?

610
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,830
He went up.

611
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,500
What are you going to do?

612
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,180
Let's make our move.

613
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,820
Betting.

614
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,080
800 Million.

615
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,530
Call.

616
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,670
Open.

617
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,800
Full house.

618
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,070
I got four of a kind.

619
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,950
Fold.

620
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,490
Three.

621
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,500
- Call.
- Fold.

622
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,490
Chairman...

623
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,580
you should have some fun, too.

624
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,470
I'm sorry, Chairman.

625
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,700
At a glance, I can tell this hand is...

626
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,520
straight.

627
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,500
I know.

628
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,640
I can tell it's straight at a glance.

629
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,690
Betting.

630
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,290
Check.

631
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,470
1.6 billion won.

632
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,760
Does it seem real now?

633
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,550
What kind of game table you are sitting at?

634
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,060
You don't think I can take 1.6 billion?

635
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,500
That's worth an apartment in Seoul.

636
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,480
No one would blame you even if you fold now. Right?

637
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,280
Call.

638
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,650
What is it?

639
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,980
Open.

640
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,840
He's acting.

641
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,400
I didn't know he was at this level.

642
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,270
He's got a partner.

643
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,190
But who?

644
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,410
Oh Soo Yeon only folded.

645
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,070
D*** it. Who's playing tricks here?

646
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,710
Go ahead.

647
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,720
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

648
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,370
And also Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

649
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,770
Both of them at the same time.

650
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:04,710
Chairman Do abducted Woo Sang Ki, so he can attack Chairman Yang of The Skin Nation.

651
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,730
I don't exactly know why at this time.

652
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,660
Hold on.

653
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,710
Chairman Yang is on the same team as Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook.

654
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,030
Chairman Yang...

655
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,830
He must now know that I'm his enemy.

656
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,290
CEO, please be careful.

657
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,870
And I will definitely get out as scheduled.

658
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,480
You do have a plan, right?

659
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,930
You need to look after the first leaguers here.

660
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,290
Especially Nam Dae Moon...

661
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,840
I mean...

662
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,760
There's a man named Noh Seung Hwan.

663
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,000
Please deposit double the usual amount for Noh Seung Hwan.

664
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,700
When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable.

665
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,660
He totally ignores you as soon as he's released?

666
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,780
Oh, my. Kim Yo Han. He's not the person I thought he was.

667
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,560
Whoa!

668
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,330
Chairman Yang will come to you now, Dean.

669
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,040
To the Dean...

670
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,430
I'll tell him myself.

671
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,100
Chairman Suh, CEO Cha...

672
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,160
They've never even met Kim Yo Han before.

673
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,470
Instead, they are helping me kill Kim Yo Han.

674
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,480
Astray, please.

675
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,820
My luck tonight sucks.

676
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,730
What is it that you want now?

677
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,980
Can't you leave me alone?

678
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,610
You'll regret it

679
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,100
if you let an important person get away like this.

680
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,810
Fold.

681
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,650
Let's say that all the others are like that, but

682
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,200
how could he cajole Chairman Suh?

683
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,570
That old man lacks nothing.

684
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,150
You want me to

685
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,380
work with you to overtake Chairman Yang?

686
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,340
Yes.

687
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,690
I've known those brothers for 20 years.

688
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,390
Did you come here knowing that?

689
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,460
Yes.

690
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,440
Over the past 20 years,

691
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,980
I know you have that many more resentments toward them.

692
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,650
And...

693
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,460
that you hate losing or making concessions. You're a fighter.

694
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,950
I have studied about you up to there.

695
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,690
Lift your head.

696
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:44,140
I would like to offer you Chairman Yang's The Skin Nation.

697
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,470
I'm not sure if it's to your taste.

698
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,650
10 billion won.

699
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,240
Call.

700
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,180
Got it.

701
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,420

Raise you 20 billion.

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,780

Call.

706
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,840
Call.

709
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,430
Got it.

710
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,420
And raise you 60 billion.

711
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,190
Let's raise the stakes.

712
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,760
Higher?

713
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,630
My 60 billion...

714
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,100
and this VIP room.

715
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,970
Is that possible?

716
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,560
This...

717
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,750
Okay...

718
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,500
60 billion.

719
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,800
Accepted and

720
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,610

That old man is your chairman, not mine.

He's flaunting.

Like saying this is my present to you.

738
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,610
He means to take away a legitimate business and give it away.

What will you need in order to win in there.

740
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,920
The way to access the Labuan Bank account with the Goldman slush funds is...

741
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,200
Director Jin's eye is required?

742
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,250
Director Jin Soo Min manages the account containing the slush funds.

743
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,160
Please get her.

744
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,450
If this is all true,

745
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,890
the Central Investigation Division will be uprooted.

746
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,600
How do you plan to deceive Jang Sun Oh?

00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,460
Do you want to know?

748
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,330
Did you come here to kill yourself?

749
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,260
If you f*** around, I'll donate all this money away.

Where's Director Jin?

I'm only doing what I'm told.

752
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,900
You have to ask Chairman Do Won Bong about that.

753
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,070
It's Chief Prosecutor Yoon who wants my head, right?

754
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,220
Why didn't you run away?

755
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,530
Do you know what it took for me to get up here?

756
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,630
Is the sinkhole prepared?
