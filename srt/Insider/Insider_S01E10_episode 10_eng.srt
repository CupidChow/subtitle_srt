00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,150
   

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,860
   

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,310
   

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,890

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,150
   

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,230
While you and Min Ho were abducted, they moved you to a different location once?

8
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,610
 I was only involved in wiring funds into the Labuan bank ...

9
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,060
 Is anybody inside? 

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,070
 Hello? Is anybody inside? 

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,480
 I brought what you asked for. 

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,580
 Think of your son in case you want to scream. 

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,730
- He was... 
  - Police!  
 - a policeman.

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,300
He said he was responding to a call and wanted to come inside the storage shack,

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,320
 but the guy who kidnapped us kept us still. 

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,600
 010-0913-3374. 

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,590
 If you are trapped inside, call this number. 

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,860
0913...

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,620
3374...

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,570
   

21
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,400
So after that policeman left, you were moved to a different location.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Yes.

23
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,680
 We were moved that same day. 

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,950
 Min Ho... are you okay? 

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,990
 Min Ho, go and find a policeman first. 

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,190
 Min Ho, run! 

27
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,520
 Run away! 

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,090
 Min Ho had escaped that night. 

29
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,400
And I...

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,340
escaped much later.

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,910
When I got out, I tried to call that number...

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,300
but the phone number didn't exist.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,110
 CEO, it's Inspector Kwon Dae Il's number. 
    

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,230
Inspector Kwon Dae Il.

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,690
 Dad, I met that policeman. 

36
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,320
 Inspector Kwon Dae Il. 

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,020
 When you get this message, call this number. 

38
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,620
 010-0245-0303. 

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,100
 That policeman who came to the storage shack. 

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,970
 - This is the police. 
 - Inspector Kwon Dae Il. 

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,980
But he had passed away.

42
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,410
 And Inspector Kwon, who was in charge of your grandmother's case. 
   

43
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,940
 I'm Inspector Kwon from Seoul Yongmoon Police Station, Criminal Affairs Division. 

44
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,380
 That inspector committed suicide. 

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,530
That's why I became even more cautious.

46
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,060
Because I knew that the Prosecutors' Office of Korea was behind the Goldman Casino.

47
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,730
I understand.

48
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,420
I mean... if it was going to turn out like this,

49
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,250
why did you go after Woo Sang Ki in the first place?

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,600
Yang Hwa and Yang Joon. I wanted to get past those two thugs

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,770
and see you both in person.

52
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,690
So I played a little trick.

53
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,860
A trick?

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,500
To make us come to you,

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,630
you abducted a skilled technician imperative to

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,500
laundering money for the Goldman slush fund?

57
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,140
Are you senile?

58
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,970
Oh, well...

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,580
For both of you, you still have a long way to go until you hit old age

60
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,380
in this era of living to be 100,

61
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,960
but I don't have that many years left in me.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,980
So even if I go when it's my time,

63
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,580
I want to go with a peace of mind.

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,170
Therefore, I made a bucket list of my own.

65
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,970
Bucket list?

66
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,640
And the first wish on the list is to enjoy working for the two of you.

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,820
How about working with me from now on and forgetting those thugs?

68
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,750
I don't mean to disrupt the rule, but just change the order a bit.

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,960
I think everyone can benefit from it.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,170
How are you different from those guys?

71
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,510
On top of that, you were pushed out by those guys,

72
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,670
and that's why you are in here.

73
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,380
We're not in the same standing when it comes to class.

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,840
I'm not a thug.

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,080
I buy out companies at a really cheap price

76
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,910
and fix them up nicely to sell for a profit. I'm a trader.

77
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,320
The company of the two brothers...

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,860
I'll take away The Skin Nation this time around

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,710
and offer it to you both as my grand opening treat.

80
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,920
If you can accept that for starters,

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,860
and if you can help me reclaim my position from those thugs,

82
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,430
I will forever take care of you both and do what's good for you going forward.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,790
Yes...

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,250
You go on ahead first. I need to take care of a few things first.

85
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,530
Okay.

86
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,510
Do you think Inspector Kwon has gone as far as finding out

87
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,980
that Jang Seon Oh killed your grandmother?

88
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,940
Because he found out,

89
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,010
 do you think Jang Seon Oh killed Inspector Kwon? 

90
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,560
They say you can die from having too much on your mind.

91
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,870
What do we have to do here today?

92
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,900
Pick up some seriously addicted gamblers

93
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,720
and get their signatures here.

94
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,210
   

95
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,800
   

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,750
How come they're under my name instead of the Chairman's?

97
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,380
Borrowing a name?

98
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,630
The Chairman is planning to steal The Skin Nation.

99
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,150
Kim Yo Han, you just need to go and play the game.

100
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,500
Win if you are told to win, and lose if you are told to lose.

101
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,280
So under your name?

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,770
No need to give out my name.

103
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,910
Just introduce yourself as Mr. Koo.

104
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,070
Were you going to frequent the house with your name?

105
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,950
Attorney Koo.

106
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,560
Who do you work for?

107
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,130
You belong to the Sinseon-dong elders, right?

108
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,500
I wonder why you haven't done anything, when you know Chairman Do wants you dead?

109
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,430
What are you holding in your hand?

110
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,640
If you are working for someone more powerful than Chairman Do,

111
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,500
Sinseon-dong would be the closest answer.

112
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,570
If you're not working under Chairman Do

113
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,780
but Sinseon-dong is using you to monitor Chairman Do...

114
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,640
Is that why you wanted to partner up with me?

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,500
Going as far as telling me that Chairman Do is trying to kill me.

116
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,500
Yes.

117
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,940
I don't want to die by Chairman Do's hands.

118
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,170
I imagine you also feel the same way.

119
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,280
All-in... 
    

120
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,530
   

121
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,920
   

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
   

123
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,340
   

124
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,400
- Call. 
 - All-in.

125
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,440
I got another good hand at the end.

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh, what to do...

127
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,230
I got a straight flush.

128
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,670
Nice work.

129
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,240
Well... as for the surgery date, go back there.

130
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,840
You can discuss it with him.

131
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,650
Sir, please let me live!

132
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,610
I really can't die right now.

133
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,410
I have two young daughters...

134
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,130
Do you want to sign a new document?

135
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,010
   

136
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:07,480
I hear that the company you work for is about to go public. 
    

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,200
   

138
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,370
Mr. Koo.

139
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,030
Who is Kim Yo Han?

140
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,480
You don't need to know that.

141
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,310
- Let's start the surgery. 
 - No, no!

142
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,260
No, no! I'll cover everything,

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,150
so you can buy as many as you want.

144
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,770
You can even buy the whole company.

145
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,180
Where do I sign?

146
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,120
- Next page. 
 - Go ahead, take it all!

147
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,140
   

148
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,370
   

149
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,830
   

150
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,000
   

151
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,540
Wow, so, so cruel.

152
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,010
Cruel.

153
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,010
Mr. Jo, I heard you kill people with this.

154
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,980
Chairman...

155
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,950
I really don't know where that Kim Yo Han is. That bastard.

156
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,420
Then why did you run away? 
    

157
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,300
I came into this organization

158
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,440
when I was 15 years old.

159
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
Even if I run away, where would I go?

160
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,380
If you let me go,

161
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,680
not only Kim Yo Han but that Woo-something. I'll bring them both to you!

162
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,670
You know, I'm pretty well-known in the underground collections world.

163
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,880
Are you going to use him?

164
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,940
Why is Chief Prosecutor Yoon so anxious to kill Kim Yo Han?

165
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,400
We are busy enough looking for Woo Sang Ki.

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,530
Are you going to use him?

167
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,960
If not, let's get rid of him.

168
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,360
Please spare me! Just spare me!

169
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,770
That Kim Yo Han. I know everything about him.

170
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,110
I'm the only one who can catch him.

171
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,490
- Hyung! 
 - What?

172
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,330
Are you going to use him?

173
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,240
D*mn...

174
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,540
Our stock is going public in a couple of days. What are you doing?

175
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,350
I'll take care of it.

176
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,490
Don't do anything stupid.

177
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,120
Are you... acting like this because of that woman?

178
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
 Why is Soo Yeon doing this... 

179
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,950
 It turns out she had already partnered up with Kim Yo Han. 

180
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,530
Geez.

181
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,140
Don't waste your time on a woman who already left you.

182
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,960
You are just causing double the pain.

183
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,770
This is no fun.

184
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,640
Where are you going?

185
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,050
Chairman Yang.

186
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,750
Hey, Joon!

187
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,910
Geez, that guy...

188
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,970
Manager, please spare me.

189
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,710
Let's see.

190
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,230
Gosh, Manager!

191
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,670
Please spare me!

192
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,150
Please!

193
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,870
Please spare me!

194
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,270
Made in Korea.

195
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,960
   

196
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,190
Chairman Suh of Dongdaemun Taepyeong Plaza.

197
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,520
He was released 10 years ago after serving time for embezzlement.

198
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,360
He got caught stealing 350 billion won from 3,000 investors.

199
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,430
Aigoo, he sure is greedy all right.

200
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,050
Playing cards? Is he into things like that?

201
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,840
It's been rumored that out of the 350 billion won he embezzled,

202
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,070
he lost 80 billion won playing Hold'em.

203
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,580
So he's a player, too.

204
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,930
Considering he took all the negative aspects of Do in prison or Yang who took over Namdaemun,

205
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,370
you could look at it that way.

206
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,110
He's no second fiddle to Do or Yang.

207
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,860
- He's that much of a bad guy? 
 - Right.

208
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,380
When Yang took down Do in Gangnam and took over all of Seoul,

209
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,170
the only one who withstood it all is Suh.

210
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,600
Chairman Suh.

211
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,110
Sounds good.

212
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,270
Good, bad, and ugly. He's got it all.

213
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,460
   

214
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,320
Excuse me.

215
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,560
Hello, Chairman Yang.

216
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,700
Aren't you busy with the listing ceremony?

217
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,880
Hey, Soo Yeon.

218
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,490
Are you...

219
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,030
available during our listing ceremony?

220
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,040
Of course.

221
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,940
I've already prepared my dress for that day.

222
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,930
 I'm sure you'll be pretty. 

223
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,100
After the ceremony,

224
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,440
we plan to have a bash with some of the VIPs.

225
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,280
Sounds fun.

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,890
Am I invited, too?

227
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,270
 Of course. 

228
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,950
There's always a place for you, my Soo Yeon.

229
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll also save another place.

230
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,570
So if you have a good friend, come together.

231
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,620
But... don't you need 10-20 million won minimum to play there?

232
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,950
 Well... 

233
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,960
Who can I bring who won't get rattled, and

234
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,640
enjoy a place like that?

235
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,980
 Abduct Woo Sang Ki... 

236
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,450
 get to The Skin Nation's finance director this time 

237
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,590
 and buy up convertible bonds. 

238
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,680
 Yo Han takes the shares from the equity holders by playing Hold'em. 

239
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,910
 Gather all that in the Dosan Holdings 

240
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,660
and take The Skin Nation entirely, huh?

241
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,350
What's after that? The casino?

242
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,160
 Let's say... this is the Goldman Casino in Incheon. 

243
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,250
 I said you have to take over this place to be number one in Korea's gambling scene. 

244
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,360
 But actually, this is just a cover. 

245
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,710
 Cover? 

246
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,240
 The game that makes real money is not the casino, 

247
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,290
 but what happens in the casino hotel's upstairs suites. 

248
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,250
 It happens in the VIP suites where only the ones with invitations are allowed in. 

249
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,080
 The real power behind the Goldman Casino 

250
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,260
 is not the casino, 

251
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,360
 but the slush fund, the money that is laundered through the casino. 

252
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,470
 Goldman slush fund. 

253
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,310
 The one who manages the slush fund becomes the casino's manager. 

254
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,680
 Anyway, if you can control the slush fund 

255
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 you can also acquire the casino. 

256
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,370
 So what's the scenario? 

257
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,810
 In a given year, there aren't many games held in the VIP suite. 

258
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,450
Unless a super VIP wants it or

259
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,260
 the game happens on a special occasion. 

260
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,330
 But you know Yang Joon's The Skin Nation? 

261
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,630
 I hear they might be going public really soon. 

262
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,520
 It's highly likely that a game will take place in the VIP suite on the day of the listing ceremony. 

263
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,760
 I can't play because I've been marked by Yang Joon. 

264
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,590
 But you go in and win tons of Yang Joon's money. 

265
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,660
 If you'll tie up Yang Joon there that night, 

266
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,500
 then in the meantime, I'll get to Director Jin, the one in charge of the slush funds. 

267
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,340
 I'll get Director Jin. 

268
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,110
 I'll twist her and get the slush fund in my hands. 

269
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,840
 You said you need an invitation to get into the room. 

270
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,970
 How will we get that invitation? 

271
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,710
 That's the crucial issue here. 

272
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,540
 Work on someone who's got the invitation 

273
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,160
 and pretend to be his proxy and get in. 

274
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,800
 I'll come up with something after my release tomorrow. 

275
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,110
Everything is... coming together at the Goldman Casino.

276
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,020
All of our plans are entangled.

277
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,100
If one thing goes wrong, then the rest will falter.

278
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,670
Don't worry too much.

279
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,610
If things go according to my plan...

280
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,530
Yes.

281
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,540
Good job.

282
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,360
See over there?

283
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,850
Make that more visible and center it around the new products.

284
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,230
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,600
Good job.

286
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,650
- That drum. Am I hitting it? 
 - Yes.

287
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Does it make a sound?

288
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,630
Yes, the audio is fine.

289
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,600
Have you tried it?

290
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,430
I'll check it again.

291
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,950
I heard Kim Yo Han was the dean at Seongju Prison.

292
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,650
Oh, man. It was a sh*tty period.

293
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,500
He used to be such a baby back then.

294
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,910
What did he eat to get so big?

295
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,210
Jang Seon Oh taught him?

296
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,030
I know, huh?

297
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,890
He took him as his successor.

298
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,650
He picked him and made him play cards day and night.

299
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,560
And no one knows what happened to him after he was released?

300
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,740
I did hear that he visited the school a few times after his release. 
  (T/N: School - Slang for prison) 

301
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,780
Sweep that up, too.

302
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,800
Okay.

303
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,960
Sweep over there, too.

304
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,750
Don't you have to go to the visitation room?

305
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,780
I heard your boss is in the Sinseon-dong.

306
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,430
Kim Yo Han is back here?

307
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,020
What?

308
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,210
You didn't know?

309
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,560
When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable.

310
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,510
He totally ignores you as soon as he's released?

311
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,330
Oh, my. Kim Yo Han...

312
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,010
He's not the person I thought he was.

313
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,420
He's as cold as dry ice.

314
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh, this, too. Take it.

315
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,040
Whoa!

316
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,280
I think I can find out if I asked a few people.

317
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,530
Do it right.

318
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,990
Yes, sir.

319
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,580
- Hello. Hello, hello. 
 - Welcome.

320
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,720
Let's get started.

321
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,030
The winner of this hand...

322
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,640
looks like it's me.

323
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,970
3 K's...

324
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,830
4 K's.

325
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,180
Sh*t.

326
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,210
   

327
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,470
Nice to meet you.

328
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,080
You look familiar.

329
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,040
   

330
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,900
Even if you are tired, don't go straight home.

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,290
Like this...

332
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,320
You should always go around twice before going in.

333
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,460
Bye now.

334
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,960
 This is how to tell if you are being followed. 

335
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,380
 Even if you allowed enough time and distance, 

336
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,030
 a person or a car keeps popping up. You have to figure that out. 

337
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,450
 Every time you change direction, 

338
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,470
 typically a new tail would take over. 

339
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,380
 The best way to beat them 

340
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,760
 is to frequently change directions and make the tail get up close to you. 

341
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
 Then... 

342
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,710
 go into a place with many entry points, like a department store or subway station, 

343
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,000
 and make the tail follow you in. 

344
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,620
 Hey! 

345
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,910
So you knew all this in advance?

346
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,200
Have you ever seen me talking nonsense?

347
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,580
Was that Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung?

348
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,440
He used at least six people to catch you.

349
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,200
That means...

350
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,310
he's trying to kill you.

351
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,580
Is he the one you were talking about earlier?

352
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,810
Yeah.

353
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,170
He circled around widely and spotted all of us.

354
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm certain I've been exposed.

355
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,810
Most of these guys here also.

356
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,770
You could've been photographed also.

357
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,230
   

358
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,940
 Geez! I can never get it right! 

359
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,550
 Geez! 

360
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,800
 Lost again! 

361
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,260
 Nothing works out. 

362
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,210
 Geez! 

363
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,930
 Look at this! 

364
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,090
 Look! 

365
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,600
 I'll win the lottery next! 

366
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,310
You must be hurting bad...

367
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,550
What is it?

368
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,130
Just follow me.

369
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,120
Don't be scared.

370
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,370
Why is your name Nam Dae Moon?

371
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,310
So that I'm not too stiff, easily opened and closed.

372
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,440
So that I could live like that. That's why it's Nam Dae Moon.

373
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,310
How long have you been out?

374
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,480
It's been 20 days.

375
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,480
Life is like a melodrama. I'll speak to you casually.

376
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,160
Do you know where Kim Yo Han is?

377
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,920
After his release, he was eager to make some money.

378
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,190
So he was looking for some games where he can make some money.

379
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,720
That's what I heard...

380
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,430
Really?

381
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,590
How come I haven't heard that?

382
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,870
Maybe because...

383
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,460
he's using an alias, Mr. Koo, to enter the games.

384
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,040
He wants to find whoever killed his grandmother and he needed money for that.

385
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,710
That's what I heard.

386
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,070
Who killed his grandmother?

387
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,830
I'm not sure. That's...

388
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,610
I'm not sure...

389
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,610
Thank you for this.

390
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,030
When a tumor grows in the pituitary gland, it is called prolactin.

391
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,110
It causes an abnormality in hormone secretion.

392
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,610
This drug can mimic similar symptoms.

393
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,700
You have to make it look like you have a real brain tumor.

394
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,460
So your meal menu will be changed accordingly.

395
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,710
To receive a suspended sentence,

396
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,880
you'll need to become so sickly that you can't hold a spoon.

397
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
When is the PET scan scheduled for?

398
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
It's set in two days in the morning.

399
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,390
 Independent investors in online communities say 

400
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,230
 when The Skin Nation goes public,
   

401
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,110
 the price is expected to double 

402
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,240
 creating the "Double-price" phenomenon. 

403
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,600
 They recommend the purchase of the stocks. 

404
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,900
 In the midst of these opinions, on the day the company goes public, 

405
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,150
 The Skin Nation is planning a large-scale promotional event
    

406
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,860
 at duty-free shops, garnering high anticipation. 

407
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,690
It'd be best to eat them whole on the day it goes public.

408
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,310
How about the head of the Brain Tumor Center?

409
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,800
Did you bribe him?

410
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,010
Yes, his daughter is studying art in college.

411
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,340
We offered to set up an exhibition for her.

412
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,270
After that,

413
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:08,330
the only thing remaining is for the DA to sign off on the suspension of execution.

414
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,220
So all that remains is

415
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,180
the Seocho-dong's decision.

416
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,760
 If The Skin Nation stock price doubles as a result of going public, 

417
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,620
 including all the stock market news in the latter part of the year 

418
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,630
 this will be the biggest news topic in the corporate world.
   

419
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,020
 What do you think about that? 

420
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,330
 The biggest factor that influences the cosmetics market is... 

421
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,350
What are you going to do?

422
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,150
How about you?

423
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,600
 In the instance of The Skin Nation... 

424
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm a little worried...

425
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,420
that I might get indigestion.

426
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,730
But you know, it takes a lot of money to keep our guys in line.

427
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,310
I mean, it looks like

428
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,670
no matter who sits in that seat, we won't have to quit our positions.

429
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,340
So if that's the case,

430
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,570
wouldn't it be better to go with that old man?

431
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,930
You don't really care for Manager Yang.

432
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,690
That's true, but

433
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,260
I've seen too many sunbaes who got burned from gluttony.

434
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,260
I really hate...

435
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,780
to see my family suffer, Sunbae.

436
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,040
Yeah...

437
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,260
Let's contemplate this a little more.

438
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,450
Mr. Koo?

439
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,210
You are out?

440
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,490
Thanks to you.

441
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,790
I came out after serving time that was never meant for me.

442
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,510
Well, then go and play.

443
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,160
Give it to me.

444
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,600
This is a small game for you, isn't it?

445
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,310
Let's see...

446
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:29,160
Oh, my! Your winning streak is going straight up at the end.

447
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,940
I heard you are desperate for money these days.

448
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,600
- What's this? 
 - An invitation.

449
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,610
They are setting up the biggest game in the country there.

450
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,100
How about it? Do you want to play big?

451
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,470
We got it.

452
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,970
Kim Yo Han received an invitation.

453
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,650
- You asked for me? 
 - Yes.

454
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,770
I'm glad you came.

455
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,320
Here, have some.

456
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,870
The Skin Nation listing ceremony.

457
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,330
I heard you received the invitation to their after-party.

458
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,260
Yes.

459
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,550
So when you go there that day...

460
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,450
the way you teamed up with Jang Seon Oh when you were here,

461
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,000
go and win the Goldman slush fund and bring it to me.

462
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,130
What?

463
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,630
Did you think you were the only one working for me?

464
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,530
Boy, look at the expression on your face.

465
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:02,230
Jang Seon Oh is also my possession, works for me just like you.

466
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't think that I deceived you.

467
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,280
You just quietly...

468
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,890
do what you have to do.

469
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,920
I will do as you said.

470
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,140
Will you be okay seeing Jang Seon Oh?

471
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,420
 Incheon Seobok-gu Wangin Beach Park Shelter 17:00. 

472
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,280
 Jang Seon Oh. 

473
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,960
 Just as I expected... 

474
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,130
 Jang Seon Oh was working for Do Won Bong. 

475
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,440
 Then... 

476
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,240
 my guess that Jang Seon Oh killed my grandmother is true. 

477
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,930
Sun Oh!

478
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,750
Hyung.

479
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,100
Wow. Your face looks much better.

480
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,190
Not as good as yours.

481
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,670
So how did you do it?

482
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,830
To find someone to get that invitation,

483
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,290
I've been doing everything I could since I got out.

484
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,390
But it didn't work out.

485
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,280
Maybe it's because too many people know what you look like.

486
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,020
True...

487
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,000
Not many people out here know you were the dean at Seongju prison, right?

488
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,700
So you got an invitation now.

489
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,800
Did you find out how the money laundering is done at the casino?

490
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,130
Okay.

491
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,500
In the last five years,

492
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:44,900
the 50,000 won bills that the banks couldn't recover is worth 12 trillion won.

493
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,880
Move it.

494
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
 What do they do if they want to spend that money? 

495
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,990
 They have to launder it all. 

496
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,900
 Enjoy! 

497
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,760
 The Goldman Casino in Incheon 

498
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,340
 is operated jointly by the Macau Goldman Casino Group and Yang Joon, Yang Hwa. 

499
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,730
 It's a foreigners-only casino. 

500
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,210
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

501
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,250
 They would say the cash slush funds that the Deep Pockets handed over 

502
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,570
 came from the foreign tourists who come to gamble here. 

503
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,120
 It all becomes the casino's revenue 

504
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,930
 and if it's withdrawn from the Macau head office, 

505
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,430
 the international wiring of the funds is completed. 

506
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,650
 Out of today's revenue at Incheon Goldman, designate 850 million won as Macau Goldman's revenue. 

507
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,200
 Should I withdraw it as cash like before and deliver it to Woo Sang Ki? 

508
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,220
 Set it aside for a while in a separate account. 

509
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,950
Finally, the money is exchanged for bitcoin in Hong Kong

510
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,210
and wired to a tax haven where it sits in a business account under a borrowed name.

511
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,300
Exactly.

512
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,970
As expected of a model student, you studied everything already.

513
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,100
People don't really change, right?

514
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,070
Right?

515
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,370
People don't change.

516
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,600
 The Skin Nation, a cosmetics company that has attracted a lot of interest among investors, 

517
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,000
 is about to be listed at 9 a.m. today. 

518
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,290
 There was some controversy over the high valuation... 

519
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:28,350
Now, let's check today's final closing price

520
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,850
on the first day of the historic listing of The Skin Nation!

521
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,320
 They anticipate a very successful opening day, doubling the price. 

522
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,380
 Five, four, three, two, one! 

523
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,860
   

524
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,200
 Congratulations! 

525
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,330
The offer price was 39,000 won.

526
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,790
The final stock valuation is 101,400 won, an increase of 160%!

527
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,710
It's more than double, everyone!

528
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,590
Let's go!

529
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,700
 Yang Joon! Yang Joon! 

530
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,560
 - Yang Joon! Yang Joon!  
 - CEO, I'm Seok Hong.

531
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,100
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

532
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,740
Congratulations, CEO Cha.

533
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,080
It looks like you'll make some money this time.

534
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,910
As for me, I'm sure I'll just get some crumbs.

535
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,000
Will you be coming to our after-party planned for this evening?

536
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,930
Who goes to school to study?

537
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,130
You go there to eat your lunch.

538
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,170
Security check, please.

539
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,300
A VIP is entering.

540
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,870
Why is Kim Yo Han here?

541
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,520
Geez, I told you not to stir trouble.

542
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,240
Don't you stir up trouble, Hyung.

543
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,800
Don't go up against the prosecutors.

544
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,110
They can kill several with just a phone call.

545
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,370
 Would it be possible to hold a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets?
    

546
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,040
Annie Stevens...

547
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,610
She wants a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets. Sh**...

548
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,530
Man...

549
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,950
Geez...

550
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,650
One Gangster, two gangsters, one prosecutor, two prosecutors...

551
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,470
One avenger, two avengers...

552
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,170
Here.

553
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,680
Slush fund in the full...

554
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,920
If an avenger catches a slush fund in the full flop of the account...

555
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,230
Sinseon-dong, Sinseon-dong, Goldman, Goldman...

556
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,200
Turn and Chairman Do...

557
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,090
If Chairman Do deals big, the cards and button...

558
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,600
Call, call , call...

559
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,230
And then river...

560
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,390
Soo Yeon.

561
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,970
Chairman.

562
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,040
 Kim Yo Han has won another hand. 

563
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,820
 8,000 on this game. 

564
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,940
 Today's total is 723 million won. 

565
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,040
Let's go in.

566
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,950
Ladies first.

567
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,280
All the VIPs inside have been informed, right?

568
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,070
That I will kill Kim Yo Han tonight.

569
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,100
Yes, they said they'll all cooperate.

570
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,010
Of course... Chairman Suh, you are here as well.

571
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,130
CEO Cha, long time no see.

572
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:02,000
All right, how are your winning streaks tonight?

573
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
This is just the start.

574
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,470
This new guy is something else.

575
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,560
Is that so?

576
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,380
Everyone, take caution.

577
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
For an entertaining evening,

578
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,760
he's a special 'devil' I invited tonight. 
  (T/N: Devil - A slang that means a cheater in Poker) 

579
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,880
It's been a long time, Kim Yo Han.

580
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,110
Thank you for the invitation, Chairman Yang.

581
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,330
Gosh, Yo Han...

582
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,780
You are shameless.

583
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,520
I invited the elders, so they'll have a good time.

584
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,490
But if you keep winning like that, they'll say you're being rude.

585
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,930
Oh, my.

586
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,170
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,000
I guess I didn't read the room.

588
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,710
I heard this was a major league, so

589
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,850
I swung my bat pretty hard.

590
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,180
Chairman Suh? Chairman Suh, right?

591
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,680
Shall I...

592
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,630
tone it down a bit?

593
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,010
Hey.

594
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,940
Even being rude and talking cheap is part of this culture.

595
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,670
Merely a few million won. We'll just say we chewed it up to stay awake.

596
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,270
Right now is just perfect.

597
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,670
Just right.

598
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,280
Now is just right, he says.

599
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,740
What's your name there?

600
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm Oh Soo Yeon. It's nice to meet you.

601
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,370
It's my first time meeting you. I'm very pleased to meet you.

602
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,400
Are you seeing anyone?

603
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,410
If there is, does anything change?

604
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,190
As for introductions...

605
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,250
I think that's enough.

606
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,320
Okay. Let's resume the game.

607
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,870
I've been looking forward to this night all day long.

608
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,210
I can't bear to wait any longer.

609
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,960
Call!

610
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,870
Who are you looking for, sir?

611
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,450
Is there a VIP room? Where the stakes are higher.

612
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,200
The high betting room is over there.

613
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,310
Did you see Kim Yo Han?

614
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,130
He went up.

615
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,400
What are you going to do?

616
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,080
Let's make our move.

617
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,920
Betting.

618
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,980
800 Million.

619
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,530
Call.

620
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,570
Open.

621
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,700
Full house.

622
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,970
I got four of a kind.

623
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,850
Fold.

624
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,390
Three.

625
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,400
- Call. 
 - Fold.

626
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,590
Chairman... you should have some fun, too.

627
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,270
I'm sorry, Chairman.

628
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,350
At a glance, I can tell this hand is a...

629
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,420
straight.

630
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,600
I know.

631
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,540
I can tell it's a straight at a glance.

632
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,590
Betting.

633
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,190
Check.

634
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,370
1.6 billion won.

635
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,660
Does it seem real now?

636
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,450
What kind of game table you are sitting at?

637
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,960
You don't think I can take 1.6 billion?

638
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,300
That's worth an apartment in Seoul.

639
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,380
No one would blame you even if you were to fold now. Right?

640
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,180
Call.

641
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,550
What is it?

642
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,880
Open.

643
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,740
 He's acting. 

644
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,300
 I didn't know he was at this level. 

645
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,170
 He's got a partner. 

646
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,090
 But who? 

647
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,310
 Only Oh Soo Yeon folded. 

648
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,970
 D*** it. Who's playing tricks here? 

649
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,610
 Go ahead. 

650
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,620
 We need to secure Woo Sang Ki. 

651
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,270
 And also Attorney Koo Bon Chul. 

652
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,670
 Both of them at the same time. 

653
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:38,610
 Chairman Do abducted Woo Sang Ki, so he can attack Chairman Yang of The Skin Nation. 

654
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,630
 I don't exactly know why at this time. 

655
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,560
 Hold on. 

656
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,260
 Chairman Yang is on the same team as Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook. 

657
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,610
 Chairman Yang is on the same team as Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook. 

658
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,930
 Chairman Yang... 

659
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,730
 He must now know that I'm his enemy. 

660
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,190
 CEO, please be careful. 

661
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,770
 And... I will definitely get out as scheduled. 

662
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,380
 You do have a plan, right? 

663
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,830
 You need to look after the first leaguers here. 

664
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,190
 Especially Nam Dae Moon... 

665
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,740
 I mean... 

666
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,660
 There's a man named Noh Seung Hwan. 

667
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,900
 Please deposit double the usual amount for Noh Seung Hwan. 

668
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,600
 When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable. 

669
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,560
 He totally ignores you as soon as he's released? 

670
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,680
 Oh, my. Kim Yo Han. He's not the person I thought he was. 

671
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,460
 Whoa! 

672
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,230
 Chairman Yang will come to you now, Dean. 

673
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,940
 To the Dean... 

674
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,330
 I'll tell him myself. 

675
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,000
 Chairman Suh, CEO Cha... 

676
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,060
 They've never even met Kim Yo Han before. 

677
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,370
 Instead, they are to help me kill Kim Yo Han. 

678
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,380
Astray, please.

679
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,720
 My luck tonight sucks. 

680
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,630
 What is it that you want now? 

681
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:00,880
 Can't you leave me alone? 

682
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,510
 You'll regret it... 

683
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,000
 if you let an important person get away like this. 

684
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,710
Fold.

685
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,550
 Let's say that all the others are like that, but 

686
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,100
 how could he cajole Chairman Suh? 

687
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,470
 That old man lacks nothing. 

688
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,050
You want me to

689
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:46,280
work with you to overtake Chairman Yang?

690
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,240
Yes.

691
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,590
I've known those brothers for 20 years.

692
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,290
Did you come here knowing that?

693
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,360
Yes.

694
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,340
Over the past 20 years,

695
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,880
I know you have that many more resentments toward them.

696
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,550
And...

697
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,360
that you hate losing or making concessions. You're a fighter.

698
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,850
I've only studied about you up to there.

699
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,590
Lift your head.

700
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,040
I would like to offer you Chairman Yang's The Skin Nation.

701
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,370
I'm not sure if it's to your taste.

702
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,550
10 billion won.

703
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,140
Call.

704
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,080
Got it.

705
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,320
And raise you 10 billion.

 - Got it.

707
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,400
Raise you 20 billion.

708
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,680
Chairman...

709
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,160
Call.

710
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,740
Call.

711
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,400
40 billion.

712
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,220
Fold.

713
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,330
Got it.

714
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,320
And raise you 6 billion.

715
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,090
Let's raise the stakes.

716
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,660
Higher?

717
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,530
My 6 billion...

718
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,000
and this VIP room.

719
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,870
Is that possible?

720
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:55,060
This is worth about 8 billion.

721
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,850
Okay...

722
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,200
6 billion.

723
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,600
Accepted and include the VIP room.

724
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,800
Call.

 That's going to be tough. 

738

 How could this be? 

739
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,220
 How much of Seocho-dong did you buy?

 That old man is your chairman, not mine. 

741
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,910
 He's flaunting. 

742
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,460
 Like saying this is my present to you. 

743
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,310
 He means to take away a legitimate business and give it away. 

744
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,730
 What will you need in order to win in there? 

745
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,820
 The way to access the Labuan Bank account with the Goldman slush funds is... 

746
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,900
 Director Jin's eye is required? 

747
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,950
 Director Jin Soo Min manages the account containing the slush funds. 

748
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:08,960
 Please get her. 

749
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,650
 If this is all true, the Central Investigation Division will be uprooted. 

750
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,300
 How do you plan to deceive Jang Seon Oh? 

751
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,460
 Do you want to know? 

752
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,030
 Did you come here to kill yourself? 

753
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,060
 If you f*ck around, I'll donate all this money away. 

754
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,550
 Where's Director Jin? 

755
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:24,910
 I'm only doing what I'm told. 

756
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,700
 You have to ask Chairman Do Won Bong about that. 

757
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,670
 It's Chief Prosecutor Yoon who wants my head, right? 

758
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,920
 Why didn't you run away? 

759
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,530
 Do you know what it took for me to get up here? 

760
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,330
 Is the sinkhole prepared? 

761
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:42,080
 If you don't see a sign from me in 30 minutes, begin as you see fit.
