1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,780
   

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,910
   

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,230
   

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,930
   

5
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:45,520


6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,020
   

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,810
Hey! You're on the same team as Kim Yo Han, right?

8
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,030
Hand over your phone while I'm using my words.

9
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,580
If you shoot, this place will be the source location.

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,570
If you must capture Yoon Byung Wook with your own hands,

11
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,720
you must survive for the moment.

12
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm not a substitute.

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,150
I'm replacing you.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,290
Send out the message.

15
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,970
Whoever kills Kim Yo Han is the next manager of the casino.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,380
This was used to anesthetize animals.

17
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,710
You're supposed to use half the size of your pinky nail on a human.

18
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,570
And I'm extremely grateful...

20
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,940
for things I was grateful to you for.

21
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,040
I got it. So leave now.

22
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you...

23
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,380
cutting me off right now?

24
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,170
So you won't do anything about whether or not I survive out there?

25
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,520
I said I got everything.

26
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,190
I'll try to figure everything out.

27
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,360
Answer my call right away.

28
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,260
   

29
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,820
   

30
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,240
Heo Sang Su?

31
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,410
Sang Su. 
    

32
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,920
Errand.

33
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,130
Okay.

34
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,900
Connect Jang Sun Oh and Do Won Bong using this.

35
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,890
You're here.

36
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
What about CEO Oh?

37
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,780
She said she'd be back by now for tomorrow morning's security check preparation.

38
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,820
She's running a little late.

39
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,190
Is that all true?

40
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,320
I'll let the Prosecutor General know.

41
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,720
You go and check if Oh Soo Yeon is Lee Yeon Su.

42
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,180
I'll check right away.

43
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,820
I just need to head to Goldman, right?

44
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,460
Yes.

45
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,290
Shall I leave?

46
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,620
   

47
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,140
   

48
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,610
Pull over here for a second.

49
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,150
 Don't answer and just listen. 

50
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,400
 The people you're with. 

51
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,510
 They'll try to kill you. 

52
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,530
 You must survive, okay? 

53
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,970
Let's go.

54
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,730
It's fine. Get in.

55
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,170
Get in.

56
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,780
- Hey, get him! 
 - What is this?

57
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,550
He's fast, sh*t!

58
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,580
Stop, you a**hole!

59
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,560
- Where did he go? 
 - That way!

60
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,690
Hey, find him!

61
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,410
- Get him! 
 - Sh*t!

62
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,770
- Stop! 
 - Run!

63
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,070
Stop him! Kill him!

64
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,500
   

65
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,590
Yes.

66
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,690
 Where are you? 

67
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,130
Being chased. Why?

68
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,760
 I'll go get you right now. 

69
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,660
 Where do I need to go? 

70
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,290
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

71
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,830
Drink, drink.

72
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,340
Here, here!

73
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,750
- Long time no see! 
 - Tell me about it.

74
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,330
 It'll be hard on your own. 

75
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,920
 I'll be right there. 

76
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,020
 - Hurry up and tell me your location.  
 - Hurry up and tell me your location.

77
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,160
- Hey! 
 - He's there!

78
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,250
Right there!

79
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,050
   

80
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,560
They'll catch Kim Yo Han there...

81
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,410
Catch him there...

82
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,980
Yes, speak.

83
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,200
What? You lost him?

84
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,460
Give me a f***ing break...

85
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,580
Didn't you say he even did a job in North Korea and came back?

86
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,710
Sh*t. Get a refund!

87
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,380
Stupid idiot.

88
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,800
   

89
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,340
   

90
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,530
Quick, quick, quick.

91
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,740
   

92
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,930
   

93
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,370
Geez, you scared me.

94
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,420
What are you doing over there?

95
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,320
Let's go.

96
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,970
It's Chairman Do's phone.

97
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,430
   

98
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,420
Then it means Mr. Jo got this text, too.

99
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,630
And you still can't reach Mr. Nam?

100
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,040
CEO.

101
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,270
Yes.

102
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,090
What did you say?

103
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,270
Did something happen with Chairman Do?

104
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,660
CEO.

105
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,360
   

106
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,100
   
 CEO Oh? 

107
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,450
You're with Kim Yo Han, right?

108
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,090
Yes. What do you need?

109
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,570
 Aigoo. Who might this be? 

110
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,570
 Hearing your voice makes me think... 

111
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,880
Geez, where did all my money go?

112
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,070
 Oh, you were startled a little earlier, right? 

113
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,050
Are you with Mr. Nam right now?

114
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,270
Will you come pick him up?

115
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,030
I'll head over there, so let's talk in person.

116
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,550
Wow.

117
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,230
I see, you get to drink at places like this now that you've got a sponsor.

118
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,670
Well, congrats on the Sinseon-dong.

119
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,890
That's what I'm saying.

120
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,980
I wonder if I should've been sponsored like you long ago.

121
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,310
Why did you call me over?

122
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,420
Do you know that Kim Yo Han is trying to prosecute you?

123
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,340
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

124
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,970
It's not me.

125
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,410
But that must mean that there's someone else.

126
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,990
Somebody around you.

127
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,380
Around me...

128
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,030
Then...

129
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,980
would a guy far down in Yeosu try to get you?

130
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,430
If he's after you...

131
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,800
wouldn't he have to be one of your CID kids?

132
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,150
Your reason for letting me in on this?

133
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,890
What do you...

134
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,670
think about providing mutual help?

135
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,480
Inspector Park Ro Sa is on the way, too.

136
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,680
Stay with her, and I'll contact you.

137
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,410
You mean you're going in there alone?

138
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,370
If you die,

139
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,140
your plan dies, too.

140
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,710
- So— 
 - Yes.

141
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,190
I'll be careful.

142
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,220
Hey. Get him.

143
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,330
 Seya? 

144
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,350
Are you here, my dear Yo Han?

145
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,560
Don't waste your energy there

146
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,630
and come up here carefully, okay?

147
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,290
 Stay right behind him and kill him as soon as I signal. 

148
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,240
Gosh, my Yo Han hyungnim,

149
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
you have balls of steel, don't you?

150
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
But...

151
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,180
what is that knife for?

152
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,500
Put it down already. Who are you trying to stab?

153
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,440
Yang Joon, Yang Hwa, and Chairman Do.

154
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,610
You can't handle them by yourself, Mr. Jo.

155
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,660
Did they say that the position makes the man?

156
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,570
Now that I'm sitting here like this

157
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,370
and you're standing there like that,

158
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:38,650
it reminds me of my golden days, you know?

159
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,210
Since you're not asking any questions,

160
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,320
I assume you also saw Annie's text.
   

161
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,620
Then I'll get to the point.

162
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,670
Unless you plan to cut me in half,

163
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,040
put that knife down and

164
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,000
throw in your towel already.

165
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,380
All righty?

166
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,800
   

167
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,470
You know me, right?

168
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,960
I... am a person...

169
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,110
who will kill when I say, "I'll kill."

170
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,600
What is it?

171
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,060
Hey!

172
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,750
What are you doing?

173
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,180
Sh*t.

174
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
I took care of the control room, Hyungnim.

175
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,650
Who is it?

176
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,740
Bastards who betrayed me over money...

177
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,900
are not my family.

178
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,490
Let's go.

179
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,370
Let's go!

180
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,570
I'll go on up first.

181
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,120
- Radio me. 
 - I'll go with him!

182
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,520
Kill them all!

183
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,280
 Hand Kim Yo Han over unless you want to die. 

184
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,830
Hey, let Mr. Nam go.

185
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,830
Do you think you can take on both Yang Hwa and me?

186
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,970
He's coming for your neck, a**hole.

187
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,030
He'll kill you first and then me, though.

188
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,690
Don't you think?

189
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,970
Come out, all of you!

190
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,340
All three of you were together?

191
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,790
Let's have you all die together today.

192
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,280
Sh*t.

193
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,470
Secure Yang Joon.

194
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,610
So you can make a deal with Yang Hwa.

195
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,620
Yang Joon, are you on the 20th floor?

196
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,500
Joon!

197
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,060
Man...

198
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,640
Did you also learn to fight in prison?

199
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,510
What? Do you want a piece of me?

200
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,070
You bastard...

201
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Wh-What are you doing? Th-That,

202
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,280
th-that guy...

203
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,660
Stop him from getting to the 20th floor.

204
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,510
We have to stop that nutcase.

205
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,150
- Hurr— 
 - Sh*t.

206
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,250
Hey, you!

207
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,580
Hey!

208
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,750
 It didn't stop at just the pancreas. 

209
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,800
 It followed the veins and remotely spread to the liver. 

210
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,790
 Remotely spread? 

211
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,460
 To label it in certain stages, 

212
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,540
 it would be stage four cancer. 

213
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,890
The show's over now.

214
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,860
   

215
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,080
 The person you are calling is not available... 

216
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,250
   
 (T/N: Police) 

217
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,410
Hop on my back.

218
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,960
- Go get Yang Joon first. 
 - Shut up.

219
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,630
Shut up and get on my back!

220
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,380
You should've left when I told you to.

221
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,040
 You should go back to where you came from. 

222
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,030
 This is not a place for you. 

223
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,350
Take responsibility...

224
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,180
of my daughter.

225
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,610
Sh*t!

226
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,650
 The police are here! 

227
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,270
What are you doing?

228
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,330
You can't get out on your own, either.

229
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,750
Put my brother down.

230
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,600
We don't have time for this. He'll die for real!

231
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,800
- I said to put him down— 
 -  Two arrest teams and more coming! 

232
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,940
 You have to leave now. 

233
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,240
Block the police.

234
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,800
Then I'll save your brother and put my life on the line.

235
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,690
Why should I trust you?

236
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,110
Because I need you to testify.

237
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,600
I parked the car.

238
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
Take that car when you leave.

239
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,970
Thank you.

240
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,020
In place of my late father...

241
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,800
please come back anytime if it means we can kill Yoon Byung Wook, CEO.

242
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,420
 Last night, around 11:00 p.m. at the Goldman Casino, Incheon, 

243
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,700
 a large scale act of violence was seen 

244
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,370
 which is thought to have been a clash between two criminal organizations. 

245
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,460
 As a result, Prosecutor Hong was killed 

246
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,430
 and Goldman Financial Director Noh and an additional 60 people were found dead. 

247
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,930
 The police announced plans to investigate 

248
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,100
 internal CCTVs and nearby surveillance cameras 

249
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,390
 after restoring them.
  

250
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,930
 The police investigating the incident
   

251
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,370
 pointed out Manager Kim as the focal individual for the incident 

252
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,000
 and have started working on locating him. 

253
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,160
 They're considering forced investigation among all other options 

254
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,090
 and stated their plan to conduct a national search. 

255
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,210
 Regarding this Incheon Goldman Casino incident, police particularly mentioned 

256
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,080
 the need for a joint investigation with the prosecution. 

257
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,720
Yo Han.

258
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,080
You must only answer my calls.

259
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't answer CEO Oh's calls, either.

260
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,400
That's protecting her.

261
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,340
All right.

262
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,390
   

263
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,570
Did you

264
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,410
look into why he...

265
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,530
went to that place?

266
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,370
I'm still checking.

267
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,980
Okay.

268
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,900
The Supreme Prosecution people and your crew are over there.

269
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,450
Where's Byung Wook?

270
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,880
He came to say hi and left right away.

271
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,970
All of you...

272
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,990
secretly search Byung Wook's...

273
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,270
call history...

274
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,380
and financial history...

275
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,360
without him knowing.

276
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,650
Report anything that

277
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,730
matches Jae Sun's for

278
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,050
the last one month.

279
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,580
Yes, Sir.

280
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,440
   

281
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,430
Hey.

282
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,090
Who's going to take charge of this one, huh?

283
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,190
I'll take this one.

284
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,730
Hey.

285
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,070
This one's complicated.

286
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,130
Hong Jae Sun from the CID is involved, too.

287
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,800
The arrest warrant for Kim Yo Han is to be delivered this afternoon.

288
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,900
I heard you voluntarily took the case?

289
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,550
Yes.

290
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,220
You know Chairman Suh Jin Cheol of Dongdaemun?

291
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,830
The one who was busted for planned real estate fraud.

292
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,110
I do.

293
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,390
He seems to be a decent person.

294
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,480
He's had trouble with the Bukyeongpa gang for a long time,

295
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,140
received 48 percent of The Skin Nation way too easily

296
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,710
from Kim Yo Han right after it went public.
   

297
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,860
I think if I dig into Goldman,

298
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,200
Chairman Suh will surface for sure.

299
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,320
Chief, I've been after Chairman Suh for four years.

300
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,360
I know.

301
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,570
Chairman Suh, should get caught at least once.

302
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,490
But...

303
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,230
why did you want to see me?

304
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,920
Because of Hong Jae Sun.

305
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,880
Yes...

306
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,200
I've been following that case because

307
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,150
Prosecutor General Hong is gravely heartbroken.

308
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,330
Let's put Oh Soo Yeon on the list

309
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,890
for the arrest warrant request.

310
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,590
Oh Soo Yeon?

311
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,250
She's the owner of Burj Nadiyya in Gangnam.

312
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,570
Her real name is Lee Yeon Soo.

313
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,340
Lee Yeon Soo.

314
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:53,700
I'll take care of it later so let's add her to the list first.

315
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,740
Okay, I understand.

316
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,600
   

317
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,980
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

318
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,770
   

319
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,360
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

320
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,170
 Next news. 

321
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,970
 In regards to last night's Incheon Goldman Incident,
   

322
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,770
 they issued an emergency public arrest warrant for suspect Kim Yo Han and 

323
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,180
  accomplice Oh Soo Yeon as wanted criminals.
   

324
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,200
 It's an emergency decision that from the first day of investigations took less than a day to get. 

325
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,570
 In doing so, the police emphasized the heinous nature of this case. 

326
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,430
 The police also promised grave punishments and robust investigations, 

327
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,940
 showing their strong dedication to calm national concerns and social anxiety. 

328
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,250
Kim Yo Han is done for.

329
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,360
 In regards to this matter, the police spokesperson Kim Ji Sook said, 

330
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,070
 "This case's possible connection to an international criminal organization 

331
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,700
 - cannot be overlooked."  
 - I will tie the knot, Yo Han.

332
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,400
 They will also form a specialized investigations team centered around the police agency... 

333
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,570
 The weather is so nice today. 

334
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,480
   

335
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,970
Please show your ID.

336
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,580
   

337
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,130
- So this is what I did. 
 - Get out of here.

338
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,550
Let's go elsewhere.

339
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,930
Go on ahead.

340
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,530
Hello?

341
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,030
This is our first time meeting like this, isn't it?

342
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,780
Aren't you scared of me?

343
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,990
Should I be scared of you?

344
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,900
The Chelin Case.

345
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,440
You had also invested 5 billion won there.

346
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,240
Using an English name.

347
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,530
You took that case into your own hands

348
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,510
to erase your footprints in the pyramid scheme case.

349
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,900
Then you framed the easiest target of the

350
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,980
initial investors,

351
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,140
Hostess Oh An Na, as the main culprit.

352
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,010
Oh An Na attempted to

353
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,980
expose your share of the investment because of resentment.

354
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,560
Only to be found hanging dead

355
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,500
a day before the press conference, that Oh An Na.

356
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,710
The investigations were ceased because the dead could not be charged.

357
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:45,610
And since you were the prosecutor in charge,

358
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,860
you announced it to the press as if

359
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,500
Oh An Na was the real culprit.

360
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,590
So why should Lee Yeon Soo, the daughter of that Oh An Na...

361
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,940
Why should she fear you?

362
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:11,160
Then you proceeded to sell me off to the brothel

363
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,850
when I was only 16 years old.

364
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,810
While my friends went to school in uniforms,

365
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,060
I fell asleep after enduring tens of adults through the night with nothing but my body.

366
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,520
By the time I became 20,

367
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,450
I had forgotten all the letters that I had learned.

368
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,090
So...

369
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,260
are you trying to exact revenge or something?

370
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,850
Well, why can't I?

371
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,990
It's a dangerous thought.

372
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,780
It's not the law that's unfair. It's the world.

373
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,220
If the law isn't fair...

374
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,370
shouldn't you realize justice based on your own capabilities?

375
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,670
That's a severe victim mentality.

376
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,440
Why don't you go...

377
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,490
see a doctor instead of a judge?

378
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,960
I already did.

379
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,100
Thanks to you.

380
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,280
Then you just need to go to jail now.

381
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,500
Aren't you afraid of people?

382
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,710
Does revenge...

383
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,640
not scare you?

384
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,200
Do I need to be afraid of you?

385
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,170
The victim should've been careful.

386
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
If you feel such injustice,

387
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,970
hurry up and hire a lawyer.

388
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:37,150
We exist because of people like you who still believe that the world is fair.

389
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,030
Also...

390
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,960
run away...

391
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,750
while you can run.

392
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,050
He needs to be hospitalized now.

393
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,880
Can't do much more...

394
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,340
What hospital...

395
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,720
Just call my hyung over.

396
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,470
You a**hole...

397
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,370
It's all over.

398
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,150
If I die like this here,

399
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,770
my hyung really will kill you.

400
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,400
Lee Tae Gwang's video...

401
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,480
Find it if it's still there.

402
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,510
The video...

403
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,780
of you gambling overseas?

404
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,690
That one?

405
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,790
I was only...

406
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,430
the intro medley.

407
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,320
The main chorus...

408
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,760
was Yoon Byung Wook.

409
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,630
   

410
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,000
You became a lot healthier.

411
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,210
I'm glad.

412
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,470
Well...

413
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,420
It was tough, but...

414
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,620
I came to ask you a favor.

415
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,000
The video...

416
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,610
of Chairman Yang from a long time ago...

417
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,780
Do you still have it, by chance?

418
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,370
 And that Lee Tae Gwang's USB you were desperately looking for in prison. 

419
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,430
 Do you know what's in it? 

420
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,680
 Jang Seon Oh definitely saw the video, and 

421
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,270
 he knew of its value. 

422
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,460
Y-you, what's with you?!

423
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,830
Security, security!

424
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,800
Don't do it!

425
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,900
Don't do it!

426
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,600
Oh Soo Yeon.

427
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,370
Asking for backup!

428
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,840
Section Four, calling backup!

429
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,940
Kim Yo Han, you are under

430
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,450
urgent arrest on charges of organized crime, special assault, and murder

431
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,300
in the Goldman Casino case.

432
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,840
And Oh Soo Yeon,

433
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,730
you're also under arrest for aiding and abetting murder.

434
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,990
I have something to tell you.

435
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,640
Yes.

436
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,950
Please go ahead.

437
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,100
Chairman Do...

438
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,080
I'm sorry.

439
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,560
I had to because he had already caught on to our pla—

440
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,710
I'm sorry...

442
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,740
Are you okay?

443
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,410
That kind of ending is natural for someone

444
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,170
with that much karma.

445
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,240
More than him...

446
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,960
I'm more worried about you.

447
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,420
Wasn't it your first time?

448
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:00,590
Whatever decision I had made,

449
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,570
you were by my side, CEO.

450
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:09,890
I will also stand by you.

451
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,910
So you...

452
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:18,200
choose the path you desire, whenever you want.

453
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:33,530
Where have you been... all this time?

454
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,900
I found out where Lee Tae Gwang's video is.

455
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,210
How?

456
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,370
 Why did you help me? 

457
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,530
Because you were suffering.

458
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,800
Is there a reason for helping someone in pain?

459
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,570
I understand.

460
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,140
I'll be back again.

461
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,240
 Gambling den operators... 

462
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,980
 hide their secrets in gamblers' debts. 

463
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,680
 Using the ID and password we got from Director Jin's phone, 

464
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,220
 I connected Chairman Do and Chairman Yang with her transaction history. 

465
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,880
Chairman Do and Jang Seon Oh

466
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,400
were connected with the money that Jang Seon Oh hid in his gambler's debt.

467
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,470
 Mr. Nam had one particular ledger. 

468
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,070
 Please tell me. 

469
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,400
 Don't touch me. Seriously. 

470
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,000
 Mr. Nam already knew that 

471
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,260
 Jang Seon Oh disappears from the prison at times. 

472
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,600
 After he came back from his job as a fixer, he got paid by Do Won Bong, 

473
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,490
 then put it in the form of gambler's debt that we never recovered, 

474
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:14,540
 which was hidden in Seongju Prison's 1st leaguers' bank accounts. 

475
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,840
I'm from Seongju Prison.

476
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,480
I was told you have 130 million of gambler's debt.

477
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,020
 One of those debts will contain info about the location of Lee Tae Gwang's video. 

478
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,790
 The scene of Yoon Byung Wook instigating murder. 

479
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:06,290
 Even if it doesn't have the sound, but if it's Lee Tae Gwang's video... 

480
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:12,010
   

481
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,920
   

482
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,660
 Defendant Yoon Byung Wook? 

483
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,130
   

484
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,920
What is this crap?

485
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,270
   

486
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,780
 Let's meet up with Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon.
   

487
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,990
 The location is the Goldman Casino's Manager's room. 

488
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,980
 At the river, 

489
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,470
the table turns.

490
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,760
   

491
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,280
What are you doing?

492
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,620
Didn't you call me to make a deal?

493
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,770
There are no deals or anything like that.

494
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,220
Then what? A mock trial?

495
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,750
Are you all playing house or something?

496
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,950
Not a trial.

497
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,280
A judgment.

498
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,350
To bring judgment to you for your crimes of exploiting and harming people

499
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,210
by using the law for your own personal benefit.

500
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,840
I intend to judge you here today.

501
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,320
Sure. But how?

502
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,410
I finally...

503
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:10,460


504
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,320
have the sword handle of the law.

505
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,830
♫  You got me wrong  ♫

506
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,320
   

507
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,990
♫  Wrong  ♫

508
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,190
♫  Who is driving the wheel of fate?  ♫

509
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:38,990
♫  I cannot stop even though my entire body will break  ♫

510
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,140
♫  Wrong  ♫

511
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,570
♫  We will now break you down  ♫

512
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,250
♫  Wrong, wrong, wrong  ♫

513
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,230
 Since when was a murder just a mistake? 

514
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,790
 You want to see this to the end, huh? 

515
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,200
 Trial is long. 

516
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,290
 Let's go like the prosecutor that you are. 

517
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,460
 How great are those people that all these things we're doing are made possible? 

518
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,720
 That mutual help, let's use it now. 

519
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,200
 Run while you can because I'm not holding back anything right now. 

520
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,090
 Are you trying to kill me? 

521
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,590
 If you bear it, you'll live through it. 

522
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,270
 Who's got their back that they can pull this crap? 

523
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,630
 I found out where Lee Tae Gwang's video is. 

524
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,130
 There's no way you have such a thing in your state. 

525
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,860
 What goes around comes around, a**hole. 

526
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,260
♫  Can't be stopped now  ♫

527
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,600
♫  You got me wrong  ♫
