1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,820
   

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,100
   

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,450
   

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,130
   

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,060
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,070
   

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,040
   
 The person who kidnapped my dad and me... 

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,430
 is the one who killed your grandmother. 

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,520
 Jang Sun Oh. 

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 The only way for you to get out of here was through Do Won Bong. 

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,810
 Without Do Won Bong's permission, 
    

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,560
 no one can leave the prison. 
   

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,160
 In other words, the killing of my grandmother by Jang Seon Oh was also 

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,940
 ordered by Do Won Bong. 

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,680
 Right now, it's not Jang Seon Oh we have to check out. It's Do Won Bong. 

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,490
 He'll try to avoid getting mixed up with you, Yo Han. 

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,800
 Then I'll have to make him follow.
   

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,400
 Throw them the meat... 
    

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,340
 Did you send this? 

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,990
 Where is everyone? 

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,910
 And take away the bones. 

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,890
 The prison's warden has been replaced because of corruption 

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,510
 so under these circumstances, even Chairman Do 

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,060
 won't be able to send people out to do his bidding for some time. 

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,580
 He has to send someone outside besides Jang Seon Oh... 

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,640
 Help me. 

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,140
 In front of, Chairman Do who is in that predicament,... 

28
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,200
 if I plead with him with my arms stretched out, asking him to save me, 

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,110
 Chairman Do... 

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,820
 won't be able to bear not reaching out and grabbing my hand. 

31
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,560
 Go and kill a person. 

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,960
 Woo Sang Ki. The father of the kid you've been searching for. 

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,900
 Please spare me. 

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,350
 We need to secure Woo Sang Ki. 

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,800
 Find me a corpse that can't be identified 

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,030
 and Attorney Koo Bon Chul as well. 

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,070
 - The day you escaped from the kidnappers... 
 - June 9th. 

38
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,770
 That day, Chairman Do intended to kill you and me both, Attorney Koo. 

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,730
 How about we combine our efforts? 

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,760
 Abduct Woo Sang Ki... 

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,000
 get to The Skin Nation's finance director this time 

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
 and buy up convertible bonds. 

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,540
 Yo Han takes the shares from the equity holders by playing Hold'em. 

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,270
 Gather all that in the Dosan Holdings 

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,460
 and take The Skin Nation entirely, huh? 

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,160
 What's after that? The casino? 

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,050
 The game that makes real money is not the casino, 

48
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,440
 but what happens in the casino hotel's upstairs suites. 

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,670
 It happens in the VIP suites where only the ones with invitations are allowed in. 

50
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,850
 The real power behind the Goldman Casino 

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,300
 is the slush fund, the laundered money from the casino. 

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,610
 The one who manages the slush fund becomes the casino's manager. 

53
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,360
 Anyway, if you can control the slush fund 

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,650
 you can acquire the casino as well. 

55
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,000
 There are people building slush funds through a casino. 

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,410
 Chairman Yang guards the casino. 

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,650
 Since Woo Sang Ki's disappearance up until now, 

58
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,100
 Goldman Casino has been unable to launder 260 billion won. 

59
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,030
 The ones protecting Chairman Yang are Hong Sang Wook and Yoon Byung Wook. 

60
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,310
 We put you in your positions to take care of problems like that. 

61
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,260
 Macau is starting to ask who is responsible for this. 

62
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,820
 Director Jin Soo Min manages the account containing the slush funds. 

63
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,410
 All right, now then, this is my place. 

64
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,060
 While I distract Chairman Yang, 

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,370
 please go and get Director Jin Soo Min. 

66
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,270
 You are one of them, right? Who is it?! 

67
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,880
 When I use words, they always think it's just a warning. 

68
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,740
 Then Oh Soo Yeon will hack Jin Soo Min's phone to get into the account. 

69
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,660
 There are two registered irises. 

70
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,270
 Director Jin. 

71
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,960
 We worked our asses off to get us this far. 

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,310
 Put it on your fingertips and... 

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,010
 And Yang Hwa. 

74
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,250
 I'll transfer this money to an account for that kid you killed. 

75
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,410
 As for Jang Seon Oh... 

76
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,010
 you're going to fool him, Mr. Nam. 

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,800
 Jang Seon Oh, Kim Yo Han, and Oh Soo Yeon... 

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,620
 I also notified the police and put a bounty on them. 

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,180
 - Twenty million won per head, Sir. 
 - Raise it to 100 million won each. 

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,070
 Where is Director Jin? 

81
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,060
 We need to get Jang Seon Oh. 

82
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,660
 Do you need me to really show you what I mean? 

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,640
 Come if you want to live, Jang Seon Oh! 

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,240
 The funds are secured. 

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
   

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,910
 And you take that money back into your hands. 

87
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,880
 YH Holdings, Malay Investments and miscellaneous corporations. 

88
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,230
 I paid the entire balance under those names. 

89
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,110
 With your head, you can't handle them! 

90
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,520
 More than anything, I will... 

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,190
 I'll never let you get to that positionâ€” 

92
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,700
 You're fired from the Sinseon-dong. 

93
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,600
 It's about time we get Jang Seon Oh's confession. 

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,290
 - What? 
 - That you killed my grandma. Chairman Do told you to do it. 

95
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,120
 And what about this video clip? What can you prove with this? 

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,310
 Stop it, you a**hole. 

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,760
 Do you know who killed Kwon Dae Il? 

98
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,440
 And that Lee Tae Gwang's USB you were desperately searching for in prison. 

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,110
 Do you know what's in it? 

100
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,090
 Cut the bulls***. 

101
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,070
 Which hospital is Jang Seon Oh at? 

102
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,160
 Jang Seon Oh was someone I desperately needed. 

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,480
 Yo Han, you're now the Sinseon-dong's Go-to man. 

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,530
 What that means is that... 

105
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,310
 you're forever an inmate. 

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,820
 Forget all your personal feelings or hopes for revenge. 

107
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,230
 In the Sinseon-dong, there are no penalty points or solitary confinement. 

108
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,910
 F***! 

109
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,440
 Kim Yo Han, you've garnered more than half of the yes votes. 

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,300
 I install you as the new manager for our Goldman Casino. 

111
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,630
 Why do you seek to work for us? 

112
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,890
 I want to hold the sword handle of the law. 

113
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,060
 I'll hold the sword handle of the law 

114
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,920
 and the f***ers who made my life this way... 

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,500
 Yoon Byung Wook, Yang Hwa, Yang Jun, 

116
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,870
 Hong Sang Wook, Hong Jae Sun, 

117
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,290
 Mok Jin Hyung... 

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,100
 I will slaughter all these f*ckers. 

119
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,740
   

120
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,500
On what basis is the Ministry of Justice

121
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,910
rejecting the current promotion list?

122
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,510
They're barking at the dust that came out.

123
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,800
For you, the election intervention from last time.

124
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,600
For you, the ordered investigation of BH during the last regime.

125
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,020
You...

126
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,280
Well... for that one last time, yes.

127
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,640
Loan allegations with that hospital.

128
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,040
As for you, for overlooking the Financial Committee audit.

129
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,480
Pyeongtaek, Yeoju, Eastern Busan, and Cheonan.

130
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,740
Who's the f***ing snitch?

131
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,190
This is all insider information.

132
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,240
Kim Jung Gyu, the 24th class of Judicial Institute.

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,290
What an a**hole.

134
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,790
Byung Wook, we don't have time now.

135
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,000
We'll now have to lobby Prosecutor General Cha Jeong Su,

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Executive Director Jo Nam Il,

137
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,860
and Undersecretary In Tae Geun

138
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,810
more to resolve this matter smoothly in the end.

139
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,180
When is Annie handing over the pay?

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm seeing her today to talk about this.

141
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,750
Hey, Byung Wook.

142
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,300
Curb your temper a bit, okay?

143
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,250
I reserved a table inside.

144
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,830
Come this way.

145
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,870
The one at the bar is Advisor Han Ik Sang.

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,980
You know him, right? Former Supreme Court justice.

147
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,410
And that one on the leather sofa,

148
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,560
he's Advisor Park Hyun Chul.

149
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,480
He was a member of the Financial Holding Board

150
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,830
who now advises on project financing matters.

151
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,730
That one over there is a former legal reporter,

152
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,730
Advisor Lee Sang Kyu.

153
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,390
Advisor. Hi.

154
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,210
This way for us.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,810
Why the long face?

156
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,140
Should I get you a pretty girl?

157
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,700
ID and password.

158
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,310
You don't want to bow your head...

159
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,980
- but you want the new town infâ€” 
 - ID... and password.

160
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,460
I'm sorry, but this time... there's nothing.

161
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,850
- What? 
 - The company that your wife's family runs

162
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,810
is Yeonguk Constructions, Inc, right?

163
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,140
When the Deep Pockets collude to bring new town and redevelopment projects to Yeonguk...

164
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,350
Yeonguk cares for its people through the subcontractors

165
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,700
that take the jobs, right?

166
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
   

167
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,690
 Leasing cars for the ones who need a car. 
    

168
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,870
 Giving priority housing subscriptions 

169
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,860
 to the ones who need a house. 
   

170
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,210
 Getting unemployed children 

171
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,170
 hired at the subcontracting companies. 
   

172
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,150
A full-care service even for their children.

173
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,570
   

174
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,650
 This is mine, right? 

175
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,570
 I heard you work in the middle to pay 

176
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,600
Chief Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook in the same way.

177
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,850
You crazy?

178
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,130
Recently at the casino,

179
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,900
no money was laundered, you know?

180
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,600
So the Deep Pockets said

181
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,970
they can't feed Seocho-dong this time.

182
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,230
That's why... you should take good care of Manager Kim Yo Han,

183
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,760
so that something like this doesn't happen again.

184
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,210
Wow...

185
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,560
Is this perhaps Kim Yo Han's doing?

186
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,890
Sorry?

187
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,730
This s*** you're pulling right now.

188
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,080
Was it instigated by Kim Yo Han?

189
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,030
This never happened when Chairman Yang was here.

190
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,730
Well. You didn't have a past with Chairman Yang.

191
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,550
I heard Kim Yo Han...

192
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,300
was imprisoned because he got caught investigating

193
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,850
you and Chief Prosecutor Hong.

194
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,130
Who says?

195
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,010
Kim Yo Han.

196
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,500
Do we not have Jang Sun Oh and Do Won Bong yet?

197
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,960
Leave those who fell out of the competition to us

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,160
and stabilize this place quickly if you want to survive, Manager.

199
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,500
That seat right there is where the top lineage of this country sits.

200
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,700
What that means is that

201
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,830
when you step down from that seat, you step down as a corpse

202
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,310
or even if you're alive,

203
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,250
you'll spend the rest of your life in prison.

204
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,070
I need to make another trip to Macau to run an errand again.

205
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,180
I hope everything will be stabilized by the time I come back...

206
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,150
Manager.

207
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,890
May I help you?

208
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,100
The Manager is here, right?

209
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,300
Hold on. Please show me your warrant first.

210
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,930
No such thing today, a**hole.

211
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,050
No!

212
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,570
Lock the door!

213
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,000
 Hey, it's crackdown. Rush to the front. 

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,490
What's the matter?

215
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,350
 Police and Prosecution. Both showed up. 

216
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,380
- You can't come in here! 
 - Stop!

217
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,130
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Stop pushing!

218
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,560
- Hey! 
 - Block them!

219
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,820
Prosecutor.

220
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,890
- Who do you think you are? 
 - Let me go!

221
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,720
I said let go!

222
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,000
You should've let me know in advance.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,570
The Deputy Chief Prosecutor wants to see you.

224
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,210
Wait, hey!

225
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,920
Hey, hey!

226
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,810
Let's talk outside.

227
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,830
Enough!

228
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,980
No. You two should stay.

229
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,360
Let's not reveal ourselves.

230
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,420
I'll be back.

231
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,190
What will you do without a phone?

232
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,840
Give me your phone.

233
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,790
I think I left it upstairs.

234
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,510
I'll go get it right now.

235
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,790
Stop.

236
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,140
Let's just go.

237
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,650
Contact Mok Jin Hyung.

238
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm bringing Kim Yo Han in.

239
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,300
No. He didn't act up or anything.

240
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,600
   

241
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,250
Where is this place?

242
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,570
Where, you ask?

243
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,580
It's the CID at the Supreme Prosecutors Office of the Republic of Korea.

244
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,270
Did you never regret it?

245
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,640
I mean, I extended my helping hand to you

246
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,000
when you entered prison.

247
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,940
 You know me, right? 

248
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,650
 If you... confess everything, 

249
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,520
 I won't let you get locked up and 

250
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,110
 put you back in the Judicial Research and Training Institute. 

251
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,710
 What did you say? 

252
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,370
What do you want?

253
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,990
This punk...

254
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,410
You grew up after coming back from school, right? 
  (T/N: School - Slang for prison) 

255
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,400
You tell me the real reason why you're willing to go this far.

256
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,940
Revenge?

257
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,640
Revenge against

258
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,920
Chief Mok, who put your life in that state?

259
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,240
Or...

260
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,280
your grandma's killer?

261
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,040
Chief Mok said that it could be a murder.

262
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,330
So did you find the killer?

263
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,120
Who is it?

264
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,520
It's Jang Seon Oh...

265
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,720
He was an inmate at Seongju Prison

266
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,310
when I was locked up there.

267
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,800
He was one of the hitmen who Chairman Do,

268
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,930
another inmate, sent outside the prison to run errands.

269
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,210
Why did that person...

270
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,510
kill your grandma when he should've

271
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,960
hurt you if he were to hurt someone?

272
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,140
Yes.

273
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,760
I also...

274
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,500
I also...didn't get that at all,

275
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,670
so I captured Do Won Bong and Jang Seon Oh to ask them about this after my release.

276
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,580
Originally... someone had ordered them to kill me.

277
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,830
Aigoo.

278
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,810
Who is it that was ordering them then?

279
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,360
Who is it who ordered that Chairman Do Won Bong kill you?

280
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,910
Did you find out?

281
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,010
You did.

282
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,750
Who is it?

283
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,250
Who could it be?

284
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,530
It was Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung.

285
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,150
I'm going to give her to Captain Park.

286
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,690
Ganghwado?

287
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,060
 Laundering money for a slush fund using a casino. 

288
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,960
 There's a manager who guards and runs this business 

289
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,870
 and CID prosecutors who protect them from the law, huh? 

290
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,950
 Then Yang Joon, Yang Hwa, and Do Won Bong fought over this manager position, 

291
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,400
 only to have Kim Yo Han take over? 

292
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,940
Why?

293
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,870
Why would Kim Yo Han do that?

294
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,400
How? When?

295
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
Ever since he was sent into Seongju Prison?

296
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,190
No. If he knew anything back then,

297
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,540
he wouldn't have let his grandma die like that.

298
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,390
That time? When he was saying I killed his grandma and s***?

299
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,820
 I'm sorry... 

300
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,410
 I was also afraid... 

301
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,710
If that was all a lie?

302
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,980
If he collected evidence using Oh Soo Yeon and Do Won Bong...

303
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,470
and found out that Yoon Byung Wook tried to kill him...

304
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,910
He accumulated enough power for a total war

305
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,430
to take over as the manager.

306
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,610
 - Please save me... 
 - You punk... 

307
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,550
 I understand. 

308
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,420
If all that is true...

309
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,550
Whoa, our Yo Han!

310
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,320
What a feat!

311
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,570
You fooled Yoon Byung Wook

312
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,990
and fooled me, too.

313
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,200
If you succeed in getting Yoon Byung Wook,

314
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,870
you'll kill me, too.

315
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
   

316
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,400
   

317
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,870
Yes, CEO Oh.

318
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,060
Jae Sun took Yo Han?

319
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,730
Mok Jin Hyung?

320
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,400
Even after I got out, Chief Prosecutor Mok...

321
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,880
still wants my head.

322
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,560
To survive...

323
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,820
and to avenge my grandma and then myself...

324
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,340
That's why I bulked up a bit. I'll admit that.

325
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,290
But for an ex-convict

326
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,810
to get to the Seocho-dong chief prosecutor,

327
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,770
he needs to be at least the Goldman manager, no?

328
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,380
You're doing this

329
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,880
because of The Skin Nation, right?

330
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,150
I apologize about that one.

331
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,650
It was an inevitable decision for survival...

332
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,390
to sell it off to other people.

333
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,610
Okay.

334
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,960
How are you going to replace it?

335
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,030
"It was an inevitable decision for survival."

336
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,020
Aigoo, my guy.

337
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,750
That kind of sob story

338
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,000
is all your problem.

339
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,610
You owe me The Skin Nation.

340
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,070
As long as you sit as the Goldman Casino Manager,

341
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,670
you inherit all of Do Won Bong's debt.

342
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,830
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

343
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,130
Sh*t.

344
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,560
   

345
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,020
Sh*t.

346
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,910
Seocho-dong it is, huh?

347
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,070
You know where my hyung is?

348
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,650
The Seocho-dong probably has him.

349
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,670
It means they're already working with Kim Yo Han.

350
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,900
How the heck do you know that?

351
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,530
Aigoo, Chairman.

352
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,680
How are you not aware of this still?

353
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
If your hyung is captured,

354
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,700
then it means you're next.

355
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,390
Well, a boat to Macau...

356
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,250
Please get me a one-way ticket.

357
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,710
I can't fly there at this point.

358
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,570
I just want to spend the rest of my life

359
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,950
in a place where I have fond memories of.

360
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,490
If you can do that for me,

361
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,770
I'll help you see your hyung.

362
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,780
You've lost everything. How would you be able to do that?

363
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,290
Having survived in this game for 60 years with this head...

364
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,820
I'll use this head for you.

365
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,740
One ticket...

366
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,470
Just one ticket, please...

367
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:16,630
What if... I made you a Deep Pocket, Chief Prosecutor?

368
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,860
I'll make a distinct Labuan account for you.

369
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,750
And half of the commission that I receive for each money laundering case...

370
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,090
I'll deposit that in an offshore borrowed-name bank account of yours.

371
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,970
Chief Prosecutor... It would mean 2.5 percent of the amount of money that is laundered at the casino

372
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,100
becomes yours.

373
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,950
How much?

374
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,660
It's more than enough to make a Seocho-dong

375
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,030
deputy chief prosecutor into a three-time Assemblyman of Yeouido.

376
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,770
Eight to two.

377
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm telling you this for the first time.

378
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,700
I'm going to Yeouido and

379
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,650
go straight, over the river. 
  (T/N: Meaning all the way to the Blue House) 

380
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,400
I'll support you.

381
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,170
   

382
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,630
   

383
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,780
How can I help you?

384
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,640
You need to come in using the registered pass.

385
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,330
Oh, you see...

386
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,250
I left it on my desk.

387
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,400
What is your division?

388
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,740
Isn't this the renowned Supreme Prosecutors Office?

389
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,460
If a chief prosecutor shows up,

390
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,760
they should know I have my reason for coming here and lead the way.

391
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,880
What is he doing, interrogating me like that?

392
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,250
How inflexible.

393
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,350
That part is off-limits even within the Supreme Prosecutors Office.

394
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,450
So, what do you need me to find?

395
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,510
Let me see what that off-limits CCTV is showing right now.

396
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,620
I told you that area is off-limits.

397
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,410
Of course, there is no surveillance.

398
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,620
One second.

399
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,610
Hello. This is Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung of the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

400
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,310
Is Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun there?

401
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,710
Not there?

402
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,110
Do you know where he is?

403
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,570
Oh, okay. Okay.

404
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,670
Let me see if there is an interrogation room

405
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,590
that is occupied by the name Hong Jae Sun.

406
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,180
Hong Jae Sun?

407
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,840
Oh, there is one. Hong Jae Sun.

408
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,900
We've never met, right?

409
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,800
I heard you're going down to Daejeon.

410
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,130
I must say, the Goldman Casino Manager

411
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,510
is a powerful position, huh? They didn't even announce it yet.

412
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,740
I also heard the latest news about the casino.

413
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,270
That you resigned from the manager position?

414
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,860
Who updates you on Seocho-dong news?

415
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,440
Hong Sang Wook?

416
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
Yoon Byung Wook?

417
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,010
Jae Sun?

418
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,110
But where did they all go now?

419
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,630
I guess they cut ties since you stepped down.

420
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,430
That makes sense...

421
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,840
since Jo Hae Do is alive and well.

422
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,960
Yet they have you locked up here like this.

423
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,940
What did you say just now?

424
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,970
Why?

425
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:05,390
Are you hoping for a chance to be released as not guilty since Jo Hae Do is alive?

426
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,590
I think that'd be difficult.

427
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,720
What do you want from me?

428
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,570
Well, what is it that you want?

429
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,150
You took over an organization from the bottom

430
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,410
and made your brother a CEO of a company.

431
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,030
Why didn't you stop there?

432
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,360
What is it that you tried to gain from laundering money for the meanest

433
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,070
and strongest bastards in this country?

434
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,880
My mother was devoured by my father's drunken stupor.

435
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,340
My father was devoured by a typhoon at sea.

436
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,830
When I was wandering around with my younger brother,

437
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:08,760
we used to just eat and sleep at something like a gym.

438
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,840
I thought, "My parents must've felt this way before they died."

439
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Wow, the world

440
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,400
fell on my head like a tsunami wave.

441
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,340
"If I don't devour the world first, it will devour me."

442
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,470
 Hong came out to the parking lot with someone. 

443
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,900
You get only one call since we're short on time.

444
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,870
How much are you charging me for this one?

445
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,580
I won't rip you off.

446
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,770
Don't worry about it.

447
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,830
Instead,

448
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,770
we know each other now.

449
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,840
Yoon Byung Wook is not the only one at Seocho-dong.

450
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,100
 I'll be in your care. 

451
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,160
Aigoo.

452
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,090
- Let's do our best. 
 - Thank you.

453
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,920
Make sure to listen to my orders.

454
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,480
Yes.

455
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,130
Thank you.

456
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm getting together with our colleagues next weekend.

457
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,470
You want to come?

458
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,090
Is being an ex-convict a flaw?

459
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,730
Half of the assemblymen are ex-convicts.

460
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,320
Let's go together.

461
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,690
Hey.

462
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,520
Is there anything for me?

463
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,600
If you go in now, it's a sentence for life.

464
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
You're at the Supreme Prosecutors Office, right, Hyung?

465
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,240
 Chairman Yang. 

466
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,470
If you get caught, then our future is a bust.

467
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,460
 We need to have you. 

468
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,500
We can get back The Skin Nation if we have you.

469
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,520
Hyung!

470
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,130
That was gone long ago!

471
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,200
Right now, the one who makes the first move will lose.

472
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,910
So don't make a move until I give you the sign.

473
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,860
October 10th, the year of the fowl...

474
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,550
On the day of the Year of the Fowl Revolt, the sun was slowly setting.

475
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,470
Even the mighty Prince Sooyang was hesitant to actually start the coup d'Ã©tat.

476
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,980
Do you know what Han Myeong Hoi told him at that moment?

477
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,860
Even if you built a house for three years by the road, you couldn't finish it.

478
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,060
If you miss the timing to make a decision,

479
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,820
you can get dragged around by the other person's bet

480
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,140
and lose all your money even when you have an AA in your hands.

481
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,590
Before I kick that mouth of yours, what is it you're trying to say?

482
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,700
In Hold'em or in history...

483
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,300
the one who goes all-in first during a crisis wins the battle.

484
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,650
Even if The Skin Nation is finished,

485
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,690
the casino is as good as alive, right?

486
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,620
Anyone with skills can take the manager position, no?

487
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,540
You've been pushed back momentarily, so if you strike back properly,

488
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,260
I'm saying you can take it back.

489
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,820
Even though I failed, if I just help you

490
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,030
a little bit by your side...

491
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,400
Don't give up that opportunity.

492
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,610
So what?

493
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,930
Gather your army first.

494
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,000
Then...

495
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,320
I'll tell Woo Sang Ki to prepare Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook's account.

496
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,330
Yes. Please have it done before Mr. Jo or Chief Mok arrives.

497
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,780
Yes.

498
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,500
Now, we can casually meet up with Yoon Byung Wook, right?

499
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,070
Have dinner...

500
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,490
and maybe even drink together?

501
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
What is it that you want to say?

502
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,350
What else? We have to kill him.

503
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,630
What is it?

504
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,910
I think...

505
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,100
the priority right now is to stabilize the casino.

506
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,250
I need to free this shackle before Yoon Byung Wookâ€”

507
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,420
Did you get scared after visiting the CID?

508
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,530
Yoon Byung Wook is not someone we can just

509
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,130
draw out at once easily, CEO.

510
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,690
That's why you're doing it with me.

511
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,340
Is it not?

512
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,840
 That's why you're doing it with me. 

513
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,350
 Is it not? 

514
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,830
 CEO. 

515
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,140
I plan to...

516
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,380
punish Yoon Byung Wook by law as well.

517
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,420
How?

518
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,270
I'll become Yoon Byung Wook's new Yang Hwa and Yang Joon.

519
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,200
I'll give if he says to give and kill if he says to kill.

520
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,100
Then I'll amass all of those crimes and expose them to the world.

521
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,680
Insider...

522
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,390
You'll become an insider...

523
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,650
and expose everything, huh?

524
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,220
Yes.

525
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,530
   

526
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,000
   

527
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,630
Yo Han...

528
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,600
Why are you acting like a sucker?

529
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,390
I'm not trying to use the law because it's fair.

530
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,310
We need to use the law to reduce the casualties as much as possible.

531
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,630
Even if you die...

532
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,220
I'll go my own way.

533
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,000
Please...

534
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,520
Please take it easy, Oh Soo Yeon.

535
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,000
You.

536
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,430
You knew everything from the beginning, didn't you?

537
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,210
 Does it all show up? 

538
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,910
 What about the camera? 

539
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,880
 Is that all? 

540
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,300
 The judicial trainee who went into Seongju Prison. 

541
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,780
 Why? 

542
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,140
 He got caught while digging into Chief Yoon. 

543
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,000
 I think he's from the side that supports the Corruption Investigation Agency. 

544
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,450
 For what would you have dug up that mountain... 

545
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,710
 Chairman Yang? 

546
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,950
You also knew that I went to prison to stalk the CID Chief.

547
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,050
 Chairman Yang, The Skin Nation. 

548
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,210
 Why did you keep checking Chairman Yang? 

549
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,580
Only the Director of Judicial Research and Training Institute, me,

550
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,730
and Chief Mok Jin Hyung knew about that at the time.

551
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,470
You extracted that info out of Chairman Yang's phone.

552
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,330
Isn't that too much of a leap?

553
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,800
 Have you heard about a place called the Sinseon-dong... 

554
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,630
 Yes, Oh Soo Yeon. 

555
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,940
 Do Won Bong. 

556
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,770
Was that really the first time you got to see him in a while?

557
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,830
Or did an actor and an actress toy with me?

558
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,410
Stop framing me with baseless claims.

559
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,440
 Just how much does CEO Oh know? 

560
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,570
 Actually, she came to see Chairman Do before 

561
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,840
 meeting you for the first time. 

562
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,370
 Do you also have that conversation, Attorney Koo? 

563
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,880
 Why do you have an interest in that kid? 

564
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,220
 He's a former judicial trainee. 

565
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,860
 He's young and also has short sentence. 

566
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,310
 It's hard to find an ex-convict like him. 

567
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,570
 He'll have a hard time adjusting after getting out of prison. 

568
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,540
 So I plan to take him in and raise him. 

569
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,620
 Chairman Do, for sure since that time, 

570
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,940
 showed an interest in you, Manager. 

571
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,250
You're alive, thanks to me.

572
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,390
When Chairman Do started to have an interest in me,

573
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,900
my grandmother died.

574
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,570
 I'll deal with him. 

575
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,900
 So you take him off your mind. 

576
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,860
 How do you plan to lure him, Chairman? 

577
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,140
 You... 

578
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,350
 knew that Do Won Bong would go after my grandma. 

579
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,910
 But you still left... 

580
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,930
 Thank you. 

581
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,390
 my grandmother all by herself. 

582
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,920
So what?

583
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,390
You get back at me, too, then.

584
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,820
Kill me!

585
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,770
Or you want to use the law on me as well?

586
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,630
Trust me, just once.

587
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,810
So that there isn't another Kim Yo Han and

588
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,650
there isn't another Oh Soo Yeon.

589
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,950
Also so that I can believe in the existence of justice in this world.

590
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,390
So that I can punish those predators in my own way.

591
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,390
Just once... Just once...

592
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,000
please trust me.

593
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,950
Hey, this is the Manager's room. Right?

594
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,350
Yes, why? 
    

595
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,740
   

596
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,390
Never mind.

597
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,180
   

598
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,810
 Trust me just once. 

599
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,860
 So that there isn't another Kim Yo Han and there isn't another Oh Soo Yeon. 

600
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,770
 During this crackdown, the police stormed 31 illegal prostitution businesses for search and seizure. 

601
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,700
 - It's a rare arrest that does not involve organized gangs. 
 - Hey, move! 

602
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,690
 The police said that after their search and seizure crackdown, 

603
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:35,650
 they stressed that they received reports of human trafficking and the sexual trafficking of minors. 

604
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,670
 Help me... 

605
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,130
 Please don't do that... 

606
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,310
 Please don't hit me... 

607
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,000
 Please let me out. 

608
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,400
 Please let me out. 

609
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,150
 It's all my fault. 

610
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,180
 Please save me. Please. 

611
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,410
 Please save... 

612
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,260
 I can say that she's not addicted to drugs, but 

613
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,150
 because of the hormonal injections and the PTSD, 

614
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,880
 they can cause a mental illness. 

615
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,870
 She shows symptoms of so-called bipolar disorder. 

616
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:23,460
 Does the patient have a family member to watch over her? 

617
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,400
 I contacted all of her family and relatives, 

618
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,410
 but they all told me to stay away. 

619
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,460
 Saying, "A daughter just like her mom." 

620
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
 "We don't know such people." 

621
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,620
 I understand, but 

622
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,980
 Bipolar disorder is hard to treat without a guardian. 

623
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,120
 Even if you die, I'll go my own way. 

624
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,280
The Supreme Prosecutors Office is the same old stuff, just like everywhere else.

625
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,170
But still, the view is different than the Central District Prosecutors Office.

626
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,060
Different?

627
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,630
It's still Seocho-dong from here and it's still Seocho-dong from there.

628
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,460
We look out the window at the same thing all our lives.

629
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,280
That's why we become stale.

630
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,810
That's why we rot fast.

631
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,250
Am I really getting transferred in the end?

632
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,390
You failed to give me your answer sheet in time.

633
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,460
 I'm going to punish Yoon Byung Wook using the law as well. 

634
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,560
 You'll expose everything as an insider? 

635
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,300
Right?

636
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,970
It's not Daejeon.

637
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,980
It's Yeosu, actually.

638
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeosu, where they say you recover the decade of health you lost in Seoul.

639
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,390
Isn't it great?

640
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,830
It's fine as long as it's not Daejeon, right?

641
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,410
I have a favor to ask.

642
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,940
Go on.

643
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,630
For the upcoming personnel transfer...

644
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,230
could you please send

645
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,880
Chief Mok out far, far away?

646
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,960
What's the reason?

647
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,900
I need to clear up the population in my playground at the moment,

648
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,270
but a chief prosecutor is a little...

649
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,230
A little bit overwhelming for me, too.

650
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,230
Any objections?

651
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,520
   

652
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,990
 The person you are calling is not available... 

653
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,360
You piece of sh*t!

654
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,970
Why did you hit a person?!

655
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,210
You think you can just hit me, huh?!

656
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,850
You think you can just do that?!

657
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,120
Sunbaenim, how have you been?

658
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,590
Long time no see, Jin Hyung.

659
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,010
Do you want to transfer to Corruption Investigations? 
    

660
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,520
You know I've been supportive ever since the establishment talks.

661
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,690
Do I not count as an original member?

662
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:49,500
After Young Gook hyung died like that, you became the CID's dog, no?

663
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,800
Who the f*** said that?

664
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,490
I heard you even knelt at the Chinese restaurant.

665
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,950
Well, there's no reason I should self-destruct in front of all the CID people.

666
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,060
We need to achieve judicial reform, right?

667
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,170
Not because you don't want to go down to Yeosu?

668
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,650
Then what about you, Sunbaenim?

669
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,840
How did the hottest Commissioner Candidate of Corruption Investigations in Seocho-dong

670
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,100
make time to meet me today?

671
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,720
You came out because you needed me as well, didn't you?

672
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,240
That's a former Sajik-dong member for you.

673
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,670
As for me,

674
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,950
I live the same way then and now.

675
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,280
I heard that you were counter-attacked while trying to get at Hong Sang Wook.

676
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,040
That was when I wasn't capable enough.

677
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:39,230
We do have some time after the hearing and until the official launch.

678
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,570
But it's not an exaggeration to say

679
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,170
that the first case decides the course of our futures.

680
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,070
 This regime that launched Corruptions Investigations is almost coming to an end 

681
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,210
 and the Seocho-dong still doesn't seem to acknowledge us. 

682
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:08,200
 The next election results could largely decide our position. 

683
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,680
 The Corruption Investigation Agency must make a good start 

684
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,740
 in order to survive. 

685
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,950
   

686
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:52,550
Next up is blowing up the Sinseon-dong.

687
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,400
With what?

688
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,530
For now, if we let the press know about the luxury prison treatments,

689
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,290
I think we can earn enough time, so they can't hurt us.

690
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,940
After that, we'll expose the bribing of wardens and the Department of Justice

691
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,580
and look into their collusion with the CID.

692
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,920
There'll be something for sure.

693
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,660
Chief Prosecutor.

694
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,190
I want you to lead this case.

695
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,500
- Me? 
 - This is...

696
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,920
a little gift to you for trusting and following me.

697
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,820
But will that be enough to blow them out?

698
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,450
If we're to fight on their scale,

699
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,540
don't we need something more decisive as well?

700
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,340
   

701
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,350
   

702
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,390
   

703
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,740
 The person you are calling is not available... 

704
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,760
You're Chief Mok's allies, right?

705
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,240
Chairman Yang got the Manager.

706
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,530
 Why did the prosecutors come? 

707
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,700
 I'll go down and see. 

708
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,170
 We'll join you as well. 
    

709
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,990
 No. You two should stay. 

710
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,770
 Let's not reveal ourselves. 

711
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,170
 I'll be back. 

712
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,650
Chief, wait!

713
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,000
You're from the Northern Prosecutors' Office?

714
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,510
Are you Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung?

715
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,870
I apologize for this sudden visit.

716
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,820
It says that it's a search and seizure according to

717
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,240
Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes.

718
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,020
What does this mean?

719
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,250
What this means is that...

720
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,960
Isn't the Sinseon-dong here?

721
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,650
It's a search and seizure on the Sinseon-dong today.

722
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,450
Sinseon-dong?

723
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,420
I don't know what you mean by that.

724
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,000
But luxurious jail time?

725
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,750
Even if they're VIPs, they're all the same inmates here.

726
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,360
"No luxury jail time?"

727
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,170
Search it.

728
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,960
 So you're saying... 

729
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,780
these guys are the most powerful inmates here, right?

730
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,480
Yes.

731
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,450
   

732
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,820
   

733
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,280
 I've been played. 

734
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,100
 These guys are not the Sinseon-dong. 

735
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,780
   

736
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,610
Yes, Chief.

737
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,060
 Yo Han. 

738
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:00,370
The Sinseong-dong have vanished.

739
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,930
 The Sinseon-dong is safe. 
    

740
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,500
Kim Yo Han will go and strike the Sinseon-dong.

741
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,130
Why are you letting me in on this?

742
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,190
Why would Kim Yo Han do that?

743
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,700
Weren't you Kim Yo Han's chick, by the way?

744
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,600
Kim Yo Han has served his purpose.

745
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm discarding him.

746
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,260
And then?

747
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:23,170
The Go-to man for the Sinseon-dong, I plan to assume that position now.

748
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,590
Can I not?

749
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,270
   

750
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,910
   

751
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,230
Now, we can casually meet up with Yoon Byung Wook, right?

752
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:09,110
Have dinner and maybe even drink together?

753
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,170
What is it that you want to say?

754
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,350
What else? We have to kill him.

755
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,020
CEO.

756
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,450
I plan to... punish Yoon Byung Wook by law as well.

757
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,310
You'll become an insider and expose everything, huh?

758
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,760
Please take it easy, Oh Soo Yeon.

759
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,600
You knew everything from the beginning, didn't you?

760
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,810
In my own way...

761
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,520
So that I can punish those predators in my own way. Just once...

762
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,430
Just once...

763
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,340
please trust me.

764
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,010
What are you doing right noâ€”

765
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,410
   

766
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:38,720
This casino is wired except for this VIP room.

767
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,030
By Chief Prosecutor Mok?

768
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,650
 When we were getting the casino... 

769
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:53,760
The money we couldn't launder for the past year has been 300 billion won.

770
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,630
 he installed bugs all over the casino. 

771
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,210
 You just need to grab the handle. 

772
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,880
You just need to grab the sword handle of the law.

773
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:21,190
We're stabbing Yoon Byung Wook down from even higher.

774
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,830
The owners of the Goldman slush fund.

775
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,260
The Deep Pockets.

776
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,260
If the slush fund is in danger, the Deep Pockets will cut ties

777
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,370
with Yoon Byung Wook in order to survive.

778
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:36,490
They'll either kill him or he'll wish that he was dead.

779
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,020
Then we ask the Deep Pockets to hand over Yoon Byung Wook

780
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,570
in return for keeping their identities secret.

781
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:47,830
Then we send Yoon Byung Wook to court and make him confess

782
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,160
all of his crimes with his own lips,

783
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,570
out of his own volition.

784
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,740
The slush fund.

785
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:01,440
My grandma, and...

786
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:04,390
you, Oh Soo Yeon.

787
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,350
Also, the Junghoon Foundation that promised your revenge.

788
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,550
Everything he did to the people of Junghoon Foundation as well.

789
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,790
I'll expose every single thing.

790
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,830
Yoon Byung Wook...

791
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,620
Will he submit to the Deep Pockets?

792
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,430
Doesn't he also have a family?

793
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,960
Then you'll die, too.

794
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,240
We're not alone.

795
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:41,970
 Timing and subtitles offered by The Payback Team @Viki.com 

796
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,130
Work with us.

797
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,820
You got the casino to get Byung Wook, right?

798
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,880
You take Yoon Byung Wook and we'll take the CID.

799
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:02,900
How much will your chances for success increase if a government agency is on your side?

800
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,900
You figured it out, right?

801
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,960
â™«  You got me wrong  â™«

802
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,520
   

803
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,830
â™«  Wrong  â™«

804
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,160
â™«  Who is driving the wheel of fate?  â™«

805
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:31,030
â™«  I cannot stop even though my entire body will breaks  â™«

806
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,380
â™«  Wrong  â™«

807
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,660
â™«  We will now break you down  â™«

808
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,780
â™«  Wrong, wrong, wrong  â™«

809
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,570
 I vote for trying it out. 

810
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:47,820
 Since Chief Mok never got a proper chance to shine yet. 

811
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,690
 Did you plan this to hang a target on my back? 

812
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,720
 I don't know if you're in the position to say that. 

813
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,490
 Is there someone besides you that I don't know about? 

814
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,940
 Kill Kim Yo Han for sure, okay? 

815
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,770
 Do you remember Lee Yeon Soo? 

816
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,940
 It's her work. 

817
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,270
 If I break, you're next. 

818
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,800
 You only live once. 

819
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,270
 So fly up as high as you can. 

820
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,710
 I'll gather people who have enough motivation. 

821
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,780
