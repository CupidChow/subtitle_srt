1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,930
   

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,170
   

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,220
   

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,790
   

5
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,210
   

6
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,110
This casino is wired except for this VIP room.

7
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,280
 When we were getting the casino 

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,250
 he installed bugs all over the casino. 

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,760
 That's why you're doing it with me. 

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,850
 By Chief Prosecutor Mok? 

11
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,230
 You just need to grab the handle. 

12
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,700
You just need to grab the sword handle of the law.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,440
We're stabbing Yoon Byung Wook

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,580
down from even higher.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,170
Then we send Yoon Byung Wook to court

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,810
and make him confess

17
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,420
all of his crimes with his own lips

18
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,270
out of his own volition.

19
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,430
Yoon Byung Wook...

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,920
Will he submit to the Deep Pockets?

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,790
Doesn't he also have a family?

22
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,080
Then you'll die, too.

23
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,350
We're not alone.

24
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,730
   

25
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,280
   

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,730
   

27
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,180
   

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,950
We're almost there. It's over here.

29
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,190
Wait a minute.

30
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,720
Inspector, which division do you really belong to?

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,570
You're registered as an inspector

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,890
and you have a desk in your office, too.

33
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,180
But you're always working offsite.

34
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,950
I mean, where you go or what you do...

35
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,110
you never report to anyone.

36
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,040
My supervisor is inside.

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,060
Why don't you ask him yourself?

38
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,250
Salute.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,950
It's been heating up for a while now.

40
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,380
What took you so long?

41
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,460
We can't eat this if it boils much longer.

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,580
Congratulations on becoming the Goldman manager.

43
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,480
There may not be much there even if we go all the way.

44
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,940
As for the Corruption Investigation Agency,

45
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,000
couldn't you just stay put, as it should be?

46
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,390
Don't be like that.

47
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,650
Let's work together.

48
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,070
You got the casino to get Byung Wook, right?

49
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,710
You take Yoon Byung Wook,

50
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,860
and we'll take the CID.

51
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,460
You know well since you've been through hell by yourself,

52
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,560
but how much will your chances for success rise

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,140
if a government agency is on your side?

54
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,090
You figured it out, right?

55
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,080
Do you want to learn sign language?

56
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,910
Let's learn sign language

57
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,970
and learn how to write poems with betting amounts.

58
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,810
 Now, we can casually meet up with Yoon Byung Wook, right? 

59
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,860
 Have dinner... 

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,470
 and maybe even drink together? 

61
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,310
 What is it that you want to say? 

62
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,640
 What else? We have to kill him. 

63
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,460
 CEO, I plan to... punish Yoon Byung Wook by law as well. 

64
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,670
 How? 

65
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,560
 I'll become Yoon Byung Wook's new Yang Hwa and Yang Joon. 

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,370
 I'll give if he says to give and kill if he says to kill. 

67
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,600
 Then I'll amass all of those crimes 

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,330
- to expose them to the world. 
  - Now, we're enemies, right? 

69
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,960
 - Yes, that's right.  
 - Why are you being a sucker?

70
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,840
 I'm not trying to use the law because it's fair. 

71
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
 We need to use the law 

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,350
 to reduce the casualties as much as possible. 

73
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,400
 Even if you die, I'll go my own way. 

74
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,650
 Gather everyone centered around the casino 

75
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,630
and the head...

76
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,200
Catch Yoon Byung Wook first,

77
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,140
then I plan to catch the rest of them.

78
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,050
Each person has their own way of calculating

79
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,100
and we all think differently.

80
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,830
They're all just greedy without any backbone.

81
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,140
I'll split them into two groups and have them fight over the casino.

82
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,200
Split them into two groups?

83
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,350
Yes.

84
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,500
 So we fool Chief Mok by turning on our recording? 

85
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,460
 I'm trying to work on him, so he's easy to deal with. 

86
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,570
 I plan to have him leave his post as a prosecutor. 

87
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,150
I have a favor to ask.

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,900
For the upcoming personnel transfer

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,250
could you please send

90
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,140
Chief Mok far, far away?

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,600
I plan to... punish Chief Mok as well.

92
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,270
We do have some time after the hearing

93
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,040
and until the official launch.

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,440
But it's not an exaggeration to say

95
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,690
that the first case decides the course of our futures.

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,130
The Corruption Investigation Agency must make a good start

97
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,620
in order to survive.

98
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,000
Next up is...

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,270
blowing out the Sinseon-dong.

100
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,630
As for this case,

101
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,500
I want you to lead, Chief Prosecutor.

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Chief, wait!

103
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,870
Search it.

104
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,570
 I've been played. 

105
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes, Chief.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,430
Yo Han. The Sinseong-dong... vanished.

107
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,500
Kim Yo Han will go and strike the Sinseon-dong.

108
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,770
Why are you letting me in on this?

109
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,070
The Go-to man for the Sinseon-dong...

110
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,530
I plan to assume that position now.

111
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,660
Can I not?

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,700
You haven't heard... from Attorney Koo yet?

113
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,310
You won't get to see Attorney Koo Bon Chul again.

114
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,200
Kim Yo Han... has set his mind to strike all of you.

115
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,870
You can assume that the Seocho-dong have also fallen into Kim Yo Han's hands.

116
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,320
Kim Yo Han decided to turn over

117
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,220
the casino manager's profit to the Seocho-dong.

118
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,360
That crazy...

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,490
So why is he taking it that far?

120
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,560
He put his life on the line for his revenge.

121
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,280
Right now, I'm the only person who can protect you

122
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
from Kim Yo Han.

123
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,190
Why would we trust you?

124
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,780
I also...

125
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,480
put my life on the line for revenge.

126
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,490
How do you plan to get Kim Yo Han?

127
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,200
That Kim Yo Han, he's a tiger now.

128
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,820
He's not the cub you used to know.

129
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,360
So...

130
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,540
how do you plan to capture that tiger?

131
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,700
With the mindset of...

132
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,670
collaboration and cooperation?

133
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,290
   

134
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,410
Someone definitely told them in advance that we were coming in to strike them.

135
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,970
I'm sure the Sinseon-dong's eyes and ears are at Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

136
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,250
Right.

137
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sure there are.

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,930
That's why I asked for a warrant for Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes.

139
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,710
So that they'd never know my target was the Sinseon-dong.

140
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,870
Was it you?

141
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,640
Excuse me?

142
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,120
Hanging a target on my back, did you plan that?

143
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,290
Would I create trouble, so all of us could go down together?

144
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,070
Besides...

145
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,820
I was the one wearing the shackles.

146
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,810
In any case, we should watch out for wiretaps more than people.

147
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,800
Being wiretapped in the Sinseon-dong was part of every day there.

148
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
So, CEO Oh,

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,990
- you're conducting security checks throughout the casino? 
 - Yes.

150
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,810
To see if there are any hidden bugs and see if the internet network and phone lines are safe.

151
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,910
I'll let you know when I have a specific schedule.

152
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,100
Okay.

153
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,420
And we don't know what the Sinseon-dong will do.

154
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,440
For now, I'll tell Mr. Jo to strengthen overall casino and personal security.

155
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,550
Too much work has piled up while the owner of this room was switched out.

156
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,520
So the Deep Pockets don't worry,

157
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,330
let's normalize the money laundering first

158
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,300
and take care of the rest of the tasks one thing at a time.

159
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,970
How is...

160
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,460
Attorney Koo?

161
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,490
We can tie up the hands and feet of the Sinseon-dong with this hostage.

162
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,770
You must keep him alive.

163
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,530
He's being taken care of.

164
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,450
You should've used the shot from the get-go.

165
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,270
Why did you hurt his face...

166
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,620
I'll ask you one more time.

167
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,530
Koo Bon Chul?

168
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,200
What are the inmate numbers of the Sinseon-dong people you served?

169
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,810
What?

170
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,450
We don't have much time. Shoot him up.

171
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,420
You'll soon have arrhythmia in your heart.

172
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,120
Arrhythmia means your heart will get a cramp.

173
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,980
When you get a cramp in your leg, you can massage it out with your hands.

174
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,270
But when there's cramping in your heart...

175
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,740
So...

176
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,070
you don't have to tell us all the Sinseon-dong elders' numbers.

177
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,510
Just one person.

178
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,850
If you just tell us one person's number, we'll take care of the rest.

179
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,240
Okay?

180
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,910
You...

181
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,410
How many people...

182
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,680
did you kill...

183
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,810
with that face of yours?

184
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,890
I just...

185
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,880
did my best to live my life.

186
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,930
I totally stepped on it...

187
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,430
Until he starts talking, divvy up the dosage by increments and raise it

188
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,650
and if you still can't get through to him,

189
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
change the drug.

190
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,940
And we'll have to retrieve all the wiretaps in the casino.

191
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,550
Oh Soo Yeon...

192
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,300
is going to run a security check on the entire casino.

193
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,110
Thank you for the money, Hyungnim!
   

194
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,240
Congratulations, Hyungnim!

195
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,910
- Lose some weight. 
 - Yes, Sir!

196
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,810
I'll pledge my life to you, Hyungnim!

197
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,260
Thank you, Hyungnim!

198
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,990
Thank you, Hyungnim!

199
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,610
All right. Good work, everyone.

200
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,310
Bukyeongpa gang belongs to whom now?

201
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,600
 Jo Hae Do! 

202
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,280
Jo Hae Do is who?

203
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,610
 Bukyeongpa gang! 

204
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,830
- Who am I? 
 - Jo Hae Do!

205
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,150
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

206
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,610
   

207
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,930
   

208
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,260
   

209
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,270
It's Chairman Suh.
    

210
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah.

211
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,470
Kim Woo Jae...
   

212
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,730
The 36th class.

213
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,740
Chairman Suh had embezzled housing payments of 350 billion won in the past.

214
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,270
He was chasing Chairman Suh for that

215
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,510
and now he's after him for real estate fraud he committed with that money.

216
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm guessing he's got a tight hold on him.

217
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
From what I heard from the customers,

218
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,390
the mighty Chairman Suh who withstood

219
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,120
Yang Joon, Yang Hwa, and Chairman Do

220
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,460
is losing sleep because of this, one person, Kim Woo Jae.

221
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,690
Chairman Suh... is connected to Hong Sang Wook as well.

222
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,620
Yoon Byung Wook is his immediate supervisor.
   

223
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,150
I'm sure Hong Sang Wook and Yoon Byung Wook would've given him a call.

224
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,930
His nickname is Kim Tarro. 
  (T/N: Tarro means separate, set apart, isolated in Korean) 

225
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,110
Kim Tarro?

226
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,130
He's got his own answer set apart from others.

227
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,940
Is he the one?

228
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,390
I'll know when I meet him.

229
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,280
Would you like to go with me?

230
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,580
I have other plans.

231
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,150
Thank you.

232
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,580
No need to thank me.

233
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,130
If things don't work out,

234
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,640
I'll go on my way anyhow.

235
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,600
   

236
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,830
   

237
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,550
   

238
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,820
When did the largest shareholder for The Skin Nation change to Chairman Suh?

239
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,850
They say YH Holdings and Malay Investment transferred the title to them,

240
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,210
but they're actually the same company.

241
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,010
YH Holdings?

242
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,150
We found YH Holdings' general director in Labuan, Malaysia.

243
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,000
His name is Woo Sang Ki.

244
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,930
   

245
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,110
Hello, I'm Kim Woo Jae from the Western District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 4.

246
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,770
 I'm YH Holdings' General Director Woo Sang Ki. 

247
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,590
I heard you were looking for me regarding The Skin Nation's share transfer.

248
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,500
- Yes, that's right. 
  - But... 

249
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,200
for more details, you should speak to our true company owner

250
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,290
who dealt personally with Chairman Suh.

251
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,020
By chance, if you're uneasy about being summoned as a material witness,

252
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,070
you don't have to worry about that at all.

253
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,400
We're not trying to summon you, Sang Ki.

254
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,910
 Seven o'clock direction. 

255
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,390
What?

256
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,950
 The actual owner of tens of the miscellaneous corporations in operation 

257
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,280
at the time The Skin Nation went public is that man over there.

258
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,570
 Goldman Casino Manager. 

259
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,450
 Mr. Kim Yo Han. 

260
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,580
I'm Kim Woo Jae from the Western District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 4.

261
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,030
I'm Kim Yo Han.

262
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,260
A casino.

263
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,930
People from there usually try to avoid me.

264
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,580
Did Chairman Suh send you?

265
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,140
Well...

266
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,720
Did you decide to sit with me when you had your doubts?

267
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,120
I just can't get my finger on that Chairman Suh.

268
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,310
I know why the owner of Dongdaemun doesn't change even with the regime change.

269
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,050
In this world,

270
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,100
there are so many dirty and powerful scumbags.

271
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,910
Right?

272
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,530
I don't know if you're qualified to say such a thing, Prosecutor.

273
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,660
What?

274
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,640
You graduated from Hwijeong, right?

275
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,730
You grew up in the eighth school district. 
  (T/N: the wealthiest area in Seoul) 

276
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,410
Your parents' occupations are both in stocks and real estate.

277
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,040
Just like Chairman Suh.

278
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,000
Why bring up qualifications when you're doing the right thing?

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,290
You're supposed to just do stuff like that.

280
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,710
 Because he's just that type of person. 

281
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,580
 I was crossing the street. 

282
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,460
 A granny picking up waste paper 

283
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,440
 spilled all the paper she was pulling in her cart. 

284
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,980
 Everyone was just going on their way because they're all busy. 

285
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,840
 But at times, 

286
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,730
 there are some people who don't pass by 

287
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,940
 and help that granny. 

288
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,540
 So I be sure to go over and ask them. 

289
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,530
 "Why did you help her?" 

290
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,890
 They can't answer me. 

291
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,160
 Because they didn't have a particular reason. 

292
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,620
 That person... 

293
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,180
 is just that type of person. 

294
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,430
 Your father... 

295
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,250
 was also that type of man. 

296
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,110
Let's end our introduction here.

297
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,220
You threw The Skin Nation in front of me on purpose, right?

298
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,120
What do you want?

299
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,990
I'm reporting on behalf of the public.

300
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,660
Well, thugs, prosecutors, sponsors. Those kinds of things.

301
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,240
Geez, that stupid sponsor prosecutor stuff. I'm sick and tired of it. 
  (T/N: Sponsor prosecutor - Corrupt prosecutors getting paid off by criminals) 

302
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,780
Chief Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook of CID who is preparing his promotion,

303
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,230
and Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook of Central District Prosecutors' Office.

304
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,850
They're using inmates in Seongju Prison

305
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,960
and are protecting a casino that launders 400 billion won a year.

306
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Well...

307
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,130
something like that.

308
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,650
Don't you want to put a magnifying glass to it?

309
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,030
How about Attorney Koo?

310
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,820
He could've cross the Sanzu River. 
  (T/N: The river between life and death in Buddhism) 

311
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,320
Attorney Koo didn't have it easy, either.

312
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,940
Do you know why the Sinseon-dong came into existence?

313
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,470
At one point,

314
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,040
we were also managers.

315
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,090
Casinos... Military defense... Construction and development...

316
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,600
Even further away abroad as well.

317
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,200
We're errand boys who were used up and abandoned.

318
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,250
Knives with broken blades.

319
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,460
Because we were weak, we gave up our freedom

320
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,130
as collateral in order to survive.

321
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,850
Another bunch of Kim Yo Hans.

322
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,250
But... the provision of nature...

323
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,030
is so interesting.

324
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,670
When you sit around a garbage landfill for a long time,

325
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,270
the world comes to you.

326
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,460
In the end,

327
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,370
everyone all comes trickling in here.

328
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,670
We were merely errand boys.

329
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,630
But we've become similar to our owners

330
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,730
who locked us up here.

331
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,360
Then those owners are...

332
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,620
Macau and the Sinseon-dong...

333
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,110
and the people who own one-third of the Goldman shares,

334
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,890
the Deep Pockets outside of the Sinseon-dong?

335
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,220
Then why... are you locked up in here?

336
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,010
It's not that we can't leave here.

337
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,000
We choose not to leave.

338
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,920
I don't know what the difference is now.

339
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,920
Did you look for Attorney Koo's replacement?

340
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,000
 There is one candidate who's not too bad. 

341
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,470
How about your comrades of collaboration and cooperation?

342
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,510
 Chairman, let's meet. 

343
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,650
I'm gathering people who have enough motivation.

344
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,580
Make sure you kill... Kim Yo Han.

345
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,470
Yes, I got it.

346
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,660
I met with the elders in the Sinseon-dong.

347
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,160
Sinseon-dong?

348
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,420
Sinseon-dong said Kim Yo Han is fired.

349
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,040
And they told me the Sinseon-dong's new go-to woman is...

350
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,240
is me now.

351
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,010
 Did she part ways with Kim Yo Han? 

352
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,540
Is Attorney Koo alive?

353
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,410
 Is that why Oh Soo Yeon hid the Sinseon-dong? 

354
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,970
Yes.

355
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,480
As of now.

356
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
When that position opens up,

357
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,310
I'd like to recommend you, Chief.

358
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,780
Me?

359
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,120
An errand boy is a lowly slave.

360
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,480
But you can say Attorney Koo's position is...

361
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,970
kind of like a servant who receives annual pay.

362
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,410
I vote for trying it out.

363
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,210
Why me?

364
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,680
Because Mok Jin Hyung is capable of more.

365
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,520
Since Chief Mok never got

366
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,580
a proper chance to shine yet,

367
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,060
you could become even bigger than who you are now.

368
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,390
You only live once.

369
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,140
Forget justice and sh*t. Living it up more than those

370
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,070
arrogant CID bastards isn't so bad, isn't it?

371
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,100
Am I wrong?

372
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,090
 The Ministry of Justice announced the middle managers for the Prosecutors' Offices today. 

373
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,130
 Chief Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook of CID 

374
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,140
 will be the Prosecutor General of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. 

375
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,960
 Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook, Central District Prosecutors' Office, Financial and Tax Crimes Investigations Unit 2
   

376
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,060
 will be promoted to CID Investigation Planning Officer. 

377
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,500
  Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung of Seoul Northern District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 2
   

378
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,540
 will be transferred to Yeosu as the branch chief in the province of Gwangju. 

379
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,290
 This personnel announcement is to change the atmosphere in the Prosecutors' Offices 

380
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,570
 and to establish stable reformation inside the prosecution, 

381
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,680
 according to Ministry of Justice spokesperson Kim Gun Woo. 

382
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,880
   

383
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,840
   

384
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,920
 Take my hand and work with me. 

385
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,880
 First, I'll take Oh Soo Yeon's hand 

386
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,060
   

387
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,520
 and take charge of the Sinseon-dong. 

388
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,980
 Work with the Sinseon-dong, 

389
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,000
 go beyond CID and fly away. 

390
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I'll become the Sinseon-dong's representative 

391
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,690
 and capture Hong Sang Wook, Yoon Byung Wook, the CID lineup. 

392
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,430
 And all the way to the Corruption Investigation Agency that I badly wanted. 

393
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,100
 You only live once. 

394
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,760
 Go as high as you can... 

395
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,930
 and fly high. 

396
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,900
I won't leave my prosecutor position.

397
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,290
One prosecutor can kill ten lawyers.

398
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,970
One chief prosecutor can destroy three or four law firms.

399
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,500
One prosecutor general...

400
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,100
can hunt down an agency in this country.

401
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,210
For something like that, even if you're not a prosecutor,

402
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,790
you can do all that with a little bit of our help.

403
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,810
Only in darkness.

404
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,320
A prosecutor in Korea could kill someone in broad daylight in front of all the people.

405
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
And as if nothing had happened,

406
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,890
we can feign ignorance.

407
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,500
Isn't that right?

408
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,170
What's the big deal...

409
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,580
about that position?

410
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,490
 - Gather your tools! 
 - Yes, Sir! 

411
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,480
 - Hurry up! 
 - Yes! 

412
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,110
 Hurry up! Take it! 

413
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,770
   

414
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,960
Now is not the time to attack Oh Soo Yeon.

415
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,440
You should grab the hand Oh Soo Yeon is holding out.

416
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,260
You blabbering old fool. What do you know?

417
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,280
And if I hold her hand?

418
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,080
Oh Soo Yeon will once again

419
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,540
stab me in the back.

420
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,500
But you should still hold her hand.

421
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,370
Now is about fighting to see whose hand will become whose.

422
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,560
The casino and Seocho-dong, from the get-go,

423
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,830
it was a game to hit it big with two cards.

424
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,220
Kim Yo Han and Yoon Byung Wook. They're Air Lines.  
  (T/N: Two aces) 

425
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,400
The most powerful two people in the game are on the same team.

426
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,360
But you don't win the game

427
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,090
only with the hand you hold.

428
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,200
Team up with Oh Soo Yeon, you're saying?

429
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,770
Yes. You can team up

430
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,290
with Oh Soo Yeon, and you won't be Air Lines, but still...

431
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,490
you can definitely make the Middle Pocket. 
  (T/N: J, 10, 9 combo) 

432
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,790
Depending on what's getting laid on the ground,

433
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,530
if you can drive this into a mud fight,

434
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,260
you're more than capable of beating Kim Yo Han and Yoon Byung Wook.

435
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,260
Even if he's released from here, he won't be the same as before.

436
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,880
   

437
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,850
Okay now.

438
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,920
Send him to Captain Park.

439
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,230
This way, please.

440
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,110
I knew you'd be healthy.

441
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,340
Yes...

442
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:28,870
From a basement of the red light district to that position with the Sinseon-dong.

443
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,170
Congratulations.

444
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,290
Chief, greetings to you first time in a while.

445
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,250
You'll only go up from here.

446
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,170
Congratulations to you as well.

447
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,060
How can I...trust you?

448
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,340
Now, we're looking at the same direction.

449
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,020
And now...

450
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,730
I'll stand in front of you, Chairman.

451
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,770
So, don't you worry.

452
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,890
Soo Yeon,

453
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,710
you think I can't hurt you, huh?

454
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,740
Hey.

455
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,560
Hey, f***er.

456
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,620
Clean up your act.

457
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,440
I heard you barely survived the personnel transfer this time.

458
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,780
So...

459
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,490
would you be okay to get into a scandal with me at a place like this?

460
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,570
Look at the look in that motherf***er's eyes.

461
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,420
He hasn't gotten enough of a beating yet.

462
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,800
So, did Attorney Koo Bon Chul...die?

463
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,310
Would you like to meet him?

464
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,250
Ah, no.

465
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,040
It should've been my job.

466
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,800
Thank you.

467
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,890
Chief Mok will continue what Attorney Koo used to do

468
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,270
and as the Sinseon-dong's representative,

469
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,760
he will work with us in the future.

470
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,790
He's a prosecutor, not a lawyer.

471
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,110
I believe he'll be more powerful than

472
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,080
Attorney Koo in the past.

473
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,550
And...

474
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,910
you'll stand ahead of all of us?

475
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,920
As the go-to woman who serves the Sinseon-dong elders,

476
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,300
I'll lead all of you,

477
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,620
to strike Kim Yo Han's neck,

478
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,630
and plan to become the next Goldman Casino's manager.

479
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,480
But why you?

480
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,530
Kim Yo Han still has no idea I turned my back on him.

481
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,960
Really?

482
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,150
Then kill Kim Yo Han tonight.

483
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,240
Kim Yo Han is after Yoon Byung Wook right now.

484
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,910
Just like you did in the past, Chairman.

485
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,860
He'll do all the dirty work that Yoon Byung Wook orders

486
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,250
and he plans to expose everything as an insider.

487
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,310
But how he's going to get to him

488
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,850
and as for his weapon...

489
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,300
I still haven't found that out yet.

490
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,300
If all of you work hard on the front lines,

491
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,880
my role is to support all of you behind the scenes.

492
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,350
I spoke too long unnecessarily in the middle of eating.

493
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,580
I should be called an old geezer then.

494
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,790
- Please eat. 
  - Killing Kim Yo Han... 

495
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,840
 will happen when he completes working on the weapon to destroy Yoon Byung Wook. 

496
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,990
   

497
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,850
What's wrong?

498
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,880
Mok Jin Hyung at the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

499
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Who saved him?

500
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,490
I heard it was the Minister's office.

501
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,970
 We have to have that in our hands 

502
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,900
 so we won't get dragged down by the Seocho-dong later. 

503
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,710
 Thank you! 

504
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,840
Did you hear that the Minister's office revived Mok Jin Hyung?

505
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,260
I heard the Minister did that.

506
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,010
Whether Mok Jin Hyung kissed the minister or deputy minister's a**,

507
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,450
that's not the problem here.

508
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,520
S***, Kim Jung Gyu...

509
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,280
The first case for Corruption Investigation Agency...

510
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,900
He's aiming at us. The CID.

511
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,630
As for Goldman many people will pay attention to it.

512
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,240
So we don't have to worry too much about it, but...

513
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,950
But?

514
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,920
But you know that guy from a long time ago...

515
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,360
You know...

516
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,210
when Chairman Yang's overseas gambling was exposed last time,

517
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,580
the fall guy who went to Seongju Prison.

518
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,320
You know? He said he had a recording of Yang Joon gambling.

519
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,260
He said you were recorded there, too.

520
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,380
That guy who threw a fit asking us to get him out of Seongju Prison.

521
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,580
Lee Tae Gwang?

522
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,020
Right. Did you find it?

523
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,950
The video clip?

524
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,300
Sir, let's try to hold a cup.

525
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,100
Okay, use your fingers...

526
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,870
Good job. Let's try one more.

527
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:01,200
 After Lee Tae Gwang became an imbecile, the video clip disappeared, too, right? 

528
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,410
 You must get your hyungnim out first. 

529
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,550
You have to fight with momentum.

530
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,230
You'll notice a big difference whether you have your hyungnim with you or not.

531
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,840
Anyway, that a**hole Jo Hae Do

532
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,010
is buying off all the guys in the capital area with his cash.

533
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,970
Never mind Yoon Byung Wook.

534
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,080
We can't do without our guys to fight.

535
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,990
Let's stop for a restroom break.

536
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,790
   

537
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,340
Geez, that temper of yours.

538
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,250
You should've stayed put.

539
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,090
Why bother wasting your energy?

540
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,820
You're embarrassing the guys.

541
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,710
Is there someone besides you

542
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,790
that I don't know about?

543
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,550
Yang Hwa escaped while being transported.

544
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,850
As we expected.

545
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,100
Now that...

546
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,180
Yang Hwa is out, the next is...

547
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,350
to get Yoon Byung Wook involved with instigating murder.

548
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,830
 Yes, that's right. 

549
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,030
To be an insider and expose Yoon Byung Wook,

550
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,650
Yoon Byung Wook should order me to commit murder

551
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,580
 and I will... 

552
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,910
By chance...

553
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,680
do you remember someone named Lee Yeon Soo?

554
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,140
 Reveal to Yoon Byung Wook, 

555
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,600
that you're Lee Yeon Soo, not Oh Soo Yeon.

556
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,340
And that you're working with Yang Hwa, Yang Joon, Do Won Bong, and Mok Jin Hyung for your revenge.

557
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,530
That you'll stab me in the back to take away the casino,

558
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,380
kill the Deputy Prosecutor,

559
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,010
and plan to share the casino with those people who helped you.

560
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,120
That's what I'd tell him.

561
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,380
Then...

562
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,080
as he told the former casino managers,

563
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,490
Yoon Byung Wook will tell you to kill me.

564
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,500
And you'll record that, Yo Han?

565
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,340
Yes.

566
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,070
Mr. Nam will pretend to kill you.

567
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,300
While you've gone missing, I'll stand Yoon Byung Wook in court for murder

568
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,990
and hold Annie hostage to blackmail the Deep Pockets.

569
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,800
Ask them to abandon Yoon Byung Wook.

570
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,850
Tell them to make Yoon Byung Wook confess to all his crimes in court.

571
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,110
You know...

572
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,800
the Chelin case from 20 years ago.

573
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,120
A Korean-American businessman dropped information on American investment company

574
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,380
and ran off with investment funds he collected from hundreds of people.

575
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,720
That pyramid scheme case.

576
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,060
The lady who was suspected as an accomplice, got blamed for it,

577
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,160
but was found to have hung herself.

578
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,970
Oh An Na.

579
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,600
That Oh An Na's daughter is Lee Yeon Soo.

580
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,350
 Gosh, crazy! 

581
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,050
 Just by revealing that I'm Lee Yeon Soo, 

582
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,370
it is too weak for Yoon Byung Wook to instigate my murder.

583
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,220
Let's be serious.

584
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,970
So I can't do this alone.

585
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,110
You must also take action, CEO.

586
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:04,740
Send over the freed man, Chairman Yang, to Yoon Byung Wook and scare him a little?

587
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,300
Oh Soo Yeon...

588
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,020
wants to meet you in an hour.

589
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,410
   

590
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,160
Send her that old man.

591
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,970
That old man alone?

592
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,470
Yeah.

593
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,470
One prosecutor...

594
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,880
two thugs...

595
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,800
Tokarev...

596
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,600
Corruption Investigation Agency...

597
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,360
One Yoon Byung Wook...

598
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,560
and one Kim Yo Han.

599
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,930
Mok Jin Hyung, Yang Joon, Yang Hwa...

600
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,250
I thought you didn't trust Chairman Do.

601
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,450
But you know everything he said is right.

602
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,130
That we're not Air Line.

603
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,620
So...

604
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,420
we have to drag this out into a mud fight.

605
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,990
 The only person who could f*** up this s***ty situation 

606
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,550
 is him. 

607
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,110
How about the other two men?

608
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,170
They've entrusted me with everything.

609
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,150
Where is Chief Mok?

610
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,430
If we don't remove all the bugs tonight, we're all dead.

611
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,090
You can't miss even one.

612
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,820
Got it?

613
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,200
You're a busy man.

614
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:16,770
So why did you ask us to come?

615
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,370
I found out Kim Yo Han's plan.

616
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,840
And the daughter from back then...

617
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,800
Lee Yeon Soo changed her name.

618
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,800
To Oh Soo Yeon.

619
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,960
To take revenge on you.

620
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,220
Oh Soo Yeon?

621
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,180
Your Oh Soo Yeon?

622
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,080
Kim Yo Han will stand Yoon Byung Wook in court for instigating murder,

623
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,880
indict additional charges from when Manager Yang was here,

624
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,860
and relieve the injustice of his grandma's death by Jang Seon Oh.

625
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,160
Does he have proof?

626
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,850
The ledger that Jang Seon Oh kept with the record of payments from you and...

627
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,530
   

628
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,240
The portal, bank, cloud, SNS...

629
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,990
You want me to open up everything?

630
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,260
This is going to cost you.

631
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,000
The seventy million won you owe in prison.

632
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,620
If I cancel that, would that work?

633
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,710
 I hear he has Jin Soo Mi's ledger with a record of the payments 

634
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,250
 you received from Manager Yang way back when. 

635
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,340
In that ledger, if it records Yoon Byung Wook wanted us dead...

636
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,780
I'm sure it's me he wants dead.

637
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,410
If he instigates Kim Yo Han to kill me,

638
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,730
Kim Yo Han's weapon is set.

639
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,650
So I was thinking...

640
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,940
if you scare Yoon Byung Wook a little bit—

641
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,210
It's been a while...

642
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,100
Could I get a drink from you?

643
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,540
Those motherf***ers...

644
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:23,220
   

645
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,680
   

646
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,700
Why...

647
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,750
Why are you dragging your feet?

648
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,740
Oh Soo Yeon.

649
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,790
You prepared a lot.

650
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:59,300
You worked hard. But whether it's a ledger or a recording inciting murder...

651
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,830
You need a corpse and a criminal who confesses to the killing.

652
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,390
That's when the crime has occurred.

653
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,290
Pardon?

654
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,800
You need Yang Hwa in your plan.

655
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,370
You need Yang Hwa to stand in court

656
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,780
and confess that he killed people because Yoon Byung Wook told him to.

657
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,340
Then you can put away Yoon Byung Wook.

658
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,440
Using Kim Yo Han,

659
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,140
you want to try and catch Yoon Byung Wook?

660
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,620
Then Kim Yo Han really has to kill a person.

661
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,420
Do you think he could do that?

662
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:32,170
Hey! You're on the same team with Kim Yo Han, right?

663
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,700
I have no idea what you're talking about.

664
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,790
You got me once. You think I'd fall for it twice, you rotten b****!

665
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,240
I already told Chairman Yang everything.

666
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,790
Chairman Yang reported it to Annie.

667
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,680
   

668
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,640
Kim Yo Han asked to meet with Annie. And they sent the Yang brothers there.

669
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,220
Hand over your phone while I'm using my words.

670
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,580
I said give me your phone.

671
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,570
Your pretty little hands shouldn't hold something like that.

672
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,380
Give it to me.

673
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,940
Didn't you see Chairman Yang's leg?

674
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,750
If you don't listen to me,

675
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,520
I have no choice but to call him. 
    

676
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:48,140
If you shoot, this place will be the source location.

677
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,850
If you can't shoot,

678
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,130
Yoon Byung Wook will find out yours and Kim Yo Han's plan.

679
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,560
 Yo Han should kill this moron. 

680
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,800
If you put that down and let me leave,

681
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,900
considering my affection for you in the past, I'll give you a day to run away.

682
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,480
 I shouldn't kill this moron right now. 

683
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,770
It's all over.

684
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,710
Your plan is ruined.

685
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,230
You said you know someone in Japan, right?

686
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,840
Run away there and rely on them to hide you.

687
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,810
If you must

688
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,680
capture Yoon Byung Wook with your own hands,

689
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:32,700
you must survive for now.

690
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,580
I've been pushed out from the Sinseon-dong.

691
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,620
By Oh Soo Yeon.

692
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,420
And Oh Soo Yeon helped Yang Hwa escape while on transport.

693
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,780
It was her doing.

694
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,250
Thanks. I enjoyed the drink.

695
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,570
 - The call is not going through.  
 - S***.

696
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,130
Why are you here?

697
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,100
   

698
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,810
Two managers have already been taken in just this week.

699
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,890
How on earth do you handle the work?

700
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,010
You're my substitute?

701
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,670
I'm not a substitute.

702
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,390
I'm replacing you.

703
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,600
You're fired.

704
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,380
This was used to anesthetize animals.

705
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,650
You're supposed to use half the size of your pinky nail on a human.

706
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,980
I'm sorry.

707
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,560
And I'm extremely grateful...

708
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,150
for things I was grateful to you for.

709
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:50,820
Chief Mok Jin Hyung became the Sinseon-dong elders' new representative.

710
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,130
A current prosecutor?

711
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,820
I'm sorry, but if I lose the casino,

712
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,170
if I go down, you're next, Chief Prosecutor.

713
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,380
   

714
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,320
Send out the message.

715
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,510
Whoever kills Kim Yo Han

716
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,220
is the next manager of the casino.

717
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,020


718
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,640
♫  Wrong  ♫

719
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,540
♫  Who owns this world?  ♫

720
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,120
   

721
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,490
♫  Wrong  ♫

722
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,180
♫  Who is driving the wheel of fate?  ♫

723
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:28,010
♫  I cannot stop even though my entire body will breaks  ♫

724
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,400
♫  Wrong  ♫

725
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:35,650
♫  We will now break you down  ♫

726
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,850
♫  Wrong, wrong, wrong, hey  ♫

727
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,370
 What took you so long only to appear now? 

728
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,540
 I found out where Lee Tae Gwang's video clip is. 

729
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,700
 It will flip at the river. 

730
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,920
 You're going to go in there alone right now? 

731
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,000
 If you die, your plan dies with you. 

732
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,390
 Please choose what your heart desires. 

733
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,430
 At any time. 

734
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,750
 Get Kim Yo Han there... 

735
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,620
 Are you cutting me off right now? 

736
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,940
 Kill him if I give you the signal. 

737
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,410
 Kim Yo Han is finished. 

738
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,200
 I'll wrap this up, Yo Han. 

739
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,400
 I wonder if I should've been sponsored like you a long time ago. 

740
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,860
 So Byung Wook doesn't catch us, open up his call history, financial records, everything. 

741
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,140
 Is that all true? 

742
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:23,060
 Let's put Oh Soo Yeon on the list for the arrest warrant request. 

743
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,590
 Aren't you scared of me? 

744
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,600
 Should I be scared of you? 

745
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,010
♫  I cannot stop even though my entire body will breaks  ♫
