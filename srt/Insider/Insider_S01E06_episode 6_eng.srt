1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,840
   

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,130
   

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,510
   

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,900
   

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,100
   

6
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,690
 I was chasing the culprit who killed my grandmother. 

7
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,460
 I learned that Mok Jin Hyung... 

8
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,320
 Northern District Prosecutors' Office Division 2 Chief, 

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,620
 discovered my grandmother's body before the police did, 

10
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,760
 yet he covered it up. 

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,000
 So I needed the recorder to get his confession... 

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,310
 Based on his response, I was going to judge him on the spot. 

13
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,740
 That's why I hid the knife. 

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,590
Shall we play some cards together for the first time in a long time?

15
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,290
If you win, this place is yours.

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,180
If I win...

17
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,120
What? Scared?

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,470
I mean, you have nothing left to lose.

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
Fine...

20
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,110
I'm scared.

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,160
Instead of a massage  (one-on-one game) , let's play two-on-two. A four-round Hold'em.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,090
Let's say in a month.

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,730
In a month...

24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,110
I'm busy, right?

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm a chairman. A chairman.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,100
It might be tough for me if I play you alone,

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,630
but if it's two-on-two, you're dead.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm getting jealous.

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,800
It seems like you found yourself a boyfriend.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,490
Each starts with 100 million won, and you're done if you go all-in.

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,800
And the winner is the one left at the end.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,560
- Hey, Mr. Jang— 
 - Deal.

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, your hands.

34
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,340
I heard you were at the top of the Judicial Training Institute.

35
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,010
Why did you want to become a prosecutor instead of a judge?

36
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,230
I heard your father died as a prosecutor on the job.

37
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,180
He had an accident.

38
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,030
Are you sure?

39
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,090
I looked into it a bit.

40
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,090
Your father was involved in some illegal election funds or something like that.

41
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,390
He was looking into the higher-ups at the time.

42
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,370
And you still wanted to become a prosecutor?

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,330
A scam is...

44
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,740
How do you spot a scam?

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,490
Why this all of a sudden?

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,930
Listen, when a hand goes around,

47
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,840
a natural flow emerges.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,390
And in an instant...

49
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,470
 Oh, my gosh! 

50
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,140
 That flow is broken in an instant. 

51
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,470
 If despite my correct calculation, I could lose money. 

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,810
 Or if my calculation was off, and I still win the money. 

53
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,300
When a person gets into the scamming mode,

54
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,800
his body reacts first.

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,370
 You get goosebumps on your arms and neck. 

56
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,590
 Lips dry up. 

57
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,860
 And suddenly the eyes become extremely clear, 

58
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,650
 and it's crazy, you see everything so sharply. 

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,980
 But the important thing is 

60
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,460
it's too late by the time you realize this.

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,440
But what about it all of a sudden?

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,390
Right now...

63
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,850
do I look like I'm lying?

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,950
 That video was clearly created, so Kim Yo Han would see it. 

65
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,700
 In other words, the bastard who showed it to him 

66
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,200
 is the same bastard who made the video. 
   

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,550
   

68
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,070
   

69
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,390
   

70
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,670
   

71
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,810
That godd*** Sajik-dong.

72
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,050
They always say they'll get rid of it and it'll be gone.

73
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,680
It won't disappear.

74
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,780
That's why...you shouldn't have done so many bad things.
    

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,630
Why are you picking on me?

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,790
   

77
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,240
Look at these bastards... 
    

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,370
I'm the only one in the visitor's log.

79
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,780
How could that be?

80
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,620
The prison definitely manipulated it.

81
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,820
So instead of me, go bother them from now on.

82
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,950
Please!

83
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,630
I think I'll do that.

84
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,980
Wow, look at this...

85
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,780
I want to win this one.

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,350
   

87
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,440
In playing cards or in life,

88
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,950
the winner is the one who waits until he gets the nuts. 
  (T/N: nuts: The best possible hand for any arrangement of cards) 

89
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,470
In studies, being number one may be important,

90
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,640
but it's about getting to the finish line when it comes to revenge.

91
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,790
If you want to stand behind someone's back quietly, it takes time.

92
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,080
   

93
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,790
Hyung, if I save you this time,

94
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,310
you'll do me a favor, too, right?

95
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,020
 Like you, Hyung... 

96
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,080
 I want to kill the bastard who put me away here. 

97
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,270
 But I can't do it alone. 

98
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,010
 Hyung, I'll show you how to scam. 

99
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,560
 In return, team up with me and play a game. 

100
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,380
 Do you think the other players in the first league will sit back and watch? 

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,400
We still need to check him out in many ways.

102
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,530
No, the investigation is over.

103
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,430
I understand everything now.

104
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,880
Step aside.

105
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,890
Geez, you bastards...

106
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,780
What are you doing?

107
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,460
Can you stand by yourself?

108
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,060
- Security Manager.
 - What?

109
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,910
Please don't do anything.

110
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,420
What are you looking at?

111
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,380
How dare you...

112
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,600
Here in this place.

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Who's your boss?

114
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,200
I won't ask you to cough up the money you received from Nam Dae Moon,

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,260
but this bastard...

116
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,850
He'll be a convict if I say so,

117
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,310
and a first leaguer if I say he is. You guys...

118
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,340
no food, water, or bathroom trips until I release him.

119
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,840
- Understood? 
 - Yes...

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,370
- Lost your voices? 
 - Yes!

121
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,320
Wrap this up well.

122
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,270
Yes, Sir!

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
Clean this up, and you're dismissed.

124
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,030
Dean...

125
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
Dean...

126
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,770
How did I do?

127
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,970
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,190
Only if I had found that ledger...

129
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,640
Sh*t.

130
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,420
Don't be sorry.

131
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,270
You saw that, right?

132
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,500
Hyung, just trust and follow me.

133
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,900
When I heard you were coming, I fixed up a few things.

134
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,780
What's all that?

135
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,890
M-Mirror.

136
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,150
You realize we only have three weeks left, right?

137
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,290
Yes.

138
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,260
It's essential for you to master the art of scamming within three weeks.

139
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,900
That?

140
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,590
Broadly speaking, for a show, there is the shuffling of the cards,

141
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,200
cutting the deck,

142
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,630
and taking from the bottom.

143
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,270
Swapping.

144
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,720
As though I'm the one setting up the game, you shuffle the cards the way you want.

145
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,640
The highlight of shuffling is stacking.

146
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,510
Passing out the cards to the person I want.

147
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,210
That's the real swindle.

148
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,260
In order to do stacking, you need to master three basic moves.

149
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,310
 One, you need to know how to hold a card inside your palm. 

150
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,030
Another, you have to know how to shuffle the deck one card at a time.

151
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,160
One card.

152
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,970
One card.

153
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,540
 Next, you have to visually memorize the order of cards that come up at a glance. 

154
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,260
What's the answer?

155
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,160
Hyung, don't forget this.

156
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,660
Offense is the best defense.

157
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,900
I can't injure my hands, no?

158
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,640
You are right.

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,060
Guard! Guard!

160
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,320
Geez! You!

161
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,250
Come back here! We had our guard down!

162
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,790
Come back here! Come!

163
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,170
Let's have another lesson soon.

164
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,820
Muay Thai!

165
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,700
Totally awesome!

166
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,560
- Hot! 
 - It's hot.

167
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,510
Hot.

168
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,730
Sh*t.

169
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,900
Three of spades.

170
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,990
Ace of hearts.

171
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,490
King of diamonds.

172
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,140
Seven of spades.

173
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,450
Geez!

174
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,630
Geez, for someone who passed the bar exam, your concentration level is...

175
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,130
Is it because of the TV? Should I turn it off?

176
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,170
So how long did it take you to master this, Dean?

177
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,200
About two hours?

178
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,080
And Chairman Yang is better than you?

179
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,660
He's very lucky.

180
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,950
 I was taking money from the wallets of older players at these illegal storefronts in Gueseo-dong. 

181
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,060
 And they recruited me, so I was playing as the very first star player for the Skin-nation. 

182
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,680
Wow, I thought you'd be still playing Seotda in Korea. 
 (T/N: Seotda: type of game played with Hwatu)

183
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,220
I didn't know I'd get to play Hold'em here.

184
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,770
Don't say that elsewhere.

185
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,420
They'll call you LA country bumpkin.

186
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,380
It's hot.

187
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,540
 Did you play your trick? 

188
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,250
They say it'll go up to 38 degrees Celsius tonight.

189
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,750
 Yes. 

190
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,140
Check.

191
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,590
Ten million won.

192
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,850
- I'll die. 
 - I'm going to die of this heat.

193
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,220
- Call. 
 - It's an ominous night.

194
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,750
Call.

195
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,230
All right, all right.

196
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,890
- Twenty million won. 
 - Call.

197
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,610
Call.

198
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,470
Ten million won.

199
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,310
- Call. 
 - Raise you 50 million more.

200
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
Call.

201
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,370
Geez, whatever!

202
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,340
All in.

203
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,250
All in. Call.

204
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,410
Call.

205
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,610
I'm the best!

206
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,780
There.

207
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,550
 What the f*** is this situation? 

208
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,750
 That's how I declared my independence and challenged him. 

209
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,380
The one who loses here today can't play in Seoul for a year.

210
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,430
How about it?

211
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,000
You've been so excited since you came close to stabbing me in the back.

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,580
Raise.

213
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,360
 - Ten million won more. 
 - Nah... 

214
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,480
You said gambling is all about momentum.

215
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,300
- Raise 25 million. 
 - That's right. It's momentum.

216
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,860
Call.

217
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,670
You have a cosmetics company and much more.

218
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,040
Why don't you let me take over the gambling scene? Thirty-five million won.

219
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,400
Take that whiny trash talk to your mom.

220
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,610
Oh, you don't have a mom.

221
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,520
No, I don't.

222
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,040
What a crazy psycho.

223
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,980
Call.

224
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,830
Check.

225
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,020
Don't play around.

226
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,950
Check.

227
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,890
Five million won.

228
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,170
You raised 35 million earlier, right?

229
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,340
Me, too. Thirty-five million won.

230
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,570
All in.

231
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,660
What's that look in your eyes?

232
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,340
You can't be...

233
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,050
scared, are you?

234
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,420
Scared?

235
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,690
You must be scared.

236
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,410
You don't even have anything in your hand.

237
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,250
Why are you betting so hard?

238
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,740
Nah...

239
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,250
Must I have something to win?

240
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,860
Call.

241
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,170
How did you realize?

242
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,320
I noticed your pattern.

243
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,760
So why bite the hand that feeds you?

244
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,960
I'll go without the anesthesia.

245
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,850
Let me go!

246
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,850
I learned gambling from him.

247
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,980
So he knows all of my tricks,

248
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,020
but I don't know any of his tricks.

249
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,350
That's why he's lucky.

250
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,890
The fact that he was born before me.

251
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,540
I'm telling you this because you might be curious.

252
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,980
I reattached it.

253
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,560
Guard!

254
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,240
Eight of hearts.

255
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,530
Four of clovers.

256
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,730
Jack of hearts.

257
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,080
Jack of diamonds.

258
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,760
Nine of clover.

259
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,870
Whoa, you look pretty.

260
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,190
Thank you.

261
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,440
Not because you were coming here, right?

262
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,680
No, I have a blind date.

263
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,630
It's still springtime for you.

264
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,100
Do you drink wine?

265
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,630
There are over 30 Woo Min Ho's around his age in Seoul.

266
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,680
I haven't found him yet.

267
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,010
Is it because you're only an inspector?

268
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,220
Should I recruit a superintendent or a sergeant?

269
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,370
That's not the problem.

270
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,140
I'm checking them one by one by visiting them in person,

271
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,420
but he really can't be found.

272
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,830
When Inspector Kwon took a leave to pursue the investigation,

273
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,070
he went through the alleys behind the Northern Prosecutors' Office a lot.

274
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,580
I've already gone there.

275
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,080
 You are referring to the convenience shop, right? 
    

276
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,470
 Shin Dal Soo's case was not assigned to the Northern District Prosecutors' Office, 

277
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,240
 but he kept spending money at the convenience store there. 

278
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,620
 And if you look at the items he purchased, 
   

279
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,430
 they were porridge, lunchboxes, cup ramen, 

280
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,060
 underwear, and a toothbrush. 

281
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,630
 And Woo Min Ho. 

282
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,620
But Woo Min Ho...

283
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,320
 - That grandmother... 
 - Do you know she passed away? 

284
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,430
 Oh, my! 

285
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,210
 I didn't even say who the grandmother was. 

286
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,970
 But he reacted that way when I mentioned her. 

287
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,100
 He was deeply frightened. 

288
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,660
Why?

289
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,000
Because he was an eyewitness?

290
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,070
Perhaps Woo Min Ho saw the killing of Shin Dal Soo?

291
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,290
And Inspector Kwon found out.

292
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,610
Do you understand the reason for my impatience?

293
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,250
Dean.

294
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,410
I heard you woke up.

295
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,190
How disappointing.

296
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,050
Why?

297
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,320
By chance...

298
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,410
because of the two-on-two with Chairman Yang?

299
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,390
As expected of a corporate financial criminal.

300
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,110
Is he...

301
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,570
your successor?

302
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,970
Did you decide...

303
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,320
on Kim Yo Han as next-in-line?

304
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,170
Do you know why I call you Nam Dae Moon? 
  (T/N: Nam Dae Moon: A slang for a man's pants zipper fly) 

305
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,940
Because I wanted you to open and close

306
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,140
whenever I needed you to.

307
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,020
But something kept getting caught in the zipper.

308
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Geez.

309
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,730
I'll be done with you.

310
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,810
If you want even scraps,

311
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,790
just stay in bed.

312
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,420
I'm off!

313
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,730
Stacking isn't an easy skill to master.

314
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,190
He and I both, I'm sure we'll be stacking each other all night long.

315
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,440
 But he'll never guess that you'll be doing the stacking. 

316
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,830
 I just have to succeed once? 

317
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,960
 Yes, just once... 

318
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,660
 If we succeed just once, 

319
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,850
 we can beat them tonight. 

320
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,340
Are they a cheering squad?

321
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,400
My legal team. Looking good, right?

322
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,620
When I take over this place later,

323
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,840
documents need signatures and such.

324
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,950
How many people are here for a signature you'll never get?

325
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,960
Come on. You need at least six hunters to catch one wild hog.

326
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,450
Much less, we get to catch you tonight, Seon Oh.

327
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,150
We should have at least this many...

328
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,830
Oh, he's the one with the knife from the other night.

329
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,400
Boy, your face has healed nicely.

330
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,980
But I see a shadow of death on your face.

331
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,690
You don't look like you belong here tonight.

332
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,330
You'll get hurt.

333
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,440
Cut it out.

334
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,380
Those lawyers must charge a lot per hour.

335
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,330
Let the class begin.

336
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,060
Let's go ahead and start.

337
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,680
This is a four-round Hold'em.

338
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,540
Each starts with 100 million won in chips.

339
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,200
After an all-in, you are removed.

340
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,590
Blind is 20/50.

341
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,230
Betting is no limit.

342
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,390
The last man standing is the winner.

343
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,330
If I win, this place is mine.

344
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,100
If you win, I'll say sayonara.

345
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,200
But do you really want to do this?

346
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,920
Start.

347
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,060
Let's go then.

348
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,090
- Call. 
 -  You need to watch him from the start. 

349
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,960
Raise.

350
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,300
One million won.

351
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,910
Raise 3 million.

352
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,480
Call.

353
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,330
Hey, bring me some beer.

354
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,800
 Check if he's stacking. 

355
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,830
Betting 3 million.

356
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,900
Call.

357
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,860
 It looks like he's stacking. 

358
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,310
Betting 5 million.

359
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,450
Call.

360
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,020
 Full house. 

361
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,250
 I think Chairman Yang is stacking. 

362
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,970
 I'm going to fold. 

363
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,940
 No. Keep going. 

364
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,280
 We could lose it all in this hand. 

365
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,700
 We could lose 100 million in an instant. 

366
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,400
 Keep going! 

367
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,100
 Raise 10 million won! 

368
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,110
Betting 10 million.

369
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,580
Raise.

370
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,320
Twenty million more.

371
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,070
 It's a first round! 

372
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,250
 What if we get an all-in here? 

373
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,000
 Avoid the all-in, but make it look like you're a rookie. 

374
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,560
Call.

375
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,950
You must be disappointed.

376
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,630
 Nicely done. We've laid the groundwork. 

377
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,330
Look all you want. See if you can see anything.

378
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,270
Call.

379
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,510
Fold.

380
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,130
Raise.

381
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,280
Two million.

382
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,870
Raise 4 million.

383
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,460
Ten million won.

384
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,680
Twenty million won.

385
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,050
Call.

386
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,640
All right.

387
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,090
Flop.

388
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,860
Check.

389
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,170
 Bite! Bite! 

390
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,420
Twenty million won.

391
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,200
Call.

392
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,830
Turn.

393
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,820
Ta-da!

394
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,740
 Here's a 9 to make your hand a straight. 

395
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,190
It's an invitation.

396
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,830
 I gave you 7, 8, 9, 10 for a straight. What more is there to think about? 

397
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,840
 Bite the bait. 

398
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,870
Fine then. Why not have a memorial service for Lee Tae Gwang?

399
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,420
Check.

400
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,630
I told you it was an accident.

401
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,530
Fifty million won.

402
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,850
 The food for the memorial service table is getting cold. Hurry on up. 

403
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,270
Lee Tae Gwang used to do business in Macau.

404
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,750
But he couldn't eat cilantro.

405
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,770
Unlike his appearance, he had sensitive taste buds.

406
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,950
But a guy like that ate food that was laced with Clorox

407
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,670
and his IQ became a single digit.

408
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,380
No.

409
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,140
That means... someone had forcibly fed the Clorox into his mouth.

410
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,860
Is it stacking or bluffing?

411
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,500
If you lose, too, how will you guys survive the night?

412
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,240
 Why would I lose? 

413
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,110
 The river is a heart. 

414
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,980
 I have a flush. You have a straight. 

415
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,050
 Come on in already. Hurry. 

416
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,720
 My back is uncomfortable. 

417
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,620
 Spit out 50 million and get lost. 

418
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,080
Die.

419
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,410
 This guy's different. 

420
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,330
 Show your cards! 

421
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Your staff is watching. Let's maintain some manners in this game.

422
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,200
 Now, those two will have their eyes on me. 

423
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,960
 Get ready. 

424
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,690
   

425
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,230
Excuse me.

426
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,580
Aigoo, it's a lot.

427
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,140
Can I have some coffee?

428
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,750
Yes.

429
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,770
- Coffee? 
 - No, thank—

430
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,000
 When a person gets into the scamming mode, 

431
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,220
 his body reacts first. 

432
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,620
 Lips dry up. 

433
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,060
 You get goosebumps on your arms and neck. 

434
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,830
 And suddenly the eyes become extremely clear 

435
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,650
 and it's crazy, you see everything so sharply. 

436
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,500
 It's now! 

437
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,710
 Don't get distracted by others' gazes. 

438
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,670
 Just because they're looking doesn't mean they see it. 

439
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,720
 Stay calm and feel each card as you shuffle... 

440
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,840
 Just as we practiced. 

441
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,880
 We got him! 

442
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,500
Your hand movements are too rusty. It's too noisy.

443
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,360
I got you!

444
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,540
Don't move!

445
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,490
What are you doing?

446
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,400
I caught your scam.

447
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,650
Unbutton your sleeve!

448
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,640
I said unbutton your sleeve.

449
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,880
I thought my eyes were going to pop out all night.

450
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,890
That's why you brought out this amateur bastard. 
  (T/N: He literally says an "unripened animal") 

451
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,020
What are you going to do now?

452
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,000
Director Jin was caught cheating. Should I cut off a piece of her for you? Or...

453
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,590
take her eyes?

454
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,260
If you mess her up,

455
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,940
I'll call the real police.

456
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,170
Warden?

457
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,350
You recorded everything, right?

458
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,770
Yeah.

459
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,670
This is a prison.

460
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,860
There are CCTVs everywhere.

461
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,990
Director Jin getting caught while cheating has all been recorded.

462
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,640
I'll release the video to the entire country if you report us.

463
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,580
Then how many gambling houses, sites, dens...

464
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,200
do you think will accept you?

465
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,960
You motherf***er.

466
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,770
I'll release Director Jin

467
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,760
if you sign a note saying you will never come here again.

468
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,130
Hey, cheering squad!

469
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,160
What are you waiting for? Prepare for the signing.

470
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,060
Spray water in this area later in the morning

471
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,190
and sprinkle some salt. 
  (T/N: Superstitious act to drive out evil spirits) 

472
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,720
Yes, sir.

473
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,320
It took me a little over a year.

474
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,480
Stacking.

475
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,850
The best time to scam is when the opponent is scamming.

476
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,410
They are so busy with their own scams that they can't see anything else.

477
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,150
Especially that a**hole Yang Jun. Never.

478
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,310
That's why you used me as bait.

479
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,940
Yeah.

480
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,150
There was zero chance you might've gotten hurt, Hyung.

481
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,610
If you were going to stack, I knew Director Jin would put a scam on instead of him.

482
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,490
Because he knows that we'd be focused on him, too.

483
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,850
Now, if we get Director Jin, Yang Jun can't do anything.

484
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,850
Director Jin is Chairman Yang's gambling ledger.

485
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,400
A walking human ledger.

486
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,520
It was important to preserve this gambling den earlier,

487
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,200
but it was more important to make him think that you were more inferior to him.

488
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,580
So that you can help me with my vengeance

489
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,550
after you are released.

490
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,980
Are you pissed?

491
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,580
No.

492
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,290
Then, what are you thinking?

493
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,390
Going forward,

494
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,830
you have to keep doing it this way.

495
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,230
You have to do even better.

496
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,890
Pardon?

497
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,620
If you are going to bluff, make sure to do it right.

498
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,560
Make sure?

499
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,420
Aren't you going to get angry?

500
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,010
Shouldn't you get angry?

501
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:15,100
   

502
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,290
By tomorrow, you'll be outside. What are you looking at?

503
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,800
I want to engrave the view from this perspective in my head.

504
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,100
So that I won't ever forget.

505
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,330
I'll never return.

506
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,350
You really don't want us to prepare anything for tomorrow?

507
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,100
I'll leave quietly as though I was never here.

508
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,060
He's gone.

509
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:38,110
It always takes time to find a person.

510
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,780
Besides Inspector Park,

511
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,480
I'll assign higher-ranking officers to the case.

512
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,450
So let's stay strong.

513
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,060
Yes.

514
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,030
Thank you.

515
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,430
You don't have any injuries anymore.

516
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,080
You must be well-adjusted now.

517
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,750
From the Judicial Training Institute to here.

518
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,530
I felt like the walls of this place would collapse on me if I didn't.

519
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,520
You're quite a talker as well.

520
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,790
Okay, while I'm doing everything to find this kid out there,

521
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,510
what will you do here, Yo Han?

522
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,500
Take over.

523
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,400
What are you doing? Hurry up and find him!

524
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,770
Yes. Hurry up and find him!

525
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,530
 Yes, Sir! 

526
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,320
2345!

527
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,500
Where is Kim Yo Han?

528
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,470
 Whatever deal you have with him, 

529
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,910
 I'll give you 20% more. 

530
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,980
Come out! Come out!

531
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,200
Geez.

532
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,530
Cheosa-nim! 
  (T/N: A title used when addressing Buddhist believers) 

533
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,010
Cheosa-nim!

534
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,940
Kim Yo Han cheosa-nim.

535
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,020
Gosh, no.

536
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,450
Cheosa-nim!

537
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,500
Where did he go?

538
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,900
Please tell me where Kim Yo Han is.

539
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,290
I'm already sold.

540
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,760
I'll offer you more.

541
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,390
But right now, isn't Kim Yo Han the boss?

542
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,570
He's nothing but a card player.

543
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,460
Warden.

544
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,450
Everyone in our area has decided to follow me.

545
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,300
And I will follow you, Warden.

546
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,650
I am...

547
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,590
different from Jang Seon Oh.

548
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,370
Right now, Kim Yo Han is actually...

549
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,040
You got here faster than I thought.

550
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,540
You also moved faster than I thought.

551
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,810
It's all over.

552
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,000
Now, there is no Jang Seon Oh...

553
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,140
the Security Manager, and Warden's office...

554
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,190
There are no 1st leaguers who will follow you.

555
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,870
I won't kill you.

556
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,090
Just return to the regular cell block.

557
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:37,130
Go back and spend the rest of your time here quietly

558
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,990
and then leave.

559
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,170
Understand?

560
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,670
From the first day I stepped into the infirmary,

561
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,980
what did you see in me that made you suspicious of me?

562
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,970
Your eyes!

563
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,500
Your eyes aren't those of a criminal.

564
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,540
Your eyes don't belong to a person with a sense of guilt.

565
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,230
Then it's one of two cases,

566
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:12,400
either you're a psychopath or you're hiding something big.

567
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,360
What the hell are you hiding?

568
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,390
If I tell you all my secrets and truths,

569
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,620
will you accept me then?

570
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,750
Are you playing with me?

571
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,530
I...

572
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,820
I will wait here.

573
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,170
After you settle things in your head,

574
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,970
let's meet again then.

575
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,570
 Yes, this is Mok Jin Hyung of the Criminal Division. 

576
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,420
Is this the Seongju Prison?

577
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,090
   
   

578
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,210
   

579
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,570
 What is... 

580
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,410
your relationship with Kim Yo Han?

581
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,440
   

582
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,280
 A businesswoman in a hostess bar madam disguise? 

583
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,580
I asked what your relationship is with Kim Yo Han.

584
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,500
 Using the names of the homeless, 

585
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,900
 she buys assemblymen, the Ministry of Justice, and the police? 

586
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,100
 If this is exposed, it'll be huge. 

587
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,260
I'm hanging up now.

588
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,960
 I'm Northern District Prosecutors' Office Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung. 

589
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,590
I'm Trainee Kim Yo Han's mentor.

590
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,370
Kim Yo Han has a lot of work to do.

591
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:52,070
I'd like to ask that he's not bothered in any way in there.

592
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:00,340
This girl. She's got layers of charm like peeling an onion.

593
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,100
   

594
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,280
The call you just made.

595
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,550
Please keep it a secret from the others.

596
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,120
Chief prosecutor?

597
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,190
The chief prosecutor's got power.

598
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,420
So you think you can't be killed as a suicide on some night?

599
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,980
Forget this prison

600
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,080
and spend your remaining days quietly, then leave.

601
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,580
This is your last chance.

602
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,930
2345.

603
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,850
 Why did you follow Jang Seon Oh? 

604
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,120
Jang Seon Oh? No way...

605
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,630
I followed the money.

606
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,140
Can't you continue to do that?

607
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,910
What?

608
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,880
I won't...

609
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,150
take my share.

610
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,850
The Dean's share that Jang Seon Oh took.

611
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,150
The half of the house's revenue.

612
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,570
All of it. I'll give it to you and

613
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,910
the other 1st leaguers.

614
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,350
I'll share all of it with you all.

615
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,330
What is it that you want?

616
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:49,300
 You. Someone loyal to money to the end. 

617
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,270
I found him.

618
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,850
From the immigration record.

619
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,200
Woo Sang Ki.

620
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,800
It's Woo Min Ho's father.

621
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,910
He went to the US on a state scholarship and worked as an investment banker.

622
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,510
He met a Korean-American there, got married, and had a child.

623
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,190
Then he got assigned to a Hong Kong branch.

624
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,260
Then he lost his wife.

625
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,220
After retirement, he worked as a coin exchange trader

626
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,400
and lived alone with his child.

627
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,860
Last year, he returned to Korea after 15 years.

628
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,770
So it's an expired citizen ID number.

629
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,240
That's why the police couldn't find him.

630
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,860
Yes.

631
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,770
In order to find out the reason for his return,

632
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,750
we have to look into Woo Sang Ki's former employer.

633
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,390
But that's going to take some time.

634
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,470
We are using a lot of people with power,

635
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,320
but it's still going slowly.

636
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,540
That power...

637
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,300
how much stronger does it need to be?

638
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,300
Sinseon-dong in here...

639
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,200
Do you know of it?

640
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,060
 Are they Beomtul? 
 (T/N: Literally means tiger fur, but it means felons with ample detention money in prison) 

641
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,060
 They are pythons. 

642
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,600
 They are crouched down in the mud right now, 

643
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,670
 but given a chance to have dragon balls, 

644
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,980
 they'll transform into dragons and ascend into the sky. 

645
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,480
 I wonder how powerful these pythons are. 

646
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,370
 I'll have to find out for myself. 

647
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:02,930

01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:18,340
♫  I put everything I have on the line  ♫

664
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:26,900
♫  I'll keep going toward the end of life  ♫

665
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,700
 What is Sinseon-dong? 

666
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,240
 He creates a flow. 

667
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,310
 He only enjoys winning. 

668
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,940
 If there's an accident, it'll be your poison. 

669
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,960
 I'm looking for a child. 

670
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,540
 He's been missing for about 7 months. 

671
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,250
 But that child. I have to find his body if it comes to that. 

672
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,060
 Ever since I met you, 

673
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,740
 nothing's going right for me. 

674
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,570
 Did you say you found a clue about Shin Dal Soo's killer? 

675
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,470
 - Is that what you said? 
 - Yes. 

676
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,190
 Focus only on that child for now. 

677
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,930
 It's about whether we can find an eyewitness or not. 

678
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,380
 It's all or nothing. 

679
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,130
 But he mustn't be involved. 

680
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,910
♫  Another me who hid myself, no one else knows  ♫

681
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,170
♫  The darkness awakens  ♫
