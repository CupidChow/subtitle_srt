Isn't it tarnishing Kim's Group reputation?

- She's gone too far.
- Everyone.

10

This is unacceptable!

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,600
How could she do

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,540
such a disgraceful act?

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,760
Luckily, they don't get married.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
Otherwise, our Kim's Group

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,160
would be the laughingstock of Mengcheng.

16

Everyone,

I never expected my brother

can't even control his own woman.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,560

are nothing new.

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
Is the PR Department

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,080
just freeloading?

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,000

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,720
You finally showed up, Jin Xiao.

34

Cut ties with Mi Ke immediately.

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,280
I won't let her marry into our family.

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Xiao,

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
you're being foolish.

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,360
Look.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,000
Jin Xiao,

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,440
I didn't want to get involved

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
in your personal life.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,880
But this affects our group's reputation.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
You should issue a notice letter

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
and resign from the Board.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
Everyone,

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,800
give me three days.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,690
I'll handle this matter properly.

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
Jin Xiao, you can't leave.

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
You can't be so irresponsible.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
That's not the case at all.

51
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Mi Ke,

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
don't worry.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,220
I'll always be by your side.

54
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,160
Let go of me.

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
- I'm her real boyfriend.
- Ouch!

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,620
What do you think you are?

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Mi Ke,

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
don't be afraid.

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
I believe in you.

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Tell me

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
what happened.

62
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
He took me home after dinner that day.

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
But it wasn't anything

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,800
like what the news reported.

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,320
Well,

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
is he just the project contact?

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,240
What do you mean?

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Jin Xiao,

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
Mi Ke can't explain.

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,600
I'll speak for her.

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,780
She never once considered

72
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,520
marrying you.

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,260
If not for the Mi family's struggles,

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,960
we would've been together long ago.

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,760
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
Mi Ke,

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,020
didn't we confess our feelings

78
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,990
- last night?
- Let go of me.

79
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,080
- Away from her!
- Mi Ke.

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
- Mi Ke!
- Let go!

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,920
I'm warning you, get out now.

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Or I'll make you vanish from Mengcheng.

83
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Mi Ke,

84
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,780
someone like him doesn't deserve your love.

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm the one who truly loves you.

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,320
I'll wait for you.

87
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
Are you okay?

88
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Come, sit down.

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,640
We had some wine during dinner,

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,360
so he offered to take me home.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Maybe I drank too much,

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,520
so I dozed off in the car.

93
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,120
Later,

94
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,800
I didn't remember much.

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
It just felt like

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,680
my mind was a mess.

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,320
That's pretty much

98
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,080
how it happened.

99
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
You two

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
really hugged each other?

101
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
You!

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,880
Excuse me.

103
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,160
Another drink, please.

107

(Kim's Group Quickly Responds)
Really low!

108
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,120
In other words,

109
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,760
starting from the Jiahong Project,

110
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,280
it was a trap.

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
The ultimate goal

112
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,760
was to pull off this stunt.

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,280
But this situation

114
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,520
doesn't benefit Jiahong.

115
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,160
Then he went to such lengths

116
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,560
for only two possibilities.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,460
What are they?

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
First,

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,640
he genuinely likes you.

120
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
You...

121
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
But...

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
If it were me,

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,520
I wouldn't let my loved one

124
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
face such rumors.

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
So,

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
there's another possibility.

127
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,720
Let's do like this.

128
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,280

for this project at Jiahong Group,

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,520
especially Gu Chengze,

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
since joining and taking over this project.

132
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,980
The more details, the better.

133
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Yes, sir.

134
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,690
What have you guessed?

135
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,160
He might be targeting me.

136
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
Leave it to me.

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
Mr. Huang.

138
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800

will be handed over to you.

Thank you, Mr. Huang.

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,440
The food's getting cold.

143
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
Just add some heat to it.

144

Understood.

145

She's coming.

146

Miss Mi, about your affair,

147
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,860
do you have anything to say?

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
Given your status, does this incident

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,040
affect the alliance between the families?

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,600
Could you clarify if it's true?

151
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Please explain it.

152
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Is it true?

153
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,520
Answer the question.

154
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Make way, make way.

155
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Jin Xiao is here.

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,540
Mr. Jin, how do you feel

157
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,680
about your fiancée's affair?

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,080
First of all,

159
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,680
I, Jin Xiao, fully believe

160
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
in my fiancée's integrity.

161
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
She must have been framed.

162
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Second,

163
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,480
please stop spreading

164
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,640
false information immediately.

165
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,200
Otherwise, Kim's Group

166
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,480
will hold you legally accountable.

167
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Third,

168
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,760
I will personally uncover the mastermind.

169
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,840
You better watch your back.

170
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,560
You're the target now.

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Leave it to me, okay?

172
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,800
My dad had a heart relapse last night

173
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
because of this matter.

174
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,280
All my uncles and relatives

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
called to accuse me

176
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
without even asking.

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Actually, I already have some evidence.

178
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Can it prove

179
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
that I was framed?

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,120
I believe in you,

181
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
just like you trusted me back then.

182
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,160
I've already had someone retrieve

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
the surveillance footage from that day.

184
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Well done.

185
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Is that him?

186
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,960
Zoom in, zoom in.

187
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
He was caught. It's him.

188
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
Remember this face.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Let me say it again.

190
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,080
My relationship with Miss Mi Ke

191
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
is our personal privacy.

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
Your media coverage

193
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,880
has severely disrupted our lives,

194
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
especially the term "secret meeting".

195
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,800
It's an insult to our character.

196
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
He's such a drama queen.

197
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,600
His words...

198
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
Calm down.

199
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
I'm fine.

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
I can't back down anymore.

201
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,840
What's your idea?

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Take the risk myself.

203
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
How?

204
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,140
(Zuo Yemei)

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
Hello?

206
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Mr. Jin, the paparazzo is found.

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
You go find the paparazzo first

208
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
and get the evidence.

209
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Wait for my message.

210
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,930
What are you doing?

211
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,660
You came just in time.

212
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
I have something to talk to you.

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Didn't Jin Haochen

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
agree to invest?

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,120
Where's the money?

216
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,220
(Report on the Binhai Project)

217
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,800
Take a look at this.

218
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
What? I can't understand it.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
This report

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,920
confirms my suspicions.

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
Our area here

222
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
is practically worthless.

223
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,120
Are you out of your mind again?

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,960
What I mean is,

225
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,680
we'll be phased out eventually.

226
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Our industrial structure is too outdated.

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,640
Investors aren't fools either.

228
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,060
Did Jin Haochen really say

229
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,840
he'd invest in us?

230
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,840
You told us that yourself.

231
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,940
But you ask us instead.

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
Even if Jin Haochen invests,

233
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,840
we'd still bear the losses.

234
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,520
With the existing foundation here

235
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,640
and our management skills,

236
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,080
turning a profit

237
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
is too difficult.

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
So for us,

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
being acquired

240
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,380
is actually a good thing.

241
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,920
This is called risk transfer.

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
He Fang,

243
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
we're like brothers.

244
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,460
I just want to ask you

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
whether you're planning to pocket the money.

246
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,480
If you do that,

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
you'd be heartless.

248
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,200
Everything I said is data-driven.

249
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
This is

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
our only way out.

251
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Why can't we just move forward?

252
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,000
Why cling to this small piece of land?

253
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,680
We'll never rise above it.

254
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
- Well...
- Someone's here.

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,560
Who's here?

256
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
She said she's from Mengcheng.

257
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,280
Mengcheng?

258
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,920
(As far as I know,)

259
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,980
(Jin Haochen plans to use)

260
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,640
(the Binhai Project against Jin Xiao.)

261
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
(What secrets)

262
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,640
(does this project hold?)

263
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,340
(Binhai Town)

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,880
It's a lawful society.

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,580
You can't use coercion for confessions.

266
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,960
Stop wasting time with him.

267
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Are you ready?

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm ready.

269
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,040
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

270
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Are you ready?

271
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
Ready.

272
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,640
You beat me up like this.

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
You'll either go to jail

274
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
or pay me a million.

275
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,520
According to Article 234 of the Criminal Law,

276
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,120
whoever causes serious injury to others

277
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,450
shall be sentenced to imprisonment

278
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,120
of three to ten years.

279
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,400
This... this wasn't me.

280
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,760
It was clearly you.

281
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,920
But the weapon is in your hands.

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
This is the evidence.

283
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
How could this be?

284
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm calling the police.

285
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
- Call the police.
- Call the police.

286
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
Don't call the police.

288
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,470
I confess.

289
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,800
Gu Chengze made me do it.

290
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,440
He paid me a sum of money and asked me

291
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,120
to take photos and edit them together

292
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
and create some sensational news.

293
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,680
I spent that money on drinks last night.

294
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
So, it's all gone?

295
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
Then get lost.

296
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
Fine. Fine.

297
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,280
Let him leave like that?

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
You're really from Mengcheng?

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,560
That's right.

300
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,160
Jin Haochen, Mr. Jin,

301
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
asks you to invest.

302
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
How much are you planning to invest?

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
Do you know Jin Haochen?

304
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Yes, we do.

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Isn't he He Fang's brother?

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Exactly.

307
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
He Fang?

308
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
He Fang.

309
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Jin Xiao.

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes, the notorious Jin Xiao

311
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
wants to acquire us.

312
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,240
What? Do you know him?

313
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,760
You don't know him?

314
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,480
No, never met him.

315
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
Well,

316
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
he...

317
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,620
He definitely doesn't know him.

318
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,940
Not only did he lose his memory,

319
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,360
his brain got damaged too.

320
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,820
He always sides with outsiders.

321
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,820
Let me ask you something.

322
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
Did He Fang

323
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,080
embezzle

324
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,220
Mr. Jin's investment funds?

325
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
He Fang?

326
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,600
Next time, use ketchup instead.

327
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
This cough syrup tastes awful.

328
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
Mi Ke.

329
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Mi Ke.

330
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
Where's Mi Ke?

331
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
I just went to see her.

332
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,610
Mr. Liang said she went out.

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
She went out?

334
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
Where did she go?

335
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
She didn't say.

336
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,440
By the way,

337
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
I found something.

338
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,280
The Jiahong Project was with Huang Chengren.

339
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,920
Behind Huang Chengren is Jin Haochen.

340
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,360
It is him.

341
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,000
(Mi Ke: Guanyuan Hotel,
Dafeng West Road Branch. Come quickly.)

342
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
