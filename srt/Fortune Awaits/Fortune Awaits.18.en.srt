=Episode 18=

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
There's 8.037 million

4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
in this card.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,920
Just in this little card.

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,680
If it were cash,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,920
how much would that be?

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,800
Would it fill our whole cabinet?

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,920
I don't even have that many game coins.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Come on.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,760
But why is the money in odd amounts?

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,840
Taxpayers are honorable.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,160
That's why it's in odd amounts.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,880
We've struck it rich!

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,160
We're rich, we're rich!

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
We're rich!

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Baby,

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,960
you'll be a rich kid from now on.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,940
(He Fang)

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
After that car accident,

21
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,720
- He Fang!
- through a twist of fate,

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,370
- He Fang!
- I became He Fang.

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,440
Wake up, He Fang!

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
And He Fang

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
turned into Jin Xiao.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
I lost my memory because of it.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
But why did he impersonate me?

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
Could it be that He Fang

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,360
colluded with Binhai in a scheme?

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,540
He Fang, come quickly!

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,640
He Fang.

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,720
- Come here.
- Come.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,040
Freshly roasted sunflower seeds.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,360
But they seem

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
not like scheming people.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
They really think I'm He Fang.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Wait!

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,520
Wang Dalu kept stopping me

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
from meeting Jin Haochen.

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,920
That Jin Haochen

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,040
is in a rush to go abroad.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Then I'll give him a call.

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
Give me his phone number.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
I don't have it.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
I really don't.

46
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,440
Anyway, he's already abroad.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,640
He won't answer your call.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Then he must know.

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
I

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
am not He Fang.

51
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Looks like I need to remember everything.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
He Fang.

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
He Fang.

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
He Fang.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
He Fang,

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,480
thanks to your brother's donation.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
We

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
are saved.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,200
He Fang, aren't you happy?

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
I am.

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course, I'm happy.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
I think we should

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
visit Kim's Group.

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank my brother

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,960
personally.

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,600
What are you here for?

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,440
We came to see our benefactor,

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,560
Mr. Jin Haochen.

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,640
Do you have an appointment?

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
Tell him someone from Binhai is here.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,900
He's definitely coming down.

72
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,160
Sorry.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,600
No appointment, no entry.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,960
We brought gifts.

75
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
How is it?

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Is he here?

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Mr. Jin.

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Yes.

79
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Looking for Mr. Jin.

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,520
Please come in.

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,280
Come on.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Why does she treat people differently?

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,240
She agreed to him, but refused us.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
Mr. Jin is his brother. It's different.

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,600
Wait for us.

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
What the hell!

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,080
Mr. Jin, a document needs your review.

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,920
Alright.

89
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Excuse me.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
How do I get to Jin Haochen's office?

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
He's asking you.

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Why is this person so odd?

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,480
A big company is just different.

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,560
Indeed.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
It's so huge.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
What are you doing?

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
I...

98
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,830
I...

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
I feel sick.

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't throw up here.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
By the way,

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
do you know Jin Xiao?

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
No, I don't.

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
That's perfect.

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,140
Can you pass a message for me?

106
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Sir,

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,160
Mr. Jin Haochen

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,140
needs to speak with you.

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
Please wait in the meeting room.

110
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
Go alone.

111
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
What's up?

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
It's nothing.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,240
My brother knows I'm here.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,940
He wants to see me alone.

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,360
How about this?

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,020
You guys wait here for me.

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
I'll be back soon.

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Hair.

119
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680
So fast?

120
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
You're done talking?

121
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,440
Why did you change clothes?

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
What are we here for today?

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,480
To thank Jin Haochen for his investment.

124
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Exactly.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,760
I changed clothes

126
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
to look more formal.

127
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Alright, we're done thanking. Let's go.

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
Wait, we came all this way.

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,180
We haven't seen him yet.

130
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you leaving?

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,160
He looks down on us?

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
No,

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
he's just busy.

134
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
He said he'll go another day

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
to meet everyone.

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
Alright.

137
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,640
But I have to deliver this.

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,360
- Right.
- Just leave it at the front desk.

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
Let's go.

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Mr. Jin.

141
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,440
Mr. Jin, this is the report

142
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,600
(Report on the Binhai Project)
you requested to redo.

143
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
The investigation is complete.

144
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Binhai isn't viable for investment.

145
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,320
The local infrastructure in Binhai

146
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,480
is relatively underdeveloped.

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,200
It can't support large-scale projects.

148
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,720
Additionally, there's a lack of talent.

149
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Skilled technical labor is insufficient.

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm afraid our project

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,220
will struggle to stand out.

152
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,240
Who handled this project

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,360
during the approval process?

154
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,880
It was Mr. Huang's second team.

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
Jin Haochen's people.

156
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,040
Alright, I got it.

157
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,780
(Jin Haochen)

158
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
Hello? Jin Xiao.

159
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm planning to visit Binhai for research.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
Want to go together?

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
To Binhai?

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Alright.

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
I was planning to go too.

164
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,160
Then see you in Binhai tonight.

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
See you in Binhai.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
(Though I still don't know)

167
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
(what role He Fang plays in it,)

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
(Jin Haochen)

169
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,640
(is definitely involved.)

170
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
(I have no evidence in hand yet.)

171
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
(If I expose He Fang's identity now,)

172
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
(it will backfire on me.)

173
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,720
(Let him continue as me for now.)

174
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
(I can step back)

175
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
(and investigate the car accident.)

176
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,320
Why keep this here?

177
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
What Charity Dinner?

178
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,080
It's all Jin Xiao's tricks.

179
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Your money

180
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
is all given to Binhai's poor folks

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
for the expansion.

182
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Mom.

183
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Come on.

184
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Alright.

185
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Don't be mad, okay?

186
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,880
Come sit down.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Come here.

188
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Come on.

189
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,360
Calm down.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I know these aren't worth ten million.

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
But they

192
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,520
can restore my image.

193
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,100
That makes them worth ten million.

194
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,040
By the way,

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,480
the Qilin Chamber of Commerce is coming.

196
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
Do you know?

197
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,160
You mean,

198
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Chairman Zhuo Lan?

199
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Yes, it's her.

200
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
Your dad has decided to let Jin Xiao

201
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
represent the group at the meeting.

202
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
It's the Qilin Chamber of Commerce.

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Getting close to Zhuo Lan

204
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,720
is a huge opportunity.

205
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
Whenever something good happens,

206
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
why does he always think of Jin Xiao first?

207
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,480
He Fang, what's wrong?

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,400
I suddenly feel a stomachache.

209
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,800
I need to use the restroom.

210
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll go with you.

211
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,080
Why do you go with me?

212
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
It's not convenient.

213
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,800
Wait here for a bit.

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
Why is he so troublesome?

215
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Where did he go?

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
Did Jin Xiao leave?

217
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
Still in the office.

218
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,420
(Qilin Chamber of Commerce)

219
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
Could it be

220
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,440
that He Fang fell

221
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,640
in the restroom?

222
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
I'll go get him.

223
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,080
He Fang.

224
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,880
He Fang.

225
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
What are you doing?

226
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Sorry about that.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,280
I don't know how

228
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
to explain what I just did.

229
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
That's okay.

230
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
I... I understand.

231
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm willing.

232
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Jiang.

233
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,040
Let's go back first.

234
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,080
The pigs at home need feeding.

235
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,200
Alright.

236
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,360
We'll have plenty of time together,

237
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
right?

238
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,860
I still have some things to handle.

239
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
Don't keep everyone waiting.

240
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
Go back first.

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
When will you be back?

242
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,760
I'll return after I'm done.

243
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
Then hurry up.

244
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,280
Jin Xiao.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
Jin Xiao.

246
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,800
Where did he go?

247
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,720
Jiang.

248
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
Where's He Fang?

249
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,660
He said he had something to do.

250
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,820
They told us to go back first.

251
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,520
This is such a mess.

252
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,520
Completely ruined.

253
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,240
Honey, what's wrong with you?

254
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
- Zhen!
- Honey!

255
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,420
- Zhen, what's wrong?
- I...

256
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,460
- I'm going into labor.
- What's happening?

257
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,960
- Go to the hospital.
- Yes, yes.

258
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
- The hospital.
- The hospital.

259
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Let's go to the hospital.

260
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
What's wrong?

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,790
Zhen is going into labor.

262
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,080
- We must go to the hospital.
- Labor?

263
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,540
(But I haven't found Jin Xiao yet.)

264
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,600
Forget it.

265
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
Quick, give me the car key.

266
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,880
- I'll get the car.
- Okay.

267
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
- Quickly.
- Downstairs.

268
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,100
- Honey, hang in there.
- Slow down.

269
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,160
Honey.

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
Jin Xiao.

271
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,160
