Dears.

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,560
Weird.

5
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,600
Well,

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,240
I haven't seen everyone in a while.

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,240
I feel

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,520
weird.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,760
Everyone must

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,400
eat well, drink well.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
You're growing up.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
Nutrition must keep up.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
You're my treasure in my heart.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,040
You're my constant worry.

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
You're

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
the wealth of my life.

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,440
I really miss you.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Looking back,

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,800
there are achievements,

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
and also problems.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
Standing in the present,

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
there are crises

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,880
and also opportunities.

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Seeing you all healthy and strong,

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
I am confident

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
it will be a good harvest next year.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,800
But you must remember.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
If needed, get vaccinated

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
and take medicine.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,360
Be sure to keep healthy.

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,720
- In our circle...
- Everyone...

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,480
- Dear little pigs...
- everyone

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
should work together

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,680
to ride the wind and waves

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
and forge ahead.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,320
Not one less.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,720
I love you all.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,250
He Fang, He Fang, He Fang.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,760
You spoke so well.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Where did you learn that?

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Why haven't you said this before?

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
It popped into my mind.

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,360
It came out naturally.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,240
Nonsense.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
Empty talk.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,880
Not worth anything at all.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
You promised the moon to pigs.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
I just promised the moon to them.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,520
Hope it doesn't get exposed.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
Mr. Jin.

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
Where's Mi Ke?

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
She left.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
She went to rest in the guest room.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
I didn't expect you to want

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,200
to be CEO

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
in the company.

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,900
No,

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,880
I don't want to be a CEO.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
My babies are waiting for me at home.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
I can also be your baby.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,990
Good drinking capacity.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Mr. Jin.

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,480
Who is it?

64
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Help me.

65
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Jin Xiao.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,000
I feel terrible. Help me.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,890
Don't come any closer.

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
Help me.

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,590
No, don't come closer.

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Help me.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Stay away from me.

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Why are you in my room?

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
I don't want to argue.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,590
You have one day to get ready.

75
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
We must end the engagement.

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
My head hurts so much.

77
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
You can sleep with me,

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
but don't disrespect me.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
Hallucinogen.

80
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,600
It can make you feel good.

81
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,200
Looks like the dosage was low.

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
Hallucinogen?

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
Fang Yutong?

84
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
You never give up.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,200
No, I mean Fang Yutong tried to...

86
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
You know what.

87
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,000
Your brother

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,920
has impressive self-control.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
He didn't lay a hand on me.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
There are only two possibilities.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
Either he's incapable,

92
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,360
or you're incapable.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
Are you blaming me now?

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Let me go.

95
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Don't.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Where's the document?

97
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
I didn't see it.

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,470
Let go of me.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,200
Find a way

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
to get him to sign the project proposal.

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Let me go.

102
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,760
How could I possibly do that?

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,920
You know hypnosis, right?

104
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,800
It's getting late.

105
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
I have to leave.

106
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,040
Wait a second.

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,600
I like women in high heels.

108
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
And one more thing.

109
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,200
Before my father returns,

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
I don't want him to step into the company.

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Got it.

112
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,000
Remember now?

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,640
He Fang,

114
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
look at your clothes.

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,290
You look like an insurance salesman.

116
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,840
So, feeling better?

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,280
The flavor, meat quality, texture,

118
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
all top-notch.

119
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,160
But it's a losing business.

120
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,000
Have you ever thought why?

121
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
Business is not good.

122
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
That's because of fierce competition.

123
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,680
But I believe with our family's strength

124
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,930
business will surely get better.

125
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,720
Exactly.

126
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,000
Based on your shop's location

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,840
and the town's permanent population,

128
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
your daily consumers is under 20.

129
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,960
At an average of 2 yuan per skewer,

130
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
your gross profit margin is just 20%,

131
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,400
then deduct utilities

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
and necessary maintenance costs,

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
can you make a monthly profit

134
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
of 4,000 yuan?

135
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
That's the best-case scenario.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,120
The town's population is shrinking.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
The elderly ratio is increasing.

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,920
How many seniors eat barbecue?

139
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,720
No consumers come to eat.

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
It's a losing business either way.

141
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
So what should we do?

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,720
First,

143
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
close the shop early.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,880
Second, change the strategy,

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,020
cut costs, boost efficiency,

146
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,100
and create something unique.

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
First, second, blah blah.

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,720
Close the shop? No way.

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
Get out of here! You're bad luck.

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,640
Wang Dalu.

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Just take him away.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
Stop causing us trouble here.

154
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Go, go, go!

155
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
What nonsense are you talking?

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
This ecological park

157
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
is too traditional.

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,880
If we don't innovate,

159
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,140
it'll be doomed eventually.

160
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,000
Just shut up already.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
I think you're done for.

162
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
If you knew how to manage sales,

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
your pig farm

164
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
wouldn't be in such a state.

165
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,800
That's what I can't figure out.

166
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,000
What do you mean?

167
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,080
Why did I even start pig farming?

168
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Pig farming.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
I have to do it.

170
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
The sunlight.

171
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
The air.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,330
It's a waste not to raise pigs here.

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,360
You haven't heard piglets

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,920
crying for food.

175
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,080
It's like music to the ears.

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Raising pigs?

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,400
Right here?

178
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,000
Why are you everywhere?

179
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm your doctor.

180
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,480
Of course, I'm here to treat you.

181
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,520
I told you I'm not sick.

182
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
