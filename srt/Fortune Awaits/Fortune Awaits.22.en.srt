00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,920
Partnership...

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,160
Agreement...

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,440
Help me become the heir

6
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
to stop the Binhai acquisition plan.

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,240
Alright.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,760
Since it's a contractual marriage,

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,140
I want to set three rules.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're right.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,160
It was fake from the start.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,320
He Fang,

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,160
this is my good luck.

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,360
Now I'm giving it to you.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,800
Miss Mi,

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,160
since we first met,

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,120
you've always tried your best to help me.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,120
Thank you.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Whether you're Jin Xiao or He Fang,

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll always be by your side,

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,560
accompanying you,

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
and supporting you.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,680
I believe in you.

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,040
Just like you once believed in me.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
- Hello?
- Congratulations.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,240
When's the wedding scheduled?

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
I won't marry her.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,320
I heard the Mi Family and Qilin Chamber

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
are collaborating well.

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,680
Her dad even gave shares to Mi Ke.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
What do you want?

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
I want you to give me

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,320
the Mi Family's shares.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
No way.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,080
You're not qualified to negotiate.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,480
I've done what you asked.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
Don't try to bargain with me again.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Then maybe

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll talk to Mi Ke.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,680
You dare touch her?

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Jin Haochen.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
Jin Haochen.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Mi Ke.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,160
Mi Ke.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Mi Ke.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
Mi Ke.

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,140
(Incoming call)

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,740
(Jin Haochen: Mi Family shares in 12 hours)

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Jin Xiao, you're here.

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,600
- Mr. Mi.
- Come on, have a seat.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,820
I was just about to look for you.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Ke isn't answering my calls.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
Is she not with you?

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,920
She's busy preparing for the wedding.

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
She said she wants to surprise you.

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,680
My heart can't handle

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,320
any more surprises.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,080
As long as your wedding

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,400
goes smoothly,

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,560
I'll be at ease.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Did you need something from me?

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Mi Ke said...

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
Why are you hesitating to talk?

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,140
Just say what's on your mind.

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,240
It's about the Equity Transfer Agreement

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
what you mentioned to her last time.

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
Look at her.

68
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,960
She's not even married yet,

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
and she's already not on my side.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
I've had it ready for a while.

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,550
You came just in time.

72
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,400
(Mi's Group Equity Transfer Agreement)
Take it back.

73
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
It just needs her signature.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
You're giving it to me

75
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,400
so easily?

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,220
What's there to worry about?

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,240
We're family now.

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Alright, Mr. Mi,

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
I'll take it to her.

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Alright.

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm going.

82
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
Go ahead.

83
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,100
(Document Folder)

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm here.

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,560
Where are you?

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Turn around.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
See the man with a mask?

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,720
I see him.

89
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,800
Go talk to him.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Where are they?

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,760
Give it to him.

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,200
He'll tell you.

93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,200
Jin Haochen,

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,200
hand them over to me.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
You know pork better than I do.

96
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,820
I wanted to invite you to eat together.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
Where are they really?

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
I have to say,

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
the pig in this villa

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,280
is different from those in the pigpen.

101
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
It tastes even more delicious.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Wuhuarou?

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Want to try it?

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
Jin Haochen,

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
you're crazy.

106
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Come on.

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Keep going.

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm telling you,

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
whatever you do to me,

110
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,440
I'll do it

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,620
to those beautiful ladies.

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,480
I've given you everything you wanted.

113
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Where're they?

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,440
It can make you so obedient.

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Of course, I'll make good use of it.

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Right?

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Come on.

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Get closer, and I'll tell you.

119
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,400
Come on.

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,120
Apart from looking like Jin Xiao,

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
you are nothing like him at all.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
Because he never believed in me.

123
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,760
Jin Haochen,

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
you're insane.

125
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,280
You're going to hell.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
You're too adorable.

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,040
I like you so much.

128
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Where are they?

129
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
He Fang, oh He Fang.

130
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,560
We're the same kind of people.

131
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
Selfish and greedy.

132
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,440
The first time you

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,840
pretended to be Jin Xiao,

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,650
did you not have ulterior motives?

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
- You...
- When you saw so much money,

136
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,200
and all those beautiful ladies,

137
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
wasn't it thrilling?

138
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,920
If you were still that pig farmer,

139
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
do you think Mi Ke, Zuo Yemei,

140
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
and that Fang Yutong

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
will still revolve around you?

142
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,520
My dear brother,

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
come on.

144
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
Try some pork belly.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
It's really delicious.

146
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,480
Jin Haochen,

147
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,680
my patience has its limits.

148
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
Tell me where they are.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,440
Or wait for the police to come.

150
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,800
Call the police, huh?

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
Alright.

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,680
If you want to call the police,

153
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,240
I need to get that ten million back

154
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
that your friends in Binhai

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,920
owed me.

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Do you know

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
what it means

158
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,100
to scheme for money and harm lives?

159
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Madam,

160
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,520
where are they?

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,280
What's wrong with you?

162
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm fine.

163
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
Madam,

164
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Zhen, Qiang,

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,120
Haoyun, Jiang, where are they?

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
Houses here are going to be demolished.

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Why stay here?

168
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Life is unpredictable.

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,960
It is all my fault.

170
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
I caused everyone

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
to lose their homes.

172
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,720
It's fate.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
It's destiny.

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,600
You and Jin Xiao

175
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
are destined

176
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,080
to intertwine.

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
But I really don't know

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
what I should do now.

179
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,460
Do you think I shouldn't leave

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,160
in the first place?

181
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,640
The first time,

182
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
I made a choice for you.

183
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
This time,

184
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,120
you choose for yourself.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Madam,

186
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm too clumsy.

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,880
If it were Jin Xiao,

188
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
what would he do?

189
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,440
He, Jin Xiao,

190
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,400
is no ordinary Jin Xiao.

191
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
You, He Fang

192
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,080
is no ordinary He Fang.

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,080
The world is an illusion.

194
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,840
All is emptiness.

195
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,840
You should

196
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
think about what He Fang should do.

197
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Go ahead.

198
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,080
Do what you must.

199
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
Be yourself again.

200
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
Mr. Jin.

201
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
Mr. Liang.

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Is my father here?

203
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I need to talk to him.

204
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
Hello, Mr. He.

205
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,080
I know you have concerns.

206
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,600
But there's no time to explain.

207
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,440
Just remember this.

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,840
I haven't

209
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
threatened you in any way.

210
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,280
Jin Haochen...

211
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,360
Jin Haochen, he...

212
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Miss Mi and the others

213
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
are in great danger.

214
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,320
I've sent the address to your phone.

215
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
How do you have their location?

216
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,320
You're not alone.

217
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,880
Be very careful.

218
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Hu, let me toast you.

219
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,640
