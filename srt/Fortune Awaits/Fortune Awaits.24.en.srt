=Episode 24=

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Why are you still here?

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,200
Haochen,

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
long time no see.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
That's you!

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Surprised?

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Unexpected?

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,280
He Fang!

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Whether poor or rich,

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
in sickness or in health,

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
you will love him faithfully,

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,920
until eternity.

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Miss Mi Ke,

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,560
do you agree?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,800
You are Jin Xiao?

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,880
Miss Mi Ke.

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Stop it!

19
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,470
Go away!

20
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,620
Go away!

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,050
Go away!

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,320
Jiang.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,440
Chairman Zhuo.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
This piece of land

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,480
already belongs to Kim's Group.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,480
Stay out of it.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
Go tell Jin Haochen

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,140
that I will take charge

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,320
of this matter.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Thanks.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Hurry up.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,140
Someone's waiting for you.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Jiang.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,480
Jin Xiao's alive.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,460
Mi Ke.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,320
Jin Xiao.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Why are you so late?

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
It's a bit tricky.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,040
What's going on?

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,720
Why do they look identical?

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
That's amazing!

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,670
Hello?

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
This is Jin Xiao.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
You're still alive.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,440
Want to work together?

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,720
From now on, your happiness

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,040
is up to you.

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,150
Well...

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,160
Jin Haochen.

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
You failed to kill me twice.

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,400
You're surprised, aren't you?

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Jin Xiao,

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
what are you talking about?

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,280
Dad, did you see that?

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
He found a stand-in.

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
He must have done

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880
something shady.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
What everyone sees on your phones now

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
is the evidence of Jin Haochen

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
diverting project funds.

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,200
This is too much.

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
It's fake.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
It's fake.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
It must be fake.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Zhenghao,

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
you must trust Haochen.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
It's all that impostor's doing.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Shut up!

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,200
Jin Haochen,

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,520
three months ago,

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,790
you asked to meet me in Binhai,

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,400
but you didn't show up.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
The location of the car accident

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
was also chosen by you.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
That was an accident.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,880
Do you have proof?

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
- Why the rush?
- Don't frame me.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
I have evidence.

80
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
I found it

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
in my wrecked car.

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,600
You hired someone

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
to plant a tracker in my car.

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,680
Dad, you have to believe me.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
He's framing me.

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Jin Haochen,

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,150
(Report on the Binhai Project)
you've been looking for this.

88
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
The Binhai Project

89
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,560
isn't worth investing in.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
But you didn't dare let Dad know.

91
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,480
Because it was a tool you and Huang Chengren

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
used to amass wealth.

93
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
And the project funds

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,780
were already transferred by you.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
Dad,

96
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Huang Chengren forced me.

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,240
He said you're unfit as chairman.

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,480
He wanted me to take over.

99
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,800
Enough!

100
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
Both of you

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,640
are leaving for Thailand tomorrow.

102
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't come back in three years.

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,360
Zhenghao,

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,080
you can't do this to us.

105
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
You old fool.

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
You forced my hand.

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm telling you,

108
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,260
you must hand the group over to me today.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,360
You monster!

110
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Someone!

111
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
Zhao Hu!

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,320
- Zhenghao.
- Mr. Jin.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
- Dad, someone!
- Master Jin!

114
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
To the hospital.

115
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,400
Zhao Hu!

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Zhao Hu!

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
It's no use.

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,980
We've already taken control of Zhao Hu.

119
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
Just wait for the police to arrive.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Someone, grab this scoundrel!

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,640
Don't let him get away.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,800
Let me go.

123
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Money, money.

124
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
I'll give you money.

125
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Any amount?

126
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,170
Yes.

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,120
Yutong,

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
this money was meant for you.

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Let's forget the past.

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,140
Take this money and let's start over, okay?

131
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,240
Tell them to let me go.

132
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
This money should be mine.

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,560
But what you owe me

134
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
is far from enough.

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
How much do you want?

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,060
I'll give it all to you.

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
You...!

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Well done.

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
Well done.

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
I deserve it.

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Enough?

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,500
What else do you want?

143
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,360
I want to make you

144
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
go to hell.

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
Young Master Jin.

146
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
Fang Yutong.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,940
If the police are here,

148
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,580
you can't get out of this either.

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,760
I called the police.

150
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,880
I've confessed everything to them

151
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,720
and turned myself in.

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Enjoy it.

153
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
Fang Yutong!

154
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,360
(Jin Haochen, Fang Yutong, Jia Lihua,
Huang Chengren, and others involved)

155
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,640
(all were lawfully arrested
and faced legal consequences)

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
I am He Fang.

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
I know.

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Let me

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
reintroduce myself.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
My name is He Fang.

161
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,760
That He Fang, who raises pigs in Binhai.

162
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
This is the most relaxed time

163
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,040
I've felt in the past three months.

164
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,200
During this time,

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
it was your encouragement

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
that kept me going.

167
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
I was too insecure before,

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
so I kept pushing you away.

169
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,720
Mi Ke,

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
would you still marry me?

171
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,800
Well,

172
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
not even a ring?

173
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
I have.

174
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,680
Where's my ring?

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
He Fang,

176
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,140
Wuhuarou left it to you.

177
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Thanks.

178
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
Mi Ke,

179
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,960
will you marry me?

180
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,760
I do.

181
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,300
(Good Luck)

182
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,000
It really is you.

183
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
Three,

184
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,760
two,

185
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,720
one.

186
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,020
(Binhai Town Market)

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
First of all,

188
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,000
I want to thank the investors.

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
For me,

190
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
your investment

191
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
is not just financial support,

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
but also recognition of me.

193
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,680
Thank you all.

194
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,960
You gave us the chance

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
to develop our hometown.

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Correct.

for this land

202
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480

Yes.

205

Finally,

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
we must

207
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
work together

208
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800

Go!

212
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080

From now on,

223
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,200
don't do farm work yourself.

224
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
If I don't do it, who will?

225
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
I can't afford to hire workers.

239
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,360
I said here last time?

240
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
What?

living here

243
