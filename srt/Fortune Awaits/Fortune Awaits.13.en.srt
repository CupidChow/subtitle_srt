3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
He Fang,

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
why did you sleep over there?

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,200
What happened?

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
The thing is

7
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,520
like this.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
You're quite thoughtful.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
I've been taking care of you.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Only now you realize?

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,240
Humph.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,720
Stop flaunting your love.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,880
Are you even listening to me?

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
But He Fang,

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,760
you did a great job today.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,390
You protected our merchants

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,200
and made a huge contribution.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,560
But I don't remember anything.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,480
And I saw someone

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,960
who looked exactly like me.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
How is that possible?

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,840
How could there be someone

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,050
exactly the same in this world?

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,680
He Fang,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
your condition must be acting up again.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
I really saw him.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
Anyway, we've got the investment.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,040
You should just rest well.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,600
Mr. Chen's investment

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
is all set?

31
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,680
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,880
It's your big brother,

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,920
Jin Haochen.

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,480
Isn't he going to invest in us?

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,320
Jin Haochen?

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,160
He Fang, why didn't you mention this earlier?

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Why bother with Jin Xiao?

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
We should ask your brother for help directly.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,440
I feel like I've seen him before.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,640
If you can't remember, don't force it.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Right?

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,600
Let's go have a drink.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,960
Fight fire with fire.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
Did you prepare all this?

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
So, Miss Mi,

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,720
do you like it?

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
It's just okay.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
Here, please.

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
(What is he doing?)

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
(Is he going to confess?)

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Mi Ke,

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
today...

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,640
I'll go first.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
I'm ready.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,280
You go ahead.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Miss Mi,

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,720
since we first met,

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
you've always been

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
trying your best to help me.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,160
And I have never

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,680
formally said to you,

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,040
thank you.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
That's it?

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,040
You said

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,200
we're on the same boat.

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,720
Just business partners, that's all.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
Right. I kept my word, didn't I?

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
But I want to say,

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
you're a very special person

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,120
in my heart.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
If you could

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
give me a chance,

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,440
we could be more than partners.

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,880
Well,

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,160
what do you want us

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
to be?

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
I hope...

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
Mi Ke.

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
Mi Ke.

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Wake up, Mi Ke.

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
Why are you spacing out?

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
It's nothing.

83
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,120
This... this wine is too strong.

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,120
What did you just say?

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
I prepared

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,160
a very special gift for you.

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
A gift?

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,360
Wuhuarou?!

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Why is it again?

90
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
I can't take care of it.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Take a closer look.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Here. Here.

93
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,000
Open this up.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
- What?
- You'll know the answer.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Wuhuarou!

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Wuhuarou!

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,880
Wuhuarou?

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,650
What's wrong with you?

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Did you mess up again?

100
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
It's fine.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,880
You can stay here with me today.

102
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
He Fang,

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,320
why are you chasing the pig everywhere?

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,360
What's more important,

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
the pig or me?

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

107
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
He Fang.

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Sit down.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,840
Jin Haochen came to Binhai today.

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
But he didn't meet me.

111
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
Why did he decide to invest?

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,840
He Fang,

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
you're haunted.

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
Let's do it this way.

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll go to Kim's Group myself.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
You can't go.

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
Why not?

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,600
Look at your current state.

119
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
Sometimes you remember.

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,320
Sometimes you don't.

121
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,760
You shouldn't overwork your brain.

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
What if you become a fool?

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
You're the fool here.

124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
So he needs to rest properly.

125
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
Going to Kim's Group

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
doesn't require much thinking.

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,520
Jin Haochen

128
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,800
is in a hurry to go abroad.

129
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
So he's not in the office lately.

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Wait until he returns.

131
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,360
Alright.

132
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,240
I see.

133
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll give him a call then.

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Give me his number.

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
I don't have it.

136
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,080
Really, I don't.

137
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,200
He's already gone abroad.

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
He won't answer your call.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,700
Just wait till he's back.

140
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,440
I wanted to discuss investments with him.

141
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,200
You're a patient now.

142
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
Why overthink it?

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Right, just rest well for now.

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,800
You have a follow-up tomorrow.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
I'll handle the pigs today.

146
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,700
Thanks for your hard work.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
No problem.

148
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,060
(Wang Dalu: Answer the phone! Urgent!)

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Wuhuarou!

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,520
Wuhuarou!

151
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Wuhuarou!

152
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,840
Never thought we'd meet

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,680
like this again.

154
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,120
What are you doing here?

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
I need to clarify some things with you.

156
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,720
Mr. Jin,

157
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
I came to apologize.

158
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,560
Whether you believe it or not,

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
I was forced into doing those things.

161
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
Gather the surgery fee quickly.

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,280
It can't be delayed.

163
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,420
(Mengcheng Central Hospital, MR Report)

164
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,440
Have you forgotten

165
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
that your mom

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,240
is still in the hospital's ICU?

167
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
She needs me.

168
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
Only I can save her.

169
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,440
Miss Fang,

170
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,280
your honey-trap failed.

171
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,560
Trying the sympathy card now?

172
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Your medical skills are average.

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,480
But your acting is top-notch.

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,560
How about this?

175
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
You jump.

176
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,680
If you jump, I'll forgive you.

177
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm unable to swim.

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,680
That's not much of an apology.

179
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Forget it.

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,520
You really jump?

181
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
My earring.

182
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,080
That's my favorite earring.

183
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
Jin Xiao.

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Jin Xiao.

185
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
Don't come closer.

186
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
There's a snake here.

187
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Jin Xiao.

188
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Jin Xiao.

189
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Are you okay?

190
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,080
Are you alright?

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
Fang Yutong,

192
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,400
you lied to me again.

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Sorry, I came to apologize.

194
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
I really don't know

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
why there is a snake in the water.

196
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Just leave.

197
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
I don't want to see you again.

198
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,820
You've been bitten by a snake.

199
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Be sure to stay calm.

200
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
Or the venom will spread.

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Thank you for saving me.

202
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,200
I know you didn't want me to die.

203
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,600
The person behind you

204
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
wants to kill me.
