3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,900
(Starting with a Negative)

4
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Fang Yutong,

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,760
despite what you did before,

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,680
it's all in the past now.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
This time,

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
thank you.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
Don't thank me.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,040
You should thank

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,040
Mr. He.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,280
This is nothing to me.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,240
He... He...

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,520
You...

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,080
I've been to Binhai.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,280
You... What did you go to Binhai for?

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Miss Fang,

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,440
feel free to speak your mind.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,160
There's another Jin Xiao in Binhai,

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
called He Fang.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
You two look exactly the same.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,200
We look exactly the same?

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,080
What a coincidence!

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,240
You look exactly the same.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,120
- What a coincidence!
- How is that possible?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
That's impossible.

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Since you asked me to be straightforward,

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,320
you two should stop hiding things.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,040
The real Jin Xiao has lost her memory.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,480
You've hidden him in Binhai.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
And you are He Fang.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm not.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
Yes,

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,480
he is indeed He Fang.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
How did you...

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
If she really wanted to harm you,

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
she wouldn't help you against Jin Haochen.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Miss Mi is indeed clever.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
Whether you're Jin Xiao or not,

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,720
I just want Jin Haochen

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,960
to pay a heavy price.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
I didn't quite understand.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,920
What do you mean?

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
Whether you are Jin Xiao

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,440
has nothing to do with me.

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,160
We share a common enemy.

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
Spreading rumors

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,920
is easy.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,880
Why should we trust you?

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,640
All vendors at Binhai Market

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
have been closed for rectification.

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,160
You should know that.

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
If Jin Haochen's investment funds

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,080
are not in place,

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,080
the real Jin Xiao will be here very soon.

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,480
Jin Haochen's compensation

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,920
has not been delivered

58
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,360
to us yet.

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,720
He agreed so readily.

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,920
When will he give it to us?

61
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,840
No, he couldn't have

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,080
seen through our plan, right?

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,640
Why don't you pay the money?

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,760
I don't have the money!

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,400
Even though he's the young master,

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,960
according to the financial process,

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,040
accessing such a large sum of money

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
isn't easy.

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Yes.

70
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
I can't come up with the money.

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,720
I can't stop the acquisition either.

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm so useless.

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,960
I have a plan.

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,240
But after it's done,

75
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
I want 10% commission.

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
I have my own struggles too.

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,640
Your recent actions

78
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,080
are testing my limits.

79
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,640
(Kim's Group stock drops)
Look at how

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,880
the company's stock has fallen.

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,280
Can you control yourself?

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll figure it out, Dad.

83
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,840
I'll give you three days.

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
You must answer to the shareholders.

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,160
Or get out of the company.

86
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Alright.

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,680
Darn it!

88
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,840
He forgot his own past mistakes.

89
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Mr. Jin,

90
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,080
your invitation.

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
What invitation?

92
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Not sure.

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
Someone just delivered it.

94
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Alright, you can go.

95
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,980
(Invitation)

96
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,000
Jin Xiao, what are you up to now?

97
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,680
It's a mistake.

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,080
It's such a big event.

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
They didn't write it clearly.

100
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,560
(To Mr. Mi Qingyun
Mengcheng Charity Auction Night)

101
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Charity Dinner?

102
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
Mi Ke's dad gave it to me.

103
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,240
He said it's a charity auction.

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
It aims to fund remote mountain areas.

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,320
It's a small cost for big impact.

106
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,990
Don't you think it's better

107
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,760
than spending on ads?

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,880
The company and personal fame

109
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
- instantly skyrocket.
- Let me see.

110
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,120
Alright, I'm going.

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,880
(This is actually a good opportunity.)

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
(He took the bite.)

113
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,860
What are you guys doing?

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
There's an auction.

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Kim's Group said

116
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
they would auction off our old items

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,320
and donate the money to us.

118
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,800
Kim's Group?

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
What is this?

120
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,370
A slop bucket.

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Will someone

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
buy these junk items?

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
Brother, Mom.

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
You guys came too.

125
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,160
Xiao, our family

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
is the business leader in Mengcheng.

127
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Of course I had to come.

128
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,600
That's right.

129
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,480
Please show your invitation.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
I am Jin Xiao from Kim's Group.

131
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,840
No invitation, no entry.

132
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,840
Don't you recognize me?

133
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,120
Son-in-law,

134
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,120
you are dressed

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
very ceremonially today.

136
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Father-in-law,

137
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,560
I don't have an invitation.

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,000
No problem.

139
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,000
This is my invitation.

140
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
He is my son-in-law.

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
We're together.

142
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
- Sir, please.
- Let's go.

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
The first item

144
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,190
(Charity Auction)
we are auctioning today

145
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
is this three-legged golden toad.

146
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
About this golden toad,

147
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,240
there is a touching love story.

148
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
It is said that the owner

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,690
is a stay-at-home mom.

150
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
- Although
- Quick.

151
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,080
she has a family heirloom,

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,420
- Why so late?
- the couple endured hardships.

153
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,140
- I just saw...
- They made a living by running a shop.

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,600
They never bowed down to life.

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Alright, let's start now.

156
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
The starting price is 2,000 yuan.

157
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
5,000.

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,320
Okay, 5,000.

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
10,000.

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
10,000.

161
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
It's already 10,000?

162
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
Mom, it's not just a golden toad,

163
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
but a good reputation.

164
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,760
100,000.

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
300,000.

166
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
300,000.

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Haochen,

168
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
let us elders

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
show love.

170
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
It's fine.

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,280
500,000.

172
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,360
It's 500,000 now.

173
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,950
- Mr. Jin is so generous.
- Indeed.

174
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,800
Mr. Mi,

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
before raising the bid next time,

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
think

177
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,860
about your company's financial situation.

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Dad.

179
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Your task today is to be the shill.

180
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Don't get carried away.

181
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
500,000, first.

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
500,000, second.

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
500,000.

184
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Last chance!

185
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Sold!

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,480
Next item is

187
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
the dark iron kitchen knife.

188
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,120
I bid 800,000.

189
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
iPhone 99.

190
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,490

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
The final item for today's auction.

198
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,280
This is a wooden barrel

199
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,640
Two million for a broken bucket.

206
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,780
Let him have it.

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
We're almost done.

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
How could I let Jin Xiao win?

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
Any more bids?

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200

Three million.

212

The two sons of Kim's Group

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
are truly generous.

214
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Any bids

215
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
higher than three million?

216
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,890
- Enough.

congratulations!

222
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
You're amazing!

223
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
Come on, come on.

224
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
Here.

225
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,280

226
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,880
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

227
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
What do you think

228
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
Jin Haochen is feeling

229
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
with all that junk?

230
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
This is worth it.

231
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
They cost me ten million.

232
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Jin Xiao,

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
I hold the knife

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
and you're the fish.

235
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,400
Come, cheers!

236
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,040
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,800
Just drinking alcohol

238
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,720
is boring.

239
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
How about this?

240
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,840
Let's play a game.

241
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,960
Truth or Dare.

242
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
That's so childish.

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Not at all.

244
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Come on.

245
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,380
Mi Ke.

246
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Truth or Dare?

247
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,280
Truth, truth.

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Mi Ke.

249
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
Who did you give

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
your first kiss to?

251
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
So intense, huh?

252
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
Wang, Wang Dalu.

253
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Ask a different question.

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
No.

255
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
We must follow the rules.

256
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,200
Take it step by step.

257
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,800
Mi Ke is Jin Xiao's fiancée.

258
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
She must give her first kiss to Jin Xiao.

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,060
That may not be the case.

260
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,710
Isn't there a guy named

261
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
- Gu...
- You...!

262
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Alright, let me change the question.

263
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,440
Alright, I'll take a penalty sip.

264
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,680
Boring.

265
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
Alright, pass.

266
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
Done.

267
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
My turn now.

268
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Alright.

269
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Miss Zuo,

270
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
do you

271
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
have someone you like?

272
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
I...

273
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,320
Do you?

274
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,760
Your face is all red.

275
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,080
Seems like you do.

276
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
No.

277
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,760
Then why are you drinking?

278
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
Right, you already answered.

279
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I like drinking, alright?

280
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
Alright, it's your turn.

281
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Mr. Jin,

282
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,560
you...

283
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440
Hurry up.

284
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,520
Have you eaten yet?

285
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,620
What kind of question is that?

286
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,340
I ate, I ate, I ate.

287
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,380
Let me, let me, let me.

288
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,040
How about this? I'll ask a question.

289
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
- No, no, no.
- Alright, you ask him.

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
Alright, go ahead.

291
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Jin Xiao,

292
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,760
among all the girls here,

293
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
who's the most important to you?

294
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,000
Rank them.

295
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,920
First place is definitely Mi Ke.

296
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,760
What about second?

297
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400
Well, second is...

298
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Second...?

299
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,640
Second is...

300
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
Wuhuarou.

301
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
Wuhuarou.

302
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Does Wuhuarou count as a girl?

303
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Why wouldn't

304
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,920
Wuhuarou be a girl?

305
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,200
Yes, yes, yes.

306
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Come on, have a drink.

307
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Alright, go back to the room

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
and sleep...

309
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,480
Get up, get up, get up.

310
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,560
I... I can fly!

311
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,760
- What nonsense!
- Fly... flying!

312
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,280
- I can't stand you.
- I can fly!

313
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,970
Fly!

314
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Fly... fly!

315
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,120
Be careful!

316
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,040
Ladies, please spare me!

317
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Come on, lift your leg.

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,370
Who?

319
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Why did you kick me?

320
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,290
Pervert!

322
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
It's not like that.

323
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,280
I can explain.

324
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
