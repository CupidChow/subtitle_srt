00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,360
Excuse me. Your take-out is here.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,480
Here. Here.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,600
Hurry up.

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,700
We are fellow townsmen.

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,200
Remember to give a five-star review.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,360
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Get out now.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,320
- Get out.
- Please, enjoy your meal.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Hu,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,880
this is really good.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Hu, give it a try.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,680
What's wrong, Hu?

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,200
You little rascal.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,280
I'm from Sichuan.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,160
I don't eat spicy.

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,460
Sorry, Hu.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,800
I forgot you're from Sichuan.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
Try this soup instead.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,690
This soup isn't spicy.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,890
It's really delicious.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
Try it.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
Hu, I feel something is off

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
with this dish.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
I feel dizzy, Hu.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,000
You dare poison me, you rascal!

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
Zuo Yemei.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,800
Zuo Yemei. Zuo Yemei.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,590
- Zuo Yemei, wake up.
- Who are you?

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,040
It's me.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
- Mr. Jin.
- Are you okay?

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Are you alright?

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,920
- Where's Mi Ke?
- She's on the rooftop.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Let's go. I've dealt with of them.

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
Mi Ke.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
He Fang...

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
Mi Ke.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
It's over now.

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,580
Let's head back first.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Let's go back.

42
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,920
I've already asked Butler Liang

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
to pack my things up.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
I'll move out soon.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm already in this state.

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,840
Can't you stay

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,760
and take care of me?

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,700
You don't lack people to care for you.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,080
Besides, I'm not so shameless

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,480
that I still stay at your house

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,600
after the engagement's off.

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
That day, I...

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Let's not talk about it now.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
Jin Haochen didn't succeed this time.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
He won't give up easily.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
He didn't walk away empty-handed.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,160
What do you mean?

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
I gave your family's shares

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,520
to him.

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,720
What?

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
If they ran, let them run.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
I was just playing along with them.

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,660
Transfer the money to my private account.

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Sell the shares.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440
I'm afraid we can't.

67
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Why not?

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,480
(Signed by Mi Qingshan and He Fang)
He Fang signed this contract.

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
And the contract states,

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
Mihua transfers the shares to Mi Ke.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
But they're not married yet.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
It doesn't count as marital property.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
So this contract

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
is legally invalid.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
It's He Fang again.

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Haochen,

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,160
you were careless.

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Shut up.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
I didn't expect you

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
to become so smart now.

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,060
A great teacher makes a great student.

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,620
It's all thanks to your teaching.

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
Aren't you afraid Jin Haochen will find out

84
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
and turn against us?

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,260
Those who think they control everything

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,660
are the easiest to get careless.

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
He's too confident.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
He believes

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
as long as he has you in his grasp,

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,340
I won't dare to play tricks.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
This point

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,980
was also taught by you.

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,920
How can you still laugh?

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,920
Miss Zuo.

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
Thank you.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Don't thank me.

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
Mr. Jin is still missing.

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
Are you feeling relieved?

99
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
So you already knew.

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,920
If I had exposed you earlier,

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,200
Mr. Jin wouldn't...

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
Jin Xiao...

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
What exactly happened to him?

104
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,680
He was taken by Jin Haochen's men.

105
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,040
To find evidence of Jin Haochen's crimes

106
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,880
and protect you all as well,

107
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,440
he didn't tell Master Jin

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,640
the whole truth.

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
Now he's missing.

110
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
How can you still

111
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
feel so at ease here?

112
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,400
There's something

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
I can't tell you right now.

114
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
But please trust me.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,800
Trust you?

116
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Because I trusted you too much,

117
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
so I spoke up for you with Mr. Jin.

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
I said you're a good person.

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
But what did you do?

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,840
You knew the Binhai Project had issues,

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,490
but you still signed a contract with them.

122
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
You betrayed your once closest friends.

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Jin Haochen used you to threaten me.

124
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,360
I had no choice but to obey him.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
I know.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
I take responsibility for his actions.

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
Do whatever you want with me.

128
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
But not right now.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,880
Now I must take down Jin Haochen myself.

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
Take down Jin Haochen?

131
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,280
There's no evidence left now.

132
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,680
How will you take him down?

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,440
Next week, my wedding with Mi Ke

134
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,200
is the death date of Jin Haochen.

135
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,120
Are you ready?

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Don't be nervous.

137
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,960
It's fine, I can handle it myself.

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
You'll getting married.

139
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
Can't you give me this right?

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Thanks.

141
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Although

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,520
this is Jin Xiao and Mi Ke's

143
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
nominal wedding,

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
the person I truly want to marry

145
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,700
- is...
- I understand.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
We'll still face

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
more challenges ahead.

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,560
So if

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,120
you regret it now,

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
- it's not late.
- I don't regret it.

151
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
Hello?

152
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
What?

153
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

154
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,120
respected guests,

155
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
let's give a warm applause

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
to

157
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,280
the newlyweds.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
Alright.

159
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,000
I got it.

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,160
What's up, He Fang?

161
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Mi Ke,

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
He Fang...

164
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,600
He...

165
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960
The groom might be a bit shy.

166
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,880
Guests, let's give another round of applause

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
to the groom.

168
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
Smash it!

169
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,720
What are you doing? Stop hitting.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,900
Stop it!

171
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,910
Stop, stop, stop!

172
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,600
- Don't hit him.
- Stop hitting!

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
You dare hit me?

174
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm Jin Xiao.

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,800
Mr. Jin asked me to deliver a message.

176
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Happy Wedding.

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
Take a good look.

178
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,160
See their faces clearly.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
This situation today

180
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,040
is all your doing.

181
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,600
Stop!

182
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
Stop!

183
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,280
- Stop it.
- Stop hitting.

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,560
What's going on?

185
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Where's the groom?

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
If you ask me,

187
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,960
it must be the bride

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
who did something wrong.

189
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,800
She made Jin Xiao leave.

190
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,580
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,140
I'll sew your mouth shut, believe it?

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. Mi,

193
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,520
what's your role today?

194
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
Speaking like this

195
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,900
isn't appropriate, right?

196
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
You better understand

197
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
it's your son who didn't show up.

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
I saw it with my own eyes

199
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,680
Jin Xiao cheerfully went to the back.

200
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,040
If you ask me,

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,120
maybe Mi Ke

202
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
did something shameful

203
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
and drove my son away.

204
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,120
- You...!
- Enough!

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
Their family is not afraid of losing face,

206
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
but our family is.

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
Zhenghao,

208
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
let's go back first.

209
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
We'll settle this later.

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm here.

211
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,520
Why are you still here?

212
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
Haochen,

213
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,560
