=Episode 21=

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,400
After the car accident,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,200
He Fang is in Mengcheng

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,160
and Jin Xiao in Binhai.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,320
This means

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Jin Xiao

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,960
remembered he is Jin Xiao.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,000
But He Fang

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,120
doesn't want to be He Fang anymore?

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,440
Could it be

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
the real He Fang kidnapped the fake one

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,640
and the fake Jin Xiao became the real one?

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,720
Oh my god.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
But,

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,760
from what I know about He Fang,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
he wouldn't do something so unethical.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,290
Then where is He Fang?

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,720
No, where is Jin Xiao?

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,760
Jin Xiao

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
can never survive.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,360
What about that bodyguard?

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,200
We've tied her up.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,200
She's been with Jin Xiao for so long.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,760
Maybe she knows something useful for us.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,720
Great!

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
Jin Xiao, oh Jin Xiao,

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,760
have I regressed

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,320
or have you regressed?

30
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,920
- Mr. Jin.
- The cooperation with Qilin Chamber,

31
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,560
- Look, what's going on?
- We believe

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
will benefit both companies' future growth

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,700
(Jin Xiao, Vice President)
and will also bring more

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,870
(Kim's Group)
economic and cultural growth to the city.

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
This...

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,120
This, what's happening?

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
Didn't you say he was dead?

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
Impossible.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
That's impossible!

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Even if he's not dead,

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
he should be severely injured.

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,440
How did he work with Zhuo Lan so quickly?

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
That's impossible.

44
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,670
Son.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
Mom.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Brother.

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
Jin Xiao.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,290
- You're here.
- What are you doing here?

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
He Fang.

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
He Fang.

51
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980
(Charity Auction)

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Here.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Jin Xiao.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
Haochen.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
There's someone so similar.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Mr. Jin.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Mr. Jin.

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
Master Jin is back.

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
So sudden?!

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320
He knows you facilitated

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,880
the cooperation with Qilin Chamber.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,080
He is very satisfied,

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,880
so he decided to return early

64
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,240
to meet with Chairman Zhuo.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
What about Mi Ke?

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
She's handling the details of the deal

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
at the company.

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,080
She can't accompany you to pick up Sir.

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
And Zuo Yemei?

70
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
Why haven't I seen her lately?

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,240
She hasn't been around lately.

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,920
Do I have to leave right now?

73
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,880
(Wang Dalu; Incoming call)

74
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,050
Hello?

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
He Fang,

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,560
Jin Xiao hasn't been home for days.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,540
- Jiang is looking for him.
- He didn't...

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
Everyone knows the truth now.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Everyone?

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Alright.

81
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,920
I understand the situation.

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,980
I'll talk to you later.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Who are you?

84
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,560
What do you want from me?

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm in a hurry to pick up Dad.

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
What are you looking at?

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,600
You're really identical.

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't be nervous.

89
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,280
In a moment,

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll go with you to see Dad.

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
No wonder everyone knew you

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
last time in Binhai.

93
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,800
I am too careless.

94
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
I was fooled by a pig farmer for so long.

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,280
You're quite something.

96
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
He Fang.

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
I don't get what you mean.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,540
I don't understand what you're saying.

99
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,320
It's fine if you don't get it.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
I guess

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
it is because of that car accident.

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,640
It caused my brother

103
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
to Binhai to raise pigs.

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
You...

105
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
I did you a huge favor.

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
You should thank me.

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
What do you mean?

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Jin Xiao has vanished from this world.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Only I know

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,480
about your identity.

111
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
Haven't you noticed

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
someone's missing around you?

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
Zuo Yemei?

114
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,700
What have you done to her?

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,280
Her life

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
is in your hands.

117
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Not just her life.

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Whether in Binhai or Mengcheng,

119
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,620
whoever I'm looking for,

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
I'll always find them.

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,480
As long as you behave.

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,760
Come on, play a few rounds.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,080
Dad, you're back.

124
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
Dad.

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
You've lost weight.

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Dad.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
This is the summary of all projects

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,860
for the three months you were away.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm aware

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
of company matters.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
You two did a great job.

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Dad.

133
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,840
About the Binhai Project,

134
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,520
Jin Xiao has finished the survey.

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,940
We can sign the contract soon.

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Right, Jin Xiao?

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,800
The initial phase is almost done.

138
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Good.

139
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,980
Then arrange to sign the contract soon.

140
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,380
I can take this chance

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
to see

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
your abilities.

143
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Alright.

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Anything else?

145
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes, a small thing.

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Go ahead.

147
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
Dad,

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
the company's been too busy.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
After the car accident,

150
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
I haven't fully recovered.

151
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
The doctor suggested

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
I take some time off.

153
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,960
So, do you think

154
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
if I can hand over my current tasks

155
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,040
to my brother temporarily?

156
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
Is this your idea?

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
Alright.

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,940
After the Binhai Project contract is signed,

159
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,480
you can take a break.

160
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Thanks, Dad.

161
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
And also,

162
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,800
your wedding with Mi Ke

163
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
should be arranged soon.

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
Alright.

165
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
(Binhai Town Old Street
Renovation Project begins)

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
(Resort Renovation Project)

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,980
(Binhai Town Old Street enters a new chapter)

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Isn't that He Fang?

169
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,160
- He...
- He really betrayed us.

170
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,600
This real estate project

171
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,240
refers to Binhai here, doesn't it?

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,560
He traitor!

173
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,600
To become the Jin Family's young master,

174
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
he sold us all out.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,330
He Fang isn't that kind of person.

176
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,220
What do you know?

177
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,280
Answer the phone!

178
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
No, I have to go find him.

179
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm going too.

180
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,620
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

181
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,400
I've done everything you asked.

182
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,640
Can you let Zuo Yemei go now?

183
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
If only my brother

184
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,360
were as obedient as you,

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,300
things would be easier.

186
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
What else do you want?

187
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I haven't decided yet.

188
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,360
But compared to him,

189
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I like you more.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
Why don't you keep acting?

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,760
Aren't you afraid I'll call the police?

192
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Call the police?

193
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,160
Do you want your friends

194
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
to end up like Jin Xiao?

195
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,500
You...!

196
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,580
Besides, calling the police

197
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,840
requires evidence. Do you have any?

198
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,880
But I do.

199
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,320
I have proof you faked my brother.

200
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
Contracts you handled total billions, right?

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,560
This fraud amount

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,240
could land you in prison for life.

203
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,500
(Grilled oysters; pig trotters; wheat gluten)

204
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,750
You're still drinking?

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
He Fang,

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
you're no longer my brother.

207
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm Jin Xiao.

208
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,800
He Fang has his reasons.

209
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Reasons?

210
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,080
He has his reasons?

211
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
Didn't you hear him?

212
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,160
He's Young Master Jin Xiao now.

213
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,560
Wealthy and influential.

214
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
Why would he care about us poor people?

215
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Exactly.

216
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,200
He Fang, explain it to them.

217
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,040
Say it.

218
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,590
Why did you agree to sign the contract?

219
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Say it.

220
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
You can't explain it, huh?

221
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
If you can't, then stop talking.

222
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,680
Consider me blind.

223
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
I trusted the wrong person.

224
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
How about this?

225
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
After I finish this matter,

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
I'll talk to you when I come back.

227
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,210
Is that okay?

228
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,100
Come back?

229
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
Don't come back.

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
We don't want to see you again.

231
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,600
We don't need you anymore.

232
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,400
Let's go.

233
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,960
Why didn't you explain?

234
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
He Fang, I just want to ask you one thing.

235
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,640
Where's Jin Xiao?

236
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm asking you where Jin Xiao is.

237
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
I really don't know.

238
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,300
Mr. Jin said the wedding
will be held next week.

239
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,640
He wanted to know my thoughts.

240
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,360
Why are you drinking so much?

241
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
What's wrong with you?

242
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm fine.

243
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
You go first.

244
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Jin asked me to pick a date.

245
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,680
I've already checked.

246
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Next Wednesday is a great day.

247
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
The Chinese almanac,

248
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
the weather,

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,240
everything looks perfect.

250
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
- So...
- Next week?

251
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
In such a hurry?

252
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,440
Yes, I know it's urgent.

253
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
Don't feel pressured.

254
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,200
It's okay.

255
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
After all,

256
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
it's a contractual marriage.

257
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
We don't have to...

258
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
I'll clarify it with him.

259
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,760
Alright, you talk to Mr. Jin.

260
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm flexible with time.

261
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,880
I'm the one calling off the engagement.

262
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,200
It has nothing to do with you.

263
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
And it won't involve your Mi Family.

264
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
What do you mean?

265
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,160
The Binhai issue is resolved.

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
Your family's crisis

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
is also over.

268
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,080
We were just partners.

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The partnership

270
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,720
should end now.

271
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Partners?

272
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,600
He Fang,

273
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,600
what are you talking about?

274
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,800
Are you drunk or something?

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
You're talking nonsense.

276
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,120
I know exactly what I'm saying.

277
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,520
And so do you.

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
From now on,

279
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
I won't bother you anymore.

280
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,160
Thank you

281
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,980
for this period of time.

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Alright.

283
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
I also thank you.

284
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll make it clear to my dad.

285
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Do you want those around you

286
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,480
