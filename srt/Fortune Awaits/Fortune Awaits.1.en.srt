=Episode 1=

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,920
On today's business stage,

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,160
Kim's Group shows remarkable growth.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,120
Behind this golden, magnificent door,

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,760
a storm is quietly gathering.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
The rivalry between Kim's Group's two heirs

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
concerns the fate of the entire group.

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,180
Mr. Jin, something happened in Binhai.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
Go check it out.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,660
(Demolition Site at Binhai Town)

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,640
What are you doing?

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,860
(Driver's Home)

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,080
Hu! Hu!

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,760
Mr. Jin Xiao is here.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,340
(Binhai Town Market)

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,800
Young Master Jin Xiao is here.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
If you offend him, you're done for.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,880
Retreat!

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Mr. Jin,

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,160
we didn't send anyone.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,280
Jin Haochen is really in a hurry.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,720
- He Fang.
- He Fang.

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,940
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Where are you going?

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
Get out here!

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Get out of the car!

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Listen to me.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,360
I don't hit women.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,200
I...

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
- Stop it!
- He Fang!

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's go.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,680
- He Fang.
- He Fang.

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,830
Get up quickly.

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,520
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Jin Xiao,

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
you'll regret this.

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,720
(Report on the Binhai Project)

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Mr. Jin,

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,520
they must be sent by your brother

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,620
to stir up trouble in town.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
Jin Haochen has disliked me for a while.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Don't worry about it.

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,120
But we need

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,080
to acquire this land soon.

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Understood.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,480
- Go check it out.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
Oh my!

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
What's wrong with you?

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,600
You hit my leg!

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
You can't leave.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Mr. Jin.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,880
You are...?

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Let me introduce myself.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm He Fang.

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,320
You sent people to demolish today, right?

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
I'm not here for compensation.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I just don't want to move.

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
But,

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,360
you owe me for damages and medical fees

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,440
and then apologize in person.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Jin Xiao.

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Jin Xiao.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Who are you?

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,580
Why are you touching me?

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,040
Taking advantage of me?

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
You've got some nerve, Jin Xiao.

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,160
Shameless!

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Where is this place?

71
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,440
Welcome home, Mr. Jin.

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
Mr. Jin?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Mr. Jin,

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
you're awake.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Well,

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,800
who are you all?

77
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Mr. Jin, what's wrong with you?

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,600
The pigs haven't been fed.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
I need to hurry back.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,820
Pigs?

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Your...

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Your brain is hurt?

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Why is it you?

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
Forget it, I won't settle this now.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
The pigs are hungry. They're still growing.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Move aside.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,960
Good day, Mr. Jin.

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Good day, Mr. Jin.

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
(That Mr. Jin is really cunning.)

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
(He wants to kidnap me to threaten others.)

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
Mr. Jin.

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,680
I want to see Jin Xiao.

93
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,480
Jin Xiao?

94
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Didn't the doctor say he is alright?

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
What's going on?

96
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Amnesia?

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,480
Car accident?

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
No, no, no.

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
We look exactly the same.

100
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
Well...

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,200
This doesn't make sense.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,080
Did you remember something?

103
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
What about after the car accident?

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,680
What happened then?

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
- He Fang!
- He Fang!

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,720
He Fang!

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,280
- He Fang!
- He Fang!

108
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,080
He Fang!

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,680
Wake up, He Fang.

110
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,180
- Sorry, you can't.
- He Fang!

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,880
(In surgery)

112
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,420
(Bedside card: Neurosurgery, Jin Xiao)

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,200
- He Fang.
- Step aside.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm Mr. Jin's personal bodyguard.

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,580
I'm taking him to another hospital.

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Kangxin Hospital will coordinate with you.

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
This isn't allowed.

119
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
You're not equipped to treat Mr. Jin.

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,240
Here he is, here he is.

121
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,600
What? Trying to run away?

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,180
I'm telling you, it's not that easy.

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Your master is fine.

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,480
But my friend is unconscious.

125
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Exactly.

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
Listen to me.

127
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,460
Until we sort this out today,

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,240
no one's leaving.

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,040
What? You wanna fight?

130
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm warning you,

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
I never hit women.

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't believe me? Try it.

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Ouch, ouch.

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,240
How could you hit someone?

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
- Just wait.
- Don't run!

136
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
Don't run away!

137
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,760
That's how it happened.

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,240
(So they mistook me for Jin Xiao.)

139
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,840
(We really look exactly the same?)

140
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,160
Mr. Jin, rest assured.

141
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,040
Master Jin will return from abroad

142
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
in three months.

143
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,200
You have the top bodyguard,

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,640
Miss Zuo, escorting you.

145
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
Such incidents won't happen again.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Actually,

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm not...

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Forget it.

149
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
I have something to do.

150
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I really need to leave.

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Son,

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
my dear son!

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,960
How are you doing?

154
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,200
My poor son.

155
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,020
- Where are you hurt?
- Brother, are you okay?

156
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,780
Let me see.

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
(Brother?)

158
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,090
(Jin Xiao has an older brother?)

159
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,840
(Then this woman)

160
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,760
(is his mother?)

161
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Madam, Mr. Jin, don't worry.

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
The doctor has checked.

163
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
There's no health issue.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
Everyone,

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
actually, I'm really not...

166
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,520
Since everything's fine,

167
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
sign the document.

168
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,780
Everyone's waiting for you.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
(Binhai Land Development Project.)

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
(Then can I...?)

171
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Son, what's wrong?

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Mom.

173
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Bro.

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm glad you're here.

175
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,520
I... I...

176
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
My head and stomach hurt.

177
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,360
My arm...

178
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
My arm hurts too.

179
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,760
I can't sign this.

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,720
Maybe...

181
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,370
Let's put it aside for now.

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
You...

183
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
Young Master Jin Xiao's head was injured.

184
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
The doctor said

185
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
he needs rest.

186
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,760
That's right.

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,040
My brother

188
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,560
is having great luck.

189
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
He's pulled through such a big ordeal.

190
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,560
Jin Xiao, get some rest.

191
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
I'll visit you another day.

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
I hope from now on,

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,440
you'll always

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,990
turn misfortune into good fortune.

195
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Alright.

196
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
You all can leave too.

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
If anything happens,

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,680
call me anytime.

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
It's such a big car accident.

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
He's completely unharmed.

201
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,560
Unbelievable.

202
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,760
This is indeed strange.

203
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
Not sure what tricks he's up to.

204
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Son,

205
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
no need to rush.

206
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
Since he's not well,

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,520
let him rest properly

208
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
at home.

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Mr. Jin.

210
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,280
Useless fool!

211
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,750
Get out.

212
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

213
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
Do they really think I'm Jin Xiao?

214
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,320
Then maybe I can

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,800
abolish the acquisition plan.

216
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Tomorrow will be better.

217
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
(Annual gala)
Tonight, we'll camp out.

218
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't doubt, don't hesitate.

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
You are the next lucky one.

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
Wish you good Luck.

221
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,600
Since I am here,

222
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,600
I should make myself at home.

223
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
Will you stay with me in the future?

224
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
You serve me.

225
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
A bit higher.

226
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,560
Higher, a bit higher.

227
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Use more strength. Are you weak?

228
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,610
You call yourself a bodyguard?

229
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,400
What are you doing?

230
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

231
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
I was too rough.

232
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Mr. Jin.

233
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,360
What are you doing?

234
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,600
- Let me fix your arm.
- Back!

235
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
Let me help you.

236
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Mr. Jin.

237
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,080
Mr. Jin.

238
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
This is life.

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,600
Luck is finally on my side.

240
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,460
(Outpatient)

241
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,240
He Fang.

242
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,480
You're awake.

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760
He Fang.

244
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
You...

245
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
