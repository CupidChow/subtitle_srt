3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,640
Jin Haochen?

4
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
You, let me go!

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,800
Let me go!

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
Let go!

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,580
The more you struggle, the more I like it.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,520
Was it you?

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
You...

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,280
Didn't you go to great lengths

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,380
to trick him into the water?

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,100
What does it have to do with me?

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
Do you realize

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,440
you're committing murder?

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,680
You've learned to record now.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
Isn't it you who's killing?

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
What does it have to do with me?

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,100
Do you have any proof?

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
No wonder your dad doesn't like you.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
You are really inferior to your brother.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
How do you dare

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,120
judge me?

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,360
Let me tell you,

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,600
I have all our videos.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
You've made me

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
very unhappy today.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,400
I might share them with others.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Imagine it.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,960
If your mom in the hospital

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,080
saw those videos,

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
will she...?

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm just kidding with you.

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm teasing you.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Give me a smile.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
You look best when you smile.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Smile for me.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,320
Yes.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
That's the look I love.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,000
You can go now.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,440
I don't want to see you lately.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
You're recovering well.

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Here, here, and here.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,100
Everything seems fine now.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Sometimes I can recall something.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,440
Other times I feel like

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm someone else.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you feel like a failure?

48
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,150
Yes.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,480
Do you think you should

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,900
have many beautiful women around?

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
Yes.

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Do you feel like you should be

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
financially free and adored by all?

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes.

55
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Me too.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,320
No, no, I understand you.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
That's just daydreaming.

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,040
Go back and observe for a while.

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,320
- Thanks, Doctor.
- Got it, Doctor.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
By the way,

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
this was left behind during your accident.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,500
I meant to return it to you.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
But you came just in time.

64
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,940
(Report on the Binhai Project)

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,420
It was my mistake last night.

66
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,800
I won't drink anymore.

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,860
This is my private matter.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,220
It has nothing to do with you.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
Mr. Jin.

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,500
Someone wants to see you.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,600
What are you doing?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,360
How did you find this place?

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,520
He Fang.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,640
What a big house!

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
You're living the good life.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
Get to the point. Hurry up.

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Jin Xiao is in trouble.

78
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
- He's dead?
- No, no, no.

79
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,040
We're waiting for his investment funds.

80
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,550
He wants to negotiate with Jin Haochen.

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,960
We can't let him meet Jin Haochen.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Then you provide the money.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
I don't have any money.

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
You live in such a big house.

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,450
How is it possible?

86
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,840
This house isn't mine.

87
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
Then stop the acquisition.

88
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,480
Anyway, we're attracting investment

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,520
to resist the acquisition.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
You're already Jin Xiao now.

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,620
Why don't you just directly

92
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,460
stop the acquisition?

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,520
I have an idea.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
But you have to cooperate with me.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll help you.

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,600
But

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,400
can you let me move in for two days?

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
Just two days?

99
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
Is that okay?

100
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,680
No way.

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,400
Absolutely not, I'm telling you.

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,380
I'm showing you respect,

103
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,560
so I came to Kim's Group.

104
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,720
If you can't satisfy us,

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
and want a refund,

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,960
there's no chance.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Mr. He,

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
we can be considered friends

109
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,080
with a bit of acquaintance.

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,280
Can we show each other some respect?

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
How much is respect worth?

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm telling you, I don't need respect.

113
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,440
I just want money.

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,300
But your demand

115
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,360
is completely unreasonable.

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,200
Bro,

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,120
what brings you here?

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,760
I heard Binhai's rep came to negotiate.

119
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,700
I came to check it out.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
You must be Mr. He from Binhai Pig Farm.

121
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
We've met before.

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
Don't try to cotton up to me.

123
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,780
Perfect, both of you brothers are here.

124
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,360
Hurry up, who's in charge?

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,440
Be quick about it.

126
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
What's going on?

127
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
Bro,

128
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
troublemakers

129
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,600
are always troublemakers.

130
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Aren't there a few merchants

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
on the Binhai land?

132
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
That's true.

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
Their lease isn't up yet.

134
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,840
We can just offer some compensation.

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I didn't expect him

136
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
to make a scene at the company.

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,560
He demanded a huge sum

138
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,920
and won't leave without money.

139
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,520
What does this have to do with us?

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,940
They should find whoever leased it.

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,760
No wonder they're troublemakers.

142
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
That's the logic behind it.

143
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
But look at him.

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
His attitude.

145
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,860
What are you staring at?

146
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
What does he want?

147
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,920
He wants

148
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,140
every household

149
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,280
to receive 50... one million

150
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,640
in housing subsidies,

151
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,080
and then after the land is developed,

152
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
each household will be given

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
two commercial properties

154
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,120
at the original site.

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And also,

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
they want us to sign

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
the exclusive agreement.

158
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
It means existing businesses

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
can't bring in competitors.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
Don't you think that's too much?

161
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,240
When has our Kim's Group

162
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
ever been treated like this?

163
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
If you ask me,

164
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,430
there's plenty of land out there.

165
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,240
Let's drop it.

166
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,720
Have you looked enough?

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,760
If you can't afford to demolish,

168
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,600
just drop it.

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
Didn't you say it is foolproof?

170
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm puzzled too.

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Why did he agree?

172
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,760
He's not following the script.

173
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,800
Let's talk later.

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
Stay happy.

175
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Dad,

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,400
did you not allow me

177
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
to get involved in company projects?

178
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
You need to understand,

179
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,800
the clients

180
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,360
want more than just our resources.

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
They still want to use us

182
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,440
to connect with Kim's Group.

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,120
Now that you're engaged to Jin Xiao,

184
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
you're the perfect candidate.

185
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,880
Miss Mi, the guest is here.

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,200
Let him in.

187
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Gu Chengze?

188
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Long time no see.

189
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
What?

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,480
Her ex-boyfriend!?

191
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,600
Don't get worked up.

192
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920
Sit down, please.

193
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,880
Just hear me out.

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
Those two, you see,

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,640
used to be in a relationship.

196
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
Mainly, that guy

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,920
was too good at sweet-talking.

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,440
He was always trying to make Ke happy,

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,640
either promising the stars

200
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
or the moon.

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
So,

202
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
they were meant to be a couple?

203
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
No, no.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,240
Then he suddenly went abroad to study.

205
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
As for their relationship,

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
it just fizzled out.

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Fizzled out?

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Does it mean

209
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
there's still a chance to reignite it?

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Well...

211
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,550
Then why did you

212
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
still let him

213
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,960
work with Mi Ke on the project?

214
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,040
That guy,

215
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
he...

216
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
I can guarantee

217
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
those two

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
are just

219
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,680
in a project partnership.

220
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,240
As for the other company,

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
they specified

222
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
Mi Ke as the contact person.

223
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
But who knew the person they sent

224
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,600
would be Gu Chengze?

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
But listen, Jin Xiao,

226
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,640
you should know,

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,960
in my eyes,

228
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,120
Gu Chengze

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,280
can't compare to you at all.

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
That's true.

231
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Well,

232
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
regarding the project progress,

233
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
I think

234
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
we can speed it up a bit.

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,340
- What do you think?
- Let's eat first.

236
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,200
I ordered all your favorites.

237
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,360
I have some other things to do later.

238
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
As for this contract,

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I made some revisions.

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,560
Take a look and see

241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
if it needs some adjustments.

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,320
You're still the same as before.

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,560
You always do things so directly.

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Do you remember?

245
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,840
This is where we first dated.

246
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Seems

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
like it is.

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,600
It's been too long.

249
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
I can't remember clearly.

250
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,180
Every time I come here,

251
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
memories of those years feel like

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
they happened yesterday.

253
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
The past

254
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,500
is already in the past.

255
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,320
Besides, Jin Xiao and I

256
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,640
are already engaged.

257
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
I know you well, Mi Ke.

258
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
You don't truly love Jin Xiao.

259
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
It is just a business marriage, right?

260
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
I...

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
If you're happy with him,

262
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,940
I wish you both the best.

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
But if you don't love him,

264
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,200
my previous promise is...

265
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

266
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,660
- What are you doing?
- Really sorry.

267
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,480
Are you okay?

268
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
The service awareness

269
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,520
in the service industry is quite poor now.

270
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
It's fine, it's fine.

271
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
How's the food today?

272
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,880
It looks

273
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
pretty good.

274
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
- Mi Ke...
- Sir, your wine.

275
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,890
Are you out of your mind?

276
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Sorry, sorry.

277
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
Don't run. Stop right there!

278
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm reporting you.

279
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,600
Forget it.

280
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,380
I don't have much appetite anyway.

281
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,400
Otherwise,

282
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,560
let's get to business.

283
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
(Project Cooperation)

284
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,740
- Pleasure working with you.
- Pleasure working with you.

285
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,990
I've been very happy these days.

286
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,680
Though the project's over,

287
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
I hope we can meet again.

288
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,240
As friends.

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
Mi Ke,

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
how about a celebratory meal?

291
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
We're almost there.

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Let's get off here.

293
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,120
Are you afraid Jin Xiao might see us?

294
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Let's avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

295
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
Mi Ke.

296
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm sorry.

297
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Why are you apologizing?

298
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
I...

299
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
I still feel like I owe you too much.

300
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
Can we start over?

301
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,440
Let the past be the past.

302
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,180
Pleasure working with you.

303
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
