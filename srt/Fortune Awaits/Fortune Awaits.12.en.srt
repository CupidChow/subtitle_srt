2
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
At that time,

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,840
he was at the hospital.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
While lying there,

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,600
he suddenly woke up

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
(Mi Ke: Jin Haochen went to Binhai!)
and said he didn't know...

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,640
Quick, hide Jin Xiao.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
What happened?

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,040
My brother is here.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
Your brother?

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Aren't you an only child?

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
Not my brother,

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,200
it's Jin Xiao's brother.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,840
If he finds two Jin Xiaos,

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,680
we're done for.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,910
Worse yet,

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,720
the whole farm could be at risk.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520
- Hide him, quick!
- No, no.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,980
How do I hide a living person?

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
I don't care.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,200
Just hit him with a stick.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,600
- I need to think.
- Let's split up.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
Hello? What's going on?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Are you in Binhai?

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
How did you know?

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,840
It's a long story. You can't let Jin Haochen

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,680
find out who you are.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That goes without saying.

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
He'll be there in half an hour.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
You have to rely on yourself.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Got it, got it.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Madam.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Madam.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
What's wrong?

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Nothing.

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Sit down and talk.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,240
As for catching up,

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll skip that for now.

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Here's the current situation.

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Jin Xiao has a brother.

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,500
His name is Jin Haochen.

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Did you know that?

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,940
Jin Haochen is actually his half-brother.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,680
Did you know that?

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
That's not important.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
The point is,

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Jin Xiao wants to buy this land.

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,680
But Jin Haochen disagrees.

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
You get it, right?

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Got it.

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
It's about royal succession.

53
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,640
- We've seen it on TV.
- Right.

54
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,800
This Jin Haochen,

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,880
I know him.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,770
You know him? Why didn't you say earlier?

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, you...

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,160
I just met him.

59
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
We hit it off right away.

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,080
I respectfully call him big brother.

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,550
He called me his little brother.

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,600
Under this brainwashing

63
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
of mine,

64
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
he agreed to invest in expanding production

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,040
on this piece of land.

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, he'll be here soon.

67
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Later, follow my lead.

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
- Got it.
- One more important thing.

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
From now on,

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
no one calls me He Fang.

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,320
Got it?

72
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Why?

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
It's complicated.

74
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,960
I'll explain later.

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,760
Can we keep this place?

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,400
Follow my command and we can.

77
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,600
- Alright.
- And one more thing.

78
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,440
Okay.

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,590
(Jin Xiao)
Put this away quickly.

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Pull yourself together and give it a try.

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,510
Welcome, welcome!

82
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,390
(Welcome Mr. Jin Haochen)
Warmly welcome!

83
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,040
Welcome, welcome!

84
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
(Binhai Town Market)
Warmly welcome!

85
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,680
Welcome, welcome!

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,480
Warmly welcome!

87
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,600
You must be Mr. Jin Haochen, right?

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
And you are?

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm Qiang.

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,520
Mr. Jin, nice to meet you.

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480
You're here.

92
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,670
What are you doing here?

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
This is my project.

94
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Of course I'm here.

95
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,260
Everyone heard you were coming.

96
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,960
They're really happy, right?

97
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes, yes, yes.

98
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,880
How did you know I was coming?

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
We're brothers.

100
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
We have a connection.

101
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,320
First, show my brother around.

102
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
Come on, Mr. Jin.

103
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,770
This way, Mr. Jin.

104
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,640
Let's go, we're almost there.

105
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
Go on, keep moving.

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,960
Where are we going? I'm busy.

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,100
The investor wants to meet you. Over there.

108
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,840
See? Over there.

109
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
Let's go, let's go.

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Here is

111
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
VIP exclusive area.

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
It meets all the needs

113
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
of our clients.

114
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,500
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Reserved for Kim's Group.

116
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Come over here, brother.

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
Jin Xiao,

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,420
did you redesign this too?

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
Yes.

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,760
Young man,

121
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
you're surrounded by dark energy.

122
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
You need to do more good deeds.

123
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
He Fang!

124
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,560
Who is this extraordinary person?

125
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
This must be the legendary

126
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Mr. Jin, right?

127
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Your presence truly makes

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
our humble place shine.

129
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,900
Make our humble place shine.

130
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Alright, I heard

131
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,680
there's a pig farm here, right?

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,680
The owner must be pretty impressive.

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,890
Let's go check it out.

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,080
Bro,

135
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,760
the pig farm

136
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
is dirty and smelly.

137
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
What's there to see?

138
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,360
Let's just go eat.

139
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,640
- Yeah, let's eat.
- Let's eat.

140
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,550
- Let's go.
- No need.

141
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
I'll go myself.

142
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,840
Mr. Jin, this way, please.

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
Let's go, let's go.

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
Where's Jin Xiao?

145
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,860
Don't worry.

146
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,860
I've arranged for someone

147
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,840
to stop him on the way.

148
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Now the key issue is

149
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,640
who will play the boss.

150
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Who?

151
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Can you act?

152
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
- Mi Ke.
- This

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
is the pig farm you mentioned?

154
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Yes.

155
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
But right now,

156
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,200
it's not the time for a tour.

157
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
What are you doing?

158
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
You...!

159
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
I...

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Am I a bit

161
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,640
harsh?

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
- A bit.
- A bit.

163
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,000
Welcome!

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm He Fang.

165
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,520
I own this pig farm.

166
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Aren't you that guy...?

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,760
It's a small town.

168
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,400
Gotta do all kinds of business here.

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,640
But pig farming

170
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
is my main business.

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Miss Mi,

172
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,240
what brings you here?

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,590
Are you worried about Jin Xiao?

174
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
The husband sings

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
and the wife follows.

176
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
Since we've all introduced ourselves,

177
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
let's

178
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,240
find a place to chat.

179
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
No need.

180
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm already here.

181
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll go in and take a look.

182
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,600
Well,

183
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,600
it's just a pigpen.

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Nothing worth seeing.

185
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,080
Don't get your clothes dirty.

186
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,280
Forget it.

187
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,120
Right, Mr. Jin?

188
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,120
What?

189
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,960
Not convenient?

190
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
It's convenient.

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Nothing we can't see.

192
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Right, Jin Xiao?

193
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes, Mr. He,

194
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
take my brother inside to look.

195
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Let's go then.

196
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,240
Let's go.

197
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,830
How could he...

198
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,880
Even in a small place like this,

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,050
they have this feeding method?

200
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,960
Absolutely.

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,320
Piggy kindergarten.

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
Piggy slide.

203
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
Piggy pool.

204
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,440
Music early education.

205
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
What is this?

206
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,560
Straw mat.

207
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,360
It's used to keep the pigs warm.

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,960
I've never seen this straw mat before.

209
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
It's very dirty.

210
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,560
It smells.

211
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Pigs.

212
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,240
Quick, shoo it away!

213
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
They don't listen to me.

214
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,080
Help him out.

215
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,560
They got my brother's clothes dirty.

216
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,080
- Control it!
- Hurry up!

217
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,120
Hurry, hurry!

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
There's still dirt over there.

219
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
- The head!
- Over there!

220
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,670
Alright.

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
Watch it.

222
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
How about

223
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
we head to the VIP lounge for a break?

224
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

225
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
- Come on.
- Let's go.

226
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's go to the lounge.

227
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,840
- Take a break.
- Put me down.

228
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,160
I can walk on my own.

229
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
Let's go, let's go.

230
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,040
♪Qiang fell in love with Zhen♪

231
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,600
♪On a starless night♪

232
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,160
Good.

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,230
How is it, bro?

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
It's custom-made for your arrival.

235
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,720
Jin Xiao.

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,560
Weren't you against the acquisition?

237
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
So,

238
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,470
why did you come here?

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,040
Not against it,

240
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
just reconsidering.

241
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I've been thinking it over these days.

242
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,440
We not only have

243
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,720
to do this project,

244
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
but go all in.

245
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
Yes, yes, go all in.

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
So, I rushed here overnight.

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
You were here last night?

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
That's right.

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
Alright, Jin Xiao,

250
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,660
since you support the acquisition,

251
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,920
then let's speed things up.

252
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,520
Before our father returns,

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,990
you need to show some results.

254
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
No problem, bro.

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
Come on, Mr. Jin!

256
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
On behalf

257
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,140
of all the merchants in our town,

258
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,280
let me toast you!

259
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
- Come on!
- No need.

260
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
Alright, alright.

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
I can feel your enthusiasm.

262
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,160
- Sit.
- I drank too fast.

263
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,320
I drank too fast.

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Come on, sit down.

265
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,760
My brother felt the enthusiasm.

266
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Jin Xiao,

267
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,760
from what I know,

268
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,840
the merchants here

269
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,000
are difficult to deal with.

270
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,740
What did you say to them?

271
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,160
I didn't say anything.

272
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,880
You cannot view them

273
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,820
through colored glasses.

274
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
They were a bit stubborn.

275
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
But they're improving.

276
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,560
We should see them

277
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,660
with a forward-looking view.

278
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Enough talking.

279
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll call my wife

280
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,320
to bring out our finest wine.

281
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,920
Zhen, bring the wine.

282
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Coming!

283
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Come on, come on.

284
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,920
I'll toast to Mr. Jin then.

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
If it weren't for him,

286
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,040
our shop would've been gone.

287
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
- Right.
- So we're with you

288
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,000
on the same boat, right?

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,280
We must take down Kim's Group.

290
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Take down...

291
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
What did you say?

292
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,520
Slip of the tongue. He's also surnamed Jin.

293
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
We should

294
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
fight against evil forces

295
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
and build a new Binhai.

296
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,000
- Right.
- Cheers!

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,840
They've drunk it up.

298
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
Come on, drink up!

299
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
Bottoms up!

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
- Come on.
- This...

301
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
What is this?

302
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,480
It's homemade.

303
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,720
Tonic wine.

304
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,280
This wine is strong.

305
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,590
You should drink it slowly.

306
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
Being strong is fine.

307
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,490
My brother can handle it.

308
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,960
Come on, bottoms up!

309
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Impressive!

310
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,080
Very impressive!

311
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,240
Good capacity!

312
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,120
Mr. Jin, good capacity!

313
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,840
- How is it?
- Great!

314
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,920
How about some beer?

315
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,480
- Sure.
- Yeah, have some beer.

316
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,280
Bye.

317
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,380
(Binhai Town Market)

318
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,840
It's finally over.

319
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,340
It was a misunderstanding.

320
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
It's so quiet here.

321
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Right.

322
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,200
Here,

323
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,400
there's no city noise or fast pace.

324
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
Actually,

325
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,480
living here

326
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
is pretty nice.

327
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Of course.

328
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
Life here is simple,

329
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
but it has a kind

330
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
of rare tranquility

331
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
and contentment.

332
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
In the city,

333
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,800
it's always hectic,

334
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,320
leaving no room to breathe.

335
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
But here,

336
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,400
