00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
You're here.

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,600
Mi Ke,

5
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,940
why did you suddenly ask me out?

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,960
If others see us,

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,930
it could be bad for you.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Why did you

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,040
say those things to the media?

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
My feelings for you are real.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Let's ignore those rumors.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,250
We can prove directly

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,400
our love is real.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,680
Right now,

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,520
it's just the two of us.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Tell me

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,080
what you did to me

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
that day.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,880
Mi Ke,

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,620
what are you talking about?

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Gu Chengze,

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,880
actually,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
I still have you

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,520
in my heart.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,960
But this matter

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,440
hurts the Mi and Jin families' reputations.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
If you tell the truth,

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
we can start fresh

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
with a clean slate.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Really?

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,840
I truly love you.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
If you still care for me,

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,440
we can go abroad.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,800
We can forget all this.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,120
We can start over.

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Then,

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,080
first tell me

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,040
what happened that day.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
I just want the truth.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
This way,

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
we can start over again.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
Mi Ke.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,720
You've been gone so long.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,720
You've changed for the worse.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,120
Let me go, let me go.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Didn't you see a man and a woman?

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,660
The woman is Mi Ke and the man is Gu Chengze.

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,000
Check it right now.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
Sorry, that's guest privacy.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
- We can't disclose.
- You...!

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't push me.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
Sorry, the hotel has its rules.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,940
He's really tough on himself.

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,880
He'll really do it.

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,940
I'll call the police if you continue.

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Didn't you say you still care for me?

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,880
Didn't you say to start over?

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,280
- Come on.
- You're crazy!

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,400
Let go of me!

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
It's only a few years.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
You got engaged to someone else.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,320
I can let you go,

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
but let me finish first.

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
Help!

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
You don't even know Mr. Jin?

66
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,180
(Jin Xiao)

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,120
Mr. Jin.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
Mr. Jin, this way please.

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,190
- I'll take you there.
- Let's go.

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,320
Stop pretending.

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,600
I love you so much.

72
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,900
How could you treat me like this?

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
It is because Jin Xiao is richer,

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
isn't it?

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
You're about to become

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,680
the young mistress of the Jin Family.

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Right?

78
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
Let go! Help!

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
Help!

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Here!

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Hurry.

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
This is it.

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Hello.

84
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,980
Stop wasting time. Let me.

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
He Fang.

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,160
Let go.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Get up.

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
Weren't you sweet-talking?

89
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,200
You promised the stars!

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
You promised the moon!

91
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
I'll beat you up.

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,560
Don't!

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
I confess.

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
- Let go first.
- Speak.

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
No one.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
Just me.

97
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
No one?

98
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,280
Still stubborn.

99
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,320
Be honest!

100
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,280
Stop hitting me!

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,920
Huang Chengren made me do it.

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
Tell us something we don't know.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Let me go first.

104
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Speak.

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
I confess.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,640
He gave me a new project.

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,000
He told me to rekindle with Mi Ke.

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,280
I put something in Mi Ke's drink.

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Then I hired a paparazzo.

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Mi Ke.

111
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
Can we start over?

112
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
Gu Chengze,

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,960
we're just business partners.

114
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,320
Please respect yourself.

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Mi Ke.

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Mi Ke.

117
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
Mi Ke.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
That's all.

119
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,300
It's just this.

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,480
Just like in the photo.

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Did you get it all recorded?

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,840
I've confessed. Why do you still hit me?

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
From now on,

124
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,240
don't let me see you in Mengcheng again.

125
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Mi Ke,

126
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
are you okay?

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
Let's go.

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
How could you

129
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
be so bold?

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,840
He's a man, after all.

131
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,420
If he wants to do something to you...

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
No, no, no.

133
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,160
Look at my big mouth.

134
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
I...

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
He Fang,

136
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I thought I'd never see you again.

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
That won't happen.

138
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,960
I'll always be by your side.

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
Does it hurt?

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm a man.

141
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,440
This little injury is nothing.

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,360
- I used to
- You say I'm reckless.

143
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,320
Don't act so impulsively next time.

144
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,320
What?

145
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,800
Feeling sorry for me?

146
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
The evidence is all here.

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,840
Let me upload it online.

148
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
Then it's accomplished...

149
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
What are you doing?

150
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,120
No need to rush.

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
No rush?

152
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,080
Spreading rumors is easy.

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
Debunking them takes effort.

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
Give it to me.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Let me ask you.

156
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360
In this recording,

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,960
only Huang Chengren is mentioned, right?

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,140
Isn't Jin Haochen easily able

159
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,560
to get rid of suspicion?

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
So you're saying...

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,280
What I mean is...

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
I haven't figured it out yet.

163
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,840
But I always feel like

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
something's still missing.

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,140
What you're missing is me.

166
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,960
You've been more and more negligent lately.

167
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,800
How can anyone just walk in?

168
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Jin Xiao,

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
I can help you.

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
It's an honor

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,840
to work with you.

173
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Once I take over Kim's Group,

174
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,840
our collaboration

175
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,920
will be even smoother.

176
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Good.

177
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,360
I believe in you.

178
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Mr. Jin,

179
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
didn't you die of cancer?

180
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
What cancer?

181
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
You said you wouldn't live long.

182
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,080
That's why I ended my pregnancy.

183
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,080
You killed our child.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,360
- Who said...
- Scumbag!

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,720
Who are you?

186
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,720
Nonsense.

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
Who was that woman just now?

188
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
Who are you?

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,280
You promised to love me forever.

190
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,600
You liar.

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
Liar, liar, liar!

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Stop it!

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Liar!

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm calling the police.

195
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
You...!

196
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Miss Xu,

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't even know them.

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,760
You won't believe them, will you?

199
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
Jin

200
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Hao

201
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
chen.

202
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,920
It's fine you messed around before.

203
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
But we have a child now.

204
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
You still fool around.

205
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,520
What should we do?

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,320
- Come on.
- I can't go on.

207
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
You...

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,860
Are you trying to frame me?

209
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
I can't go on.

210
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you okay?

211
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,870
Let me help you.

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
Miss Xu, I don't know her at all.

213
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,620
Miss Xu, I really don't know her.

214
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Mr. Jin,

215
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,560
I think you should take your wife home first.

216
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
What wife?

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,480
I don't know her.

218
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
The child has nothing to do with me.

219
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,040
What a scumbag!

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
Let's go.

221
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I'll take you home first.

222
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
I...

223
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,800
(The Mistress of the Jin Family
was Framed in the Kissing Incident)

224
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,140
(Mr. Jin Haochen of Kim's Group
Had Affairs with Multiple Women)

225
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,640
Is this really okay?

226
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,600
Although these women are hired by me,

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
the events are real.

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,540
I've spoken to several parties involved.

229
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
They're willing to testify against him.

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
Why not have them come in person?

231
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
We're all women.

232
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,620
Gossip is a fearful thing.

233
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,480
He Fang.

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you.

235
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Is it sweet?

236
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,120
This is my good luck.

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,540
(Good Luck)
Now I give it to you.

238
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,800
I hope it helps you.

239
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
So it's you.

240
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,400
What do you mean?

241
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
Don't worry.

242
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm here for you.

243
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,720
In the future,

244
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
this won't happen again.

245
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
First of all,

246
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
I, Jin Xiao, fully believe

247
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,200
in my fiancée's character.

248
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,680
She must have been framed.

249
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Kim's Group

250
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
has two heirs in total.

251
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,490
(Jin Haochen, eldest son)
One is Jin Haochen.

252
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
The other one

253
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
(Jin Xiao)
is Jin Xiao.

254
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,280
But no clear photos or videos of Jin Xiao

255
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,040
can be found online.

256
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
It feels like someone's hiding it on purpose.

257
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,000
You!

258
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,760
- I...
- Jin Xiao, you scoundrel.

259
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
Jin Xiao.

260
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Jin Xiao?

261
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
(Could it be)

262
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,280
