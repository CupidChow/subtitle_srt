=Fortune Awaits=

2
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Chairman Zhuo.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,960
Mr. Jin,

5
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,060
sorry to keep you waiting.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,840
The coffee is worth the wait.

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,500
Chairman Zhuo has arrived.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Well,

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Chairman Zhuo...

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,720
Her schedule

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,660
is quite packed today.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
No time to meet you.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,960
I happen to be free today.

14
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,070
I can wait.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,180
We'll talk after she's done.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
Let's reschedule.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Mr. Jin,

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,080
please.

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,320
I can't believe myself.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
I overslept for such a big event.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,880
He Fang,

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,800
I heard Jin Haochen

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,160
got rejected by Zhuo Lan

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
and was kicked out.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
This Zhuo Lan,

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,680
what's her background?

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,720
It is formed by three investment firms

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
eight listed companies,

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,200
and two foreign enterprises.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,000
Zhuo Lan is a tough woman.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
She married the then chairman

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,480
at the age of 18.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,480
Her husband passed within three years.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,990
She then became the chairman

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
until today.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,160
It's like she jinxed her husband.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Other than that,

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,480
she's nothing special, right?

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
Not exactly.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
After she took over,

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,400
the Qilin Chamber grew even stronger,

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,600
swallowing and acquiring everything

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,440
in its path.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,490
She came to Mengcheng this time.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,720
Kim's Group must be

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
one of her targets.

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,800
Do you know

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
their main business?

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Real estate.

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,560
If it takes over Kim's Group,

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
Binhai

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,680
will die even faster.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
So awful!

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
I didn't even speed up.

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,200
Your scam is too obvious.

56
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,060
What?

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,520
You hit me without speeding.

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
If you sped up,

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960
I'd be dead by now.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
Call your master over here.

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,600
Hurry up, I don't care.

62
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
You...!

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
- Someone's dying!
- Chairman.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Well, he...

65
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
Brain MRI, abdominal CT,

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
and casts on limbs.

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,320
Not a single one can be missing.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Call the police.

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
Call...

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,120
Oh my goodness!

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
This woman hit me and tried to run.

72
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
This woman hit me and tried to run.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
You're sexually harassing women in public.

74
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm telling you, you're in trouble now.

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,620
According to Article 237 of the Criminal Law,

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,240
those who use violence to molest others

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
or insult women

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,920
shall be sentenced to imprisonment.

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
You might face control and detention.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,520
- Don't film me.
- It's all recorded.

81
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Don't film me.

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Beautiful lady,

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,760
are you okay?

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,060
A hero saves the beauty?

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,400
Meeting you is fate.

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,600
Hello.

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Thank you.

88
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,760
Young Master Jin Xiao.

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Five minutes.

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
Last time was a special circumstance.

91
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,330
It's not being proud and disrespecting you

92
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,840
like others said.

93
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,500
Besides, my brother went, didn't he?

94
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,600
This shows that we care more about you.

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
You have three minutes left.

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,360
I came here this time

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,640
mainly to ask for a favor.

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
Mengcheng is just a tiny place.

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Your chamber wouldn't care about it.

100
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,560
Why not just let it go?

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
One minute.

102
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,660
How about I arrange a gathering?

103
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,790
I'll personally cook for you.

104
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,560
Do you like pork?

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
Pork belly, front leg, or...

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
Why is your watch running so fast?

107
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,500
(Day 8)

108
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Five minutes.

109
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,290
Mr. Jin.

110
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,740
- There's trouble.
- What happened?

111
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,080
Jin Xiao's bodyguard, Zuo Yemei,

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,780
began investigating the car accident.

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
People eat grains and cereals.

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,840
Who can go through life

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,400
without encountering accidents?

116
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,200
I can only say

117
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
my brother is really unlucky.

118
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
You go bait the hook,

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,350
with the information provided,

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
the closer to the truth, the better.

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
Otherwise, he won't fall for it.

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,660
Lure the snake out of its hole

123
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
and catch them all at once.

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
What's wrong?

125
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,770
Sir,

126
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,120
there's roadwork ahead.

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Why don't you pull over

128
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
and wait a moment?

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
How much longer do we have to wait?

130
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,560
About five hours or so.

131
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,080
Chairman Zhuo, what bad timing.

132
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
How about I stay here

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
and chat with you?

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,200
Seriously?

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
Is that even allowed?

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Tomorrow,

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,540
I'll give you one last chance.

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
That bad woman

139
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
finally showed some kindness.

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,300
What are you talking about?

141
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
She's a good lady.

142
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
These past few days,

143
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
has he been busy with this?

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Yes.

145
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
By the way, Mr. Jin,

146
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,900
there's a lead on the car accident.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
I remember on the day of the accident,

148
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,520
your brother asked to meet you, right?

149
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
That makes sense.

150
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,500
An informant took photos.

151
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,180
Mr. Jin was at the hotel

152
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
that day.

153
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
That doesn't prove anything.

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,920
There's another photo.

155
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,080
That truck driver

156
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,990
was also at the hotel.

157
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
What do you think, Chairman Zhuo?

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
You've been visiting this all day.

159
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Any thoughts?

160
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
I gave you the whole day.

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
You brought me here to see this place?

162
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
Do you know

163
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
I could buy all of Binhai

164
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
in a single day?

165
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Yes, I know.

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
You can earn a lot in a day.

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,720
But money can never

168
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,720
be earned enough.

169
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,520
Time, however, is limited.

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
So you don't want me against Kim's Group.

171
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,540
It's not about the money.

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
It's this.

173
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
Nowadays, everything's too commercialized.

174
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,280
People seem obsessed with money.

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,600
But this is different.

176
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
This is a pure land.

177
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Here, Chairman Zhuo.

178
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,600
Look.

179
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,920
You can't catch me.

180
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,980
Maybe these people don't really

181
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,080
want to live in the city,

182
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,400
nor have they thought

183
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,460
their hometown would have so many buildings.

184
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,640
They can hold

185
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
their daughter's hand like this,

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
growing old slowly

187
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,660
while their daughter grows up,

188
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
which is quite nice.

189
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,520
But growing up takes money.

190
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,400
If he had a car,

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,220
his daughter wouldn't need to walk.

192
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,600
But if his hands

193
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,520
are on the steering wheel,

194
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
he wouldn't be able

195
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
to hold his daughter's hand.

196
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
So in comparison,

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
what this girl needs

198
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
might not be this car.

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
You've got a utopian spirit.

200
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,760
But your idea

201
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
doesn't represent your father,

202
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,660
nor does it represent Kim's Group.

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
Even if I back off this time,

204
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Kim's Group's expansion

205
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,440
won't stop.

206
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,990
Chairman Zhuo, don't worry.

207
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll convince my father myself.

208
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Moreover, Kim's Group's current ventures

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,520
don't align well with Qilin Chamber's

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,640
existing ones.

211
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
On the contrary, if we can cooperate,

212
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
we can achieve more

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
with less investment.

214
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Your risks will be relatively smaller.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
You're smarter than your brother.

216
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
I'll consider it.

217
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Chairman Zhuo,

218
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
if we are to cooperate,

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
could we

220
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,080
add one more partner?

221
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,600
You're pushing your luck.

222
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,490
I could have handled it myself.

223
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,700
You didn't need to come.

224
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
Didn't your informant say

225
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
he had to see me in person

226
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,760
to believe it's not Jin Haochen's trap?

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,480
That's why you shouldn't have come.

228
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,480
It's too dangerous.

229
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,840
I trust your abilities.

230
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
You looked like He Fang just now.

231
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
You can't escape this time.

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Get them!

233
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,400
Jin Xiao, good child,

234
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,400
well done.

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
Our family

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,330
can partner with Qilin Chamber of Commerce.

237
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
In the past,

238
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,160
we wouldn't dare dream of it.

239
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Mr. Mi, it's nothing.

240
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
Just a small matter.

241
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
As for me,

242
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
I've prepared

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,840
a big gift

244
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
for both of you.

245
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
I've made up my mind.

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
After you two get married,

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll transfer my shares in Mihua

248
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
entirely

249
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,040
to Ke.

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
From then on, the company

251
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
belongs to you.

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,520
Dad.

253
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
As long as you two are happy,

254
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
I

255
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
can rest easy.

256
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,680
My health isn't great.

257
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,840
I should have retired

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
and enjoyed some peace.

259
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,970
By the way,

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,160
tell me

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,400
about how you convinced Chairman Zhuo.

262
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
I did some research.

263
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Zhuo Lan

264
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
grew up in poverty.

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Her dad

266
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
walked her 10 km to school daily,

267
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
rain or shine.

268
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,280
But her dad

269
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,560
passed away

270
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,600
before her career took off.

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,520
This is also

272
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,440
her motivation to earn money all along.

273
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,860
Perform well.

274
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
If you do well, I'll treat you to barbecue.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
Come on.

276
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,040
You can't catch me.

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
He Fang.

278
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,040
So strange.

279
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,600
