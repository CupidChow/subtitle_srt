3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,520
Jin Xiao!

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,040
Haochen.

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,200
Xiao,

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,280
aren't you going to offer me

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,800
an explanation about the auction?

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,840
What explanation?

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
You set the trap

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
and lured me into it.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,160
Set a trap?

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,640
Isn't this the way

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
we've always been?

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
Haochen,

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
you've regressed.

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
You seem

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
a bit different too.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,800
What's different?

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,440
Hurry home

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,480
and take a shower.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,240
You smell weird.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
By the way,

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,200
as for the Qilin Chamber's project,

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,560
I advise you

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,560
not to touch it.

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
(He Fang)

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
(actually played Jin Haochen like this.)

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
(Interesting.)

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,200
How is it going?

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
(Operating Room)
It's been so long.

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,560
Why hasn't it been born yet?

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,280
What's the rush?

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,880
You think it's that easy?

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,240
It's been so long. Will she...?

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
Just shut up.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,680
How is it?

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Congratulations, it's a girl.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,080
A daughter!

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,980
- I'm a dad now.
- That's amazing!

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm a dad now.

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
This is the hospital.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Did you pick a name?

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
No.

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,960
It happened too fast.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,220
I haven't had the chance.

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,860
Let's give a nickname first.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
What should it be?

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Call her Haoyun.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Haoyun.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,120
It's a good name.

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Xu Haoyun.

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
You gave her this name.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
Now you're Xu Haoyun's godfather.

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,760
Really?

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll call Madam right now

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
and share the good news.

57
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,060
(Operating Room)

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Miss Fang.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,320
What brings you here?

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,190
Congratulations!

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,040
That's a nice name.

62
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,860
What are you doing here?

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
I told you,

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,560
I have my own struggles.

65
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,210
(Fang Xuemei; Gastrointestinal Surgery)

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Maybe I could help.

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
If I told you earlier,

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,920
would you believe me?

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
Don't worry.

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
My mom's surgery went well.

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Congratulations.

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm going to take care of my mom.

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
Go ahead.

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
He Fang, He Fang, come here!

76
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Coming.

77
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,860
- Is she out?
- Hurry up!

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Hello?

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
Hello? Wang Dalu.

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Where are you?

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm in Binhai.

82
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,720
Come quickly and cover for me,

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,880
so that others won't discover

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,780
there are two He Fangs.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Jin Xiao.

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
He doesn't seem to be in Binhai.

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
What's going on?

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Where's Jin Xiao?

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,360
If he's not here,

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,440
he might have stayed at the company.

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
What's going on?

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Here's what happened.

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,960
That's just how it is.

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
What a mess!

95
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,580
I just went out for a massage.

96
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,620
Why is everything in chaos.

97
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,880
You can't manage without me.

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's leave it at that.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,900
You watch Jin Xiao here

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,240
and notify me if anything happens.

101
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
- Alright.
- Hurry up.

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
- Hurry up.
- I'm going.

103
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,620
(Incoming call)

104
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Jin Xiao.

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Jin Xiao.

106
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,460
(Incoming call)

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,400
Answer the phone, Mi Ke.

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
I don't dare go back.

109
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
It's fine if you're asleep.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Otherwise,

111
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
I might feel too shy to say it.

112
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,360
That day,

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,880
after coming back from the rice fields,

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
I couldn't sleep at all.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
I thought

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
I've fallen for you.

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
As for the three rules we agreed,

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I regret them now.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Perhaps

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,040
with our current identity

121
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,080
and relationship,

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't ask for an outcome yet.

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
But whether you're Jin Xiao

124
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,360
or He Fang,

125
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,280
I'll always be by your side,

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
accompanying you,

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
and supporting you.

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Why are you drinking alone?

129
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,920
Don't drink too much.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
You're learning to care for others.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,520
I remember you used

132
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
to be serious all the time.

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
Is it so?

134
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
Looks like even you believe him.

135
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,600
That means that guy

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
really looks just like me.

137
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
Looks just like you?

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Who is he?

139
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
I don't have time to answer now.

140
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,120
Why is it so big?

141
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
I am Jin Xiao.

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
He's just a fake.

143
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
As you said,

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
this guy's actions are interesting.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
Anything else?

146
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,480
Apart from taking advantage

147
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,890
of your identity to indulge himself,

148
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
he hasn't shown any other intentions.

149
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
He is most concerned about the acquisition.

150
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,780
He made a scene at the company twice

151
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,820
to stop the acquisition.

152
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,960
Seems like he's here

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,360
for the Binhai Project.

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
Mr. Jin Haochen is troubled.

155
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,200
He lost a lot in the auction.

156
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
And his reputation took a hit.

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
He indirectly helped you.

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
From what you're saying,

159
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,120
you seem to approve of him.

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
I...

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,840
No.

162
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm loyal to the Jin Family.

163
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,340
If we don't consider the Jin Family,

164
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
how do you think of him?

165
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
He must be back.

166
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Cover for me.

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,420
I'll leave through the back.

168
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
Based on what you just said,

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
that car crash was no accident.

170
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
We all know exactly

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
who was behind it.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
But we still need solid evidence.

173
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,280
During this time, you investigate discreetly.

174
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,770
Make sure not to give yourself away.

175
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,600
As for any matters at Kim's Group,

176
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,140
report them to me promptly.

177
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Mr. Jin.

178
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
You're still up this late?

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,320
You just got back?

180
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
Have you seen

181
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
anyone else been here?

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Alright, that's good.

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
It's late, you should rest.

184
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Man proposes,

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
but heaven disposes.

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
The heavens above

187
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
are on your side.

188
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,520
Even if that fool comes,

189
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
he can't take down Chairman Zhuo.

190
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,440
Chairman Zhuo has arrived.

191
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
Chairman Zhuo, nice to meet you.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,420
Here's my business card.

193
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Chairman Zhuo, look forward to your support.

194
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,160
Why didn't the alarm go off?

195
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,380
Chairman Zhuo, nice to meet you.

196
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm Jin Haochen from Kim's Group.

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,440
I remember the representative

198
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,960
of the Kim Group on the list

199
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,000
is named Jin Xiao.

200
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,100
That's my younger brother.

201
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,160
He's not feeling well today.

202
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,600
My father is abroad.

203
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
For such an important event,

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
I specially came.

205
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Specially?

206
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
I must thank you

207
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,200
for your presence.

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
I have an invitation.

209
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,640
Sorry, the event has already started.

210
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,780
Can you make an exception?

211
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Please.

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
Thank you all for coming

213
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,000
once again.

214
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,480
Chairman Zhuo.

215
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,840
What you just said

216
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,240
aligns perfectly

217
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,640
with our group's philosophy.

218
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,720
I've heard

219
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
about Kim's Group.

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Maybe we can

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
establish a partnership soon.

222
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,800
Alright, let's set a time

223
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,360
to discuss our future collaboration.

224
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Now works for me.

225
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,240
How much do you want to sell?

226
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
What do you mean by that?

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,640
How much do you want

228
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,160
to sell Kim's Group for?

229
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
Or

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,960
how much does your father want?

231
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
We will never

232
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
sell Kim's Group.

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,520
If you want to cooperate,

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,240
show some sincerity.

235
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,600
Acquisition

236
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,560
is my utmost sincerity.

237
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,320
Of course, in Kim's Group,

238
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
you don't have the final say.

239
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
Find someone who can make decisions

240
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
and talk to me.

241
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,920
It's just a chamber of commerce.

242
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
I don't have to work with her.

243
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,760
This is Mengcheng.

244
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,760
Seven projects

245
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,440
are now under Qilin Chamber.

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
Stock trading is abnormal.

247
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Someone's dumping Kim's stocks.

248
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,680
The news of Qilin entering Mengcheng

249
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,730
will be released tonight.

250
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,160
And the headline is...

251
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
What is it?

252
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,400
Speak!

253
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Qilin Chamber is entering Mengcheng

254
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,560
and Kim's Group is in chaos.

255
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,400
Nonsense!

256
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,940
Is she really that powerful?

257
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,800
Get Dachen and Xinghe

258
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,840
here.

259
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
With their support for our group,

260
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,300
Mengcheng won't be in trouble.

261
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,360
Yes, sir.

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
Haochen,

263
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,700
I think we should let it go.

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,560
They're already Zhuo Lan's guests.

265
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
What did you say?

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Our group is completely isolated now.

267
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,220
If it continues, before the chairman returns,

268
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
our group will be taken over

269
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,180
by Qilin Chamber at a low price.
