39
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,360

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,110
Their purpose

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,970
is to deal with us using the bombs.

69

They were all nobodies!

570
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,680
You've been in China for so long.

571
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,430
You must have heard of the saying,

572
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,760
"A single spark can start a prairie fire."

573
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,740
They are not nobodies.

574
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,380
They used their bodies to form a Great Wall

575
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,110
against the invasion.

576
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,470
They will never

577
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,920
be erased from history.

578
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,420
They're the pride of our people,

579
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,870
the hope of our people,

580
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,690
and the faith of our people.

581
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,890
They will let our next generation

582
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,470
live

583
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,040
under the warm sunshine

584
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,980
of the new China forever,

585
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,690
including your child with Jingxian.

586
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,090
He will definitely

587
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,380
bask in the warm sunshine of the new China

588
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,460
and grow up happily.

589
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,070
But these

590
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
have nothing to do with you anymore.

591
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,330
This is for you.

592
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,620
The wine and dishes for your last meal.

593
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,070
Enjoy it

594
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,880
and don't think too much.

595
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,130
I won't come to see you off tomorrow.

596
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,930
Wait for the sun.

597
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,640
Li Shaotang, the former director of the Special Technology Research Lab

598
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,830
at the NBIS Chongqing Station

599
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,730
and Acting Vice Captain,

600
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,470
has been sentenced to

601
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,710
immediate execution

602
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,320
for espionage, conspiracy to commit murder,

603
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,490
and other crimes.

604
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,270
Here, have some water.

605
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,990
Okay.

606
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,010
What's wrong?

607
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,350
You want to ask about

608
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,000
Moqing, right?

609
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,790
How is she

610
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,630
doing now?

611
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,720
She's in a new position to combat.

612
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,900
Everything is fine.

613
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,020
Okay.

614
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,190
So, what does the organization

615
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,690
want me to do

616
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,210
next?

617
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,210
After careful consideration by the higher-ups,

618
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,000
we order you

619
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,870
to continue to stay undercover at the NBIS Chongqing Station

620
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,530
and provide information for the organization.

621
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,110
Since you've chosen to work for the revolution,

622
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,770
you have to give up something.

623
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,670
I know.

624
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,200
Get ready at any time

625
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,740
to sacrifice everything

626
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,160
for the Party

627
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,140
and the people.

His identity remains to be determined.

643

The level of confidentiality is extraordinarily high.

649
