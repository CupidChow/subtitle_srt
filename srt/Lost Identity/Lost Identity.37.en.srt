I joined the NBIS' Sundial Operation

until I had been providing information on Cherry Blossom

21

and become a spy for all three of them.

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,550
In order to understand more about Sundial,

194
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,930
I've been keeping Nakamura,

195
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,730
that scum of the empire, around.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,040
I didn’t expect

197
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,200
he would pretend to be dumb

198
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,380
in 810

199
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,850
and get involved with the Communist Party

200
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,970
and escape with Ou Xiao'an.

201
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,360
No matter what,

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,260
you shouldn't trust Ou Xiao'an anymore.

203
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,620
Are you chastising me?

204
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,090
I dare not.

205
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,640
But this person is really troublesome.

206
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,960
We've had several close calls with him.

207
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,280
If

208
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,920
you could have kept the original plan

209
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,570
and handed the information that Ou Xiao'an copied to my men

210
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,680
on the train to leave Shanghai,

211
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,580
none of this would have happened.

212
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,010
I waited until the train left Shanghai

213
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,460
before I ordered the capture of Ou Xiao'an

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,740
to ensure the documents

215
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,000
would be in your hands.

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,570
But the person who liaised with me on the train

217
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,720
was dead.

218
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,280
I could only give the information to NBIS.

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,810
It's a way to gain their trust at the same time.

220
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,850
NBIS does

221
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
indeed trust you.

222
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,800
At the last minute,

223
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,640
before I was sent to the gallows,

224
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,140
they let you persuade Shen Congwu to listen to your opinion

225
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,780
and let me fake my death

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,900
in front of the world to escape.

227
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,640
NBIS' trust in you

228
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,680
exceeded my expectations.

229
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,620
Sir.

230
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
Are you

231
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,640
doubting my loyalty?

232
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,970
I trust you.

233
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,180
I believe your feelings for me.

234
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,890
But...

235
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you have the same loyalty

236
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
to the empire?

237
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,000
You know me better than anyone in the world.

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,870
You shouldn't question me,

239
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Sir.

240
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,130
Okay.

241
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,410
I take it back.

242
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,120
I hope you can understand me.

243
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,700
Even Japanese like Nakamura

244
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,100
who were born and raised in Japan

245
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,580
could be revolutionized by Communist Party ideology

246
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,840
and betray the empire,

247
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,000
let alone you.

248
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,400
Under the current situation...

249
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
Everything we're doing now

250
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,350
is to keep the plan going.

251
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,520
NBIS wants to deal with the Communist Party more than we do.

252
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,290
Only by capitalizing on this

253
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,360
can the empire win again.

254
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,880
In 810,

255
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,630
I met Comrade Chen Ke.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,760
I told him about Li Shaotang

257
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,890
pretending to be me.

258
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,930
He was worried that Li Shaotang

259
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,470
would take the chance to enter the organization,

260
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,450
so he arranged for you and me

261
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,760
to escape together.

262
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,480
Our mission was...

263
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,200
To expose Li Shaotang,

264
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
catch Ohashi

265
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,760
and destroy

266
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
the Cherry Blossom Project.

267
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,040
Comrade Ou Xiao'an.

268
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,830
Yes.

269
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,560
You're a member of the organization now.

270
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,330
There's one thing

271
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,340
I have to tell you.

272
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,450
Go ahead.

273
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,960
Do you remember, four years ago

274
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,490
when you left Shanghai

275
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
and relocated an NBIS member

276
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,250
called Sundial?

277
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,990
That man is

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,480
Li Shaotang.

279
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,010
He is a technician

280
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,070
at the Japanese research institute.

281
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,940
Listen.

282
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,890
This Li Shaotang

283
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,320
works for Ohashi Kazuya.

284
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,270
He's a spy.

285
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,810
What?

286
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,590
He's Ohashi's?

287
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
The real Sundial

288
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,480
is here right now.

289
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,210
He's the mute who you'll

290
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,790
escape with tomorrow.

291
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,110
His name is

292
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,100
Nakamura Takayuki.

293
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,670
He's a party member

294
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
who was cultivated by Lou Mingyuan.

295
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,440
He's Japanese?

296
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,610
Yes.

297
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,680
Your mission after you two break out of prison will be to

298
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,930
expose Li Shaotang,

299
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,850
catch Ohashi Kazuya

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,160
and destroy

301
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,310
the Cherry Blossom Project.

302
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,600
From now on,

303
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,260
your code name is Midnight.

304
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,290
Remember.

305
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,210
Before the mission is completed,

306
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
you must not expose

307
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,140
your identity as a Communist Party member to anyone,

308
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,260
including your comrades.

309
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,290
Do you remember that

310
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,540
in the packet of letters I gave you

311
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,040
there was a recepient

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,580
called He?

313
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,780
I remember.

314
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,230
Her address is

315
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,600
Qiushui Cloth Company

316
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
on Xiafei Road in Shanghai.

317
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Yes, this Qiushui Cloth Company

318
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,150
is an important liaison point of the party.

319
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,270
After you finish your mission,

320
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,579
you have to try to find He.

321
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,910
This letter is mine.

322
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,849
After reading the letter,

323
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,710
she will verify your identity to the organization.

324
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,640
Understood.

325
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,109
The code word is...

326
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,589
Ou Xiao'an.

327
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,920
This code

328
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,079
is also a message from me to you.

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,260
How can it be said that we have no clothes?

330
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,260
We will share the same robe.

331
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,410
After escaping from 810,

332
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,780
I kept the documents close to me at all times.

333
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,960
When I entered the prison camp,

334
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
I hid them

335
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
in a crack in the wall

336
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,110
to escape the soldiers' search.

337
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,480
This information

338
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,410
is too important.

339
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,660
With this information,

340
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,420
Ohashi Kazuya won't be able to escape.

341
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,660
Tell me.

342
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,130
Is there a problem with our plan?

343
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,410
Absolutely not.

344
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
With the biochemical information,

345
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,430
NBIS will trust me more.

346
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,520
I've put so much effort into this.

347
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,760
You have to understand.

348
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,690
After enduring such humiliation,

349
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,400
and giving my life's work

350
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,080
and research to the Chinese Nationalist Party

351
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
and you.

352
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,040
Yes, Sir.

353
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
The Kuomintang-Communist peace talks clearly

354
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,680
can't decide the future of China.

355
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,650
Shandong is in chaos now.

356
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,160
Biochemical data

357
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,870
is not the most important thing

358
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,010
to the short-sighted Chinese Nationalist Party.

359
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,120
What they care most about

360
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,530
is your gas bombs.

361
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,770
So, Sir,

362
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,800
you must give them the coordinates

363
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,770
after you return to the empire.

364
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,570
The Chinese Nationalist Party will help you.

365
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,200
It's the only way you'll be able to return to the empire safely.

366
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,280
All these years,

367
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
if the Communist Party hadn't

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,270
wasted so much of my time,

369
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,690
I would definitely

370
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,440
win this war for the empire.

371
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,260
Asano Aohiko.

372
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,320
No matter what happens in the future,

373
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
you must remember who you are.

374
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes.

375
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,640
I will never forget

376
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,250
your kindness.

377
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Secretary Chen and Li Manqiu

378
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,660
are still in Li Shaotang’s hands.

379
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,600
We must stop them.

380
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,010
There are photos now.

381
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,050
There's evidence. There's me.

382
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,520
I can be the witness to identify Ohashi Kazuya

383
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,840
and Li Shaotang.

384
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
You stay here

385
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,370
and hide yourself.

386
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,850
Secretary Chen said

387
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,880
identifying Ohashi Kazuya and Li Shaotang

388
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,370
is my mission.

389
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,600
I remember now.

390
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,040
I remember everything.

391
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,160
There is actually someone who works for Mr. Dai

392
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,190
and doesn't smoke?

393
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,310
I used to smoke.

394
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm an experienced smoker.

395
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,110
When I first saw him,

396
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,750
he was still a child.

397
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,060
At such a young age,

398
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,020
he was already an experienced smoker.

399
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,540
Then I met a friend

400
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,920
who had bad lungs and advised me to quit smoking too.

401
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
I was joking with him.

402
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
We made a bet.

403
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,280
I said,

404
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,450
if you can quit smoking,

405
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,430
I'll give you

406
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,890
the record.

407
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,850
In order to win,

408
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,440
I didn't smoke a single stick.

409
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,760
I thought, he was so young

410
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,950
and so addicted to smoking

411
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,870
that it would be impossible.

412
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,220
But after that,

413
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,560
he never smoked again.

414
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
This old record

415
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,570
was my prize.

416
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,930
You really quit smoking

417
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,330
just for this?

418
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,010
I liked it.

419
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,640
If you see a ray of light

420
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,610
coming through from a distance

421
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,440
in a suffocating, dark night,

422
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,990
you would crawl

423
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,940
as hard as you could

424
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,920
towards that light.

425
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,720
Tell Mr. Ye

426
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,370
I want to join the Communist Party.

427
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,410
Yesterday, some of our comrades

428
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,270
studied your application to join the party.

429
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,820
Now I solemnly inform you that,

430
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,700
in view of special circumstances,

431
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,940
the organization

432
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,940
has decided to accept you

433
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,080
as a member of the Communist Party of China.

434
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,220
The ceremony will be simple.

435
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,260
Now, take the oath with me.

436
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,270
Has 9548 been sent out?

437
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,700
Yes.

438
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,810
Qin Moqing.

439
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,930
I want to ask you about someone.

440
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,140
Who?

441
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,690
Do you know He?

442
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,530
He from Qiushui Cloth Company on Xiafei Road in Shanghai.

443
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,840
If you know her,

444
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
please tell her that

445
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,400
Mr. Ye gave me a letter

446
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,140
and asked me to give it to her personally.

447
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,180
You remember everything now?

448
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Yes.

449
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,320
Got it.

450
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,670
Ohashi Kazuya isn't dead.

451
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,860
He should still be in the prison camp

452
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
but we don't know where they hid him.

453
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,670
I suspect

454
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,080
he made a deal with NBIS

455
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,570
with information on the biochemical virus.

456
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,660
The prisoners will be repatriated in three days.

457
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,040
He'll probably take this opportunity

458
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,640
to return to Japan secretly.

459
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,370
We must

460
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,390
plan this matter carefully.

461
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,710
We have to expose the conspiracy of the Chinese Nationalist Party

462
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,040
and have a public trial for Ohashi Kazuya.

463
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,690
We can't let a war criminal like him

464
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,520
go back to Japan so easily.

465
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,400
Besides,

466
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,720
if he's really using NBIS and Li Shaotang

467
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
to study biochemical weapons,

468
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,140
and left these biochemical weapons

469
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,490
to the Chinese Nationalist Party,

470
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,850
then our soldiers

471
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,230
are under threat.

472
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,750
Understood.

473
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
One more thing.

474
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,510
Go ahead.

475
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,450
Ou Xiao'an told me

476
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,940
he regained his memory.

477
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,720
He wants to see He.

478
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,060
Me?

479
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,530
How does he know about me?

480
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,640
I never told him

481
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,560
any information about the organization.

482
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,800
He said he remembered that

483
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,250
Mr. Ye had a letter

484
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,650
that he had to pass to you.

485
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,450
And the contact address in Shanghai back then

486
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,530
was correct too.

487
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,070
Our priority now

488
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,950
is to stop them from repatriating Ohashi.

489
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,500
Let me think about

490
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,890
meeting Ou Xiao'an.

491
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,380
After all, we can't afford a second lesson

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,010
after Li Shaotang.

493
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,900
I'll find an excuse

494
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,680
to postpone the meeting.

495
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,290
But I can assure you that

496
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,280
Ou Xiao'an is different from Li Shaotang.

497
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,120
Unit 328, Labor Shift Sergeant,

498
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,310
Yoshioka Kunihiko.

499
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,610
Unit 381, Special Prison Private,

500
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Harada Hiroki.

501
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,670
Infantry, 894th Regiment,

502
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,120
7th Company, Captain Nagi Saburou.

503
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,540
Unit 432, Lieutenant

504
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,630
Miki Jirou.

505
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,890
Infantry, 15th Division,

506
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,560
37th Company, Unit Commander,

507
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,090
-Suzuki Ichirou.
-Come on.

508
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
Vice Captain Li.

509
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,490
Section Chief Qin, why are you...

510
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,260
Everyone.

511
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,120
This is

512
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,050
Vice Captain Li, who is in charge of the repatriation today.

513
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,920
Vice Captain Li.

514
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,390
Why did you bring reporters?

515
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,330
-Leave now.
-No.

516
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,940
Now!

517
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
Vice Captain Li, listen to me.

518
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,370
They're Americans.

519
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,800
These American reporters insisted on coming

520
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,780
once they heard about the repatriation.

521
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,980
They even threatened me with the U.S. Embassy.

522
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,050
I had no choice.

523
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,590
So this is what I was thinking.

524
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
When I heard they were coming,

525
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,500
I thought it was great.

526
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
It's the perfect propaganda material

527
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,260
to show how well the National Government

528
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,410
treats prisoners of war.

529
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,470
Take the pictures and leave quickly!

530
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,710
Okay, don't worry.

531
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,740
Dear journalists,

532
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,880
these are the Japanese prisoners

533
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,780
who will be sent back today.

534
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
From now on, all Japanese prisoners in China

535
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
will be repatriated gradually.

536
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
The National Government has always maintained

537
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,010
a generous policy of treating prisoners of war

538
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,640
with food, clothing, shelter

539
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,260
and medical care.

540
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,920
I believe that the National Government's

541
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
treatment of prisoners of war

542
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,220
will set an example

543
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,450
in the international community.

544
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:27,920
Right?

545
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,840
Everyone, quick.

546
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,770
Come on.

547
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,240
Unit 328, Finance Sergeant,

548
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,480
Hasegawa Takashi.

549
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Unit 432, First Lieutenant,

550
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,130
Kouno Hiroshi.

551
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,070
Unit 381, Special Prison Private,

552
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,280
Asada Kyou.

553
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,210
Qin Moqing.

554
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,860
Take them away.

555
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,080
They're Americans, I can't do anything...

556
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,940
Take them away!

557
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,570
Isn't that Ohashi Kazuya?

558
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,920
-It’s Ohashi Kazuya!
-Stop taking photos!

559
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,290
-No.
-Didn't the National Government

560
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,310
execute Ohashi Kazuya?

561
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,930
Why is he still here?

562
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,930
Can you give us an explanation?

563
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
Hurry up. Take them away!

564
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Hurry!

565
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,610
Hurry up!

566
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,250
Don't fight!

567
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,210
Can you give us an explanation?

568
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,260
Why is Ohashi Kazuya here?

569
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,180
Useless!

570
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,890
Useless! Useless!

571
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,530

[Uphold Integrity and Honor]

573
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,720
How could you make such a stupid mistake?

574
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,260
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,960
[Uphold Integrity and Honor]

576
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,650
What are you doing?

577
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,640
Now,

578
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,450
the whole world knows

579
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,220
that Ohashi Kazuya is not dead

580
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
and are criticizing us.

581
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,030
Even the Communist Party will go on the papers

582
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,110
and talk about us.

583
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,640
We, the National Government

584
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
got such a huge scandal.

585
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,870
Not only did we negotiate with the Japanese,

586
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
but we also covered up and staged

587
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,230
Ohashi Kazuya's fake death.

588
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
The Americans

589
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,680
even asked us

590
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,820
to give them an explanation. An explanation my ass!

591
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
They just want a piece of the action.

592
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,990
This is great.

593
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,170
Now both domestic and foreign voices

594
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,930
are asking us to retrial Ohashi Kazuya.

595
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,280
Have a public trial for Ohashi Kazuya.

596
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,010
A public trial. A public trial!

597
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,410
The Americans said

598
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,440
they'll send a judge to preside over the trial

599
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,960
as a sign of justice.

600
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,340
Isn't it embarrassing?

601
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
Aren't you ashamed?

602
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,770
Director Shen.

603
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Calm down.

604
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,560
Yes.

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,840
Have some water.

606
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,770
Director Shen.

607
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,050
Have some water.

608
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,960
But Director Shen,

609
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,920
I have to emphasize something.

610
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
For Ohashi Kazuya, it was you

611
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,090
and Vice Captain Li who were in charge.

612
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,310
As for how he came back to life,

613
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,110
or if we're retrialling him,

614
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
there's nothing we can do.

615
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,160
Yes.

616
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,770
Captain Wei.

617
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,140
We only kept Ohashi

618
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,360
for the good of the of the National Government.

619
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,800
If we retrial him now,

620
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,000
he might

621
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,390
expose all our plans.

622
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,180
Vice Captain Li, stop it.

623
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,000
What plans? Look.

624
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,660
Director Shen is so angry.

625
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
You need to read the room.

626
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,590
We'll have to do the public trial.

627
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,770
It'll be hard to quell public anger without a public trial.

628
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,480
But if we're doing a public trial,

629
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,280
I'm afraid Ohashi will spill everything in court.

630
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,340
It's like adding fuel to the fire.

631
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,670
Director asks us

632
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,010
to put the project on hold

633
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,710
and deal with Ohashi Kazuya

634
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,860
before we discuss.

635
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,210
Xiao'an.

636
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,920
Yes.

637
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,530
Take the Operations Department

638
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,250
to all newspapers and radio stations in Chongqing

639
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,040
and tell them

640
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,090
no one can report

641
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,290
about the Japanese prisoners today.

642
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,890
Whoever reports it will be banned.

643
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,180
Got it. I'll go now.

644
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,760
Moqing.

645
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,600
Go and find out what the Americans are saying.

646
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,400
Yes.

647
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,060
Director Shen.

648
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,160
I'll look into the reporter who instigated this.

649
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,620
I suspect he's someone.

650
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,910
As for Ohashi,

651
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,060
I'll go talk to him.

652
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,440
Alright, dismissed.

653
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,440
Vice Captain Li.

[Uphold Integrity and Honor]

655
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,140
Please wait.

656
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,580
Director asked me to tell you

657
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,200
to give you a chance to make up for your mistake.

658
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,870
In three days, come up with a plan

659
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
to keep the project going.

660
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,230
But you said we're putting it on hold.

661
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,420
It's just a stopgap measure.

662
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,540

663
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,980
keeping Ohashi Kazuya

664
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,010
would be useful for us

665
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,010
when dealing with the Communist Party in the future.

666
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,760
Understand?

667
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,030
I understand.

668
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,960
Go.

[Personnel Investigation Form]

673

As arranged,

674
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,720
I've investigated each and every one.

675
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,840
Most of them have clean backgrounds.

676
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,440
According to the American reporter George,

677
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,240
the first person who discovered Ohashi

678
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,920
was beside him,

679
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,690
a reporter who claimed to be from the Central News Agency.

680
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,560
But when I went to the Central News Agency

681
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
I found out

682
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,130
that this person is not from the Central News Agency.

683
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,290
His name is Qian Cheng.

684
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,800
[Personnel Investigation Form]

685
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,000
He's a reporter from Fengdu Daily News.

686
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,140
After the incident,

687
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,120
he's gone missing.

688
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,620
Have you checked his background?

689
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,920
This newspaper company is very small

690
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,990
and the files are incomplete.

691
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,520
Judging from the information they provided,

692
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,630
this person has never even

693
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,850
worked as a reporter on the paper

694
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,420
so he can't have

695
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,920
photographed Ohashi Kazuya in Shanghai.

696
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,250
He's never been a reporter.

697
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,920
In less than a minute,

698
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,730
and from a distance,

699
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,610
how did he recognize Ohashi?

700
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,310
Vice Captain Li.

701
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Could there be a spy

702
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,480
among us?

Where is Mr. Ye's letter?

706
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,860
I don't have it with me.

707
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,520
But I know the content.

708
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,280
How can it be said that we have no clothes?

709
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,810
We will share the same robe.

710
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,720
The king has mobilized the army,

711
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,650
sharpening our spears and halberds.

712
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,980

716
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,030
where shall I return?

I'm He.

720
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,290
When I first joined the Party, this poem was the code

721
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,530
that Secretary Chen,

722
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,210
or Mr. Ye,

723
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,570
and I used to communicate with each other.

724
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,830
Only the two of us know it.

725
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,230
It's been so many years,

726
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,900
and we haven't used it for a long time.

727
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,980
I finally found you.

728
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
Finally.

729
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,780
Mr. Ye told me,

730
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,980
if you find He and say this code,

731
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,409
you guys will know who I am.

732
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,690
Comrade He,

733
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,070
Special Member of the Chinese Communist Party, Ou Xiao'an,

734
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,820
code name Midnight,

735
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,040
reporting to the organization.

736
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,850
Comrade Ou Xiao'an.

737
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,540
On behalf of the organization,

738
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,690
thank you for everything you've done for the party.

739
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,179
I'll report your situation to the organization as soon as possible.

740
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,120
But what I need to know now is,

741
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,590
what mission did Secretary Chen give you

742
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,870
when you escaped from 810?

743
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,239
Exposing the identity of the Japanese spy Li Shaotang

744
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,000
and stopping the Cherry Blossom Project.

745
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,469
Our comrade has already exposed

746
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,870
Li Shaotang's identity.

747
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,090
He failed to join our ranks.

748
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,030
But

749
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,660
Li Shaotang is still

750
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,210
plotting with Ohashi Kazuya.

751
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,120
Cherry Blossom Project hasn't stopped either.

752
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,040
As for that,

753
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,390
the organization has also received information.

754
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,620
We're trying to stop them now.

755
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,330
According to the photos you provided,

756
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,660
We contacted our comrades in the Dongbei Resistance

757
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,230
and verified Li Shaotang's Japanese identity.

[Recognition of Degree]

759
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,170
Asano Aohiko.

760
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,460
I finally caught you.

761
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,800
My brother.

762
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,030
[Recognition of Degree]

[ID Certificate]

764
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,720
Asano Aohiko?

765
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,760
Yes.

766
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,570
This is the real name of Li Shaotang.

767
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,200
He is Japanese.

768
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,570
He's a proud student of Ohashi Kazuya.

769
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,300
Ohashi Kazuya trained him for so long

770
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,450
so he could infiltrate NBIS

771
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,750
and continue his biochemical research.

772
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,450
Tell me where

773
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,700
you got these documents?

774
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,780
This room has been locked

775
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,440
since we found out something happened to Mr. Li.

776
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,770
Is this Li Shaotang?

777
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,810
Li Shaotang.

778
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,080
You are indeed Japanese.

779
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,290
What should we do?

780
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,610
Should I report it to the station?

781
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,760
Now is not the time.

782
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,170
These documents

783
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,450
are from a Dongbei informant of mine

784
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
who I've used for many years.

785
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,040
Do you think this Asano Aohiko

786
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,430
is Chinese or Japanese?

787
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,930
He must be Japanese. Look.

788
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,800
Family photos, childhood photos,

789
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,060
they're all Japanese.

790
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,680
But his mother is Chinese.

791
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Li Shaotang

792
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,100
is working for Ohashi Kazuya.

793
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,560
Li Shaotang already told me

794
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,750
about your so-called intel long ago.

795
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,080
And he also told me

796
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,850
the Dongbei Resistance

797
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,090
has been secretly investigating his background.

798
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,160
That's not right.

799
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,080
The Dongbei informant you mentioned

800
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,970
isn't from the Resistance, right?

801
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,780
Li Shaotang is just trying to

802
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,130
justify his false identity.

803
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Ou Xiao'an.

804
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
Do you know what you did today?

805
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,160
If I describe it lightly,

806
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,520
you collaborated with the communists.

807
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
If I go deeper,

808
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,460
I could even suspect that you're a Communist Party member.

809
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,170
I'm a Communist Party?

810
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,130
Director Shen.

811
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,410
Captain Wen.

812
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,340
I'm trying to expose the Japanese spy in our station

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,800
to NBIS.

814
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,040
I'm a Communist Party member?

815
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,680
What do you mean?

816
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,200
Is our station

817
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,110
working with the Japanese now?

818
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,920
The Japanese have already surrendered.

819
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,620
As for Li Shaotang's identity

820
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,080
and whether Ohashi Kazuya is dead or alive,

821
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,370
it doesn't matter anymore.

822
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,930
Gentlemen.

823
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,570
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

824
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,420
Do you really believe

825
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,830
he will work for NBIS with all his heart?

826
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,290
As long as

827
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,040
he can make sure Ohashi Kazuya's biochemical weapons

828
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,680
are in our hands,

829
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,230
why shouldn't I believe him?

830
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,880
He developed biochemical weapons

831
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,340
to use against us Chinese!

832
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,760
Ou Xiao'an.

833
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,440
Answer me now.

834
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,320
Did you get these

835
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,050
from the Communist Party?

836
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,450
I got them from my informant.

837
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,320
Okay.

838
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,090
I can trust you,

839
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,400
but Director and the government

840
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,280
need to see your loyalty.

841
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,950
There's a lot of fuss about this right now.

842
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
It looks bad.

843
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,330
The Communist Party took the chance to fan the flames.

844
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,270
Domestic and international voices

845
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,080
all want to retrial Ohashi Kazuya.

846
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Now the US sent a judge

847
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,070
to preside over the trial of Ohashi Kazuya for justice.

848
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,510
Director ordered that,

849
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,680
when you testify in court,

850
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,800
the repatriated person, Toda Ryuichi

851
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,610
was not Ohashi Kazuya.

852
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Do you

853
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,680
understand me?

854
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,830
Director Shen, I have a question.

855
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,120
You mean

856
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,430
you want me to perjure myself

857
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,380
for Ohashi in a public trial?

858
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,880
Do you know how many Chinese people he killed?

859
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,990
Don't get emotional.

860
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,770
Focus on the big picture.

861
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,360
Let me tell you.

862
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,040
Li Shaotang

863
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,050
is in the middle of a major project

864
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,340
at the behest of the bosses.

865
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
So,

866
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,800
regarding his identity,

867
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,440
Boss doesn't want you to ask any more questions.

868
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,220
Even if he's a Japanese spy!

869
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,180
What if

870
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,440
I don't agree?

871
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,000
This is the Director's order.

872
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,650
It's also an order from Kuomintang!

873
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,090
If you don't agree,

874
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,120
I'll shoot you

875
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,670
for colluding with the Communist Party now!

876
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,760
Xiao'an.

877
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,140
The biggest enemy in front of Kuomintang

878
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,930
is the Communist Party.

879
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,190
Even if we cooperate with the Japanese,

880
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,120
if we can eliminate the Communist Party,

881
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,080
any mission

882
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,510
is acceptable.

883
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,290
Yes.

884
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,920
I was being impulsive.

885
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,440
Director Shen, Captain Wen.

886
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,460
I understand.

887
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,370
Kuomintang comes first.

888
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280

890
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,600
Is that all?

891
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,860
Yes.

892
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,820
Have you made arrangements for

893
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,990
the reporter?

894
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,820
Don't worry, it's been arranged.

895
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,760
He's probably

896
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,820
at the next liaison station already.

897
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,470
Okay.

898
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,760
So now,

899
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,020
we need to send the other person out as soon as possible.

900
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
You mean Nakamura?

901
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,410
NBIS is already cooperating with Ohashi.

902
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,730
Chongqing is too dangerous now.

903
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,640
The world's attention

904
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,610
is focused on this trial now.

905
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,140
We can't

906
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,650
put our hopes on the Americans anymore.

907
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,790
NBIS has already asked me to commit perjury in court.

908
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,170
They've been colluding

909
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,500
with the Americans.

910
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,300
Don't worry. I'll make arrangements.

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Qin Moqing.

912
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
I'd like to release

913
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,920
all this information

914
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,150
to the public at tomorrow's trial.

915
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,920
Ohashi's identity has to be exposed.

916
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,580
We can't let him live anymore.

917
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,110
Do you know what you're saying, Ou Xiao'an?

918
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,060
Do you realize the consequences of what you're doing?
