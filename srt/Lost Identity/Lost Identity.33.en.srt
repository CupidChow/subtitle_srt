00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,830
No.

192
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,090
I have a meeting in your station this afternoon.

193
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,280
Then you go ahead with your work. I’ll take my leave.

194
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,390
It's such a large conference room,

195
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,620
and there are only the three of you here

196
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,950
for the meeting with me?

197
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,790
Director Shen...

198
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,990
Where are the others?

199
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,350
They are busy.

200
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,570
Recently, the station has been busy,

201
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,180
and we can’t spare any more people.

202
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,220
If you need anything, just let us know.

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,070
We’ll relay it honestly.

204
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,900
Maybe it’s because I’ve come here so often

205
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,740
that you don’t take me seriously.

206
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,000
Director Shen, you’re overthinking it.

207
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,260
Being busy is a good thing.

208
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,180
What’s worse is when someone gives misguided orders,

209
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,240
causing their subordinates

210
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,180
to work in vain.

211
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,500
Don’t you agree, Captain Wei?

212
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,220
Yes.

213
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,010
Director Shen, you have keen insight.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
By the way, Captain Wei,

215
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,750
that Ye Xuanmin

216
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
I took from you earlier,

217
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,240
who is also known as Chen Ke...

218
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,380
Ye Xuanmin?

219
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,860
Chen Ke?

220
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,190
Vice Captain Feng,

221
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,920
you are unaware of this matter?

222
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,060
This is the task that Captain Wei

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,940
assigned to Vice Captain Wen.

224
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,380
-Wei?
-Feng.

225
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,860
It was a secret mission.

226
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,130
I'll explain it to you later.

227
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,340
Captain Wei,

228
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,340
I plan to have people send Chen Ke back to Yan'an.

229
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,260
Director Shen,

230
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,150
sending Chen Ke back to Yan'an at this time

231
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,180
would just add to our difficulties.

232
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,220
Wen,

233
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,730
you shouldn’t say that.

234
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,950
I believe

235
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,670
adding to our difficulties

236
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,760
is not Director Shen's concern.

237
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,620
What Director Shen cares about is the major issue

238
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,020
of the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks.

239
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,140
See?

240
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,460
Now, sending Ye Xuanmin,

241
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,870
the leader

242
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,850
of the underground organization of the Communist Party

243
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,150
in Shanghai,

244
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,700
who is also known as Chen Ke,

245
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,240
back to Yan'an

246
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,060
is primarily to strengthen the friendship

247
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,670
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

248
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,200
and to support the peace talks.

249
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,770
Director Shen, is it okay for me

250
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,560
to understand it this way?

251
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,640
Vice Captain Feng,

252
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,270
what do you think?

253
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,930
What do I think?

254
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,030
I know nothing.

255
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,760
I’d rather hear your thoughts first.

256
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,900
Vice Captain Feng’s daughter

257
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,230
is about to get married.

258
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,740
He can’t focus on the affairs in the station.

259
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,820
So, he really doesn’t know.

260
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,750
Wei.

261
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,220
What do you mean?

262
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,510
I was just telling

263
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,580
Director Shen the good news for you in advance.

264
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,620
See? You overthought again.

265
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,920
I hadn't finished speaking just now.

266
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,860
Chen Ke

267
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,270
is to be sent back to Yan'an.

268
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,550
But who will send him and how to send him

269
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,670
is the key.

270
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,860
Here's my plan.

271
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,780
We'll find a few competent inspection personnel

272
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,990
within our NBIS

273
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,300
to take Chen Ke away under the pretense of defection

274
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,830
and send him back to Yan'an.

275
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,620
That way, our people will be able to

276
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,180
successfully infiltrate Yan'an

277
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,819
and send us information from the inside.

278
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,540
I understand Director Shen's intention.

279
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,740
This so-called Kuomintang-Communist peace talks

280
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,109
are just

281
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,829
a formality, right?

282
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,859
Sooner or later, we'll fight again.

283
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,589
By then,

284
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,640
our people who have infiltrated their ranks

285
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,220
will play their role, right?

286
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,900
They will be able to send us

287
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,069
the information we need,

288
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,780
causing all of their plans to fail.

289
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,670
Yes.

290
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,140
I call this plan

291
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,900
Termite Project.

292
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,900
So, how are you going to select

293
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,560
those personnel you mentioned earlier?

294
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,260
We'll inform all Section Chief-level

295
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,460
and above officers within the station.

296
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,740
Those who are willing

297
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,630
can volunteer.

298
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Then, we'll screen the candidates.

299
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,140
Volunteer?

300
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,140
Yes.

301
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,590
In a place like Yan'an, which is extremely dangerous,

302
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,540
any slight mistake could lead to exposure.

303
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,140
We can't just

304
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,030
randomly select people to go.

305
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,060
Interesting.

306
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,460
Director Shen's plan is really interesting.

307
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,310
Especially the volunteer part,

308
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,120
it's very thoughtful.

309
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,100
Director Shen,

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,310
I have a request.

311
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,540
I hope that in this Termite Project,

312
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,350
like last time with 810,

313
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,380
you will personally take charge and lead us

314
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,440
to complete this task successfully.

315
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,110
Captain Wei, do you think I have nothing to do

316
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,380
at headquarters?

317
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,010
I can't take charge of everything, can I?

318
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,100
I've already entrusted Li Shaotang

319
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,960
with full responsibility for the Termite Project.

320
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,220
He will decide

321
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,690
on the candidates.

322
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,620
Feng,

323
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,040
congratulations.

324
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,590
[Feng Mansion]

325
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,860
Uncle, I’m Dachun.

326
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,310
Uncle, I’m Dachun.

327
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,230
I’m Dachun, Uncle.

328
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
I'm from Dongbei.

329
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,340
My grandma is Fengqin. I'm Fengqin's grandson.

330
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,940
Look at me, Uncle.

331
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,620
Lunatic.

332
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,910
Dongbei! Uncle!

333
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,800
Get him away!

334
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,850
Uncle!

335
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,060
Let go!

336
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,550
Uncle!

337
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,720
Don't shoot!

338
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,580
I'm afraid of dying.

339
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,870
I mean no harm, Uncle.

340
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,150
Don't let them shoot.

341
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm Li Shaotang's brother.

342
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,470
Uncle, tell them not to shoot.

343
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,910
I mean no harm.

344
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,990
Who?

345
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,220
Li Shaotang. Li Shaotang.

346
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,460
Who are you?

347
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,310
Captain Feng,

348
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,160
take a look at the person in the photo.

349
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,260
Do you know him?

350
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,050
No.

351
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,970
Let me explain it to you.

352
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,030
This big one is me,

353
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,220
Li Dachun.

354
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,550
This small one

355
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,740
is Li Shaotang.

356
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,180
Nonsense.

357
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,460
Take another look.

358
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
How could I talk nonsense to you?

359
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,380
We share the same mother,

360
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,110
but not the same father.

361
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,720
When I was six,

362
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,160
Dongbei was occupied.

363
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,020
The Japanese killed my dad.

364
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,860
My mother was a spineless woman.

365
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,340
I know it's not right to speak ill of her,

366
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,140
but do you know how lowly she was?

367
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,540
She hooked up with a Japanese man!

368
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,340
She claimed it was for my own good!

369
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,470
Less than two months after my dad died,

370
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,300
she married that Japanese man

371
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,510
and took me to Japan.

372
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,220
The next year, she gave birth to this bastard.

373
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,980
His name is Asano Aohiko.

374
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,630
I’m seven years

375
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,110
older than him.

376
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,540
I didn’t get along with his bastard dad.

377
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,000
When I was sixteen,

378
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,440
I returned to Dongbei.

379
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,780
Ridiculous.

380
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,280
When you were sixteen,

381
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,820
this child was only 7 or 8 years old.

382
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,350
How could I possibly be sure

383
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,460
that he is Li Shaotang?

384
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,060
Listen to me.

385
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
In 1940,

386
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,660
my mom...

387
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,990
When I went to Tokyo for her funeral, I saw him.

388
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,070
At that time, he was in college.

389
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,880
He spoke only Japanese

390
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,580
and pretended not to understand Chinese.

391
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,340
He never spoke a word to me.

392
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,540
So,

393
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,780
how did he suddenly

394
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,390
become your son-in-law?

395
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,150
If I hadn't seen it in the newspaper, I wouldn't have known.

396
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,430
My brother

397
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,130
is unconscionable

398
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,370
and cold-hearted.

399
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
On the wedding day,

400
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,660
if the groom's family is not present,

401
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,980
and others start gossiping,

402
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,940
it will be embarrassing for you.

403
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,470
It's none of your business.

404
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,500
How can it be none of my business?

405
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,740
We're in-laws,

406
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,420
the closest kind.

407
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,060
Besides,

408
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,750
if it gets out that a senior official in the NBIS

409
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,960
has a bastard son-in-law,

410
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,480
wouldn’t that be a problem?

411
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,860
Sit back.

412
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,980
Looks like

413
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,280
you have something to ask for.

414
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,860
Twenty gold bars.

415
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,860
Once I get them,

416
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,140
I’ll disappear.

417
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,180
Aren’t you afraid of biting off more than you can chew?

418
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,630
I have a big appetite.

419
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,260
I can handle five big pork knuckles in one meal.

420
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,460
Since you said your brother is cold-hearted,

421
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,990
you should ask him

422
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,690
for those 20 gold bars.

423
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,980
He doesn’t have any money.

424
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,420
In the future,

425
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,820
he’ll still need to rely on you for money, right?

426
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,220
If he really does have some,

427
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,950
he’ll have to wait until you...

428
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,020
How dare you!

429
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,260
Captain Feng,

430
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,830
may you live a long life.

431
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,780
If you give me the gold bars,

432
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
I’ll burn incense for you every day.

433
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,990
What do you think?

434
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,860
Twenty gold bars, right?

435
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
I don’t have them.

436
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,780
I’m currently preparing for a wedding,

437
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,510
and there are many expenses. How about...

438
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,420
you give me a few days?

439
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,750
Fine.

440
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,070
I'll go to the wedding the day after tomorrow.

441
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
Do you think

442
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,300
it’s okay for the groom’s brother

443
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,380
to go?

444
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,220
You’re quite something.

445
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,220
Tomorrow night at seven.

446
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,500
Xianqiao Cave.

447
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,530
I’ll bring them to you.

448
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,950
I don't have to go to the wedding. This will do.

449
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,070
But Captain Feng,

450
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,720
could you pass on my regards to Qinyan?

451
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,620
I came all the way from Dongbei,

452
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,540
and my wallet is empty now.

453
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,210
Could you provide some

454
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,100
assistance to your in-law?

455
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,740
Captain Feng, you’re indeed generous.

456
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,420
Get lost.

457
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,540
Get lost?

458
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
I'm getting lost.

459
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
I'm getting lost.

460
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,740
I'll leave you alone.

461
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,980
Asano Aohiko?

462
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,940
Master refuses to eat.

463
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,440
It's fine. You my leave us now.

464
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,880
Mrs. Wu made so many delicious dishes today.

465
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,150
Dad,

466
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
please eat more.

467
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,650
Make a call and ask Shaotang to come over.

468
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,660
Now?

469
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,030
Isn't it too hasty?

470
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,710
Tell him to drop whatever he's doing

471
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,240
and come over immediately.

472
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,820
Okay, I'll call him now.

473
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,150
Dad, don't be angry.

474
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,550
Take your time to eat now.

475
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,000
You're fighting a losing battle.

476
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,060
Qiushui,

477
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,100
I know that,

478
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,660
up to now, the higher-ups still can’t be certain

479
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,390
if Ou Xiao'an is truly one of us.

480
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,990
But he did help me deal with

481
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,590
the matter of Zheng Bangyao.

482
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,300
Moreover, I found Secretary Chen

483
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,780
through Lu Ziming.

484
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,350
Miao Jiang is very meticulous.

485
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,000
If she detects

486
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,230
even the slightest clue from Lu Ziming,

487
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,660
it could pose

488
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,300
a risk to me.

489
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,260
The operation is on August 14, right?

490
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,020
Yes.

491
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,070
It’s the night after tomorrow,

492
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,030
when the defenses are the weakest.

493
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,850
Go back and tell Ou Xiao'an

494
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,670
that there will be support for him.

495
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,320
Yes.

496
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,580
Okay.

497
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,310
Dad, why did you tell me to come over?

498
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,670
Dad said he missed you,

499
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,580
so he invited you here for a meal.

500
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,820
I did miss him.

501
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,790
Shaotang is very busy now.

502
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,080
It’s not easy to invite him out, you know?

503
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,430
Dad, you must be joking.

504
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,450
I’ve been busy

505
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,300
delivering invitations.

506
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,550
Besides delivering invitations,

507
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,750
you've been busy with a plan, right?

508
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,620
Dad,

509
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,620
didn’t we agree to enjoy the meal and not talk about work?

510
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Why are we talking about this again?

511
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,980
Alright.

512
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,140
Let's eat.

513
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,360
Dad, I’m feeling a bit unwell.

514
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,600
I need to go out.

515
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,980
Are you alright?

516
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,060
Shaotang,

517
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,460
you've been busy with the Termite Project, right?

518
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,060
If Director Shen hadn't come,

519
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,590
I would still be in the dark.

520
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,860
Director Shen should have already told you, right?

521
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,550
He’s covered the general aspects.

522
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,820
Tell me about the specifics.

523
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,660
Here's the thing.

524
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,190
The station has always been

525
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,700
a bit unclean,

526
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,300
and we haven’t found any communists.

527
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,460
I thought of using

528
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,600
the rescue of Ye Xuanmin as an excuse

529
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,700
to get these potentially problematic individuals

530
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,740
to Yan'an.

531
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,220
Once they’re in Yan'an,

532
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,530
if they are members of the Party,

533
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,220
they’ll continue to stay there

534
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,680
and send us intelligence.

535
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,220
If they are communists,

536
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,580
then the station will be clean,

537
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,470
and we can shut the doors and focus on our work.

538
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,040
It was your idea, wasn't it?

539
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,700
Yes.

540
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,820
Who do you plan to send?

541
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,130
Qin Moqing and Ou Xiao'an.

542
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,560
Since they returned to the station,

543
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,390
they have been suspicious.

544
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,020
Ou Xiao'an?

545
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,150
Good idea.

546
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,940
Here, dad.

547
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660
Shaotang.

548
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,460
The world is really strange.

549
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,340
Today,

550
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,820
I met a madman

551
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,260
on the road.

552
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,350
He’s only a few years older than you.

553
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,420
He suddenly jumped out and stopped my car,

554
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,740
insisting that he was a relative of yours

555
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,590
and wanted to acknowledge me as a distant uncle,

556
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,790
saying he wanted to attend the wedding.

557
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,460
I could tell it was fake

558
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,350
and had someone drive him away.

559
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,860
Dad,

560
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I have to say,

561
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,220
this is your fault.

562
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,550
With the newspaper announcement

563
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,960
and choosing the date,

564
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,510
you’ve stirred up a lot of attention.

565
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,660
For those who are aware, they know it's me and Jingxian's wedding;

566
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,710
but those who aren’t

567
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,290
might think something big is happening in Chongqing.

568
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,490
So everyone feels the need to come and see for themselves.

569
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,900
Yes.

570
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,220
It has caused quite a stir.

571
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,910
Even the headquarters is sending people to attend the wedding.

572
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,510
Why do you think

573
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,260
this madman

574
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,670
specifically wanted

575
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,820
to claim a relation to you?

576
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,580
Well...

577
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,280
Which relative

578
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,190
did he say he is to me?

579
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,830
Master!

580
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,540
Master!

581
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,950
Master,

582
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,220
it seems that Her Ladyship is pregnant!

583
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,890
Congratulations!

584
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,340
Pregnant?

585
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,630
Have you finished reading?

586
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,990
Just finished.

587
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,420
Don’t you find it strange?

588
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,860
Strange?

589
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,310
It's really strange.

590
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,970
[Recruitment Notice of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the National Government]

591
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,380
Not to mention that they’ll send Chen Ke

592
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,020
to Yan'an,

593
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,260
this notice is mainly about

594
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,990
sending undercover agents to Yan'an.

595
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,070
I’ve never seen a notice

596
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,380
recruiting undercover agents before.

597
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,350
The most important point is that

598
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,580
he arranged for Li Shaotang, who's from the Special Technology Research Section,

599
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,510
to carry out this Termite Project.

600
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,550
So I’m not sure

601
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,630
whether these people

602
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
have gone mad

603
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,500
or they’re just confident that their strategy

604
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,710
is smarter than ours.

605
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,900
This is a confidential document, confidential.

606
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,840
[[Confidential case]]

607
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,870
Recruiting undercover agents?

608
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,120
I think

609
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,300
they must be

610
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,270
setting a trap

611
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,930
to see who will fall for it.

612
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,230
So what should we do?

613
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,260
Should we fall for it?

614
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,140
Either way, you can’t act.

615
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,540
With your current situation,

616
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,940
any slight intervention

617
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,510
will confirm their suspicions about you.

618
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,380
If anyone should fall for it, it should be me.

619
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,700
But I don’t mind.

620
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,850
They’ve suspected me for so long,

621
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,260
and I’m still fine, right?

622
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,800
About this matter,

623
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,020
I'll arrange to meet with Li Shaotang

624
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,830
and see what he's really up to.

625
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,750
Will it work?

626
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,580
We'll see.

627
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,330
Alright.

628
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,860
Be careful.

629
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm fine.

630
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,300
Come in.

631
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,040
Section Chief Li, are you busy?

632
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,699
Captain Zeng?

633
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,219
What brings you here?

634
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,429
Nothing much.

635
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,139
It's just that I'm not on duty today,

636
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,199
so I came to see you.

637
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,800
Come, have a seat. Let's talk.

638
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,820
Go ahead.

639
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,420
Section Chief Li,

640
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,860
I'm not very educated.

641
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,900
In my life, I’ve always admired highly educated people

642
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,500
like you who have studied abroad.

643
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,580
Captain Zeng,

644
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,980
just say what you want to say.

645
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,380
You seem straightforward.

646
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,710
I'll get to the point.

647
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,340
Although we’re currently in a period

648
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,550
of peaceful nation-building,

649
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,580
anyone with a keen eye

650
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,910
knows that

651
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,060
a war between

652
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,220
the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party is inevitable.

653
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,110
I know that you,

654
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,340
Section Chief Li, serve the Kuomintang selflessly,

655
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,200
seeking neither profit nor fame.

656
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,420
I, Zeng Jiwu, am exactly the same.

657
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,990
You have a plan, and I have experience.

658
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,420
Let’s join forces.

659
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,860
Join forces?

660
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,660
How?

661
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,510
Section Chief Li,

662
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,100
you are playing dumb with me, aren't you?

663
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,500
It's obvious.

664
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,260
With my perceptiveness,

665
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,700
I would know right away

666
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,710
if the Communists passed by me.

667
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,100
Captain Zeng,

668
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,120
I understand what you mean.

669
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,550
Since Director Shen has kept you in the station,

670
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,280
I will definitely consider it.

671
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,670
It's an honor to work with Section Chief Li

672
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,260
for the Kuomintang.

673
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,220
It’s my honor!

674
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,230
Section Chief Ou.

675
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,660
What is it?

676
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,630
You must have heard that I’m going to get married.

677
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,430
After thinking it over,

678
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,760
I’d like to invite you.

679
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,980
Sure.

680
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,120
I wish you all the best.

681
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,020
Thank you.

682
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,700
If there's nothing else,

683
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,080
shall we have a meal together?

684
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,580
Sure.

685
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,680
I’ll book a place and let you know.

686
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,150
Director Liu.

687
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
It's Feng Yunian.

688
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,550
I have a favor to ask.

689
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,430
Please help me look up a person.

690
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,380
A Japanese

691
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,790
named

692
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,460
Asano Aohiko.

693
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,500
He should have graduated

694
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,100
from the University of Tokyo about 8 years ago.

695
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,150
Yes.

696
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,300
I need all information

697
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,280
related to him.

698
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,140
Alright.

699
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,350
Okay, thank you.

700
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,110
Shaotang is getting married.

701
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,700
Time flies.

702
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,670
I...

703
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,460
sincerely...

704
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,180
wish you a happy marriage.

705
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,150
Thank you.

706
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,870
Nice wine.

707
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,100
Not bad, right?

708
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,390
I specifically chose this place

709
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,460
so you could enjoy some hometown wine,

710
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,330
eat some hometown dishes,

711
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,020
and talk about your time in Japan.

712
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,470
What does that mean?

713
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,140
I just want you to reminisce about

714
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,340
the taste of home.

715
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,430
I don’t have any other intentions.

716
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,620
We’ve just started drinking,

717
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,080
and you’re already drunk?

718
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,190
Did you invite me today

719
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,300
because of Jingxian?

720
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,860
No.

721
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,830
Don't get me wrong.

722
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,310
You two are getting married tomorrow.

723
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,280
You should have some confidence.

724
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,500
Besides, Jingxian and I are not meant to be together.

725
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,620
Even if I try, it won’t work.

726
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,980
I’m really here to give you my blessing.

727
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,820
Also,

728
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
I want to ask you

729
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,870
about the Termite Project.

730
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,060
Termite Project?

731
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
Shouldn't you

732
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,160
ask Director Shen about this?

733
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,830
Actually, I should have asked Director Shen.

734
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,020
But then I thought,

735
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,900
such a despicable idea

736
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,420
must have come from you.

737
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,220
You know me well.

738
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,430
I did this for the good of the station.

739
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,420
Think about it. Lately, we’ve been investigating

740
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,940
the communists every day.

741
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,030
Instead of doubting everyone,

742
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,100
why not send some people to infiltrate Yan'an?

743
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,660
Ye Xuanmin is there too.

744
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,230
It’s a great idea.

745
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,040
Now that you mention it,

746
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,210
I actually think it’s a good idea.

747
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,620
It’s a smart move.

748
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,340
But why would Yan'an

749
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
trust our NBIS people?

750
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Section Chief Ou,

751
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,940
you have experience

752
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,220
in infiltrating Scott Road

753
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,230
and were highly valued by Ohashi.

754
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,340
Do you really need to ask me

755
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,630
how to do it?

756
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,620
I do know.

757
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,120
But look at how hard

758
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,980
I was beaten by Ohashi.

759
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,460
I almost died.

760
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,230
About the Termite Project...

761
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,340
Are you interested in it,

762
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,220
or is Section Chief Qin?

763
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,550
I don’t care

764
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,030
about others.

765
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,470
But let me speak for myself.

766
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,420
Actually, I’m not interested either.

767
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,110
I just can’t stand

768
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,710
staying in this chaotic Chongqing Station

769
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,860
any longer.

770
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,940
I want to leave.

771
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,940
You want to go?

772
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,100
Don't joke with me.

773
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,620
I'm not.

774
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,900
I really want to leave.

775
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,790
Besides,

776
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,100
if I leave,

777
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,750
won’t you be happy?

778
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,300
If I leave Chongqing Station,

779
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,260
you’ll be free here

780
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,830
in the future.

781
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,960
No one will be able to stop you.

782
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,670
You know me well.

783
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,180
Okay.

784
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,190
I’ll apply to Director Shen

785
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,900
to make arrangements for you.

786
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,140
Three days later,

787
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
go and rescue Ye Xuanmin.

788
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,060
Three days won’t do.

789
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,310
It’s too short.

790
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,300
How many days do you want?

791
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,310
Ten days.

792
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,540
Ten days?

793
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,400
Are you kidding me?

794
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,700
In the station,

795
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,860
I still have a lot of work to hand over,

796
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,860
right?

797
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,650
Three days is too rushed to get everything done.

798
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,590
But as far as I know,

799
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,460
there isn’t any work at the station

800
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,020
that only you can handle.

801
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,710
Section Chief Ou, right?

802
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,990
Look at you.

803
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,940
I offered you a couple of drinks,

804
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,520
and now you look down on me.

805
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,700
What did you mean

806
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,930
by that?

807
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
I have to

808
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,900
investigate the communists, right?

809
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,420
I have to

810
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,820
find Japanese spies, right?

811
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,980
You set up a trap

812
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,310
to capture Mao Renxing in Guizhou.

813
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,620
During that time, he was ambushed.

814
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,180
I need to find out

815
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,130
whether you met with Ohashi

816
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,030
while you were missing.

817
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,700
I need to clear your name, brother.

818
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,350
I hope you can clear my name as soon as possible.

819
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,190
I'll give you ten days to investigate.

820
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,060
On the 11th day,

821
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,430
I’ll kill Ye Xuanmin.

822
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,060
By then,

823
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,780
the one who is a communist

824
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,960
will be the one who is anxious.

825
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,380
Keep your promise.

826
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,660
Xiao'an,

827
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,300
having you as my opponent

828
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,000
makes me happy.

829
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,820
Having you as my opponent

830
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,780
makes me sick.

831
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,100
Let’s stop talking about work and eat.
