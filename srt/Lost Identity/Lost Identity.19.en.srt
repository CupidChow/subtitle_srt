00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,110
I made a joke with him.

15

21
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,240

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,200
KW30

197
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,600
is the latest virus the Japanese are working on.

198
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,530
They are using prisoners from 810

199
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,590
to conduct living experiments.

200
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,410
Every prisoner who was injected with the virus

201
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,830
died very painful deaths.

202
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,810
You remember everything now?

203
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,830
No.

204
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,880
I have

205
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,200
some images in my mind.

206
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,230
Long time no see,

207
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,520
Mr. Ou.

208
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,000
This is where

209
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,460
you torture us, right?

210
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,830
What do you think?

211
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,900
If that's heaven,

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,430
then this is hell.

213
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,390
We transported everything

214
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,790
from Shanghai to Burma.

215
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,520
But I felt like

216
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,150
something was missing.

217
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,840
You're what's missing.

218
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,740
Besides,

219
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,100
you still have what I want in your head.

220
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,370
What you want

221
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
is not in my mind anymore.

222
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,020
As long as you cooperate with us

223
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,350
and write out the Cherry Blossom Project,

224
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,060
you'll still be my distinguished friend.

225
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,360
I...

226
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,740
I really want to cooperate with you and write it out.

227
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,250
But I can't remember it anymore.

228
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,160
I have no choice then.

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,910
Mr. Ando.

230
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,760
He's yours.

231
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,640
Yes.

232
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,270
Mr. Ou.

233
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,350
Please.

234
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,950
Mr. Ou.

235
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,940
After we parted in Shanghai,

236
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,440
I really missed you.

237
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,720
Mr. Ou.

238
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,280
Do you remember

239
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,390
all the data and information

240
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,990
about the virus experiments

241
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,960
in the Cherry Blossom Project  information booklet now?

242
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,220
I...I can't remember.

243
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,020
Mr. Ou,

244
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,839
I'm starting.

245
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,660
This medicine

246
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,200
will amplify the sensations of your tactile nerves.

247
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,690
Here, relax.

248
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,670
The more tense you are,

249
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,280
the more painful it'll be.

250
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,570
Let's start the countdown.

251
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,140
About two minutes.

252
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,930
Now,

253
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,400
you'll feel pressure in your lungs

254
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,990
slowly building up.

255
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,240
Your throat

256
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,260
is filling up.

257
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,920
Your eyes

258
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,060
are swelling up.

259
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,950
Yes.

260
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,210
The pain you feel now

261
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,430
is ten times what you feel in reality,

262
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,280
maybe even a hundred times.

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
Yes.

265
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,960
Time's up.

266
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,480
Let's move on to the first item.

267
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,640
Here, follow my command.

268
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,110
Stretch your fingers slowly.

269
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,710
Yes.

270
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,210
Slowly.

271
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,470
Open

272
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,830
your hand, yes.

273
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,530
Do you feel like

274
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
someone is

275
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,470
trying to break your fingers?

276
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,140
Now, your finger is broken.

277
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes.

278
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,430
Is it different from that time in Shanghai?

279
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,250
Mr. Ou.

280
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,710
Now,

281
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,210
we are going to

282
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
the second item.

283
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you feel

284
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,420
the pressure

285
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,020
on your throat getting worse?

286
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,520
Yeah.

287
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,300
Like you're

288
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,580
suffocating.

289
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,580
Yes.

290
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,630
Suffocate. You can't breathe.

291
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,600
Now follow me,

292
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,200
follow my command.

293
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,180
Yes.

294
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,280
You can only stop when I say stop.

295
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes.

296
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,050
Suffocate.

297
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,260
Suffocate.

298
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,200
Stop.

299
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,500
No.

300
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,200
How is it, Mr. Ou?

301
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,020
Do you remember now?

302
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,750
Don't.

303
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't.

304
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,130
Then I can only

305
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,930
continue.

306
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,910
Don't.

307
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,160
No!

308
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,230
♫Find a reason for myself♫

309
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,780
♫I bow my head in times of trouble♫

310
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,960
♫Whenever I raise my head♫

311

♫What's there to worry about?♫

♫Standing hesitantly at the crossroads♫

315
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,390
♫Can't see through♫

♫Have long disappeared♫

♫That rainbow♫

336

Help! Help!

337
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,800
Someone died!

338
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,710
Help!

339
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,760
Someone died! Help!

340
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,990
Help! Someone died!

341
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,530
Help!

342
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,070
Help! Help!

343
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,870
Drag him out.

344
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,710
Yes.

345
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,230
Help! Someone died!

346
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,600
Someone died! Help!

347
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,560
Is he still alive?

348
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,190
Didn't you say the KW30 vaccine trial

349
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,160
had shown

350
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,790
some preliminary success on him?

351
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,470
No matter what it takes,

352
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,280
bring him back to life.

353
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,710
It's too late.

354
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,440
He's dead.

355
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,150
Bastard!

356
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,950
Yes.

357
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,160
We have to start over again.

358
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,640
Take the body away.

359
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,990
Stop knocking!

360
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,840
Stop knocking!

361
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,000
Stop knocking!

362
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,400
Stop knocking!

363
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,930
Stop knocking!

364
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
Stop knocking.

365
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,680
Stop knocking.

366
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,370
Stop knocking.

367
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,240
Stop knocking.

368
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Stop knocking!

369
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
What the hell do you think you're doing?

370
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,900
What do you want?

371
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,410
Dignity.

372
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,140
It's you again.

373
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
We want dignity.

374
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,720
We want food that's fit for humans.

375
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,780
We want longer

376
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,850
out of cell time.

377
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,110
Who are you to negotiate with me?

378
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,110
All of us here today

379
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,230
can guarantee that

380
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,870
any experimental subject you choose

381
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,830
will end up committing suicide.

382
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,410
We'll make sure that

383
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,030
your experiment

384
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,570
never succeeds.

385
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,980
Can we do it?

386
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,660
We Chinese are not afraid of death!

387
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,950
We Chinese are not afraid of death!

388
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,270

There's no other way.

is Shangguan Haifeng.

411
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,610
This was his idea.

412
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,540
I tried to talk to him,

413
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,220
but he felt that, as a

414
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,050
test subject for the Japanese,

415
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,780
if the experiment succeeded,

416
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,960
he wouldn't be able to face

his faith.

418
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,680
So he decided

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,980
to end his life

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,170
in this way.

Have you ever wondered

00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,230
why Ohashi built it underground?

457

458

Only by building it underground

460
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,940
would it be easier to hide

develop the vaccine for this virus.

491

Once he succeeds,

where 810 is

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,320
Mr. Ou.

579
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,960
You can write out the entire

580
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,700
Cherry Blossom Project.

581
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,000
Yes.

582
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,160
You're amazing.

583
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,950
You can remember

584
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,970
hundreds of pages of information.

585
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,600
From now on,

586
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,540
you have to give me at least 10 pages a day.

587
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,670
Then, I'll put you

588
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,280
in the experimental team of Cherry Blossom Project

589
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,540
to conduct experiments with Dr. Mitsui.

590
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,950
I believe,

591
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,440
with you on board,

592
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,030
the plan will move faster.

593
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,950
10 pages.

594
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,510
Too many.

595
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,710
I can't get that much out in a day.

596
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,040
Chief Ohashi.

597
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,400
Can you get Ando

598
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,950
to stop doing experiments on me?

599
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,240
My head's been all messed up

600
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,070
because of him.

601
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,510
Also,

602
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,790
can I

603
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,840
go out everyday

604
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,830
to get some sun?

605
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,120
Just for a little while.

606
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,160
Let me...

607
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,190
Let me sober up.

608
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,280
Who are you to bargain with me?

609
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,310
10 pages

610
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,280
a day.

611
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,680
I'll help you

612
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,510
write 10 pages a day.

613
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,390
Let me have some sun.

614
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,040
Okay.

615
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,590
I promise you.

616
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,750
I'll let you go up twice a day.

617
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,870
10 minutes each, in the morning and afternoon.

618
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,510
But you must

619
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,070
give me 10 pages.

620
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,120
Okay.

621
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,820
Okay.

622
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,450

652

What you have so far

653
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,930
is all partial.

654
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,360
I can only go to these areas now.

655
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,890
I can't go anywhere else.

656
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,730
Where is the guard post?

657
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,190
Not counting the prison area,

658
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,790
in the out of cell area alone,

659
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,120
there are four guards

660
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,440
and three more patrols below.

661
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,070
Four shifts a day.

662
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,640
The two shifts after our out of cell time

663
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,720
is the most relaxed.

664
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,920
They often go out for breaks and to chat.

665
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,950
I also heard

666
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,040
that there's...

667
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,750
Ou Xiao'an.

668
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,030
What's up?

669
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,580
I know what you're planning with those guys.

670
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,610
Count me in.

671
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,910
I can give you information.

672
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,170
Which department are you from?

673
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,340
Count you in?

674
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,700
What are you doing?

675
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,670
You guys want to escape,

676
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,920
right?

677
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,220
Have you eaten too much?

678
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,030
Do you think I’ve been in 810

679
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,690
working against my conscience with the Japanese

680
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,680
for nothing?

681
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,050
Let me tell you.

682
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,200
You're not the first person

683
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,720
to try to get out of here.

684
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,060
Plus, you know that

685
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,390
even if you guys manage to escape,

686
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,480
first, you don't know the environment.

687
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,360
Second, you don't know the route.

688
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,320
The Japanese will catch you again really quickly.

689
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,550
I know the coordinates of 810.

690
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,170
The precise coordinates.

691
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,360
Trust me.

692
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,260
You will need my help.

693
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,800
If you know so much,

694
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,230
run away yourself then.

695
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,210
Are you too used to being a traitor

696
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,850
so you're talking to me on behalf of Ohashi?

697
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,080
Do you think I really want to stay here

698
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,440
and be a traitor for the Japanese forever?

699
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,880
I really want to get out.

700
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,660
Ou Xiao'an.

701
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,910
Take me with you.

702
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,490
Or I'll report you to the Japanese immediately.

703
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,980
Hurry up then.

704
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,170
97°26′ E.

705
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,520
What?

706
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,550
97°26′ E.

707
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,840
The position of longitude of this place.

708
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,170
You're a special agent.

709
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,960
You can do the math based on how you came

710
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,750
and check

711
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,830
if I lied to you.

712
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,940
Think about it carefully.

713
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,750
When you've decided,

714
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,150
come to me with your plan.

715
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,080
I'll give you the exact latitude then.

716
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,990
Take me with you

717
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,400
and you'll have a better chance of getting out of here.
