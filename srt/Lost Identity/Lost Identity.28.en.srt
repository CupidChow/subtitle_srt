00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,550
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,979
The saddest part is that the two communists

5
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,460
are still alive,

6
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,550
but they've been thrown into the river

7
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,670
beside the village.

8
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,780
If it weren't for Ye Xuanmin

9
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,860
and Li Manqiu's help,

10
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,500
I would have died in the dungeon long ago.

11
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,810
Section Chief Qin!

12
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,130
Section Chief Qin!

13
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,280
What are you shouting for?

14
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,110
Section Chief Qin,

15
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,170
Vice Captain Wen wants to see you now.

16
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,130
Okay, I got it.

17
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,560
Take the stuff for me.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,160
Yes.

19
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,150
Captain Wu,

20
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,270
you and Yang Jieli of the 20th Army go way back,

21
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,250
and he still owes you a leg.

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,170
When did that happen?

23
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,620
In the 1934 counterattacks on the Encirclement and Extermination Campaign,

24
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,030
I shot him in the left leg.

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,820
Doesn't that mean he owes me a leg?

26
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,150
Captain Wu, you're really something.

27
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,360
You even got me there.

28
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,440
If they dare to impersonate soldiers from the 20th Army,

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I dare to pretend to be their savior.

30
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,510
It's just a pity

31
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,910
that we still failed to save Secretary Chen

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,040
and Comrade Manqiu.

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,560
Comrades, hang in there.

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,250
We'll reach our territory soon.

35
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,010
Yes!

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm Yang Jieli from the 794th Regiment, 20th Army.

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,160
Hello, Regimental Commander Yang.

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,980
I'm Wen Yishan from the NBIS Chongqing Station.

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,550
Thank you for your support.

40
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,590
Didn’t you say you needed us here to suppress the communists?

41
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,190
Where is the guerrilla team?

42
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,910
It's all a misunderstanding.

43
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,670
The captain of the guerrilla team is Wu Guangxian.

44
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,240
He said he's your friend.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,810
We're both here to catch Ohashi. Nothing serious,

46
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,950
so I let them go.

47
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,940
Wu Guangxian?

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,750
Yes.

49
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,690
And he said we were friends?

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,910
Yes. Yes.

51
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,780
Do you know how my leg was crippled?

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,570
He shot it!

53
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,450
Sir.

54
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,110
Regimental Commander Yang must be tired from his journey.

55
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,010
The meal is ready.

56
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,600
Let them eat first.

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,510
Yes, let's eat first.

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,070
Regimental Commander Yang, let's eat first.

59
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,700
You just won't open your mouth, right?

60
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,810
Even your emperor has announced your surrender.

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,570
How long are you going to hold out?

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,690
His Imperial Majesty has never stated that our empire has been defeated.

63
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,659
We've merely received the Joint Announcement

64
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,320
and declared an end to the war.

65
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,550
Is there a difference between "end" and "defeat"?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,530
If there was no difference,

67
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,140
you could shoot me right now.

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,660
I won't kill you now.

69
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,420
I'll take you back to Chongqing.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,120
You have an old friend there.

71
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,620
He'll get you to talk.

72
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,350
Moqing,

73
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,560
how is the Regimental Commander Yang?

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,890
Everything is settled.

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,190
They're full,

76
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,880
and they are finally soothed.

77
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,090
That communist bastard Wu

78
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,720
made a fool of me.

79
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,170
Sir,

80
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,940
how's Ohashi?

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,230
Still won't talk.

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,370
We're going back to Chongqing tomorrow.

83
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,540
You rest early today.

84
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
You too.

85
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,080
Section Chief Qin,

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,340
going out at this hour?

87
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,560
I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,370
How about I send two men with you?

89
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,330
No need.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
Stay alert.

91
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,570
Keep an eye on the prisoner.

92
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,170
Yes.

93
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,130
Who is it? Don't come over!

94
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,310
Don't come over!

95
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,190
Don't come over!

96
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,290
Secretary Chen!

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
Don't be nervous.

98
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,950
Let me check Secretary Chen's injury first.

99
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm here to save you.

100
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,670
How long has Secretary Chen been in a coma?

101
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,909
Who exactly are you?

102
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,590
How do you know Secretary Chen?

103
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,170
You're Li Manqiu, right?

104
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,550
It's hard to explain

105
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,050
my identity to you at the moment. Listen to me.

106
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,910
NBIS's men are all over the place.

107
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,940
You and Secretary Chen are seriously injured.

108
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,350
Even if they don't find you,

109
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,920
this place is remote and lacks medicine,

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,050
so there is no way you can get out alive.

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,670
Come with me.

112
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,300
I will ensure your safety with Secretary Chen.

113
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,410
To where?

114
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,580
Why should I trust you?

115
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,020
Father.

116
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,690
Mother.

117
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,870
In order to fight against the Japanese with the guerrilla team,

118
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,690
I asked Mantun to lie to you

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,290
that I went to the back mountain to gather hay.

120
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,410
I didn't expect

121
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,310
to be gone for five years.

122
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,380
This is my letter to my parents.

123
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,830
How did you know?

124
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,410
Section Chief Qin!

125
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,730
Section Chief Qin!

126
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Listen to me.

127
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,210
Secretary Chen's illness can't be postponed.

128
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,050
Trust me.

129
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,640
Section Chief Qin!

130
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,670
Captain Zeng.

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,500
It's really you.

132
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,470
It's late, and you're still up too.

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,880
I heard from the night guard

134
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,260
that you were out alone in the middle of the night.

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,320
It's so dangerous!

136
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,840
I was worried about you.

137
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,750
Section Chief Qin,

138
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,510
are those two...

139
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,080
Didn't Captain Wu say

140
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,070
that two communists were missing?

141
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,260
I couldn't sleep, so I came out to have a walk.

142
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,060
I didn't expect to run into them.

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,840
They're half dead.

144
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,410
Section Chief Qin, you...

145
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,270
What are you going to do with them?

146
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,760
Take them back to Chongqing.

147
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,140
What if we can save them?

148
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,170
With two communists in our hands.

149
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,740
Well,

150
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
they may have some use for us.

151
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
I knew

152
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,100
that our Section Chief Qin had foresight.

153
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,480
Stop flattering me.

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,760
If I have credit for it, you'll be part of it.

155
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,080
It's getting late. Take them back.

156
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,020
Sir.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,060
They are the two missing communists?

158
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes.

159
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,240
Just leave them here.

160
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,120
Get ready to go.

161
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,960
Sir,

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,430
I suggest taking them

163
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,600
to Chongqing for treatment.

164
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,540
They are badly injured. If we leave them here,

165
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,670
they won't survive.

166
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,540
Are you kidding me?

167
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm already merciful enough not to kill them,

168
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,350
and you want me to take them back to Chongqing?

169
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,990
Let's go.

170
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,760
Vice Captain Wen,

171
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,890
I suggest we take them back to Chongqing.

172
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,080
If they die on the way, just dispose of the bodies.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,190
What if we save them, and they can give us some valuable intel?

174
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,190
What do you think?

175
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,990
Okay, don't delay the departure.

176
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,760
Yes.

177
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,210
Come, take them to the car.

178
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,570
Good for you.

179
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,930
You’re a fast learner.

180
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,600
Section Chief Qin,

181
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,460
it's all thanks to your guidance.

182
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,440
Now the Japanese have surrendered.

183
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,090
All that's left are us and the communists.

184
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,790
We'll know

185
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,320
once we make the first move.

186
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,230
You're good.

187
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,980
You really know how to go,

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,660
whichever way the wind blows.

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,730
Section Chief Qin,

190
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,410
don't you think the man who passed out

191
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,050
looks a bit familiar?

192
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,250
Well, are you a hunting dog?

193
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,050
Everyone looks familiar to you?

194
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,920
What?

195
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,750
You even made friends with the communists?

196
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,720
How can I make friends with them?

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,530
I had dealings with him in Shanghai.

198
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,360
The book writer.

199
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,110
He is quite famous. Don't you remember?

200
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,310
Think about it again.

201
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,360
You mean...

202
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,700
Ye Xuanmin.

203
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,400
This man

204
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,830
is my pledge of loyalty to join the station.

205
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,440
You're good.

206
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,480
How did you recognize him?

207
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,040
Didn't you remind me?

208
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,450
Did I?

209
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,710
You didn't?

210
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,510
They're calling you.

211
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,850
I'll be in the back, escorting the car.

212
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,010
You ride with me.

213
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,540
Let's go.

214
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,280
These are

215
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,750
all the construction drawings for the bomb shelter.

216
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,810
I went to check it.

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,990
It's indeed built according to the drawings, no secret room.

218
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,160
So, you mean

219
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,750
there is no gas bomb there,

220
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,660
right?

221
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,790
No.

222
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,010
Xiao'an,

223
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,120
I've been very supportive of your work.

224
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,140
Don't make me look like an idiot

225
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,560
in front of Vice Captain Feng.

226
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,400
Yes.

227
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,530
Think again.

228
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,290
Is there anything suspicious?

229
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes.

230
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,000
Here.

231
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,100
[Central Oxygen Supply System]

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,540
It's a central oxygen supply system.

233
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,140
The entire shelter

234
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,770
gets its fresh air from here.

235
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,780
What's so suspicious about that?

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,060
Every shelter

237
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,810
needs an oxygen supply system.

238
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,200
The entire shelter

239
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,910
depends on this system for oxygen.

240
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,160
If biochemical weapons

241
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,650
[Central Oxygen Exchange Structure]

242
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,500
or gas bombs are deployed here,

243
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,840
over 3,000 people in this shelter

244
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,770
will all be dead.

245
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,120
I see.

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,640
The bomb shelter is fine.

247
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,690
It's just that you didn't trust

248
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,070
Li Shaotang all along, did you?

249
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,090
It's not that I don't trust Li...

250
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,820
You don't trust him either, do you?

251
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,360
Let's not talk about this.

252
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,540
Let's talk about your task.

253
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,070
You need to find the gas bombs

254
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,470
instead of analyzing

255
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,230
some poisoning method with me.

256
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,290
Understand?

257
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes, I see this

258
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,460
could be dangerous. So I'm mentioning it to you.

259
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,110
I'll keep finding the bombs.

260
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,430
Also,

261
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,650
Ohashi will be escorted back tomorrow.

262
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,400
I think I'll leave this task to you.

263
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,660
Keeping Ohashi at the station,

264
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,420
I don't think it's safe.

265
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,650
Got it.

266
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,490
I'll go set up the Huajiang Villa.

267
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,710
Let's keep him there.

268
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,580
I can give you more power.

269
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,050
You can take revenge on him,

270
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,220
but don't kill him.

271
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,690
He is of use to me.

272
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,750
Understand?

273
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Yes.

274
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,010
I'll get going.

275
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,900
Thank you.

276
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
You were already at the door.

277
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,240
Why didn't you just come in?

278
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,530
Someone broke in without knocking earlier.

279
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,990
Didn't you throw him into the Jialing River?

280
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
You know me so well,

281
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,130
yet you still dare to come to me?

282
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,500
If it weren't for the emergency,

283
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,030
I wouldn't have come to you.

284
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,569
Just say it. What is it?

285
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,810
It's my first time here.

286
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,430
This is for you.

287
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,030
Take a look.

288
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,869
Why are you giving me lipstick?

289
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,060
My friend brought it from Paris.

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,590
I think the color will suit you.

291
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,550
Why does this color suit me?

292
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,590
It's like blood.

293
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,090
Of course, it suits you.

294
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,240
Thank you.

295
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,280
My room is small,

296
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,490
so I don't have much to offer as a host.

297
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,040
How long have you been staying here?

298
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,240
I've been living here

299
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,520
since I moved from Beijing to Chongqing.

300
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,330
There are people dead here.

301
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,320
Are you not afraid at night?

302
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,380
What should I be afraid of?

303
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
Just say it.

304
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,300
Why are you here?

305
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,620
Ohashi Kazuya

306
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,090
was caught by your people.

307
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,820
He was caught yesterday,

308
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,630
so he should be escorted back to Chongqing soon.

309
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,910
Have you not heard anything about it

310
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,520
at Chongqing Station?

311
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
I do know

312
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,480
that someone went to Guizhou on a mission.

313
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,080
So, they went to catch him.

314
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,690
Wei Qingming never told me about it.

315
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,470
He must be suspect me.

316
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,170
What do you mean?

317
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,910
Don't tell me you want me to save Ohashi?

318
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,620
Once the Cherry Blossom Project is started,

319
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,660
it will never stop

320
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,400
for anyone.

321
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,580
The problem is

322
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,910
that we can't reach Ohashi's secret spy

323
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,590
at Chongqing Station.

324
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
So you've planted someone else

325
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,790
at Chongqing Station.

326
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,240
There's another person besides you.

327
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,360
Who is it?

328
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,840
His code name is

329
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Lanshan.

330
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,110
Lanshan?

331
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,370
Shaotang,

332
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,010
come help me serve this, will you?

333
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,240
Shaotang?

334
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,840
Shaotang?

335
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,010
Why did you ignore me when I called you?

336
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,980
Did you burn yourself?

337
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,840
I'm fine.

338
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,430
What's wrong?

339
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,680
I called you several times,

340
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
but you seemed not to hear me.

341
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,190
Nothing.

342
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,180
I just

343
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,330
have some trouble at work.

344
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,990
Let's eat.

345
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,100
Here.

346
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
Thank you.

347
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,880
I heard from Dad

348
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,860
that Ou Xiao'an was reinstated

349
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,660
and became the section chief of your Operations Department.

350
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,870
Did he give you a hard time?

351
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,520
No.

352
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,930
Don't worry about it.

353
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,250
Everything is fine.

354
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,650
By the way,

355
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,740
the bomb shelter project

356
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,010
has come to an end.

357
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,260
Your dad specifically asked me

358
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,780
to come back more often to accompany you.

359
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,710
Let's enjoy the meal today.

360
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,710
Drink more. Here.

361
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,080
Let's eat.

362
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,860
Here.

363
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,290
Jingxian,

364
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,130
don't go back

365
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,730
tonight.

366
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,290
Ohashi is his only contact.

367
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,670
All the information and files regarding the Cherry Blossom Project

368
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,840
were secretly sent to us by Lanshan.

369
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,620
Well, as you said,

370
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,420
Ohashi was arrested,

371
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,780
and we lost contact with Lanshan.

372
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,520
It's going to be hard

373
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,080
to proceed with the Cherry Blossom Project, right?

374
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
So, we need you.

375
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,230
What do you want me to do?

376
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,490
We've got a copy of the rest of the files

377
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,530
through Ohashi

378
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,480
and acted on them long ago.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,470
What we lack now

380
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,760
are the construction drawings for the 129th bomb shelter.

381
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,210
If possible,

382
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,930
I hope you can help us get them.

383
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,330
You already knew Wei Qingming started to suspect me,

384
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,850
and you still want me to do it?

385
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,490
We have no other choice.

386
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,190
I need time.

387
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,560
Okay.

388
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,840
Get it

389
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,260
before the victory conference next month.

390
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,990
Also,

391
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,350
Lanshan is someone who has access

392
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,720
to the secret 129th bomb shelter project.

393
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,250
I need you to find him

394
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,600
and reestablish the connection with him.

395
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,670
There is no way I could find

396
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,240
the one you can't find.

397
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,270
You have...

398
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,670
Ohashi to help you at Chongqing Station.

399
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,610
Ever been to Chongqing?

400
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,750
This is also my first time

401
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,650
seeing it without air raids

402
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,330
or bombs.

403
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,470
Normally,

404
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,090
our small car should lead the convoy.

405
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,470
Being stuck behind the big car this whole way

406
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,800
is really frustrating.

407
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,490
We learned our lesson when escorting Mao Renxing.

408
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,430
We need a car at the back to keep watch.

409
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,640
I remember now.

410
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,240
He was swapped, right?

411
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,700
You seem to know quite a lot.

412
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,120
I'm just looking out

413
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,590
for our Chongqing Station wholeheartedly.

414
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,550
Were you involved in the swap?

415
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,420
No.

416
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,580
Section Chief Qin, you can't joke about this.

417
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,290
That was all Ohashi's plan.

418
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,850
I don't have the opportunity to be a part of it.

419
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,740
By the way, Section Chief Qin,

420
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,770
what are you going to do

421
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,930
with those two big shots in Shanghai?

422
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,080
I heard that they had dealings

423
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,260
with many people at our station.

424
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,050
You're really dedicated

425
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,330
to your work.

426
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,870
What do you think?

427
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,320
What do you think we should do about them?

428
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm new here.

429
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,320
You can't listen to me.

430
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,210
I only want

431
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,180
to contribute to our station

432
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,870
and strive for a better future for myself.

433
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,640
It's good that you want to make contributions,

434
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,510
but the station has its own rules.

435
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,760
Don't overplay your hand,

436
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,130
or you will suffer the consequences.

437
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,970
Yes. Yes.

438
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,570
Then, you think I was taking all the credit

439
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,790
in front of Vice Captain Wen before, right?

440
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,310
There are many people at the station,

441
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,610
but not so many credits for us.

442
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,210
What belongs to you is yours.

443
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,360
Don't even think about taking what doesn't belong to you.

444
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,060
You know, without me telling you,

445
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,590
that no one here likes you

446
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,740
except Captain Wei.

447
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,830
Hide your little ideas

448
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,800
and don't show them.

449
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,320
Be careful not to bite off

450
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,670
more than you can chew,

451
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,020
or you might end up digging your own grave.

452
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,830
Thank you for the reminder.

453
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,630
[Chongqing Army Hospital]

454
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Vice Captain Wen,

455
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,150
Wei asked me to escort Ohashi

456
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,630
to Huajiang Villa.

457
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,440
I wonder what he's up to.

458
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,260
How about this? Leave a few of our men there.

459
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,790
After settling them down,

460
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,740
you go back to the station.

461
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,380
Yes.

462
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,750
When are you going to

463
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,470
let me go?

464
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,570
I have to go back to see my mother.

465
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,500
What's the hurry?

466
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,310
We'll talk about it when you feel better.

467
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,020
I feel much better now.

468
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
I don't need you to take care of me.

469
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,960
The government treats all of you equally.

470
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,360
We can't possibly deny you medical treatment.

471
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,320
Understand?

472
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,590
Come on, someone.

473
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,290
Hurry up. Take them in.

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,940
Section Chief Qin.

475
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,540
How is it? What do you think of the arrangement?

476
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,390
Who has a dog nearby?

477
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,850
Section Chief Ou.

478
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,580
Wang Sen.

479
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,420
Are we all set?

480
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,410
Yes.

481
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,970
As you ordered,

482
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,390
the windows have been welded shut with steel bars,

483
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,440
and the barbed wire has been electrified.

484
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,560
Everyone is in position and on standby.

485
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,310
Then only leave a few people at the door.

486
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,530
Don't make it too conspicuous.

487
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,170
Yes.

488
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,260
You two go pick him up.

489
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,020
Yes.

490
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,010
Let everyone take a break and recharge.

491
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,080
The prisoner will soon be here.

492
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes.

493
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,260
-Go.
-Yes.

494
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,580
Who did we prepare this for?

495
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,930
Did we catch him?

496
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,920
Don't ask.

497
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,010
Fine. Fine.

498
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,410
Just pretend I didn't ask anything.

499
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,380
Xiao'an.

500
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,580
Sir,

501
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,720
it's all set.

502
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,590
The room is also set up.

503
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,100
We've put our men

504
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,560
in all the buildings around here. I promise this place is safe.

505
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,410
Xiao'an,

506
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,780
don't be impulsive.

507
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,490
Got it.

508
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,290
Take him down.

509
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,720
Xiao'an, I'm going back to the station.

510
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,130
See you, sir.

511
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,800
Take them out

512
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,350
for a break.

513
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,160
The higher-ups ordered us

514
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,560
not to have Ohashi Kazuya leave our sights.

515
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,460
It's okay. I got here.

516
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,380
Go.

517
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,280
Mr. Ou.

518
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,650
How come it's you, Mr. Ou?

519
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,010
It's been a long time.

520
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,380
How are you?

521
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,070
It's been a long time, indeed.

522
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,080
I'm fine.

523
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,640
How are you doing, Chief Ohashi?

524
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,450
I...

525
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,810
This is what I am right now.

526
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,400
What?

527
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,550
Captain Wei sent you here?

528
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,150
I heard

529
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,320
you were arrested.

530
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,390
Such big news.

531
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,480
So I had to come see you, my old friend.

532
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,510
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

533
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,570
Mr. Ou.

534
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,350
I didn’t take good enough care of you

535
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,180
back in 810,

536
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,190
so you suffered a lot.

537
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,990
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,390
Actually, I should

539
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,950
try all the tricks you used on me

540
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,420
on you in 810.

541
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,530
To feel it.

542
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,630
Oh?

543
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,790
But forget it.

544
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
It's all over now.

545
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,450
Here.

546
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,730
Thank you.

547
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,080
I heard

548
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,130
that you've been reinstated.

549
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,980
You're well-informed.

550
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,530
Congratulations.

551
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,810
Because I've always been caring about you.

552
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,640
Thank you for your concern.

553
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,920
I decorated this place for you.

554
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,030
How is it?

555
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,750
Do you like it?

556
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,940
Very good.

557
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,000
Thank you, Mr. Ou. Thank you.

558
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
It's my duty.

559
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,680
How is your Cherry Blossom Project

560
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,990
going?

561
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,270
Not going so well.

562
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
How is that?

563
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,560
Someone wants

564
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,710
to steal my research results.

565
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,400
You've been watching the plan for so many years.

566
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,470
Someone wants to steal it?

567
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,620
Who has the nerve to do that?

568
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,420
Mr. Ou,

569
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,790
one glass of wine

570
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,130
can't get me to tell you that.

571
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,270
Here.

572
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,290
Thanks for the wine.

573
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,179
You sent someone to kill Ando, right?

574
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,040
Yes.

575
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,050
Ando was killed on my orders.

576
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,190
Good for you.

577
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,250
You sent Elk to kill him, right?

578
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,810
Mr. Ou,

579
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,850
you're well-informed.

580
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,280
Chief Ohashi,

581
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,699
actually, I’m very curious about one thing.

582
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,510
How many spies have you planted

583
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,659
at our Chongqing Station?

584
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,159
I feel like we're surrounded by enemies.
It seems impossible to catch them all.

585
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,650
Mr. Ou,

586
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
let me tell you.

587
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,889
I've planted my "Elks"

588
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,080
all over your Chongqing Station.

589
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,010
We all say

590
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,800
that you're something.

591
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,140
You can make me feel besieged

592
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,520
even when I'm in the NBIS.

593
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,330
Your eyes are everywhere.

594
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,080
But now,

595
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,070
things are different.

596
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,200
The situation has changed too.

597
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,630
I think you need to

598
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,440
carefully consider your position now.

599
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,530
The current situation is

600
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,020
that the more spies there are at the station,

601
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,810
the more unfavorable it is for you.

602
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,960
If news of your arrest

603
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,110
were to get out,

604
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,800
their first idea would likely be

605
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,640
to kill you.

606
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,070
I know that very well.

607
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,990
But

608
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,450
with you,

609
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,480
as well as such a good environment you've prepared for me,

610
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm still very safe here.

611
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
Mr. Ou,

612
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,430
thank you for your care

613
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,840
and the wine.

614
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,210
I hope

615
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,940
you can live comfortably

616
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,230
in the future.

617
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,590

Come on, cheers.

00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,580
What? Who offended you?

622
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,880
Such a long face.

623
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,610
If you don't trust me,

624
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,540
you can send someone to investigate me

625
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,990
or replace me.

626
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,920
You don't have to hide everything from me.

628
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:06,970
Also,

629
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,330
what did I hide from you?

630
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,960
Ohashi Kazuya.

631
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,020
Who told you that?

632
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm not stupid.

633
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,150
Everyone at Chongqing Station knows about it.

634
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,460
How can I not know?

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,580
Who's got the blabbermouth?

636
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,170
Miao,

637
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,960
there’s a mole in our station.

638
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,880
I have to hide this from everyone.

639
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,320

640
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,380
currently on a mission with his men.

641
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
I've even kept it from the higher-ups.

642
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,090
I see.

643
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,230
I'm just worried about you.

644
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,050
What if someone tries to steal the credit at this point?

645
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,770
No.

646
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,990

Not at all.

00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,240
Sorry for disturbing your dinner.

00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,610
Wei, you have such a bad memory.

I never eat spicy food.

Sorry, I forgot about it.

Alright.

Stop acting.

661
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,350
I'm not.

662

Let's get down to business.

663
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,740
Just say it.

664
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,840
Okay.

665
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,870
I've sent him over.

666
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,100
Ou Xiao'an should have been interrogating him right now.

667
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,810
Should you have to come and check on it?

668
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,400
Wen,

669
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,030
you didn't ask Ohashi

670
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,390
to tell you something along the way?

671
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,050
No.

672
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,800
He knew I couldn't do anything to him.

673
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,430
So, he didn't say anything.

674
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,880
See?

675
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,530
I told you Ohashi is a prick.

676
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,050
So I leave Ou Xiao'an to deal with him.

677
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,210
Take him down a peg first.

678
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,340
Wei,

679
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,240
you let Ou Xiao'an deal with him.

680
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,370
Ou Xiao'an's memory

681
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,970
hasn't fully recovered yet.

682
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,700
What if he gets triggered somehow

683
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,260
and does something to Ohashi...

684
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,410
No way.

685
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,390
What is Ou Hyo'an most concerned about at the moment?

686
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,580
The whereabouts of the gas bombs.

687
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,640
As long as Ohashi doesn't say it,

688
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,810
Ou Xiao'an will never kill him.

689
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,730
I've warned you.

690
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,120
Then if things go wrong,

691
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,680
it has nothing to do with me.

692
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,640

You've done a great job. Well...

one of them.

Ye Xuanmin is much more valuable than Ohashi.

Alright.

711
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,040
Let's not talk about contributions.

723
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,030
why do I feel like something is wrong?

724
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,530
What's wrong?

725
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,490
Vice Captain Wen has two students.

726
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,290
One is watching Ye Xuanmin,

727
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,350
while the other is watching Ohashi Kazuya.

728
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,750
Then whose credit is this?

729
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,210
Mine, of course.

730
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,740
Really?

731
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,640
You're right.

732
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,280

733
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,410
No way.

735
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,960
Ye Xuanmin is more important.

736
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,420
What about Ohashi Kazuya?

737
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,000

00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,930
They are weak

754
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,910
and need more nutrition.

755
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,520
Got it.

756
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,210
By the way,

757
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,370
when I was checking the patient in the left bed,

758
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,850
we found a focus in his liver.

759
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,890
We suspect it's acute liver damage.

760
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,290
But we can only be sure

761
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,380
after the reports.

762
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,530
Polyene phosphatidylcholine can treat it.

763
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,470
Do you have any here?

764
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,190
Yes.

765
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,580
But that medicine is an imported drug.

766
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,850
I'm afraid that we don't have it here.

767
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,910
I'll find a way to transfer some here.

768
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,100
[Officer ID]

769
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,680
[Ward 205]

770
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,790
Then, hurry up.

771
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,230
I'll leave you to it.

772
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:50,510
[Ward 205]

773
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,240
Stop!

774
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,080
Section Chief Qin.

775
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,430
Where are you taking the culprits?

776
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,190
Get them

777
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,540
a better place,

778
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,580
much more comfortable than here.

779
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,920
Who gave you the right to change wards for them?

780
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,730
I'm doing this for our own good.

781
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,030
After all,

782
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,830
communism stands between us.
