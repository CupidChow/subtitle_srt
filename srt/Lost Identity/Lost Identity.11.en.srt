13

16

according to the files

22
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,140
I think it's very likely that 810 is the name

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,100

you want to carry out an autopsy

208

on the prisoner without permission.

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,510
This is against the rule, right?

Captain Wei,

211
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,830
I guess Vice Captain Wen is doing this

212
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,480
because he loves his disciple very much.

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480

220
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,400

Yes, Vice Captain Wen.

225
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,950
After all, he already died here.

226
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,330
If we don't leave his body intact,

227
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,520
we won't be able to explain, right?

228

If we don't find out the cause of Ando's death,

229

do you think the higher-ups will let us go?

Wei,

236
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,900
there must be another reason for Ando's death.

237
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Now his body is here.

238
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,940

What's the conclusion?

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,500
We detected arsenic

252
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,510
in Ando Motoyoshi's blood.

253
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,160
I think he died of arsenic poisoning.

254
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,220
Arsenic poisoning?

255
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,020
Yes.

256
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,430
The onset of acute arsenic poisoning varies

257
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,610
depending on the dose

258
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,320
and gastric filling degree.

259
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,000
It could take

260
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,960
five to 30 seconds

261
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,620
or 14 to 18 hours.

262
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,370
In other words,

263
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,100
during the past 18 hours,

264
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,750
anyone who had contact with Ando

265
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,610
could be the one who poisoned him.

266
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,840

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,480

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm going to make it clear first.

381
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,610
If there's anything wrong with him, I won't defend him.

382
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,380
Very good.

383
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Captain Wei,

384
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,240
you've interrogated Ando Motoyoshi and Ou Xiao'an

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
for so long.

386
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,000
Now Ando Motoyoshi is dead.

387
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,550
Do you know who did it?

388
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,460
We have detained all the people

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,070
involved in the imprisonment of Ando.

390
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,130
We're investigating them one by one.

391
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,280
I still remember

392
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,880
after something went wrong with the Sundial Operation,

393
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,270
the Chongqing Station

394
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,480
confidently pledged

395
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
to get rid of the spy

396
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,760
in front of the boss.

397
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,660
The boss gave you a chance.

398
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,310
Captain Wei,

399
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,330
you made a mistake

400
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,980
in getting rid of the spy.

401
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,610
It was such a big joke.

402
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,820
The boss didn't blame you, right?

403
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,190
It's my fault

404
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,110
that I still haven't gotten rid of the spy.

405
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,310
The boss has been waiting for your news.

406
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,160
But look what happened.

407
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,880
There is another Japanese spy

408
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,570
in the Chongqing Station.

409
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,350
When did this spy

410
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,150
come here?

411
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,510
It's been so many years.

412
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,070
You guys didn't notice it at all?

413
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,030
What's the use of you guys?

414
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,990
Now Ando Motoyoshi is dead.

415
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,950
Ou Xiao'an's identity is unknown.

416
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,050
Li Shaotang probably is a communist.

417
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,430
What?

418
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,970
Do you want me to report this

419
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,510
to the boss?

420
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,910
Director Shen,

421
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,610
I suggest we should detain Li Shaotang again.

422
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,270
No need to conduct a polygraph test. Just interrogate him.

423
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,670
We'll find out the truth.

424
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
Ou Xiao'an

425
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,200
was a member of the Chongqing Station.

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,690
Most importantly, he's a disciple of Vice Captain Wen.

427
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,700
I was too polite to him.

428
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,910
Wen,

429
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,210
we must

430
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,570
do whatever it takes

431
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,470
to make him remember everything.

432
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,620
You won't be reluctant, right?

433
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,520
Captain Wei,

434
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,390
should I do what you ask me to do

435
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,890
or listen to Director Shen?

436
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,830
Of course we should listen to Director Shen.

437
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,440
Have a seat.

[Map of Chongqing Municipal District]

439
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
Don't arrest Li Shaotang.

440
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,040
How can we arrest him without a charge?

441
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,380
As for Ou Xiao'an,

442
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,980
you've interrogated him for so long.

443
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,290
A man died, but you still

444
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,630
haven't gained any information.

445
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,820
That's why we must do whatever it takes.

446
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,950
Let him go.

447
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,080
Even if there really is something wrong with Ou Xiao'an,

448
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,310
we can catch him

449
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,740
wherever he is.

450
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,610
We might as well let him go

451
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,910
and see what he'll do

452
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,370
and who he'll contact.

453
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,950
The most important task now

454
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,610
is to find 810 and catch Ohashi Kazuya alive.

455
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,270
How about this?

456
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,690
You set up the 810 Special Investigation Team

457
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,590
in the Chongqing Station immediately.

458
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,140
Okay.

459
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,320

as a special commissioner.

462
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
I think this meeting room is not bad.

463
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,870
I'll work here from now on. What do you think?

464
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,860
Captain Wei,

465
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,480
is this okay?

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,260
Yes.

467
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,170

You're quite patient.

470

Director Shen from the headquarters came here

471
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
to investigate the spy.

472
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,400
If I get caught,

it won't do you any good.

00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,700
I killed him for you.

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,630
That's it.

476
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,890
Ms. Miao,

477
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,870
indeed, Ando is dead.

478

But now,

479
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,680
there's another problem.

480
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,880
I know.

481
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,560
Myanmar has been occupied by them.

482
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,880
To transfer 810,

483
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,050
you have to breach the defenses of the National Revolutionary Army.

484
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,190
But the southwest region

485
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,210

It's too risky.

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,400
Why did you go there?

568
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,210
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

569
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,600
If I had known, I would've sent someone to pick you up.

570
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,850
I came to clean the place up for you.

571
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,950
By the way, the things you bought have been delivered.

572
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,270
The things... I ordered?

573
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,310
Just a few big boxes.

574
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,340
There are many accessories. They are very beautiful.

575
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
I didn't order anything.

576
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,090
You didn't order them?

577
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,230
Fine. Come back soon.

578
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,480
This is strange.

581
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,000
This is my spare house.

582
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,530
You can live here for now.

583
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,820
It has been cleaned up.

584
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,840
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

585
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,460
These are all mine, Mr. Wen.

586
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,300
Back then, they said you betrayed us

587
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,590
and wanted to confiscate your property.

588
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,420
So I transferred your things here

589
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,770
in advance.

590
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,130
This time,

591
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,890
thank you, Mr. Wen.

592
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,580
Otherwise,

593
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,760
I wouldn't have been released.

594
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm flattered.

595
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,650
I'm not that capable.

596
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,560
Then who released me?

597
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,040
Do you know Shen Congwu?

598
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,160
I've heard of him, but I've never seen him.

599
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,090
If you don't know Shen Congwu,

600
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,150
why did he insist

601
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,650
on releasing you?

602
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,110
Treason

603
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,840
is not your only crime.

604
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,120
What exactly

605
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,720
did you do all these years?

606
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,960
Shen Congwu released me?

607
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,150
Well...

608
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,550
he doesn't really want to release me.

609
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,650
I think

610
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,000
he released me because he wants

611
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,920
to investigate me more easily in the future.

612
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,750
Xiao'an,

613
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,300
can I trust you?

614
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,460
Sir,

615
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,060
if you trust me,

616
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,760
I'll come back to the Operations Department to work with you.

617
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,750
Don't come back to the Operations Department.

618
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,030
Now the station has established

619
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,570
the 810 Special Investigation Team,

620
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,700
mainly to investigate 810's location

621
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,740
and

622
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,570
the whereabouts of the 8,400 gas bombs.

623
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,450
You go there.

624
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,430
Okay.

625
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,570
No matter where I am,

626
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,750
I will do my best.

627
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Take this.

628
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,870
Sir, no need for this.

629
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,320
Stop acting tough.

630
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,190
I don't think you have money to buy a bowl of noodles.

631
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,860
Take it.

632
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,030
Okay.

633
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,990
I'll...

634
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,530
pay back the money.

635
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,560
By the way,

636
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,310
Li Shaotang's polygraph test is over, right?

637
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,510
How about the result?

638
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,150
This is not your concern.

639
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,820
Actually,

640
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
I don't want to be concerned about this.

641
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,130
Although my memory

642
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,780
is a mess,

643
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,820
there are always some images

644
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,450
and voices in my head.

645
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,210
I can't tell if they're true or not.

646
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
But this time,

647
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,800
after seeing Ando Motoyoshi,

648
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,100
I'm sure some of them

649
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,340
are true.

650
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,020
Sir,

651
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,770
there must be something wrong with Li Shaotang.

652
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,650
He is a Japanese spy.

653
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,390
It's in my head.

654
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,990
Xiao'an,

655
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,200
you need evidence to testify against someone.

656
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,930
From tomorrow onwards,

657
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,390
you will work with Li Shaotang.

658
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,410
You need to adjust your mentality.

659
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,640
Now,

660
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,980
what the boss is most concerned about

661
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,120
is finding 810's location.

662
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,320
I understand.

663
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,150
I just hope everyone can be careful.

664
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,330
I'm leaving.

665
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,080
Okay.

666
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,710
Are you saying the NBIS didn't announce

667
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,170
the result of Li Shaotang's polygraph test?

668
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,790
Not just that.

669
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,790
They didn't draw a conclusion on the investigation on Ou Xiao'an either.

670
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,750
But both of them have been released.

671
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,570
After Li Shaotang finished the polygraph test,

672
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,530
he went back

673
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,880
to the Special Technology Research Lab to work.

674
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,580
Indeed, it doesn't make sense.

675
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,430
They didn't do anything to him.

676
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,510
Does that mean

677
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,170
he passed the polygraph test?

678
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,990
Li Shaotang didn't perform very well

679
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,430
in the polygraph test.

680
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,520
Especially when he was asked about Lou Mingyuan

681
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,470
and the Communist Party,

682
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,120
he exhibited obvious heart rate fluctuations.

683
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,590
The fluctuations were so obvious.

684
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,300
Even I can feel

685
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,200
something is wrong with him,

686
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,460
let alone those cunning guys in the NBIS.

687
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,880
These two men

688
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,940
accuse each other of being a Japanese spy.

689
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,670
I can't make a judgment easily.

690
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,700
In principle,

691
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
we can only trust Li Shaotang now.

692
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,590
What about Ou Xiao'an?

693
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,380
Wen Yishan told me

694
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,230
when the NBIS interrogated Ou Xiao'an that day,

695
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,950
they asked him about...

696
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,220
about whether to save Secretary Chen.

697
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,679
Judging from Ou Xiao'an's attitude,

698
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,480
he was obviously disappointed.

699
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,650
So I think

700
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,469
he must hold a cautious attitude towards the NBIS.

701
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,100
Looks like you still tend to take Ou Xiao'an's side.

702
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,330
Ando said

703
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,139
Ou Xiao'an helped him with the files

704
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,800
of the Cherry Blossom Project when he was in 810,

705
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,370
but I don't think

706
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,090
Ou Xiao'an would collude with the Japanese.

707
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,040
Then try your best to get close to him

708
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,460
and gain his trust.

709
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,730
Get more information

710
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,409
on 810 from him.

711
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,810
After what happened this time,

712
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,260
I may not be able to gain his trust again.

713
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,150
I can try.

714
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,310
Also, Wen Yishan said

715
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,080
the station is going to set up

716
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,949
the 810 Special Investigation Team.

717
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,980
Ou Xiao'an, Li Shaotang, and I

718
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,730
may become members of the team.

719
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,989
Okay.

720
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,610
Keep an eye on him.

721
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,800
Okay.

722
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,470
Be careful.

723
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,010
Don't worry.

we also had a meal here, right?

728
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,780
I think so.

729
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,640
This place hasn't changed much.

730
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm not sure if you have changed.

731
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:01,070
♫I can't let anyone take away my youth♫

732

Don't you want to take a look?

734
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,340
I think this is what Director Shen wants.

♫I can't let anyone dim the light in my heart♫

736
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,530
Make the station suspect that I'm a communist.

737
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,960
Good job.

738
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,750
Only when your identity is about to be exposed

739
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,410
can the Communist Party's special commissioner

740
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,730
possibly appear.

741
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,610
The boss's strategic view

742
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,980
is indeed impressive.

743
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,710
Back then, when he decided

744
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,600
to remove the documents of you saying you're a communist

745
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
from the archives,

746
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,260
I thought it was useless.

747
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,390
I didn't expect it to be useful

748
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,280
after so many years.

749
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,330
I'm impressed.

750
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,340
[May 1941, Chongqing]

751
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,120
The Chongqing Station is very cautious

752
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,780
in screening people.

753
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,810
Besides,

754
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,590
I have already asked the questions

755
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,620
about Ohashi Kazuya and the Cherry Blossom Project.

756
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,060
You really did a good job

757
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,290
this time.

758
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,250
Director Shen,

759
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,470
there's another thing I want to report to you.

760
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,380
Go ahead.

761
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,950
I didn't tell the Chongqing Station about this.

762
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,880
I want to report it to you directly.

763
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,530
Director Shen,

764
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,210
I'm a communist.

765
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,930
Let me think.

766
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,220
A communist?

767
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
I've been in the NBIS for so many years.

768
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,930
This is the first time that someone claims

769
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,850
to be a communist in front of me.

770
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,720
Tell me.

771
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,330
What exactly do you mean?

772
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,250
I mean

773
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,810
Lou Mingyuan is a communist. He developed me.

774
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Because when I was in Shanghai,

775
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,070
he was my only higher-up.

776
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,030
I was forced to join the Communist Party.

777
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,110
This time,

778
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,270
I want to take the initiative to report to you.

779
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,270
You skipped the Chongqing Station.

780
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,220
You are quite cautious.

781
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,190
Because Lou Mingyuan once worked in the Chongqing Station.

782
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,740
I'm worried there are still their men there.

783
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,480
Since the NBIS attaches great importance to the Sundial Operation,

784
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,150
I want to report to the boss directly.

785
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,980
Lou Mingyuan developed you?

786
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,980
Tell me why.

787
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,660
When I was studying in Japan,

788
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,160
I had great faith in Three People's Principles

789
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,220
of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

790
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,630
At that time, Lou Mingyuan asked me to steal

791
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,820
the Cherry Blossom Project's files.

792
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,440
I thought he was just a member of the NBIS.

793
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,750
I was very grateful to him at that time.

794
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,450
He made me feel

795
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,160
I still lived like a Chinese.

796
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,790
Even in Ohashi's clutches,

797
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,610
I could still serve Kuomintang.

798
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,840
But after that, Lou Mingyuan

799
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,880
revealed some information on the Communist Party.

800
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,290
I was worried if I refused him,

801
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,660
I would lose contact with the NBIS and Chongqing.

802
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,240
So I pretended to promise him

803
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,700
to be a communist secretly developed by him.

804
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,980
You're serving Kuomintang.

805
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,650
How can you prove it?

806
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,210
Lou Mingyuan told me how to contact

807
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,290
the Communist Party.

808
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,090
He said they'll summon me later.

809
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,660
I'm putting relevant files

810
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
here.

811
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,460
Director Shen,

812
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,360
I want to stay in the NBIS

813
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,900
and serve the country.

814
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,380
Okay.

815
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,770
I'll tell the boss

816
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
after I go back.

817
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,630
As for

818
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,910
your identity,

819
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,500
the boss will find out.

820
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,380
Wait for my news.

821
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,790
[May 1941, Chongqing]

822
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,940
Director Shen.

823
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,190
The boss chose to trust you.

824
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,050
Thank him for his trust.

825
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,630
Go to the Qingpu Special Training Class to register next week.

826
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,700
After the training,

827
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,450
you'll be assigned to the Chongqing Station.

828
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,780
Chong... but...

829
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,950
But what if there are still

830
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,970
communists in the Chongqing Station?

831
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,490
Don't worry about this.

832
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,080
The content of Lou Mingyuan

833
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,560
developing you

834
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,070
has been removed.

835
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,280
[May 10 in the 30th year of the Republic of China]

836
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
And this

837
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,730
is the document of the Sundial Operation.

838
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,140
I'll deliver it to the Chongqing Station myself and file it.

839
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,370
People below the rank of Captain

840
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,510
won't have the access to it without permission.

841
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,350
Okay.

842
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,710
Right,

843
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,610
the Communist Party asked you to pay attention to Ta Kung Pao.

844
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,650
Did you buy it?

845
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,990
Not yet.

846
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,170
Buy it every day from today onwards.

847
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,070
Report to me immediately

848
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,050
once the Communist Party contacts you.

849
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,840
Got it.

850
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,650
I didn't expect

851
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,750
it took the Communist Party four years

852
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,830
to summon me.

853
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,320
They are really patient.

854
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,370
But it's time for you to do something for the boss.

855
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,210
We found there is a communist spy

856
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,710
in the Chongqing Station.

857
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,910
But there are only a few of us in the Chongqing Station.

858
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,630
The spy is among them.

859
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,830
The code name is Wild Grass.

860
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,250
But I don't know

861
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,480
who that person is.

862
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,020
It could be Miao Jiang,

863
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,240
Mao Renxing,

864
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,640
or even Wei Qingming.

865
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,070
Definitely, it's not me.

866
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,430
Of course it's not you.

867
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,510
During these days...

868
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,670
Well...

869
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,830
during the days you contacted

870
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,950
the Communist Party,

871
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,270
the radio station related to Wild Grass

872
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,630
started to be active.

873
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,190
Right,

874
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,460
the place where you meet communists is called...

875
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,180
Jishi Clinic.

876
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,210
Jishi Clinic.

877
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,260
Maybe it'll connect with Wild Grass.

878
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,530
Generally speaking,

879
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,720
communists have a single-chain network.

880
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,330
Once they're connected,

881
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,740
that means

882
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,860
the current situation

883
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,730
is beyond their control.

884
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,150
That's why you asked me

885
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,640
to give myself away purposely when I answered the questions

886
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,810
about the Communist Party in the polygraph test.

887
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,540
You want to make Wild Grass think I'm a communist.

888
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,460
In order to cover you,

889
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,120
Wild Grass will take action.

890
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,370
But Wild Grass

891
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,570
didn't tamper with this report.
