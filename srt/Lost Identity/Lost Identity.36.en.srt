192
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,620
and the other to...

193
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,530
American reporters.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,270
Americans are the most keen on face-saving.

195
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,620
If we get them involved,

196
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,080
we'll have a chance to sneak into the prisoner camp.

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay.

198
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,830
I'll think about how to write it.

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Jingxian.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,160
Why did you come here

201
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,310
without telling me?

202
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,160
Shaotang.

203
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,480
What's wrong?

204
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,280
I was thinking too much at home.

205
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,390
I don't want to stay there anymore.

206
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,160
Besides, I'm married to you.

207
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,030
This is our home, right?

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,250
Right.

209
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,040
I've been anxious

210
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,430
in class recently.

211
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,320
Whenever I close my eyes,

212
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,360
I see my dad.

213
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,720
And Director Shen's men have been

214
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,680
following me to school.

215
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,970
That's bad influence.

216
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,040
So, I asked the principal

217
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,680
for some time off.

218
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,270
It's good.

219
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,730
It's good.

220
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,840
You can rest at home.

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,160
You can go wherever you want.

222
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,830
Don't worry about money.

223
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,640
I just got promoted to Vice Captain today.

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
I took over Dad's position.

225
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,990
Shaotang,

226
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,830
I don't want you to do

227
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,600
those dangerous jobs anymore.

228
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm scared

229
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,080
you'll end up like Dad.

230
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
I know what you mean.

231
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,890
You want me

232
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,680
to leave the NBIS

233
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,400
and live a peaceful life with you,

234
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,670
right?

235
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,660
I don't expect anything else now.

236
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,590
I just hope we can

237
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,300
be safe

238
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,830
and have a happy family.

239
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,500
Okay.

240
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,190
I promise you.

241
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,390
Whiskey.

242
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,120
Miss Qin.

243
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Colonel Zhou.

244
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,630
What a coincidence.

245
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,880
Are you alone?

246
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,270
Yes.

247
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,320
You're drinking alone?

248
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,990
It's about work.

249
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,430
Let me guess.

250
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,710
Some Japanese wrote a letter

251
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,430
saying that there were prisoners being abused and missing

252
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,160
in the Longquan Prisoner Camp.

253
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,640
And the Americans found out about it.

254
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,230
They are going to investigate it.

255
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,550
How did you know?

256
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,780
The NBIS is not good-for-nothing.

257
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
You can just say no to them.

258
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,460
There’s nothing to worry about.

259
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,360
Miss Qin,

260
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,290
may I have a word with you?

261
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,730
Since you already know,

262
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,330
I’ll tell you the truth.

263
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,720
It's not that simple.

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
The National Government

265
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,750
is still counting on Americans to deal with the CPC.

266
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,740
Since you've

267
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,070
told me such an important thing,

268
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,480
I'll be frank.

269
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,450
Tell me.

270
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,420
Have you thought about it?

271
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,070
What if

272
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,160
something is really happening in the prisoner camp?

273
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,440
I called and asked.

274
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,620
They denied it completely.

275
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,640
But I'm afraid they're hiding something on purpose.

276
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,760
If the American reporters go there

277
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,510
and find out some scandal,

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,580
the National Government will be disgraced.

279
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,010
You still

280
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,170
lack experience in dealing with Americans.

281
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,730
Those American reporters only brag about themselves.

282
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,880
They only have

283
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
some dirty tricks.

284
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,420
After all,

285
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
as long as they get

286
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,000
actual benefits,

287
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,520
they may even say the National Government

288
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,150
is a prime example of treating prisoners well.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,270
I almost forgot.

290
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,520
You used to

291
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,700
deal with the US Army at the front.

292
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,860
Can you help me with this?

293
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,990
That's not my department.

294
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,100
Those who know

295
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,000
would get that I'm helping you.

296
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,840
Those who don’t know

297
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,310
would think I have other intentions.

298
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,040
You know the relationship

299
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,260
between the NBIS and the Military Committee.

300
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,910
Don’t worry.

301
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,040
I’ll take care of the rest.

302
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,500
Just think of it

303
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,270
as doing me a favor.

304
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,830
Okay.

305
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,020
Then,

306
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
this is on you.

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,130
Thank you very much.

308
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,870
The prisoner camp?

309
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,300
What's wrong with the prisoner camp?

310
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,200
The Military Committee received an anonymous report

311
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,280
from a Japanese,

312
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,600
which said there was mistreatment of prisoners in Longquan Prisoner Camp.

313
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,390
And

314
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,890
some Japanese prisoners were missing.

315
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,780
Those missing Japanese prisoners

316
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,920
simply disappeared.

317
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,250
But their names and numbers

318
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,880
are written in the letter.

319
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
And the mistreatment of prisoners

320
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,900
is described in detail.

321
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,580
The Military Committee was going to check.

322
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,790
But some American reporters came to us,

323
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,410
saying they received

324
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,400
the same anonymous letter.

325
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,720
So, those American reporters

326
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,800
are going to Longquan Prison Camp

327
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,240
to do their own research.

328
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,960
How could this happen?

329
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,790
What do you think about it?

330
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,790
It’s not that simple.

331
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,220
Even if there's a mismanagement in the Ministry of War,

332
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,940
how did the news get out

333
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,080
and get to the Americans?

334
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,290
There must be someone behind this.

335
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,140
You mean the Communist Party?

336
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,010
Or the Soviet Union?

337
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,670
It's hard to say.

338
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,950
But someone

339
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,790
is trying to make it bigger.

340
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,080
The best thing to do now is not to respond.

341
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,710
Don't allow the Americans to interview.

342
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,830
What can they do?

343
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,270
It's too late.

344
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,290
The Military Committee has agreed

345
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,500
and asked us

346
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,570
to cooperate with their investigation.

347
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,330
Come on.

348
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,480
They dare not offend the Americans.

349
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,410
So they sent us to clean up the mess.

350
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,450
How could this happen?

351
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,440
Enough, Moqing.

352
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,680
They

353
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,200
also said

354
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,070
Colonel Zhou Ruofei from the Military Commission

355
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,590
asked you to do the job.

356
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,440
He said your English is good

357
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,530
and you used to deal with the Americans.

358
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,960
He hopes you can make the American reporters

359
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,760
write a beautiful article.

360
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,680
We must settle this.

361
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,370
We can't let the Americans have anything on us.

362
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,450
Okay.

363
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,010
Wait.

364
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,730
You haven't read the letter yet.

365
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,570
I won't. I don't understand it.

366
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,830
Ask Xiao'an to do it.

367
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,350
His Japanese is good.

368
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,490
Maybe

369
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,540
he'll find some other clues.

370
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,870
So...

371
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,700
You mean…

372
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,810
Ask Xiao'an to go with you.

373
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,420
It's for the Americans.

374
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,850
But recently,

375
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,620
Li Shaotang has been cocky.

376
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,690
If we can get something on him,

377
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,200
remember,

378
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,560
don't go easy on him.

379
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,250
Understood.

380
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
Comrade Qiushui.

381
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
First of all, the Party fully approved

382
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,480
the work of you and the comrades

383
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,210
from the Chongqing underground liaison station.

384
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,390
You have made sacrifices for the liberation

385
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,000
of the whole nation.

386
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,740
Especially Comrade Wang Yunjie.

387
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,810
He was a hero of our party on the secret battlefield.

388
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,810
He's also our role model.

389
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,630
So the Party decided

390
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,520
to confer Comrade Wang Yunjie the title of martyr.

391
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,610
We can only praise him verbally in this special time.

392
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,610
But rest assured.

393
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,490
Wang Yunjie won't die in vain.

394
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,070
The Party will remember every comrade.

395
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Wang Yunjie was not only my brother,

396
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,110
but also a warrior.

397
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,510
The second

398
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,270
is the identity of Ou Xiao'an.

399
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,920
What did the organization say?

400
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,000
Before Comrade Chen Ke is rescued,

401
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,230
we can't make sure

402
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,320
if Ou Xiao'an is a member of our party.

403
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,990
However, based on the words of Yun Jie and other comrades

404
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,670
and what happened after that,

405
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,030
we can see that

406
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,620
Ou Xiao'an

407
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,210
is a tough, patriotic,

408
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,030
excellent agent

409
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,340
with great executive ability and great judgement.

410
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,760
He is worthy of

411
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,590
our guidance to the Party.

412
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,290
I'm relieved that the organization

413
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,490
has made a judgement.

414
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Ou Xiao'an is indeed

415
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,740
a rare talent.

416
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,260
Hello, ID please.

417
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,000
[Name: Qin Moqing]

418
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,270

419
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,720
Section Chief Qin. Section Chief Ou.

420
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,870
I'm Yu Guangqi,

421
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,960
the head of Military Management of Longquan Prison Camp.

422
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,030
I will be responsible for your interviews

423
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,110
in the camp today.

424
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,660
-Okay.
-Mr. Yu.

425
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,960
These are

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,080
the accredited reports from America.

427
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,560
Hello.

428
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,320
Hello.

429
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,780
Can we go in and have a look?

430
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,680
Of course.

431
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Please follow me.

432
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,620
Please.

433
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,050
This way, please.

434
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,360
There are

435
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,040
1234 prisoners in the camp.

436
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,950
Mostly transferred from the southwest battlefields

437
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,480
such as Yunnan and Guizhou.

438
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,970
A small part

439
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,110
from battlefields like Xiangxi and Hubei.

440
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,110
This way, please.

441
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,720
He said

442
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,560
there are 1234 prisoners.

443
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,940
Some of them were transferred here

444
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,510
from the southwest battlefields.

445
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
From Yunnan, Guizhou.

446
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
You guys

447
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,560
are really quick.

448
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,230
You must have worked hard

449
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,000
for those American reporters.

450
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
We have no choice.

451
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,360
The higher-ups ask,

452
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,510
us underlings

453
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,070
get busy.

454
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,280
Mr. Yu.

455
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,670
These American reporters said

456
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,600
they want to take pictures of the whole prisoner camp.

457
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Otherwise, it won't be convincing.

458
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,410
Everyone,

459
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,960
you must be tired.

460
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,260
It's a long journey.

461
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,090
We've prepared a place for you to rest.

462
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,620
Let me show you.

463
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,340
Section Chief Qin, we...

464
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,660
Listen.

465
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,680
The American reporters are already here.

466
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,590
It's inappropriate not to let them take photos.

467
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,750
Section Chief Qin knows what to do.

468
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,910
Section Chief Qin, show them around.

469
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,360
Okay.

470
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
We'll check out the rest place.

471
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
Don't worry.

472
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,920
Let's go. I want to see what it looks like.

473
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
Can we take photos?

474
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,310
Sure.

475
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,760
Take pictures of the gates.

477
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,470

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,290
Did you take pictures here?

483
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,340
Not here.

484
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,000
Section Chief Qin, I think we can have a look inside.

485
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,840
There must be something inside.

486
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,000
-Yeah. It got to have something.
-Okay.

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,790
Come on.

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,470
Sir, it's a misunderstanding.

492
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,280
Put it down.

493
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,640
It’s a misunderstanding. Listen to me.

494
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,500
I’m Qin Moqing from Chongqing Station.

495
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,390
I'm ordered to bring

496
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,720
the accredited reporters from the American Embassy

497
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
to interview our prisoner camp.

498
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,810
We didn't receive any order.

499
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,030
No photos here.

500
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,270
Leave now.

501
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,120
Okay. Wait a moment.

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,850

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,240

Please make an exception.

507

-I have the document.
-No.

What are you doing here?

512
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,390
I'm glad you're here.

513
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,300
The Military Commission left this mess to us.

514
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,520
They asked me to bring these American reporters

515
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,950
to our prisoner camp

516
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,570

This is a special jurisdiction.

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,850

I have no choice.

523
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,160
I have no choice either.

524
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,220
I don't have the authority.

525
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,350
If you need anything,

526
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,160
you should ask Vice Captain Li.

527
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,740
Okay.

528
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I'll take them to somewhere else.

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,620
Sorry for the trouble.

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,100

532
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,650
I had a close look.

00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,760
That cell

534
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,230
is disguised as if no one is inside.

535
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,590
But once someone approaches,

536
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,590

What is Li Shaotang up to?

540
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,210
What is his real purpose

541
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,610
of coming to the prisoner camp?

542
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,030
Let's stop guessing.

543
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,730

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,380

for what?

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,830
Ou Xiao'an,

572
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,720
you fuss about too many things.

573
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,070
No one can have

574
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,410
my Cherry Blossom Project.

575
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
No one can.

576
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,360
You can't find anyone else.

577
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,090
There's no one else.

578
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,780
I'm telling you, you'll never achieve the Cherry Blossom Project.

579
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,070
I found out you're alive today.

580
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,920
That means

581
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,670
your real death

582
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,230
is coming.

583
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,800
Enjoy your meal.

584
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,920
I can take care of Ou Xiao'an.

585
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,070
Please trust me.

586
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,210
You still have fighting spirit.

587
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,670
And the will to prove yourself to Japan.

588
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,740
That's good.

589
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,310
I didn't train you for years

590
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,520
to let you be defeated

591
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,000
by a Chinese.

592
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,970
Yes.

593
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,080
Sir.

594
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,010
The repatriation day is coming.

595
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,310
I have put your new identity

596
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,810
into the first batch of repatriate prisoners.

597
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,690
You'll be safe

598
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,500
back in Japan in a few days.

599
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,430
Good.

600
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,640
Come closer.

601
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,270
Yes.

602
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,610
I didn't ask you to negotiate with Shen Congwu

603
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,650
for my fake death

604
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,150
so that I can stay alive.

605
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,140
Idiot.

606
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,440
I just hope

607
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,390
my Cherry Blossom Project

608
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,160
can continue.

609
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,120
Yes.

610
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,180
But you have to live to

611
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,080
see the day

612
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,660
when the Cherry Blossom Project is implemented, right?

613
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,560
Sir,

614
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,560
please don't go out these days.

615
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,300
I will have more guards here

616
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,630
until you leave safely.

617
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,240
I just got the news.

618
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,390
Ohashi got transferred

619
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,720
to another place.

620
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,670
As long as he's alive,

621
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
he can't escape.

622
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,880
Why didn't you kill him

623
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,620
in the cell today?

624
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,630
I won't let him die easily.

625
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,250
It’s too easy for him.

626
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,220
What he did in 810

627
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,340
hasn't been made public yet.

628
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,480
I want to expose everything.

629
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,120
I want the whole world to know

630
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,240
what he did.

631
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,940
I want him

632
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,600
to die in despair.

633
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,010
I'll help you.

634
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,930
The best way now is

635
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,700
to use the reporters

636
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,280
to get the news out

637
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,810
that Ohashi is still alive.

638
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,900
That's right.

639
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,410
We can force the NBIS to hand over Ohashi

640
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,370
and put him on a public trial.

641
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,310
These are the photos you asked me to take.

642
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,440
I tried my best

643
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,300
to get shots of all the prisoners.

644
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,300
Take a look.

645
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,650
Is 9548 in there?

646
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,470
Let's go inside.

647
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,210
I need to see

648
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
if 9548 is in there.

649
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,880
Okay.

650
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,800
Go back!

651
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,010
Go back!

652
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,300
There's a handyman in the prison.

653
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,360
He'll send you messages from now on.

654
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,540
His number is

655
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,310
9548.

656
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,320
This

657
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,250
is our code.

658
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,030
Stop. It's me.

659
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,150
Ou Xiao'an.

660
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Mr. Ou.

661
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,920
What are you doing here?

662
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,150
Let's talk outside.

663
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,980
Come with me.

664
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,960
Stand still.

665
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,670
Don't be sleepy.

666
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,220
Sir, it's curfew time.

667
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,200
You can't go out.

668
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,250
I know.

669
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,000
I have no choice.

670
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,720
That American reporter said

671
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,160
he ran out of film

672
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,220
and asked me to pick another one.

673
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,550
If you don't believe me,

674
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,940
call the American reporter.

675
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,320
Well…

676
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,180
It's okay. I'll be back soon.

677
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,010
By the way,

678
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,410
here.

679
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,840
Go buy some cigarettes for the brothers.

680
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,700
Thank you, Sir.

681
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,770
Open the gate!

682
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,120
Come in.

683
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,440
Vice Captain Li.

684
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,710
I told you not to disturb me

685
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,680
without my permission!

686
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,860
I'm sorry, Vice Captain Li.

687
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,090
I just received the news.

688
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,020
One of the prisoners disappeared.

689
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,160
The prisoner is a mute.

690
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,560
He disappeared

691
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,510
after the evening exercise today.

692
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,190
Why is he in the prisoner camp?

693
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,370
Go find him!

694
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,130
Yes!

695
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,520
Sir.

696
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,710
9548.

697
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,720
Li Shaotang

698
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,800
is the Asano Aohiko I know.

699
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,980
So,

700
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,460
you are the real Sundial.

701
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,430
Yes.

702
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,830
I am the real Sundial.

703
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,240
He

704
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,880
took my identity.

705
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,590
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

706
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,860
What did you say?

707
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,770
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

708
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,480
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

709
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,230
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

710
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,760
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

711
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,949
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

712
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,870
Get up! Let's go!

713
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,750
Are you okay?

714
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,340
You go first. I can't escape now.

715
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,490
It's okay.

716
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,470
I'll distract the Japanese soldiers.

717
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,960
Let's go together.

718
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,690
My leg is injured. I won't be able to leave.

719
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,000
The sample of the KW30 virus.

720
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,300
You must protect it. It's very important.

721
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,360
Take it out of here.

722
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,860
Listen to me.

723
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,120
Later,

724
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,070
I'll distract the Japanese soldiers.

725
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,040
You go north.

726
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,960
Go all the way to Yunnan-Burma Road.

727
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,720
Find the Wanding sign.

728
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,470
Wait for me under it.

729
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,330
I'll find you in two days.

730
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,670
If I don't make it,

731
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,480
ask the Chinese army for help immediately.

732
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
-Do you remember?
-Okay.

733
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,420
This

734
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,210
is our code.

735
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,830
Remember.

736
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,570
Go north.

737
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,720
I'll distract them.

738
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,550
Okay?

739
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
Remember,

740
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,280
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

741
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,890
Okay.

742
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,910
I'll distract them.

743
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,910
Go!

744
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,150
Hurry!

745
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,580
Who's there?

746
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,770
Go!

747
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,380
That's it.

748
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,570
What you just said.

749
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,970
I think of it all the time.

750
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,880
I just can't remember

751
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,960
who said that.

752
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,500
It was you.

753
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
You were the one who told me.

754
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,440
Go!

755
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,670
Tell me

756
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,920
about your past.

757
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,840
I need to know

758
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,330
the details of

759
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,460
the Sundial Operation and the Cherry Blossom Project.

760
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,400
My name is Nakamura Takayuki.

761
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,880
I'm Japanese.

762
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,730
In 1939,

763
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,090
I was a student of Chemstry.

764
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,360
I was selected

765
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,990
by Ohashi to his epidemic prevention research organization.

766
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,320
One year later,

767
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,710
I came to Shanghai

768
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,980
with the organization.

769
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,940
That is

770
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,110
the sanitary center on Scott Road.

771
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,300
I gradually found that

772
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,500
the Cherry Blossom Project I participated in

773
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,380
was actually preparing

774
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,730
for a horrible biochemical battle.

775
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,750
I was in agony.

776
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,440
I drank all day.

777
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,790
Until one day,

778
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,750
I met Lou Mingyuan.

779
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,240
He

780
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,040
found me a way

781
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,310
to atone for my sins.
