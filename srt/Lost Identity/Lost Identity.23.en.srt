[Episode 23]

4
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,910
Madam,

5
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,480
my relatives in the countryside

6
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
gave me an old hen.

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,480
How should we cook it tonight?

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,960
Master has been working very hard lately.

9
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,420
Cook chicken soup for him.

10
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Okay.

11
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,350
Let's go.

12
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,790
-Master.
-Master.

13
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,390
Hurry.

14
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,930
Sister, Master is going to a meeting.

15
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,760
Master.

16
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,110
Master.

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
Master.

18
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,980
You won't eat at home?

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,070
No.

20
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,400
Master.

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,040
Master.

22
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,690
Miss Qin called and said

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,750
she'll come back for dinner tonight.

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Tell them the meeting is cancelled.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,780
I'm going to cook a chicken

26
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,420
for Moqing myself.

27
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,620
Okay.

28
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,980
Let's go.

29
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,220
Tonight,

30
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,510
we can have a taste of Master's cooking.

31
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,760
Here.

32
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,310
A drumstick for my younger sister.

33
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,190
Your brother made this beggar's chicken himself.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,930
You care about Moqing the most.

35
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,430
Try it.

36
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,510
How does it taste?

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,850
It's not delicious?

38
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,110
It's delicious.

39
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,990
It's obviously your cooking.

40
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,190
It tastes the same as that in childhood.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,630
I remember you were seriously ill

42
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,690
when you were five.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,140
The doctor said you were extremely weak.

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,630
At that time, I thought

45
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,470
I must find you something delicious to build up your health.

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,750
I went to a rich family

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,730
and stole a chicken to cook for her.

48
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,800
You were very lucky.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,230
After eating that chicken,

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,670
you recovered immediately

51
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,880
from that illness.

52
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,200
I heard they

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,550
beat you very hard.

54
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,790
I have everything I want now.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,590
Since you joined the NBIS,

56
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,750
I've always wanted to watch you eat.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
I don't want anything now.

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,260
I just want you to be happy.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,589
Tell me.

60
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,600
What exactly happened?

61
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,120
Moqing,

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,080
I arranged a meeting between you and Colonel Zhou last time.

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,070
Indeed, I was thoughtless.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,480
But he really is a nice person.

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,150
Why don't you...

66
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,710
consider it again?

67
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,630
Enough.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,430
Moqing is my sister. This is her home.

69
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,870
She can do whatever she wants.

70
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,610
Don't talk about these things anymore.

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,230
Okay.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,270
Okay, Master.

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,870
Okay.

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,400
Make an appointment with Colonel Zhou for me.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,550
Maybe I was too impatient last time.

76
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,010
We didn't have a good chat.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,030
I know

78
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,510
you meant well.

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,430
Yamei.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,370
I'll make an appointment.

81
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,570
I'll do it right away.

82
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,650
Here, have another piece of meat.

83
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,510
Brother.

84
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,550
Brother.

85
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,710
Moqing.

86
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,070
Are you looking for your brother?

87
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,420
He went out.

88
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,270
When did he go out?

89
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,930
What's up? Did something happen?

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,290
Nothing.

91
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,780
Su Qin,

92
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,450
I want to ask you about someone.

93
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,110
There's a man named Mao Renxing in the NBIS.

94
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,120
Do you know him?

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,090
Mao Renxing?

96
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,360
I know him.

97
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,180
We often played cards together.

98
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
He and Yamei

99
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,960
often talked about business

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,310
when they were playing cards.

101
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,990
I don't really understand it.

102
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,910
We don't get high pay from the NBIS.

103
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,680
Where did he get the money

104
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,510
to play cards with you rich ladies?

105
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,520
No.

106
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,370
I think his family is rich.

107
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,280
He is decent and has a good attitude.

108
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,610
He's very generous.

109
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,350
But he's not good at playing cards.

110
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,070
He always loses, just like me.

111
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,670
Why...

112
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,350
are you asking about him?

113
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,190
He is of bad character.

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,980
Be careful. He might refuse to pay up if he loses.

115
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
Really?

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,130
Never judge a book

117
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,440
by its cover.

118
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,400
Well, go to bed early.

119
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Staying up late accelerates aging.

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,310
Yes.

121
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,840
I should go to bed early too.

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,040
Go to bed early.

123
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
What's going on?

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,140
The car broke down.

125
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,400
The front part is broken again.

126
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
Didn't your boss tell you this?

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,540
You must use the best car for this journey!

128
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,450
He did.

129
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,030
The car was fine when I set off.

130
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,800
It's just that when we went to transfer the goods in the village in Burma,

131
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,330
the car was soaked in water.

132
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,960
Okay, I'm going to have a look.

133
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,170
When can we leave?

134
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,440
We're stuck here for the time being.

135
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Something is wrong with the engine.

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,500
How long will it take to fix it?

137
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,360
I guess...

138
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
at least four hours.

139
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,220
I give you two hours.

140
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,960
You have to fix it. Hurry!

141
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Okay.

142
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,050
We must get out of here

143
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,560
before dark.

144
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,790
You go check again.

145
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,320
What happened?

146
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,180
There hasn't been any news so far.

147
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Logically, Mao Renxing should have been there by now.

148
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,870
You contacted him, right?

149
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,660
I've been contacting him.

150
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,390
I contacted him a few times earlier.

151
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,520
But he didn't reply.

152
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,740
But today, a telegram from Yunnan said

153
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,000
it was raining heavily when they went to transfer the goods

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,390
from the village in Burma.

155
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,720
The road was muddy and the car was broken.

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Is that why

157
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,550
he hasn't arrived?

158
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,920
Because of this batch of goods,

159
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,520
I've been uneasy these days.

160
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,210
And the car broke down at this time.

161
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,790
I'm afraid something bad is going to happen.

162
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,720
This is not the first time

163
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
for Mao Renxing to do this.

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,490
I don't think anything could go wrong.

165
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,270
Are there still goods left in the village?

166
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Yes, but not many.

167
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,920
We have to transfer all those goods

168
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
as soon as possible before Stilwell kicked everyone

169
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,050
of the National Revolutionary Army out of Burma.

170
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,830
We can't use those people in the village anymore.

171
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,480
They only care about money.

172
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,550
They helped the Japanese in the past.

173
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,750
Maybe one day,

174
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,590
they'll betray us

175
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,500
in front of American and British people.

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,390
[Burma] [Lashio] [Putao]

177
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,670
Bye.

178
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay.

179
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,960
Come.

180
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,400
Please come in.

181
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,520
Let me show you.

182
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,750
Miss Qin, please come in.

183
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,260
What's wrong?

184
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,120
The NBIS has started to suspect me again.

185
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,180
The case about Wild Grass just ended.

186
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,790
They have started to suspect you again?

187
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,440
To be exact, they suspect my brother,

188
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
Qin Jiru.

189
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,320
Your brother?

190
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,770
They think my brother has something to do

191
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,520
with the transportation of gas bombs.

192
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,750
I'm also investigating this.

193
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,570
But since Wen Yishan summoned me back,

194
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,430
it means the people of the station

195
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,090
still trust me to some extent.

196
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,510
If there's anyone who still can't let go of the case about Wild Grass,

197
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,510
it's definitely Shen Congwu.

198
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,030
He still hasn't given up?

199
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,390
Qiushui,

200
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,080
do you still remember Zhou Ruofei,

201
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,970
the man I told you I went on

202
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,210
a blind date with?

203
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,990
He is very close to Shen Congwu.

204
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
I've made an appointment with him.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,550
Maybe I can gain some information

206
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,590
from him.

207
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,080
Let's sit down and talk.

208
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,590
Qiushui,

209
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,070
I investigated Mao Renxing these days.

210
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,680
This man is very suspicious.

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,390
It's very likely that he has taken advantage of the NBIS

212
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,190
to help Ohashi transfer gas bombs from Burma.

213
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,080
And it's possible that my brother's Jifeng Company

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,630
is also involved in this.

215
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,310
Your brother's company?

216
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,400
Are you sure?

217
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,730
I haven't found any solid evidence yet.

218
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,830
But I've asked for Wen Yishan's permission

219
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,090
to investigate my brother voluntarily.

220
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,280
But I guess

221
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,630
the station has also sent someone to investigate.

222
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,110
If your brother is involved,

223
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,480
what should you do?

224
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,110
If my brother really works for the Japanese,

225
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,550
I won't cover for him.

226
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,640
Qiushui, you and the Party

227
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,270
don't need to worry about it.

228
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,620
Moqing,

229
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,060
you misunderstood.

230
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,630
What I mean is

231
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm really worried about you.

232
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,950
I'm worried you'll be implicated

233
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,990
by your brother.

234
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,350
Qiushui,

235
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,470
if anything happens to me,

236
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,990
there is another member of us

237
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,720
in the Chongqing Station of the NBIS.

238
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,910
You mean Ou Xiao'an?

239
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,910
Yes.

240
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,940
Do you have any evidence that can prove his identity?

241
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,880
No.

242
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,190
But

243
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,250
he had a connection

244
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,820
with Chen Ke in 810.

245
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,930
Also, it's very likely that he managed to escape from 810

246
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,730
because Secretary Chen and the others helped him.

247
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,960
Secretary Chen is also in 810?

248
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,250
Yes.

249
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,290
I saw him in the photo of 810.

250
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,640
It's very likely that he has been used by the Japanese

251
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,100
as a human guinea pig for biochemical tests.

252
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,750
Qiushui,

253
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,520
through my interactions with Ou Xiao'an these days

254
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,380
and my analysis of 810's objects,

255
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,510
I'm sure

256
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,230
Ou Xiao'an is the special person

257
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,760
who Lou Mingyuan wanted to develop back then.

258
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,640
I suggest the Party

259
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,240
should contact Ou Xiao'an as soon as possible,

260
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,910
so that the network in Chongqing

261
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,030
won't be completely broken

262
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,760
even if anything happens to me.

263
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,700
We've learned a big lesson

264
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
from Li Shaotang's case.

265
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,050
Currently, we can't confirm

266
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,650
Ou Xiao'an's real identity.

267
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,990
Ou Xiao'an is totally different from Li Shaotang.

268
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,160
I'm sure about this.

269
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,750
We still need to be cautious.

270
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,310
Yes.

271
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,630
One more thing.

272
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,320
When I was monitoring my brother yesterday,

273
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,710
I heard that he and Concubine Yamei

274
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,980
were talking about transferring the goods in Burma.

275
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,110
Their words reminded me of something.

276
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,320
[Burma] [Lashio] [Putao]

277
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,760
There are a few villages in this mountain area.

278
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,310
They helped the Japanese

279
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,730
grow poppies in the past.

280
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,970
This mountain area is very hidden.

281
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,080
But there's a road in the north

282
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,490
[Burma] [Lashio]

283
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,960
that leads directly to our country.

284
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,710
If Ohashi

285
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,150
hides 810's people, supplies,

286
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,190
and even gas bombs

287
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,200
here

288
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,610
and then transfers them in batches,

289
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,670
it will attract the least attention.

290
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,250
I think you have a point.

291
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,560
But there is not much

292
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,550
we can do there.

293
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,890
How about this?

294
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,350
I'll report this

295
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,790
immediately.

296
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,360
We'll ask our people there to further investigate it

297
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,770
and then make plans.

298
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,870
Okay.

299
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,360
Where are you going?

300
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
We want to see Captain Li.

301
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,030
Captain Li.

302
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,310
You are...

303
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,750
Chongqing sent us to intercept

304
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,590
a batch of unknown supplies.

305
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,310
Captain Li, please give us your support.

306
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,030
Sure.

307
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,010
[June of the 34th year of the Republic of China]

308
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,430
[So we've sent our station's men to investigate]

309
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,990
Chongqing

310
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,270
has informed us.

311
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,990
The checkpoint is also under the leadership of the boss.

312
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,450
We're all on the same side.

313
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,560
Thank you.

314
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,480
These are the vehicle records

315
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,589
for yesterday and today.

316
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,079
[Vehicle Entry and Exit Records]

317
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,670
Take a look.

318
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,349
Tell me if you need anything.

319
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,530
Captain Li,

320
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,430
prepare more ammunition.

321
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,430
Maybe today...

322
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,430
Don't worry.

323
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Hello, this is Mr. Zhou's office.

324
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,430
Sir, it's Concubine Yamei of the Qin family.

325
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,290
She wants you to go there tonight.

326
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,390
Tell her I'm not here.

327
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,120
Yes.

328
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,080
Mrs. Qin, Mr. Zhou went out for a meeting

329
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
early in the morning.

330
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,510
Where are you going, Colonel Zhou?

331
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,590
Miss Qin.

332
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,730
Yamei.

333
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,060
I'm in Colonel Zhou's office now.

334
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes.

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,460
We're going out together.

336
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,800
Don't worry.

337
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
Let's go, Colonel Zhou.

338
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,950
Eat, Colonel Zhou.

339
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,350
Why are you just sitting there?

340
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,990
Here.

341
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,850
Miss Qin,

342
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,320
why did you

343
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,420
come to me today?

344
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,560
Your attitude makes me scared.

345
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,510
Do I have to find a reason?

346
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,650
Didn't we agree to be friends last time?

347
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,440
Do friends need a reason

348
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,960
to have a meal together?

349
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,200
Did you

350
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,730
encounter problems at work?

351
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,530
No.

352
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,880
Everything is fine with my work. There's no problem.

353
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,320
You refused me last time,

354
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,530
so Mr. Shen made things difficult for you at work?

355
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,040
Not really.

356
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,830
It's just that

357
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,270
since we met last time,

358
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,750
I've always felt Director Shen

359
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,160
has complaints about me.

360
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,760
As you know, people in our department

361
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,140
are a bit sensitive.

362
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,090
If there is a grudge between me

363
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,800
and my higher-up because of something else,

364
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,390
it will affect my work.

365
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,630
Don't worry.

366
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,690
When I talked to Mr. Shen last time,

367
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,470
I already emphasized

368
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,710
it was all my fault.

369
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,830
Mr. Shen totally understood.

370
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,630
Then I'm relieved.

371
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,150
I just think

372
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,160
Director Shen has been very cold to me lately.

373
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,220
I don't know if I've thought too much.

374
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,860
He didn't assign too many tasks to me either.

375
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,150
Well,

376
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,030
I can do whatever I want at home.

377
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,140
But in our department,

378
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,800
I have to

379
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,680
obey my higher-up's orders.

380
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
If I offend my higher-up,

381
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,990
I'll suffer.

382
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,800
So this is the reason.

383
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,730
Don't worry about this.

384
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,120
He's busy with the corruption case now.

385
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,620
Corruption case?

386
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,200
It's okay to tell you.

387
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,050
After the American government bonds case,

388
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,020
the chairman delivered an anti-corruption speech.

389
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,080
The Military Commission just ordered

390
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,020
all the departments

391
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
to investigate themselves.

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,230
Mr. Shen is in charge

393
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,110
of the investigation on the NBIS.

394
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,370
As you know,

395
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,200
this task is very offensive.

396
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,390
So,

397
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,090
just pretend you don't know.

398
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,410
I don't care about this.

399
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,240
I only care if my higher-up

400
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,100
has made things difficult for me.

401
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,700
Five trucks.

402
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,380
Yes, it's them.

403
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,890
Everyone, get ready!

404
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,820
Deputy Director Mao,

405
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,400
long time no see.

406
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,080
Why are you all here?

407
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,630
We're here to pick you up.

408
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,040
What are you transporting?

409
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,180
There are so many goods.

410
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
Don't you plan to share with us?

411
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,030
No problem.

412
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,840
After the goods are sold, I'll give

413
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,680
each of you two gold bars.

414
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,230
Okay?

415
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,400
They are so valuable? What on earth are they?

416
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
They belong to a higher-up.

417
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
Section Chief Li, don't ask more.

418
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,370
They belong to a higher-up?

419
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,710
Which higher-up?

420
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,680
Captain Wei?

421
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,760
Captain Wei...

422
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,050
is not really a higher-up, right?

423
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,210
A bigger shot.

424
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,630
We received an order.

425
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,510
We need to check the trucks. Please cooperate.

426
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,940
What are you doing?

427
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,740
Don't move!

428
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,910
What are you doing?

429
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,990
You want to force your way through us

430
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,560
with these pistols?

431
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,230
Well,

432
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,710
we just want to check the trucks. Why are you so nervous?

433
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,110
Are you smuggling goods?

434
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,560
I

435
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,810
have a passage permit.

436
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,230
Those are

437
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,390
military supplies.

438
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,650
Military supplies?

439
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,670
Show me the passage permit.

440
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,870
Captain Li,

441
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,560
you take a look.

442
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,840
Section Chief Li,

443
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,380
is there any misunderstanding?

444
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,190
Anyone with a passage permit can pass.

445
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,540
[Seal of the Chongqing Station of the NBIS]

446
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,620
They indeed belong to a higher-up.

447
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,720
But we still want to check them.

448
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,400
How about this?

449
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,030
Section Chief Li,

450
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,830
you go

451
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,900
make a call to confirm this

452
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,540
so that there won't be any misunderstanding

453
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,000
between us.

454
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,940
Please transfer the call to the office of Director Shen in the headquarters.

455
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,060
What did you say?

456
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,670
Mao Renxing is transporting gas bombs for Ohashi?

457
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,180
Yes.

458
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,110
We suspect that the goods in the trucks

459
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,430
are the biochemical weapons used for the Cherry Blossom Project.

460
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,680
What do you mean by suspect?

461
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,380
Deputy Director Mao refused to cooperate with us in checking them.

462
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,180
He said he is transporting military supplies for the headquarters.

463
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,000
How many people do you have?

464
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,130
Ou Xiao'an and I brought eight men.

465
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,820
The checkpoint also sent a squad.

466
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,140
If Mao Renxing wants to force his way through us,

467
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,550
he won't be able to succeed.

468
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,230
Ou Xiao'an is there too?

469
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,400
Yes.

470
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,460
He and Section Chief Qin

471
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,570
found something wrong with Mao Renxing first.

472
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,430
Director Shen,

473
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,190
Deputy Director Mao refused to cooperate with us.

474
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,450
Unless the boss gives the order himself.

475
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
Captain Li is also in a dilemma.

476
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
Okay. I see.

477
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,570
Give the phone to the captain of the checkpoint.

478
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,250
Okay.

479
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,520
Okay.

480
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,760
Okay, Director Shen.

481
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
You and Chief Dai can be rest assured.

482
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,570
I promise I will complete the task.

483
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,760
Okay.

484
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,400
So?

485
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,270
Let them go.

486
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,560
Captain Li,

487
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,280
what did Director Shen tell you

488
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
on the phone just now?

489
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,750
Director Shen said

490
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,550
you should leave with your men.

491
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,050
No one is allowed to stop Deputy Director Mao.

492
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,080
No one is allowed to check

493
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,810
the goods in the trucks either.

494
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,560
Deputy Director Mao,

495
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,550
I apologize for upsetting you.

496
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,620
Thank you, Captain Li.

497
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,500
No big deal.

498
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,760
Guys, thank you.

499
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,320
Deputy Director Mao.

500
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,760
We're all executing orders.

501
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
It's okay for me to ask

502
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,380
for my higher-up's permission to let you go, right?

503
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,790
No problem.

504
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,170
Go ahead.

505
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,610
Okay.

506
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Wait a minute.

507
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,290
Is he going to call the chairman?

508
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,810
Here, Colonel Zhou.

509
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,970
A toast to you.

510
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,320
Invite me to have a meal together often.

511
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,650
Don't forget we have agreed to be friends.

512
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,730
Okay.

513
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,680
Miss Qin, you have a call.

514
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,030
I have a call?

515
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,250
It's transferred from Qin's Mansion.

516
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,750
Excuse me, Colonel Zhou.

517
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,210
I'm going to answer a call.

518
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,120
You eat first.

519
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,610
Miss Qin.

520
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,730
Hello, who are you?

521
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,570
It's me.

522
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
Ou Xiao'an?

523
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,320
Mao Renxing refused to cooperate with us in checking the trucks.

524
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,720
And he has a passage permit given by Mr. Dai.

525
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,880
Someone is with me now.

526
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,270
Maybe he can help you.

527
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,630
Okay.

528
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,440
Captain Li, have some sunflower seeds.

529
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,160
No, thanks.

530
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,870
Section Chief Li, have some.

531
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,750
Okay.

532
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,640
Okay.

533
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,690
Captain Li.

534
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,220
He wants to talk to you.

535
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,750
Calm down.

536
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,300
No problem.

537
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,140
Okay.

538
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,130
Okay!

539
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,220
Okay!

540
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,690
Section Chief Li,

541
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,560
you two were enemies before, right?

542
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,320
What? Now you're friends?

543
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,340
We didn't meet you before.

544
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,150
He said you were a Japanese spy, right?

545
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,900
You just let it go?

546
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,610
Deputy Director Mao, why don't you stop talking?

547
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,880
-Eat your sunflower seeds.
-Everyone!

548
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,760
Arrest Mao Renxing and his men!

549
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,140
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

550
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,710
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

551
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,590
What are you doing?

552
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,570
What is this about?

553
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,250
What are you doing?

554
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,000
Drop your guns!

555
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,560
Are you trying to start a rebellion?

556
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,350
-Don't move!
-Drop your gun!

557
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,500
What is this about?

558
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,710
How dare you disobey Mr. Dai's order!

559
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,040
No matter how powerful Chief Dai is,

560
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,770
he is less powerful than the chairman.

561
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,730
The order was given

562
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,040
by the Attendant Section of the Military Commission.

563
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,120
Remove his gun!

564
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,630
Open the boxes and check.

565
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,140
Okay.

566
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,960
Thank you, Minister.

567
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,310
Let's have a meal together some other day.

568
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Thank you. Thank you.

569
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,470
They have been arrested by the checkpoint.

570
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,800
I believe the truth will be revealed soon.

571
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,200
Members of the Secretariat of the Military Commission are really impressive.

572
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,590
You solved the problem just by making a call.

573
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,040
It's my pleasure

574
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,750
to help you.

575
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,700
We didn't really enjoy our meal today.

576
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,360
I'll treat you some other day.

577
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,290
Be careful, everyone.

578
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,020
They could be dangerous goods.

579
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,990
Be careful.

580
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,290
Be careful.

581
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
What are these goods?

582
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,680
Opium?

583
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,200
What's under the opium?

584
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
They are all opium?

585
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,990
Check the other boxes.

586
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,880
What are the goods in your truck?

587
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,000
These are gasoline.

588
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,330
These are all morphine.

589
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,170
These are all cigarettes.

590
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,250
These are all indanthrene fabric.

591
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,830
Anything?

592
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,900
Load the trucks.

593
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,580
Yes!

594
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,070
Do it!

595
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,640
Even the Military Commission is shocked

596
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,240
to hear about such a large batch of smuggled goods.

597
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,040
They ordered us to take them back

598
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,240
to Chongqing now for an investigation.

599
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,000
Gas bombs

600
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,300
have turned out to be smuggled goods?

601
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,010
Take them back and investigate first.

602
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,659
You two.

603
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,969
Do you know whose goods these are?

604
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,830
Did Director Shen really

605
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,310
give you the transportation permit himself?

606
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,580
It's good that you know.

607
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,469
Li Shaotang,

608
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,070
the boss and Director Shen value you so much.

609
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,110
But you betrayed them!

610
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,250
After we go back,

611
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,560
I'm sure I'll be fine.

612
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,679
Because someone will save me.

613
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,139
But your future

614
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,239
has been ruined.

615
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,159
Take him away!

616
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,830
Move!

617
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,290
Do you know how many people died

618
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,370
in order to build this road?

619
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,989
It's only been available for a few days.

620
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,050
But you're using it to smuggle goods.

621
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,739
What are you doing?

622
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,190
What are you doing?

623
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,050
-What are you doing?
-Move!

624
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,860
I feel something is not right.

625
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,670
Mao Renxing spent so much time preparing for this secretly

626
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,280
just for some smuggled goods?

627
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,540
Isn't the amount huge?

628
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,190
Considering his personality,

629
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,710
if he is doing this for the boss,

630
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,240
he would have shown off in front of us long ago.

631
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,940
Let's go back first

632
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,050
and see how Captain Wei will react.

633
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,920
Give me an explanation today.

634
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,600
I asked you to investigate the gas bombs.

635
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,830
Why did you investigate the boss?

636
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,040
You even reported the boss directly

637
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,230
to the chairman for smuggling opium!

638
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,290
Why did you do this?

639
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,420
Opium?

640
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,000
What opium?

641
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,240
Don't play dumb.

642
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,630
The goods Mao Renxing was transporting

643
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,560
are the opium smuggled by the boss.

644
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,330
Your brother is also involved.

645
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Don't tell me you don't know!

646
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,940
After Lin Shiliang's case,

647
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,350
the Kong family and the Song family

648
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,530
have been holding a grudge against the boss.

649
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,890
They've been trying to find something on him.

650
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,850
Look what you did.

651
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,070
You want to tie the boss up

652
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,440
and take him to them.

653
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,710
What does the current success of the NBIS owe to?

654
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,880
It owes to the boss's management.

655
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,410
If he falls because of this,

656
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,040
the Chongqing Station will be the sinner in the NBIS.

657
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,570
All of us

658
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,280
will suffer.

659
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,140
Tell me.

660
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,000
Was going over my head

661
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,350
your own idea?

662
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,850
Or did you and Ou Xiao'an

663
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,450
plan it together?

664
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,670
Wei,

665
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,430
I heard

666
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,360
Li Shaotang is also involved.

667
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,240
What?

668
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,070
Tell me!

669
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,480
Whose idea was it?

670
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,540
Wei.

671
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,880
It was my idea.

672
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,790
It has nothing to do with others.

673
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
Wen.

674
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,170
I have to criticize you.

675
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,860
Back then, I asked you to summon her back urgently

676
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,240
because I was worried she would tell her brother

677
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,930
before we could investigate it thoroughly.

678
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,130
But look what you did.

679
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,380
You just let her do whatever she wanted.

680
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,340
Now that this has happened,

681
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,540
you should take responsibility.

682
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,370
Well,

683
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,710
things have turned out to be like this

684
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,180
because you suspect Qin Jiru and Qin Moqing.

685
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,620
I do suspect them!

686
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,510
I didn't...

687
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,520
What?

688
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,700
Am I the only one who doesn't know about this?

689
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,400
Feng, here's the thing.

690
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,080
Wen and I

691
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,260
wanted her to investigate first.

692
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,790
We planned to tell you after finding out the truth.

693
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,430
Don't.

694
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,430
Don't tell me.

695
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,800
I don't know.

696
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,980
I know nothing from beginning to end.

697
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,110
You want to betray the boss.

698
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,340
Don't get me involved.

[Map of Chongqing Municipal District]

700
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,150
Well, I didn't say anything about betraying the boss.

701
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,360
Wen...

702
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,220
I see.

703
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
Wen,

704
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,240
your student is impressive.

705
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,670
She is righteous

706
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,290
and impartial,

707
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,880
just like you.

708
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,770
Great!

709
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,830
Moqing,

710
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,010
let Captain Wei

711
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,030
have a good rest here.

712
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,260
[Map of Chongqing Municipal District]

713
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,850
Master, stop being worried.

714
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,590
We are neither government officials bending the law

715
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,830
for personal gains

716
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,450
nor the mastermind.

717
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,510
If the government wants to fine us,

718
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,040
just let them do it.

719
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,480
I don't believe

720
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,060
they will still blame us

721
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,800
after we show them the ledger.

722
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,760
I went to the Immortal Cave to see him today.

723
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,210
I can't believe he asked an orderly

724
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,370
to send me away.

725
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,940
He clearly wants to make a clean break with me.

726
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,900
Someone has to take the blame

727
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,130
for this.

00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,540

I'm willing to do anything for Moqing.

755
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Don't tell her yet.

756
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,690
I'll talk to her later.

757
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll ask her to study in the U.S.

758
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,270
I'll ask her to study in a medical school.

759
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,840
What's going on?

760
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,040
What happened?

761
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,060
-Get off!
-Help me! Hurry!

762
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,200
Hurry!

763
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,210
Get off!

764
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,250
Be careful.

765
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,380
Aim your guns at the front part of the car. Shoot.

766
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,220
It hurts.

767
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,300
Do you want to die?

768
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,240
It hurts.

769
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,150
Take cover!

770
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,720
I'm going to die.

771
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,170
Don't move.

772
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,480
Give me a long-barrelled gun.
