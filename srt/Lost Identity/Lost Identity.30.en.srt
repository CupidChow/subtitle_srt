Sir, I've sent my men to investigate.

In Chongqing,

00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,380
there are only three villas that aren't registered

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,950
has been guarded

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,340
since the day before yesterday?

11
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,180
There is one.

Miao.

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,900
I just asked you

17
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,780
to bring out the men from 810.

18
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,380
Why did you bring so many people out?

19
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,360
I was afraid the word would get out.

20
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,070

21
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,550

Nice place.

24
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,630
This is an abandoned primary school.

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,420
It's in the middle of nowhere.

26
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,030
Most importantly,

27
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,260
it's very secluded.

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,360
It can be used as a interrogation room.

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,260
Yes.

42
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,550

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,340
He's really thoughtful.

77
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,540
Director Shen came here to take him away,

78
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,700
but I refused.

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,110

from memory.

85
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,830
That's not good enough.

86
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540

He's not the head of Special Technology Research Lab in Chongqing Station.

92
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,590
Captain Wei,

93
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,510
there's no one in Chongqing Station

94
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,370
who knows more about biochemical weapons than I do.

95
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,270
Of course, I can go back.

96
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,510
If only

97
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,409
you know more about the Cherry Blossom Project.

98
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,100
But if we can't find anything,

99
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,350
and the whole Chongqing gets hit by biochemical bombs,

100
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,900

101
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,980
of not achieving anything.

102
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm so scared.

103
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,320
Li Shaotang,

104
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,560
don’t try to scare me with such big talk.

105

107
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,860

108
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,360
you'll have dug that bomb shelter for nothing.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Right?

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,080

111
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600

112
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,440
In his dreams!

113
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,190
Believe it or not,

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,180
I can fabricate a charge of colluding with the Japanese

115
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,790
against you two now,

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
and let you die with Ohashi.

117
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,190
Of course I believe it.

118
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,880
But if I die,

119
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,180
what are you going to tell Director Shen?

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,620
Ohashi will confess.

121
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,190
Both of you will die for nothing.

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
That's brilliant.

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,140
Now,

124
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,410
I want to give you and Vice Captain Feng a chance.

125
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,490
I'll let you see Ohashi.

126
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,370

127
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,710
what you will say when you see him.

128
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,430
Thank you, Captain Wei.

129
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,400
Tell Shen Congwu to come here.

Mr. Ohashi, you have a good memory.

134
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,620
You actually remember me.

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,560
totally failed this time.

140
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,260
You'll die too.

141
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,210
Whether I die or not,

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,650
it's not your concern.

143
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,350
But you know,

144
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,580
I really like seeing you like this.

145

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,740
when you die,

148
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,820
I will carve a sentence

149
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,260

151
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,070
the man who almost won that war.

152
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,110
Unfortunately,

the war is over.

157
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,340
You've lost.

158
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,820
I will never lose.

159
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,340
Kill me.

160
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,290
Kill you?

161
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,540
It won't be that easy.

162
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,070
A war criminal like you

163
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,780
will be sent to the military court.

164
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,130
We'll let everyone know your crimes.

165
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,350
By then,

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,180
everyone in China, in Japan,

167
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,550
and even the whole world

168
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,380
will know you, Ohashi Kazuya.

169
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,540
You'll be go down in history.

170
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,670
You'll be remembered as a loser.

171
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,590
Death

172
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,140
is not that easy.

173
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,710
Why don't you choose to live?

174
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,730
Living as a loser,

175
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,810
living like a dog,

176
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,980
it's not that hard.

177
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,520
Mr. Ohashi,

178
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,320
tell us everything

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,470
about the Cherry Blossom Project.

180
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,700
Hand over all your biochemical information.

181
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
And we'll spare your life.

182
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,390
I've destroyed the project.

183
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,400
Your people saw it with their own eyes.

184
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,230
What about all the biochemical weapons

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,780
810 has produced these years?

186
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,030
As long as you give us the rest,

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,380
we can keep you alive

188
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,100
and even send you back to Japan.

189
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,950
You are not qualified to know

190
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,070
the contents of the Cherry Blossom Project.

191
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
We are not qualified?

192

Dad,

327
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,510
I thought you didn't approve of us getting married.

328
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,260
Why are you urging us now?

329

338
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,700
so you want to use him…

339
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,849
Feng Jingxian!

340
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,790
How could you say that?

341
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,109
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

342
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,710
You've been dating for so long.

343
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,210
You haven't got married

344
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,700
only because there were rules in wartime.

345
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,820
I had no choice.

346
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,030
Now we've won the war.

347
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,310

348
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,930
asked Mr. Dai about you getting married.

349
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,760
He agreed.

350
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,980
Now you're saying that?

351
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,460
You're breaking my heart!

352
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,450
Dad.

353
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,390
When Ou Xiao'an came back,

354
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,580
Shaotang was accused as a Japanese spy.

355
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,350
You were in a hurry to dissociate yourself from him.

356
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,310
You even asked Mrs. Wu

357
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,080
to put away the wedding invitations.

358
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,210
Now he is cleared of suspicion

359
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,820
and he's going to make contributions.

360
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,890
And you suddenly want me to marry him?

361
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,510
How can I say that?

362
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,940
You mean I've blown hot and cold, don't you?

363
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,720
Have you forgotten

364
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,860
how much trouble

365
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,590
Ou Xiao'an caused us back then?

366
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,520
What's wrong with being cautious?

367
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,200
I'm just afraid you'll get hurt again.

368
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,960
Am I wrong?

369
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,600
You've done nothing wrong.

370
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,510
I'm the one who's wrong.

371
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,450
I didn't choose to trust Shaotang

372
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,870
when he was

373
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,840
the most suspected and helpless.

374
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,940
Now I understand.

375
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,050
Shaotang is my fiancé.

376
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,290
No matter what happens,

377
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,220
no matter what the circumstances,

378
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,460
I should support him unconditionally.

379
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,140
I can't bring up the wedding.

380
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,290
I'll wait for Shaotang to bring it up.

381
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,270
Jingxian.

382
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,850
Dad.

383
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,300
Shaotang.

384
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,820
When did you come?

385
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,430
I heard

386
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,850
what you were saying.

387
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,820
Jingxian.

388
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Don't worry.

389
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,310
I won't keep you waiting.

390
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,670
Wei Qingming once invited Zeng Jiwu

391
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,590
to a place called Huajiang Villa.

392
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,900
I guess that's where

393
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,310
he's been hiding Ohashi.

394
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,710
Looks like the organization's analysis was right.

395
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,580
We've used every line of intelligence,

396
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,030
the Ministry of War, the Military Committee.

397
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,030
We got nothing about Ohashi Kazuya.

398
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,530
This biochemical information

399
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,640
has been destroyed by Ohashi Kazuya.

400
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,770
Yet Wei Qingming is still hiding him and won't execute him.

401
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,770
What else does he want

402
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,350
besides a deal?

403
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,260
Ohashi still has leverage.

404
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,680
Gas bombs

405
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,220
and biochemical weapons.

406
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,180
According to the prediction of the NBIS,

407
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,340
that batch of gas bombs have most likely

408
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,140
been transported to Chongqing.

409
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,820
And only Ohashi knows where they are.

410
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,830
We need to

411
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,890
report this to the organization asap.

412
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,540
Although the CPC and the Kuomintang are having a negotiation,

413
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,140
a war might start at any time.

414
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,530
If that batch of gas bombs

415
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,380
falls into the hands of the Kuomintang,

416
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,620
it'll be a great threat

417
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,900
to us.

418
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,900
I'll find out the deal

419
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,030
between Wei Qingming and Ohashi asap.

420
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,590
On one premise,

421
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,730
you must protect yourself.

422
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,830
Beware of Wei Qingming in Chongqing Station,

423
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,380
as well as Li Shaotang.

424
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,810
Li Shaotang.

425
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,650
Ou Xiao'an almost

426
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,670
caught him when they were checking the bomb shelter.

427
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,940
It seems that

428
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,960
you trust Ou Xiao'an very much now.

429
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,360
Don't worry.

430
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,030
I will be strictly disciplined

431
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,490
before we can identity him

432
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,230
as a member of the CPC.

433
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,130
I think you can talk to him.

434
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,020
Drop the hint

435
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,100
that the Japanese have lost the war.

436
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,600
He doesn't have to help the Kuomintang

437
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,150
get rid of Li Shaotang

438
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,000
and get himself into trouble.

439
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,420
Qiushui,

440
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,230
have we

441
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,820
identity Ou Xiao'an?

442
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,980
I just heard

443
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,400
from the organization.

444
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,820
Comrade Zhao Gonglai,

445
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,780
who was rescued by our guerrillas in Guizhou

446
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,460
reported to the organization.

447
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,350
9548

448
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,570
is a number for a hard labour in 810.

449
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,350
This man helped Secretary Chen

450
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,510
deliver messages in 810 for a long time.

451
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,640
Secretary Chen trusted him very much.

452
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,710
With Secretary Chen's help,

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,220
he escaped with Ou Xiao'an.

454
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,350
Do we have an ID

455
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,750
or a file on this man?

456
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,070
No.

457
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,800
We only know he's a mute.

458
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,830
A mute?

459
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,180
Xiao'an.

460
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,260
Mr. Wen.

461
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,650
You want to talk to me about something urgent?

462
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,460
Yes.

463
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,110
Here is the situation.

464
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,850
Some cellmates of mine back in 810

465
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,030
is supposed to be in the Army Hospital.

466
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,080
I went to visit them today.

467
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,070
But something was wrong.

468
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,920
They were all gone.

469
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,980
Wei Qingming is crazy!

470
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
Has he lost his mind?

471
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,740
Sir,

472
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,900
I've made my research.

473
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,910
In Chongqing,

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,840
there are only a few places

475
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,890
that can hold that many people for a long time

476
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,230
without being noticed.

477
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,630
I want to deploy some men from the Operations Department.

478
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,620
I'll find them within three days.

479
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,940
Wait.

480
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,030
No one knows you and Moqing

481
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,110
went to the Army Hospital, right?

482
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,110
Just a few people.

483
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,830
Zeng Jiwu, Mr. Li

484
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,900
and Lu Ziming.

485
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,510
Just them.

486
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,270
Zeng Jiwu works for Wei Qingming.

487
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,540
Lu Ziming and Mr. Li

488
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,940
have been taken away.

489
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,660
I don't think

490
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,830
words will get out.

491
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,560
Don't worry, Sir.

492
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,030
I will find them all

493
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,700
before things get bigger.

494
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,770
We can't get them out now.

495
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,390
If you find them now,

496
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,310
Wei Qingming will be accused of

497
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,840
trying too hard to catch communists at most.

498
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,550
Sir,

499
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,360
he can catch communists.

500
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,040
But there are too many people involved.

501
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,640
He's caught too many people.

502
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,980
That's right.

503
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,760
Dozens of people,

504
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,550
even if they eat pigswill,

505
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,980
how much does it cost a day?

506
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,950
Wei Qingming is using public funds.

507
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,290
We can afford it

508
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,730
for a couple of days, maybe five days.

509
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,050
What about weeks?

510
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,910
Where can we get that much money?

511
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,500
Sir,

512
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,060
given Captain Wei's style of doing things,

513
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,230
if there's no money

514
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,630
and no people anymore,

515
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,910
he'll kill them.

516
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,750
That's right! He'll kill them.

517
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,020
Let him kill.

518
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,710
Let him kill ten people a day.

519
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,590
Let him kill for a few days.

520
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,420
Then we'll get them out.

521
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,970
They'll be our witnesses.

522
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,180
This is our best chance

523
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,830
to take down Wei Qingming.

524
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,740
By then,

525
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,950
I'll be captain again.

526
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,710
And you'll be sitting

527
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,700
where I am.

528
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,750
You'll be vice captain.

529
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,490
Sir,

530
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,380
you'll let dozens of people get killed

531
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,150
so that you can be captain?

532
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,930
You...

533
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,640
Ou Xiao'an!

534
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,350
You are the reason

535
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,140
I got demoted

536
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,940
to vice captain!

537
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,470
Now I have to see Wei Qingming

538
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,530
show off every day!

539
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,440
See him throw his weight around me!

540
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,010
I'm telling you,

541
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,370
whoever stands in my way

542
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,260
of taking back the position of captain

543
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,910
will die!

544
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,340
I'm sorry, Sir.

545
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm sorry.

546
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,460
Xiao'an,

547
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,980
what do you think

548
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,980
about Qin Moqing?

549
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,280
Qin Moqing?

550
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,740
Did we get too close

551
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,060
and get you in trouble?

552
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,480
There are some rumors.

553
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,330
But if I have to choose from Qin Moqing

554
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,820
or Feng Jingxian to marry

555
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,500
my student,

556
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,150
I'll choose Qin Moqing.

557
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,910
Sir.

558
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,150
That's…

559
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't even think about her that way.

560
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,340
No, no.

561
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,460
I thought you meant...

562
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
No, no.

563
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,000
But, Xiao'an,

564
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,460
Moqing…

565
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,160
She's making me worried.

566
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,030
Earlier,

567
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,220
when we went to Guizhou to catch Ohashi and save Ye Xuanmin,

568
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,850
I thought something was wrong.

569
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,620
But time was limited.

570
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,510
I wanted to wait until we came back.

571
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,340
But a couple of days ago,

572
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,870
the CPC went to the Army Hospital

573
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,270
to get those people.

574
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,300
Something is wrong.

575
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,930
Got it.

576
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,860
Sir,

577
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,080
I will

578
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,070
keep an eye on her.

579
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,120
Be careful.

580
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,660
Yes, Sir.

581
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,430
Shaotang,

582
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,980
I'm sorry.

583
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,800
Jingxian's been spoiled ever since she was a child.

584
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,680
Besides,

585
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,110
she's a teacher in a primary school.

586
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,770
It's inevitable for her to be a little childish.

587
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,180
We were just lashing out.

588
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,220
Please don't take it seriously.

589
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,220
It's okay.

590
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,050
I know how Jingxian feels.

591
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,880
And I know why you are anxious.

592
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,550
Good.

593
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,660
I went to

594
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,910
Huajiang Villa today.

595
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,120
Ohashi is in custody there.

596
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,810
Did you see him?

597
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,110
Yes.

598
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,050
What did he say?

599
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,810
No.

600
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Ohashi wouldn't tell you anything.

601
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,810
Otherwise,

602
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,210
Wei Qingming wouldn't have let you see him.

603
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,940
He didn't say anything.

604
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,580
But he made a request.

605
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,430
What is it?

606
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,530
He wants to see Director Shen.

607
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,070
Shen Congwu?

608
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,540
He wants to use the complete information on the Cherry Blossom Project

609
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
and the whereabouts of the gas bombs

610
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,410
to negotiate with Director Shen.

611
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,150
What do you think?

612
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,900
Captain Wei

613
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,310
can't decide

614
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,780
whether he lives or dies.

615
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,320
Besides, he has no leverage

616
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,920
to negotiate with Ohashi.

617
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Wei Qingming is a man of no scruples.

618
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,870
What if Ohashi talks?

619
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,670
So...

620
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,090
We should inform Director Shen asap.

621
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,570
Yes.

622
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes.

623
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,390
Let's get Ohashi out of there

624
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
before Wei Qingming makes him talk.

625
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,500
Good.

626
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,120
Wei Qingming, the old fox,

627
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,970
really has no way to back down this time.

628
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,960
Director Shen, what are you doing?

629
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,530
We had a deal.

630
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,850
You'd take Ye Xuanmin and leave Ohashi to me.

631
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,060
I did agree.

632
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,710
But the boss didn't.

633
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,460
Once a war criminal like Ohashi

634
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,470
gets arrested,

635
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,450
he must go to the Military Court.

636
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,770
If the NBIS keeps him in custody,

637
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,840
people will talk.

638
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,080
The boss said

639
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,280
no one can save Ohashi's life.

640
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
But…

641
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,670
No buts.

642
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,060
I gave the report on this operation to the boss.

643
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,990
You get to take the biggest credit.

644
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,060
Move.

645
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,050
Captain Wei.

646
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,760
Miao.

647
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,590
You are getting thinner.

648
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,280
Li Shaotang is so crafty.

649
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,030
If they do find out the Cherry Blossom Project,

650
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,080
we'll...

651
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,420
They would've found out if they could.

652
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,890
It's not that easy.

653
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,170
[The Deception of Iroa] [AUNAYA ROOM, CHUNO IZU, ALL FROM]

654
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,170
[I miss the little part of my voice, the little duck of the Dao.] Four inches less

655
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,170
[Liquor with a little wild crossbow] The long waves of a slave can't come out of the cold water. [Carefully Meaning Night]

656
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,350
Mr. Ohashi, you really are a China hand.

657
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,190
Your handwriting

658
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,560
captures the essence of Liu Gongquan's.

659
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,760
But this last poem

660
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,330
[The Deception of Iroa] [AUNAYA ROOM, CHUNO IZU, ALL FROM]

661
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,330
[I miss the little part of my voice, the little duck of the Dao.] Four inches less

662
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,330
[Liquor with a little wild crossbow] The long waves of a slave can't come out of the cold water. [Carefully Meaning Night]

663
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,090
is really sad.

664
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,470
Director Shen,

665
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,860
can you move?

666
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,640
You're blocking the light.

667
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,380
Get out.

668
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,550
Tell the guards at the door to leave.

669
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,980
Ohashi,

670
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,300
you should feel lucky

671
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,300
you're in our custody

672
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,380
instead of the CPC's.

673
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,900
Is there any difference?

674
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,830
You should remember

675
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,750
you arrested many people from the NBIS

676
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,740
back on Scott Road.

677
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,540
I know how you

678
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,550
tortured them.

679
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,140
But I

680
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,190
don't care.

681
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,300
Look.

682
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,580
Ever since I invited you here,

683
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,700
I've been nice to you.

684
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,030
That's because I'm still valuable.

685
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,500
You don't want me to die.

686
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,720
[Jin Wulin West House Drums urge you to die]

687
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,150
[Jin Wulin West House]

688
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,400
There's an old Chinese saying.

689
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,330
Brothers quarrel at home,

690
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,180
but they join forces to fight outsiders.

691
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,490
Now that the enemy is gone,

692
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,740
the brothers

693
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,630
have to battle it out.

694
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,900
Stop talking about brothers or whatever.

695
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,860
Ohashi,

696
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,230
I want you to cooperate with me.

697
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,910
Cooperate.

698
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,720
You want to use my stuff

699
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,380
to deal with the CPC.

700
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,600
Don't say that.

701
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,570
I can feel that our cooperation

702
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,920
will go smoothly.

703
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,550
Mr. Ohashi,

704
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,590
there's nothing you and I can't say

705
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,920
to each other

706
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,260
on the matter of defeating the communists.

707
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,830
Understand?

708
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,570
You want me to provide you with gas bombs

709
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,930
and my lifetime

710
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,870
of biochemical research.

711
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,240
You want me to help you make gas bombs.

712
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,470
When you have the ability

713
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,000
to make the first batch of gas bombs,

714
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you'll use them to deal with the CPC.

715
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,200
You're smart.

716
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,980
How about this?

717
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,050
You can tell me your requirements.

718
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,520
Fine.

719
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,870
My requirement is

720
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,240
that I be sent back to Tokyo.

721
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,890
Can you do it?

722
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,780
So many people are watching you.

723
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,130
By then,

724
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,080
I'm sure you'll give me a public trial.

725
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,300
You'll have a commendation conference.

726
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,240
And I'll be executed like a wild dog

727
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,870
and thrown into a mass grave.

728
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,100
Why don't you kill me now?

729
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,550
Ohashi Kazuya,

730
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,179
I hope you can understand the situation.

731
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,949
You have no choice.

732
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,639
You can

733
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,190
either die like a dog,

734
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,179
or

735
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,100
you can prove how valuable

736
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,940
you are to us.

737
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,780
I need a guarantor.

738
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,889
Maybe he can

739
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,139
think of a better way.

740
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,270
The young man

741
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,850
who's worked for you and me.

742
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,320
Li Shaotang?

743
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,780
Secretary Sun.

744
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,409
Bring Li Shaotang here now.

745
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,190
-Section Chief Li.
-Section Chief Li.

746
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,870
Director Shen wants me to talk to him alone.

747
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,680
You may leave.

748
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Sir.

749
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,630
Sit down.

750
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,250
I was rude to you last time.

751
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,540
I'm so sorry.

752
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,470
No.

753
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,440
You did a good job.

754
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,450
I've trained you well all these years.

755
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,660
I want a soldier

756
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,580
who obeys orders,

757
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,080
not an emotional fool.

758
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,730
How are you and that Chinese woman?

759
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,580
Everything is going according to your plan.

760
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,510
We're going to have a wedding soon.

761
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,790
Feng Jingxian is

762
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,380
a great cover for me.

763
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,610
Besides,

764
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,620
she trusts me

765
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,110
completely.

766
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,390
What about Ou Xiao'an?

767
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,900
I can deal with him for now.

768
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,410
He almost destroyed everything in 810.

769
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,580
I didn't kill him

770
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,900
only because

771
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
I was afraid

772
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,870
you'd be exposed.

773
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,230
But now it seems that

774
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,610
letting Ou Xiao'an stay alive

775
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,430
will be a problem.

776
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,840
I understand.

777
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,770
But now,

778
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,820
I’m more worried about your safety.

779
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,460
Did Shen Congwu send you here

780
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,160
for my biochemical research

781
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,460
and biochemical bombs?

782
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
I've thought about it over and over.

783
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,790
This is the only way for you to be safe

784
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,410
and return to Japan.

785
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,390
You think

786
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,340
I'm afraid of death?

787
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,510
No, Sir.

788
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,900
Only if you return to Japan,

789
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,720
can you continue your research.

790
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,630
And Japan can have a chance to rise again.

791
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,290
I want to see

792
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,590
the victory rally in a month.

793
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,620
I want to see the Cherry Blossom Project succeed.

794
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,130
I can't die yet.

795
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,720
The NBIS is focusing on

796
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,260
dealing with the CPC.

797
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,190
If we give them the gas bombs,

798
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,000
they'll do the work for us.

799
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,030
Useless!

800
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,710
I will never

801
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,240
give anyone my stuff!

802
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,460
But,

803
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,200
how will I keep you alive

804
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,390
to complete your plan?

805
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,400
That's not for you to worry about.

806
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,570
I've arranged it all.

807
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,170
Just remember, you haven't finished

808
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,750
what you need to do.

809
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,950
Yes.

810
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,520
Director Shen.

811
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,580
Tell me the truth.

812
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,430
Do you

813
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,900
have Ohashi Kazuya?

814
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,220
Commissioner Zhang,

815
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,860
where did you hear that?

816
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,460
Where did I hear that?

817
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,220
Wang Chun.

818
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,420
The communists rescued by the guerrillas said

819
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,530
Ohashi Kazuya was taken away by Wei Qingming

820
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,410
from the Chongqing Station.

821
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Wei Qingming?

822
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Come on.

823
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,590
Stop pretending.

824
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,160
Wei Qingming took Ohashi away.

825
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,660
I don't believe you don't know that.

826
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,550
Well,

827
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,730
I really didn't know beforehand.

828
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,820
I only found out after Wei Qingming brought Ohashi

829
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,940
to Chongqing.

830
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,000
The CPC is

831
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,690
much more well-informed than me.

832
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,380
Tell me,

833
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,160
what are you gonna do about it?

834
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,160
Director Shen.

835
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,560
Section Chief Li is here.

836
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,220
Shaotang.

837
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,260
Director Shen.

838
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,300
Perfect timing.

839
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,940
Let me introduce you.

840
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,060
This is Commissioner Zhang.

841
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,220
Commissioner Zhang.

842
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,340
Commissioner Zhang,

843
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,670
this is Li Shaotang.

844
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,660
He's handpicked by the boss to work at the Chongqing Station.

845
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,070
He was the one

846
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,560
who told us

847
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,990
Oohashi was being held in Huajiang Villa.

848
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,050
Director Shen.

849
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,640
Director Wang from the CPC

850
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,710
knows Ohashi is in the custody of Chongqing Station.

851
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,190
They want an explanation.

852
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,500
What do you think?

853
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,340
Shaotang,

854
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,980
what do you think?

855
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,910
What should we do?

856
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,720
Director Shen,

857
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,060
I don't dare to give my opinions in front of you.

858
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,340
Just say it.

859
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,940
I think,

860
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,710
there's only one way

861
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,410
to handle a war criminal of this rank.

862
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,940
Execute him publicly

863
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,590
when it's time.

864
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,750
Besides, Commissioner Zhang,

865
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,280
you can invite Commissioner Wang from the CPC

866
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,460
to the scene,

867
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,000
to witness Ohashi put to death.

868
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,820
You deserve the boss's approval.

869
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,760
You're really capable.

870
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,350
Commissioner Zhang, we...

871
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,340
It's settled.

872
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,230
Let me know when and where the execution

873
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,980
takes place.

874
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,850
I'll inform Director Wang from the CPC.

875
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,060
That'll be the explanation they asked for.

876
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,500
Bye.

877
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,180
No, Commissioner Zhang…

878
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,460
See Commissioner Zhang off.

879
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,140
You're good, Li Shaotang.

880
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,950
You even dare to make decisions for me.

881
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,250
Director Shen.

882
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,580
If the communists want Ohashi dead,

883
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,940
we'll let him die.

884
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,740
Only when Ohashi is executed,

885
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,580
can we cooperate better.

886
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,310
Inmate Ohashi Kazuya

887
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,380
is physically fine.

888
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,640
His identity is clear.

889
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,870
The execution is in two hours.

890
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,790
Mr. Ohashi,

891
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,630
do you have anything else to say?

892
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,900
You must have some last words.

893
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,340
My hometown,

894
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,750
Miyoshi, Hiroshima,

895
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,630
was similar to Chongqing.

896
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,340
At this time of year,

897
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,130
it would rain for more than ten days.

898
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,380
It would be foggy everywhere.

899
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,340
Unfortunately,

900
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,800
my hometown was destroyed by the Americans.

901
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,270
For me,

902
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,790
to die here

903
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,620
is a kind of destination.

904
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,390
All right, Mr. Ohashi.

905
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,060
Finish your last meal

906
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,940
and get ready.

907
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,260
The CNP disregarded

908
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,820
the protest of the CPC and progressives

909
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,460
and arbitrarily executed Ohashi Kazuya

910
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,570
on the grounds for

911
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,870
preventing Ohashi Kazuya and Japanese spies from

912
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,900
detonating the gas bombs out of desperation.

913
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,090
[Bring criminals to justice]

914
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,630
Prepare to execute!

915
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,840
[Bring criminals to justice]

916
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,480
Execute!

917
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,730
[Bring criminals to justice]

918
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,810
[Bring criminals to justice]
