00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,810
a girl

196
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,280
who asked me to give you a record?

197
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,700
She is my daughter, Reiko.

198
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,440
What happened?

199
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,170
She used to

200
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,640
be very happy.

201
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,780
But now

202
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,900
she has multiple sclerosis.

203
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,180
It's a neurological disease.

204
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,740
I've hired many doctors.

205
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,670
But they all told me

206
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,050
this disease can't be cured.

207
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,800
She will only get more and more rigid.

208
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,640
So

209
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,580
you're experimenting on so many Chinese people

210
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,960
to cure her?

211
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,760
My daughter's dancing was excellent.

212
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,360
Her childhood dream

213
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,740
was to join the Takarazuka Revue Company.

214
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,970
But it's cruel.

215
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,530
Fate is unpredictable.

216
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,620
She might never return

217
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,010
to the stage.

218
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,870
I know

219
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,850
how much she suffers.

220
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,700
So her temper

221
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,280
has gotten worse.

222
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm not eating.

223
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,450
I'm not eating.

224
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,930
Her temper is really bad.

225
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,990
What does that have to do with me?

226
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,570
She's my daughter.

227
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,110
So

228
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,370
I will do my best

229
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,160
to fulfill her wishes.

230
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,910
What do you want from me?

231
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,660
I hope

232
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,520
you can accompany her

233
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,560
and bring her happiness.

234
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,680
I can't do that.

235
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,500
And it has nothing to do with me.

236
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,900
Mr. Ou.

237
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,160
Trust me.

238
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,930
It will bring you great benefits.

239
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,310
I don't dare take your benefits.

240
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,140
I need to go back

241
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,540
and quickly write the Cherry Blossom Project.

242
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,990
Don't you want to reconsider?

243
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,500
Today's part

244
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
isn't finished yet.

245
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,570
Fine.

246
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,590
Take him back to the cell.

247
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,240
Go in there quickly.

248
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,780
Did Ohashi Kazuya ask you to approach and take care

249
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,710
of his daughter?

250
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,060
I saved her.

251
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,080
Where is the dance room?

252
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,140
I was taken there blindfolded.

253
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,870
But

254
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,730
I can confirm

255
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,750
that 810

256
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,170
is in a tropical valley.

257
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,050
After I got out,

258
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,620
soldiers escorted me along a corridor

259
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,800
to the end.

260
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,530
There's an elevator after the left turn of the iron door.

261
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,070
The elevator went up for about a minute.

262
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
It's on the surface.

263
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,920
The entrance to 810

264
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,620
should be inside a cave.

265
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,470
I could hear loud echoes

266
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,180
of our footsteps and voices.

267
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,950
There was the sound of running water at the cave entrance.

268
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,270
The amount of water

269
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,090
sounded like a small stream.

270
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,390
I walked out of the cave

271
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,610
and turned left for about 300 meters,

272
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,690
and I reached the Japanese living area.

273
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,080
There were guards at the entrance.

274
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,480
I could hear a lot of people talking around.

275
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,100
After entering the gate,

276
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,230
I turned right and walked 30 meters

277
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,110
to a steel door. I went in.

278
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,960
It should be their kitchen.

279
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,130
I walked 30 meters ahead.

280
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,850
There was another iron door.

281
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,900
After the second iron door, I turned left

282
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,230
and walked about 25 meters,

283
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,890
then turned right and went out to a small courtyard.

284
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,040
Reiko's dance room

285
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,240
is on the second floor

286
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,070
of a building in that courtyard.

287
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,150
What are you planning next?

288
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,660
I haven't decided yet.

289
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,270
This is a good opportunity.

290
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,830
Since she wants to see you so much,

291
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,030
she must have special feelings for you.

292
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,950
We could use her.

293
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,240
At a critical moment, we could take her hostage.

294
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,900
That would be very effective.

295
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,690
I could gain Ohashi's trust.

296
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,230
But I don't want

297
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,230
to involve

298
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,830
an innocent girl.

299
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,210
Your top priority now

300
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,890
is to gain the trust of Ohashi.

301
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,470
If you can go to the dance room every day,

302
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,320
it's a rare opportunity.

303
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,590
Mr. Ou.

304
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,080
Why is there an extra page?

305
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,750
I wrote more today.

306
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,510
Officer, I deeply regret

307
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,830
the matter

308
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,040
concerning Miss Reiko.

309
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,710
I thought it over.

310
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,240
No matter what,

311
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,110
Reiko is innocent.

312
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
If I

313
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,560
can improve

314
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,030
Reiko's mood

315
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,850
or condition,

316
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,250
I think I should

317
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,790
do the right thing.

318
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,450
Fine.

319
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,080
Reiko will be happy when she knows it.

320
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,840
I'll have her prepare well.

321
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
See you at the dance room at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

322
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,160
Officer.

323
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,270
In China,

324
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,910
we value relationships and etiquette.

325
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,130
I hope through this matter,

326
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,870
I can earn a favor from you.

327
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,140
Take him to tidy up.

328
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,890
Yes, I understand.

329
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,170
Do you remember me?

330
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,630
Miss Reiko.

331
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,830
Hello.

332
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
You may leave.

333
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,190
You really came.

334
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,700
Yes, I really...

335
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,050
It's okay.

336
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,110
I can speak Chinese too.

337
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,550
You can speak Chinese.

338
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,540
Thank you.

339
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Do you remember me?

340
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,220
Of course, I remember.

341
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,090
When I worked in Shanghai,

342
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,500
didn't you give me a vinyl record?

343
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,170
Do you know

344
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,510
what's in it?

345
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,010
I know.

346
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,100
I'll play it for you.

347
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,390
Have a seat.

348
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,070
I've observed everything.

349
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,130
If we want to escape, the dance room

350
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,640
is our only chance.

351
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,000
When do you plan to take action?

352
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,130
A long delay may give rise to many a hitch.

353
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,460
The sooner, the better.

354
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Be careful.

355
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,280
Unlock him.

356
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,880
Miss Reiko, this...

357
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,290
We need to get approval from Chief Ohashi.

358
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,180
I am your Chief Ohashi.

359
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,230
I order you to unlock him immediately.

360
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

361
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,600
In the future,

362
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
whenever Mr. Ou comes here,

363
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,280
I don't want to see chains on his feet.

364
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,110
-Yes, Ma'am.
-Yes, Ma'am.

365
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,310
Thank you.

366
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,550
Let's go.

367
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,480
Play a different piece today.

368
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,530
Alright.

369
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,420
With this familiar melody,

370
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,410
what do you remember?

371
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,790
Ando said

372
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,260
you had a special experience

373
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,790
with Ohashi Reiko.

374
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,160
She trusts and relies on you

375
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
a lot,

376
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,740
right?

377
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,550
Yes.

378
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,350
You didn't transcribe the information for Ohashi.

379
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,870
But he didn't kill you.

380
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,480
He even helped you

381
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,960
fake your death and surrender.

382
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,170
Is it

383
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,300
also because of Ohashi Reiko?

384
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
I'm not sure.

385
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,900
It could be for other reasons.

386
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,350
Ando was conducting human experiments.

387
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,280
He was very interested in my brain.

388
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,910
He has written out the entire Cherry Blossom Project.

389
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,400
Congratulations, Chief.

390
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,940
Thank you, Mr. Ou, for your hard work.

391
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,550
Without you,

392
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,320
the Cherry Blossom Project's information

393
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,330
wouldn't have been completed so quickly.

394
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,790
The progress of the KW30 experiment

395
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,430
wouldn't be so fast either.

396
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,270
Now,

397
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,860
another plan

398
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,690
should also be put on the agenda.

399
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,870
What's the matter?

400
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,330
Mr. Ou.

401
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,940
Long time no see.

402
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,390
Dr. Anto's experiments

403
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,810
have been on hold for a long time.

404
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,770
Now

405
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,410
they should be resumed.

406
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,520
That wasn't what we agreed on before.

407
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,020
That wasn't what we agreed on before.

408
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,270
[1941, 810 Laboratory in Burma]

409
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,080
Chief Ohashi promised me long ago

410
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
that once you finished transcribing

411
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,710
all the information on the Cherry Blossom Project,

412
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,630
he would return you to me.

413
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,219
This time,

414
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,230
I will definitely succeed.

415
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,639
Your photographic memory

416
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,730
and perfect brain

417
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,040
are too attractive to me.

418
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,670
Don't worry.

419
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,880
I won't let you die.

420
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I need you to help me complete

421
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,350
my memory manipulation experiment.

422
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,210
I slightly

423
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,390
improved the equipment this time.

424
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,870
I added some

425
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,790
different wave-shaped electrodes.

426
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,800
It might be a little uncomfortable.

427
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,750
But

428
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,360
I think this bit of pain

429
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,890
is nothing

430
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,040
to you.

431
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,710
Ou Xiao'an, you're here.

432
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm here.

433
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,980
Let's start.

434
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,840
[China-India Road is Open to Traffic]

435
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,150
Ou Xiao'an.

436
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,810
Let's begin.

437
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,840
Okay.

438
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm sorry.

439
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,610
Ou Xiao'an.

440
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,760
What's wrong?

441
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,690
It's nothing.

442
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,460
You have a nosebleed, and you say it's nothing?

443
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,510
I'll get you a doctor.

444
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,670
Don't.

445
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm fine.

446
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,640
It's just

447
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,860
a side effect of the experiment.

448
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,460
It happens often. It's okay.

449
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
Doctors can't do anything about it either.

450
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,850
What did you say?

451
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,830
They also experimented on you?

452
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,070
We prisoners down there

453
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,330
are all test subjects.

454
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,690
In Ohashi's eyes,

455
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,090
Chinese people are not human.

456
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,580

00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,350
Actually,

459
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm also Chinese.

460
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,970
My parents

461
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,460
are both Chinese.

462
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,240
They've always conducted experiments

463
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,530
on innocent compatriots in my name.

464
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,040
But actually,

465
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,530
I'm just a pawn of Ohashi.

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,570

00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,650
I'm sorry to everyone.

469
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,850
I'm fine.

470
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
I'm sorry.

471
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,970
Do you recognize this piano?

472
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,490
You played it with Ohashi Reiko back then.

Right?

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,870
I don't think so.

480
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,640
I can't remember clearly.

481

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,870
Zhou Siping has a son.

His son is Zhenzhong.

Do you remember?

Do you recall?

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,150

have heard them all, but

00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,790
I've forgotten.

You remember these letters, right?

497

They are all farewell letters from the prisoners in 810.

498
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,750
They have something to do with you, don't they?

499
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,840
How are you holding up?

500
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Can you handle it?

501
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,790
Too many experiments

502
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,300
have messed up

to their

command center in Rangoon for meetings.

511
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,400
I suspect

512
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,930
the Japanese army

513
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,980
will soon retreat.

514
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,770
The Japanese army is retreating?

810

516
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,500

517
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,840
The escape plan should be implemented as soon as possible.

518
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,330
When you return to the cell,

519
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,670
you'll find a small package

521
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,110
It contains letters

from our comrades to their families.

523
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,450
They may never

524
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,630
see their families again.

525
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,790
I ask you,

526
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
when you get out,

527
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,230
please make sure to deliver these letters.
