I just went to the cheongsam shop.

380

Lin told me you were here.

381
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,340
Too many things happened during the day.

382
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,440
I came out to think about it.

383
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,240
Shen Congwu took the transmitter-receiver.

384
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,670
I'll find a way to get it back.

385
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,970
You can't do anything.

386
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,780
It's too dangerous.

387
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,190
The transmitter-receiver points to Lai Junsheng.

388
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,920
I've arranged for him to leave.

389
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,330
I also want to turn him into Wild Grass

390
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,170
so that

391
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,070
Shen Congwu will stop looking for Wild Grass.

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,300
You've been protecting me all along.

393

Comrade Huo

394
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,040
committed suicide.

395
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,300
I was there when he died.

396
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,090
Even if he was arrested,

397
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,580
I would've find a way to save him.

398
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,580
At least he would still be alive.

399
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,110
He was afraid he'll get us into trouble.

402
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,670

403
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,120
He is your real brother.

405
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,040
Does he have any discipline at all?

406
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,940
I'm sorry, Qiushui.

407
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,320
All right.

408
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,760
Don't cry.

409
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,400
Come.

410
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,880
Look at me.

411
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,380

412

Comrade Huo wouldn't have died in vain.

415
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,840
There's a very tricky situation now.

416
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,550
We should report it to the organization immediately

417
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,810
and stop the Yunnan-Burma Guerrilla operation right now.

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,480
But our transmitter-receiver

419
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,630
can only be silent now.

420

My brother has a transmitter-receiver.

421

430
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,850
I was passing by.

431

Just in time for your return.

432
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,600
That was sent by Director Shen.

433
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,680

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,880

Tell me.

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,960
Can a person

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,130
really have no fear of life or death

448
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,290

449

What do you think beliefs are?

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,970
can give people endless power,

453
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,810
can make them responsible,

454
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,510
can give them clear goals

455
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,050
and make sure they know where they're going.

456
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,790

in the name of beliefs,

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,150

Of course.

I hope you can maintain them.

Director Shen,

471

in the past 24 hours,

00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,570
there were no signs of any suspicious waves.

Wild Grass' transmitter-receiver

475
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,200
might have be silenced.

476
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Not necessarily.

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,350
they haven't reported anything.

482
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,480
This means the news hasn't reached the Communist Party.

483
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,400
Keep an eye on the transmitter-receiver.

484
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,370

When I came here,

491
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,730
there was a traffic jam on the Taiping Road.

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,080

502
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,100
It's not about catching the arsonist.

503
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,040
Otherwise, why is would special agents be asking?

504
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,920

It's been over three years.

564
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,680
For the past three years,

565
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,250
the daily equipment maintenance of the Telecom Section Headquarters

566
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,050
has been done by him

567
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,480
after working hours.

568
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,920
Come to think of it,

569
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,020
he did have many chances

570
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,370
to access secret messages.

571
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,280
Timeline wise,

572
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,700
it coincides with the time that Wild Grass appeared too.

573
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Now that you think about it, it makes sense.

574
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,110
What were you doing earlier?

575
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,680
This man has been working as a repairman for four years.

576
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,940
He's been doing nothing but menial work,

577
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,850
has never been promoted or moved.

578
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,720
Didn't you find anything wrong

579
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,760
during the investigation?

580
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,030
He was promoted two years ago

581
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,080
to be the Section Chief of the Telecom Assessment Department

582
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,990
but because Lai Junsheng had a bad temper,

583
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,190
he offended everyone

584
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,040
in a few days.

585
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,110
So he was sent back to be an electric inspector again

586
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,950
and managed the small warehouse of the Telecom Section.

587
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,410
There are many parts there

588
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,550
that are exclusively used by NBIS internally and for the military.

589
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,990
I think Lai Junsheng took advantage of his position

590
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,650
and stole from the warehouse.

591
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,250
Where is Lai Junsheng?

592
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,000
He ran away.

593
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,150
He didn't go to work.

594
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,790
We asked his neighbors,

595
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,020
they all said they didn't notice if he was home.

596
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,630
When inspecting the warehouse yesterday,

597
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,230
he probably realised.

598
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,040
That's why he said he had an emergency at home.

599
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,290
This is the list after the inspection.

600
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,470
The other parts are still being checked.

601
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,590
But the dry battery

602
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,220
was taken out this week.

603
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,760
So the warehouse hasn't been tampered with.

604
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,870
Director Shen.

605
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,560
Did you catch Wild Grass?

606
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
Yes.

607
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,590
Where is he?

608
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,510
Wild Grass.

609
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,620
You didn't mention

610
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,430
Wild Grass in front of him, did you?

611
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,750
Of course not.

612
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,210
I'm an experienced member now.

613
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,790
Don't look down on me.

614
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,120
Yunjie.

615
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,200
You've really improved.

616
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,710
No matter what,

617
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,110
you can't trust anyone easily.

618
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,430
Even me.

619
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,770
[Tan Mansion]

620
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,400
Look at her.

621
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,740
My Lady is back.

622
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,560
I'll go get Master.

623
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,710
Moqing is back.

624
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,530
Come on, serve the dishes.

625
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,630
Didn't I tell you not to wait for me?

626
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,620
It's my birthday today.

627
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,310
How can I do without you?

628
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,060
Birthday gift.

629
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,840
Moqing is the most considerate.

630
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,040
You're finally back.

631
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,060
Moqing, listen.

632
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,620
Your brother didn't prepare anything for me.

633
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,510
I spent my brother's money anyway.

634
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,800
If I prepare a gift, it's the same as him preparing one.

635
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,100
You are just siding with your brother.

636
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,420
Let's eat.

637
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,210
Let's eat.

638
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,690
Did you invite another guest today?

639
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,560
No.

640
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,820
It's just our family.

641
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,630
Whose car is that?

642
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,050
Hasn't that car been

643
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,760
parked there since noon?

644
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,770
Noon?

645
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,670
Are you...

646
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,830
Did you...

647
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,630
offend someone?

648
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,360
And they're here for you?

649
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,910
What are you talking about?

650
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,110
I feel uneasy.

651
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,520
Brother,

652
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,870
I suddenly remembered that I have something to do.

653
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,710
I need to go out.

654
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,280
Wait, have dinner before you leave, Moqing.

655
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,200
You guys eat first. Don't wait for me.

656
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,870
Moqing!

657
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,700
Moqing!

658
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,360
Today is my birthday.

659
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,920
I can't even have a proper meal.

660
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,010
Master.
