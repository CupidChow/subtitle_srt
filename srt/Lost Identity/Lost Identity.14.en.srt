What do you mean?

6
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,110
You've started

7
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,170
using a pile of lies to cover your first lie.

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
So,

00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,200
you think I'm lying?

10
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,680
Let me ask you.

11
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,200
Why did you burn the documents of the Cherry Blossom Project

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,860
on the train from Shanghai to Nanjing back then?

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,850
The situation was urgent.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,150
I was afraid that the Cherry Blossom Project’s documents

15
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,480
would fall into the hands of the Japanese.

16
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,370

Do you two need more time to talk, or what?

23

No need.

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,910
What’s the relationship

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,410

27
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,640
With so many accusations,

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,770
Director Shen can still cover for him?

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,730
They’re just close.

In the non-combat state

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,900

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,390
the Japanese army's driving speed

38
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,600

to 35 kilometers per hour.

40
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
So, based on this calculation,

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,410
810 should be

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,040
located about a thousand kilometers

to search the nearby jungles

54
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,870
but found nothing.

[Laka]

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,560
So we can rule out this area.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,710
Do you recall

58
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,000
riding a truck when you escaped?

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,320
I don't remember.

60
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,640
Limited Japanese standard truck tracks

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,600
were found on the nearest

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
passable road

63
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,010
to Laka Valley.

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,250
But due to severe mudslides,

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
no further judgment could be made.

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,720
If I did

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,470
ride a truck when I escaped,

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,920
then the distance

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,600
would far exceed a thousand kilometers.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,730
It might not even be in this area at all.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,080
The terrain in the Burmese mountains is very complex,

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,540
and some primeval forests

73
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,150
are blind spots on the map.

74
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,920
To conduct a more in-depth search,

75
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,670
we must narrow down the range.

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,810
At least we need a general direction.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Think again.

78
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,770
810 is where Ohashi Kazuya

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,630
used for secret biochemical weapon research

80
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,090
and detaining prisoners.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,970
It should meet several conditions.

82
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,680
First, there must be a sufficient water source

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,159
to ensure living and research supplies.

84
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,840
Second,

85
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,250
it should be far from major transportation routes to remain hidden.

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,890
So,

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,600
there should be natural barriers

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
like dense forests or valleys.

89
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,220
Section Chief Li, your analysis makes sense.

90
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,640
I’ve analyzed this

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,200
many times before.

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,120
It’s unlikely to be in the forest.

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,320
Because the forest is too dense, making construction

94
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,370
and defense difficult.

95
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,770
If it’s by a water source,

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,330
I remember

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,140
a large part of 810

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,940
was built underground.

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
Too close to the water source

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
would make constructing

101
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,440
large underground facilities impossible.

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,480
So, I think the most likely location

103
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,130
should be

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,560
between the forest and the water source,

105
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,180
like a river valley.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,670
It could also be

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,730
a large open area next to the tropical forest.

108
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,090
Ou Xiao'an.

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
Your analysis is also good.

110
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,520
Li Shaotang, if you were Ohashi,

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,330

Shen Congwu, the secretary of the A Room at headquarters,

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,970
personally went to Chongqing Station

216
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,050
as a special envoy to oversee the work.

217

Later, he went to Burma

229

230

We have found a general area,

239

Ou Xiao'an was held there before,

Isn’t this No. 79 Huayuan Road?

382
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,780
You're looking for that Mr. Li?

383
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,520
Yes.

384
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,850
It’s hard to find his house.

385
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,920
I’ll take you there.

386
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,080
No, no, I can go by myself.

387
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
I can go by myself.

388
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,050
It's hard to find. You won't find it.

389
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,650
Really, I'll take you.

390
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,360
Let's go.

391
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,130
No need. I can go by myself.

392
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:32,800
I can go by myself.

393
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,650
You're looking for Mr. Li.

394
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,200
But he doesn’t see visitors. Why are you looking for him?

395
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,960
I...

396
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,900
I’m delivering some fruit to him.

397
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,520
I see.

398
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,950
Even if you go, he won’t see you.

399
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,730
How about this?

400
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,190
Let me help you deliver it.

401
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,070
Let me help you.

402
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,330
What's your name? I'll tell him your name.

403
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,610
No, thanks.

404
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,550
You don't even want to leave your name?

405
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,500
-No need.
-Okay.

406
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,240
Close the door for me.

407
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,730
Ou Xiao'an read Li Shaotang’s polygraph report.

408
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,970
The report shows

409
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,290
a high possibility of Li Shaotang being a Communist.

410
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,350
It suggests repeated verification.

411
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,780
How credible are Ou Xiao'an’s words?

412
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Although I can’t be sure

413
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,640
if Ou Xiao'an’s words are completely true,

414
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,880
given Li Shaotang’s polygraph performance,

415
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,840
Shen Congwu not only didn’t conduct

416
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,100
further verification

417
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,670
but also gave him the opportunity

418
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,930
to contact our people.

419
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
This is too abnormal.

420
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,280
Are you worried

421
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,980
that Li Shaotang has been turned by Shen Congwu?

422
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,050
Shen Congwu is deep-minded.

423
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,930
And Li Shaotang’s identity is uncertain.

424
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,450
I’m just worried about this possibility.

425
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,580
Until Li Shaotang’s identity is confirmed,

426
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,440
the cheongsam shop will only do business

427
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
and not contact.

428
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,920
I have already rented a new house outside

429
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,980
as a contact point.

430
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,760
Got it.

431
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,880
I have handed

432
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,080
the cloth strip over to the higher-ups for verification.

433
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,400
Moqing.

434
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,640
whether it’s Ou Xiao'an or Li Shaotang,

435
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,360
you see each other often.

436
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,160
Protect yourselves.

437
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Don't worry.

438
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
I can handle it.

439
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,170
What's wrong?

440
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,830
Sister, something happened.

441
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,690
What happened?

442
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,030
Li Shaotang and I may have been exposed.

443
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,980
How did you know?

444
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,410
Ou Xiao'an came to the shop to see me.

445
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,680
He told me about 9548.

446
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,450
It seems Comrade Yaso’s guess was correct.

447
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,920
This cloth strip

448
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,640
really means a lot.

449
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,750
According to Ou Xiao'an,

450
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,690
9548 should be

451
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,330
some form of identity proof.

452
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,480
He always hinted that

453
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,250
this number

454
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,830
can prove his relationship with the organization.

455
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,920
When I first reported this intelligence

456
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,090
to the higher-ups,

457
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,370
the organization searched through

458
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,920
all materials related to Ou Xiao'an

459
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
and Lou Mingyuan.

460
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,040
This included the highest level

461
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,250
of secret documents from the Shanghai

462
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,200
and East China underground committees.

463
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,610
There was no record

464
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,800
related to 9548.

465
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,680
Yes.

466
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,810
During the process,

467
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,290
the code to summon Li Shaotang was discovered.

468
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,750
That’s why I was sent over.

469
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,210
If Ou Xiao'an is our comrade

470
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,000
and lost contact

471
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,410
with the organization due to amnesia,

472
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,060
then Li Shaotang’s identity and motives

473
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,850
are highly suspicious.

474
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,430
But since waking up from the hospital,

475
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,210
Ou Xiao'an voluntarily returned to the NBIS.

476
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,720
The one who used the code to find me

477
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
was Li Shaotang.

478
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,220
How do you explain his actions today?

479
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,450
Is it possible that

480
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,120
Li Shaotang had issues during the polygraph

481
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,330
and is now suspected by the NBIS

482
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,890
Today’s act by Ou Xiao'an

483
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,320
was just a trap by the NBIS.

484
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,400
Li Shaotang and I

485
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,930
are already being watched by the NBIS.

486
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,640
Anyway,

487
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,550
Ou Xiao'an has found you.

488
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,770
Your contact point is no longer safe.

489
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,320
Quickly organize the comrades to evacuate.

490
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,000
No.

491
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,160
If I leave,

492
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,900
Li Shaotang will be in danger.

493
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,880
Besides, the organization

494
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,790
urgently needs information about 810.

495
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,240
Whether it’s Ou Xiao'an or Li Shaotang,

496
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,800
they are both key to obtaining intelligence.

497
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,690
Only by staying

498
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,480
can I complete the organization’s task.

499
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,420
I disagree.

500
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,560
You should evacuate quickly.

501
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,470
I will find a way to handle

502
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,030
Ou Xiao'an and Li Shaotang.

503
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,030
Sister.

504
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,760
There's no better way.

505
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,980
It's safest for me to investigate.

506
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,570
If you and Yaso

507
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,270
get too involved,

508
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,660
you’ll be at risk of exposure at any time.

509
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,900
Then

510
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,360
neither you nor your line

511
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,990
will be safe.

512
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,800
The organization might also

513
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
face greater losses.

514
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,390
As per your instructions,

515
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,250
I’ve told Huo Daming everything.

516
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,090
But he didn’t have any special reaction.

517
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,750
He just said he would report to the Communist Party’s higher-ups.

518
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,580
He can remain calm

519
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,400
in the face of such information?

520
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,800
I even hinted

521
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,040
that I suspected Ou Xiao'an was a Communist.

522
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,900
But he was calmer than I expected.

523
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,770
It didn’t seem like

524
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,900
he was hearing this for the first time.

525
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,320
It’s more like he also suspects that Ou Xiao'an

526
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,400
is a Communist.

527
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,160
Given Ou Xiao'an’s relationship

528
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,760
with Lou Mingyuan,

529
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,000
it's possible.

530
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,770
All right, keep following up.

531
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,630
Report to me if anything happens.

532
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,560
Yes.

533
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,090
This is the transmission content.

534
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,810
Encode it and send it immediately.

535
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,480
Okay.

536
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,720
They will definitely reply

537
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,000
as soon as they receive it.

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Get ready to receive it. I’ll wait here.

539
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,800
It's done.

540
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,230
The situation is special.

541
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,680
Is there anything unusual

542
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
within the NBIS?

543
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,710
Everything is safe at the moment. Don't worry.

544
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,970
Take care of yourself.

545
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,800
Yes.

546
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,330
They've replied.

547
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,510
Director Shen.

548
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,240
That radio station has started operating again.

549
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,410
Can you locate its position?

550
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,570
No.

551
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,520
The time was too short.

552
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,210
I can't detect it.

553
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,490
Can we confirm it's the station related to Yaso?

554
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,940
The methods are consistent.

555
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,230
Based on the map,

556
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,370
it's roughly in this area.

557
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,790
The bigger fish

558
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,290
is about to take the bait.

559
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Wait.

560
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,230
I'll do it myself.

561
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,720
Don't knock.

562
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,390
We're from the NBIS Chongqing Station.

563
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,790
A temporary spot check. Please cooperate.

564
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,490
You're from the Chongqing Station?

565
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,560
NBIS Telecom Section.

566
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,960
[Name: Lai Junsheng]

567
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,080
Sir.

568
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,400
What are you checking in the middle of the night?

569
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,770
We are acting on orders.

570
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,630
We detected

571
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,130
enemy radio signals in this area.

572
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,660
The situation is urgent. Please understand.

573
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,500
You two, investigate it carefully.

574
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Who's there, Lai?

575
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,770
Nothing, just two meter readers.

576
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,900
You go ahead and take the shower. I'll come over in a bit.

577
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,600
Sorry, Sir.

578
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,320
Sorry to bother you.

579
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
Hurry up and leave.

580
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,050
Let's go.

581
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,290
Two brats.

582
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,870
How dare you investigate anywhere?

583
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,060
The NBIS has been acting strangely lately.

584
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,720
If you hadn't reacted quickly just now,

585
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,440
I would have been caught.

586
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,810
For them to come and check in person

587
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,390
means they've already pinpointed the general area of the radio station.

588
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,520
From now on,

589
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,000
your radio must go silent.

590
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,540
I'll move the radio station.

591
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,870
If necessary, you might have to leave too.

592
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,750
If the radio station is removed,

593
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,830
won't you lose contact

594
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,200
with the higher-ups?

595
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,830
I can re-establish contact after it's cut off.

596
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,400
You've been undercover in the NBIS for so many years.

597
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,000
It's a miracle

598
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,350
this radio station has operated till now.

599
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
Now, destroy all the data.

600
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,890
Remember.

601
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,280
Keep it silent

602
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,790
from now on.

603
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,890
Yes.

604
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,550
Immediately order Li

605
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,860
to gather intelligence obtained by the 810 team.

606
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,710
Also, verify its credibility.

607
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,480
Additionally, no relevant clues have been found

608
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,610
regarding Ou and 9548.

609
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,810
Xu.

610
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,530
I'll head to the 810 in a bit.

611
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,160
Yes.

612
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,280
Section Chief Li.

613
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,650
Let me take that out for you.

614
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,330
Thank you.

615
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,130
Hello, Special Technology Research Lab.

616
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,480
Hello, is this Mr. Li?

617
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,220
It's me.

618
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,680
Mr. Li, are you still interested in selling the mahogany furniture

619
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,080
you mentioned last time?

620
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,430
Yes.

621
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,290
Why? Is there a buyer?

622
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,190
Yes.

623
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,200
The buyers said

624
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,520
they are willing to take similar goods

625
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
if you have more.

626
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,890
Great. Thank you so much.

627
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,160
Let’s proceed as we discussed earlier.

628
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,370
You handle the buyer.

629
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,670
Five percent commission.

630
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,790
Okay, no problem.

631
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Okay, thank you.

632
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Section Chief Li.

633
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,780
Section Chief Li, your ID.

634
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,620
Section Chief Li, please come in.

635
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Section Chief Li.

636
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,610
Section Chief Jiang.

637
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,340
Is there

638
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,570
new telegram from Burma?

639
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,560
How is the search progress?

640
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,090
No.

641
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,890
The Burmese side said

642
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,950
the area we gave is still quite vague.

643
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,520
And the local terrain is very complex.

644
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,570
It’s all dense forest.

645
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,600
The search is very difficult.

646
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,530
They hope we can provide coordinates as a reference.

647
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,740
Where are Section Chief Qin and Ou Xiao'an?

648
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,870
Section Chief Qin took Ou Xiao'an out.

649
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,790
What's going on?

650
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,550
Our team has just been established for a few days.

651
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,170
There are fewer and fewer people working.

652
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,230
Isn't it too quiet?

653
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,520
What's going on?

654
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,470
Director Shen.

655
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,610
Do you have any instructions?

656
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Vice Captain Wen.

657
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,680
You seem to cherish your student very much.

658
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,130
During the meeting that day,

659
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,000
I met Ou Xiao'an for the first time.

660
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,010
Although we only spoke two sentences,

661
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,120
I could feel

662
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,790
he is a smart kid.

663
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,610
Your trust and appreciation for him,

664
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,970
including your personal concern,

665
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
became understandable right away.

666
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,680
Director Shen, are you referring to

667
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,010
the treatment arrangement I made for him?

668
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,480
I apologize for not

669
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,730
informing you in advance.

670
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,470
But I was really anxious.

671
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,010
I wanted to find clues about 810 as soon as possible.

672
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,000
Vice Captain Wen, you misunderstood.

673
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,610
I don't mean to blame you.

674
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,500
Treatment is a good thing.

675
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,630
How is it?

676
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,480
How is he recovering?

677
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,250
Has he remembered anything?

678
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
Not yet.

679
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,730
Really nothing?

680
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,520
Really.

681
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,100
Really nothing.

682
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,500
Then let's find a chance

683
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,000
for me to talk to him alone.

684
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,070
Alright.

685
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,710
Director Shen.

686
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,370
Urgent intelligence from Burma.

687
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,280
[Ambushed by Japanese troops, heavy casualties]

688
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,280
[Expeditionary Force sent a team to search for 810]

689
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,410
Hello, Director Shen.

690
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,790
-Director Shen.
-Director Shen.

691
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,410
[Burmese intelligence]

692
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,290
Darn it.

693
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,860
Director Shen, what happened?

694
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,440
Our Expeditionary Force squad

695
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,170
sent to search for 810

696
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,400
was ambushed

697
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,600
by the Japanese right after setting out.

698
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,010
Do the Japanese have a crystal ball

699
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,490
or an ear to the ground?

700
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,450
Or is there a Japanese mole

701
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,330
in your Chongqing Station?

702
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,560
Investigate it!

703
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,470
Director Shen.

704
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,730
Should our primary task

705
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,210
be to find the traitor or to search for 810?

706
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,050
Both.

707
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,800
Yes.

708
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,080
I don’t believe

709
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,480
that after we find 810

710
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,090
and Ohashi Kazuya,

711
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,860
we can't uncover the traitor.

712
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,000
Where are Section Chief Qin and Ou Xiao'an?

713
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,650
Report.

714
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,850
Section Chief Qin took Ou Xiao'an out.

715
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,210
Ou Xiao'an.

716
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,130
I know the coordinates of 810.

717
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,480
Precise coordinates.

718
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,239

719
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,800

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,530
Longitude 97° 26'.

721
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,700
[Power]

722
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,800
Our treatment is over.

723
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,830
Rest for a while.

724
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,580
Thank you.

725
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,950
What’s wrong?

726
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,960
I remembered the address of 810.

727
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Let's go back to the station and report.

728
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,340
Wait.

729
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,280
Can you trust the people at the station?

730
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
No.

731
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,210
But there are

732
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,140
many prisoners there.

733
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,410
If I don't report it,

734
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
will you go and save them?

735
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,830
This is

736
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,770
the fastest way.

737
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,930
So 810's location

738
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,440
is at longitude 97° 26'.

739
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,170
The Expeditionary Force should be able

740
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,660
to find it along this line.

741
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,450
That's all you remember?

742
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,500
That's all I remember.

743
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,650
Regardless of whether what you say is true or not,

744
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,690
with just a longitude and no latitude,

745
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,650
do you expect

746
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
the Expeditionary Force

747
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,960
to search from south to north in Burma?

748
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,930
I don't know the latitude.

749
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,530
Liao Zhijing didn’t tell me.

750
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,210
Judging by the ambush location of the Expeditionary Force,

751
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,730
it's not on the line

752
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,970
of longitude 97° 26'.

753
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
I think

754
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,400
this path is correct.

755
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,770
The Japanese

756
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,550
misled the direction.

757
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,540
Report.

758
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Liao Zhijing's file has been found.

759
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,840
Tell me.

760
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,240
Liao Zhijing, Deputy Station Chief of NBIS Nanchang Station.

761
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
In the 30th year of the Republic of China,

762
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,720
he was arrested by the Japanese military police in Nanchang.

763
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,650
Since then, there has been no news.

764
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,590
Okay.

765
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,820
I will send a telegram to the Expeditionary Force.

766
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,250
We'll search along the directiom

767
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,250
you mentioned.

768
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,390
Does everyone know

769
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,540
what the matter is?

770
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,850
Seeing your beaming face,

771
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,560
it must be great news.

772
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,890
Please go ahead.

773
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,720
Read it.

774
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,480
Yes.

775
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,250
To Director Shen of the NBIS Chongqing Office,

776
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,690
according to the information provided,

777
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,040
the team sent by the 38th Division

778
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,950
successfully found the location of 810.

779
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,610
However, no Japanese troops were found inside 810.

780
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,760
Only various biochemical experimental equipment

781
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
and countless experimental files were discovered.

782
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,350
108 prisoners were rescued,

783
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
including 47 soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army.

784
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
Telegram from the Staff Office of the 38th Division.

785
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,650
Director Shen, this is a remarkable achievement.

786
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,320
Applause.

787
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,850
Good.

788
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,460
Everyone, sit down.

789
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,630
Have them make a catalog

790
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
of the biochemical data

791
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,470
and send a telegram to Li Shaotang.

792
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,080
Yes.

793
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,880
Shaotang.

794
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,450
Yes.

795
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,170
Analyze it quickly.

796
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,410
Yes.

797
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,580
Director Shen.

798
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,770
Wasn't Ohashi found

799
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,530
when 810 was discovered?

800
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,650
He must

801
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,520
have fled upon hearing the news.

802
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,360
I have sent a telegram to the 38th Division

803
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,600
asking them to continue the search.

804
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,330
Yes.

805
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,370
Right.

806
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
This time

807
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
we not only found 810.

808
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,400
There is another

809
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,330
unexpected gain.

810
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
We captured

811
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,690
22 surviving

812
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,250
Communists

813
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,770
held there.

814
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,690
The Director was very pleased

815
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,000
to hear this news.

816
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
The Military Commission

817
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,770
has already contacted the NBIS.

818
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,920
These Communists

819
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,480
will be secretly detained

820
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,140
and interrogated by our NBIS.

821
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,520
We will take over these Communists

822
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,900
at the border in Ruili.

823
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,180
The Director also said

824
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,680
that after this mission is over,

825
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,480
everyone will be rewarded.

826
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,000
So, everyone must continue to work hard.

827
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,880
-Yes!
-Yes!

828
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,880
Ou Xiao'an.

829
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,410
Yes.

830
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,770
You made a great contribution this time.

831
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,620
All thanks to Director Shen’s excellent leadership.

832
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,040
If we could capture Ohashi,

833
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,370
it would be even better.

834
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Xiao'an.

835
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,730
To receive such praise from Director Shen

836
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,370
makes me, as your teacher, very proud.

837
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,890
Vice Captain Feng, Captain Wei.

838
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,730
Isn't that right?

839
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,800
Vice Captain Wen has taught an excellent student.

840
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,870
I envy him.

841
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,000
Bosslady.

842
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,870
Miss Qin sent this cheongsam.

843
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,970
She said she doesn't like the collar very much.

844
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,360
She asked us to modify it.

845
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,090
She seemed to need it urgently.

846
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,080
I see.

847
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,400
Go back to work.

848
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,930
Lin.

849
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,060
My migraine is acting up.

850
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,550
Close the shop

851
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,840
and go to Jishi Clinic.

852
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,590
Have them send the medicine

853
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,000
to my house.
