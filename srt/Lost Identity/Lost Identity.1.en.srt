Doctor Qin.

194
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,090
These two American soldiers

195
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,760
had diarrhea, vomiting and high fever last night.

196
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,310
I thought they had acute gastroenteritis

197
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,840
so I gave them antibiotics.

198
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,840
But this morning,

199
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,870
their condition worsened.

200
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,600
They were like this when I came.

201
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,480
Doctor Qin.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Doctor Qin!

203
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,740
Here.

204
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,330
If these two American soldiers

205
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,410
die in our hands,

206
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,780
we wouldn't be able to explain ourselves.

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,390
Boris.

208
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,740
Boris!

209
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,960
Jackson.

210
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,120
Jackson.

211
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,470
No.

212
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,530
How on earth do you Chinese military doctors treat people?

213
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,640
Two strong American soldiers

214
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,369
just had a common case of acute gastroenteritis.

215
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,650
But after two shots from you guys,

216
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,810
they died?

217
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,520
Carl.

218
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,140
We're using

219
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,500
medical products that you guys provided.

220
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,890
You doctors are the problem.

221
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,859
Carl, let go!

222
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,990
Let go!

223
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,030
Carl.

224
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,869
This is not the time to hold anyone accountable.

225
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,200
What's important now is to find out the cause of the illness.

226
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,440
Carl,

227
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,560
you don't want your two comrades

228
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,760
to die in vain, do you?

229
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,480
Let go.

230
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,360
Let go.

231
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,530
Let go!

232
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,740
It doesn't look like a normal inflammation.

233
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,100
It looks like a highly infectious virus.

234
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,040
Impossible.

235
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,270
We were together all of yesterday.

236
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,730
If it's like you say,

237
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,950
why aren't we dead?

238
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,150
What's with those Burmese girls?

239
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,220
They are here

240
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
to celebrate with us.

241
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,360
Carl.

242
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,030
Did these two

243
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,160
interact with those Burmese women yesterday?

244
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,240
We just

245
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,190
drinking and dancing.

246
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,300
Is that really all?

247
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
Bullshit!

248
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
This is all bullshit.

249
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,610
You're talking nonsense.

250
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,330
I want to report to the general.

251
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,790
You Chinese will not shirk responsibility.

252
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,390
Isolate Carl and all the soldiers

253
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,180
who interacted with the Burmese women.

254
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,060
Everyone!

255
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,670
Who knows

256
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
where the Burmese women are?

257
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,890
Be careful.

258
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,870
This way.

259
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,160
We're almost there.

260
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,600
Is this the place?

261
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,530
It's this house.

262
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,700
Auntie Li.

263
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,370
Wait here.

264
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,240
Auntie Li.

265
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,750
Auntie Li, are you home?

266
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,090
Auntie Li!

267
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
Auntie Li.

268
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Kid.

269
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,720
Your mother...

270
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,090
Mom.

271
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,470
Wake up.

272
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,560
Kid.

273
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,090
Do you know what your mother ate,

274
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,970
what she drank and where she went?

275
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,500
Quick, translate for me.

276
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,270
Okay.

277
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,270
Kid,

278
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,180
do you know where your mother went

279
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,390
what she ate and what she drank?

280
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,830
Water.

281
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,490
Water?

282
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,800
What is this?

283
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,540
This is a local drink.

284
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,250
Her mother probably drank this.

285
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,420
What is this made of?

286
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,220
Creek water and some local fruits.

287
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,720
Has this happened before?

288
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,370
No.

289
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,830
Where does the water come from?

290
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,800
Laka Valley.

291
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,710
Laka Valley.

292
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I need two people!

293
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,220
Get rid of the body quickly

294
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,500
and take the little girl back to the military camp.

295
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,100
Yes.

296
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
Tell everyone in the village

297
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,590
that they can't drink water from Laka Valley anymore.

298
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,510
Okay.

299
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,730
Go to Laka Valley.

300
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,480
There is a Japanese who is alive there.

301
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,390
Bring him back for questioning

302
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,500
and see if he has anything to do with this.

303
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,140
Yes.

304
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
He's still alive.

305
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,390
Bring him back to the military camp.

306
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,190
Yes.

307
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,850
This way.

308
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,180
Slow down.

309
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,930
Inside.

310
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,630
Thank you.

311
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,810
Put him on the bed. Hurry.

312
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,870
One, two, go.

313
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,500
Slowly.

314
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,090
Take the stretcher away.

315
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,830
Sterilized cotton wool.

316
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,170
Hurry, sterilized cotton wool.

317
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,510
Needle.

318
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,090
Hang it up.

319
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,590
Get out of here!

320
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,660
We're Americans. Save us first.

321
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,260
This man matters a lot.

322
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,980
If he dies,

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,120
we all die.

324
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,890
From my preliminary judgement,

325
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,060
local water supply was contaminated with the virus.

326
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,010
Those Burmese women

327
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,220
drank the contaminated water

328
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,170
and then passed it on

329
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,630
to the American soldiers.

330
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,180
I suspect that the source of the virus

331
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,380
is Laka Valley.

332
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,600
-And...
-You said you found

333
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
six Japanese soldiers.

334
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,630
Yes, the other five are dead.

335
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,830
Only the one inside is still breathing.

336
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,760
Are they all infected?

337
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,930
No sign of infection was found on the bodies.

338
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,180
Three of them died of fatal gunshot wounds.

339
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,890
As for the other two,

340
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,720
one of them had their heart and lungs pierced by a tree branch.

341
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,980
The other had a cervical spine fracture.

342
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,890
Also,

343
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,570
on the bodies,

344
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,020
we found Japanese bullets.

345
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,620
Japanese bullets?

346
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,050
The Japanese are fighting among themselves.

347
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,380
Internal conflict?

348
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,190
Chief, the priority now

349
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,340
is to find out the source of the virus.

350
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,780
Maybe that Japanese soldier

351
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
is the only way we can break through.

352
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,950
This is ridiculous.

353
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,740
Let's not talk about the accuracy of your judgment.

354
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,470
Just the fact that you brazenly

355
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,610
dragged a Japanese soldier back here to save.

356
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,300
How do you expect me to explain this to the Americans?

357
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,420
Qin Moqing, you're too bold!

358
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm not saving the Japanese.

359
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,480
Our priority now

360
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,030
is to find out if the Japanese soldier

361
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,550
has a virus on him.

362
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,200
If everything is as I think,

363
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,440
maybe that Japanese guy

364
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,970
is the only one who can save those American soldiers.

365
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,650
If everything is as you think.

366
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,010
What are you thinking?

367
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,290
The test results are not out yet,

368
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,890
I can't jump to conclusions.

369
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,660
But Chief, I want to remind you

370
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,630
the Japanese never give up

371
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
on germ warfare.

372
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,160
I hope you can give me some time.

373
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,920
How is he?

374
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,220
He's out of danger.

375
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,630
The gunshot wound

376
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,710
is not a big problem

377
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,570
but

378
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,340
there're obvious bruises on his head.

379
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,590
He might have been

380
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,380
hit by a hard object at some point.

381
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,350
It's unclear

382
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,380
when he'll wake up.

383
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,850
Is the blood test report out yet?

384
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,830

573
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,679
The Japanese will be defeated sooner or later.

574
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,130
When the Japanese leave,

who will our real enemy

576
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,070
become?

577
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,640
I understand.

578
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,380
We'll the poison gas bombs

579
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,180
to use against the communists

580
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700

This is what Mr. Dai wants.

582

You're worth teaching.

583
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,790

584
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,060

588

589

It's spreading too fast.

590
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,810
Carry him in.

591
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,410
Carry him in and give him some antibiotics.

592
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,070

593
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,200
What's wrong?

594
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,810
You're infected too?

595
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,170
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,220
I'll draw your blood twice a day.

597
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,120
I have no choice. I'm infected too.

598

But, in the end,

599
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,560
I saved your life.

600
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,870
It's nothing to draw some of your blood.

601
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,220
Hurry.

602
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,410
Go.

604
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,450
Go to 810 to save people.

606
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,320
Save them.

607
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,400
Wake up.

608
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,420
Where is 810?

609
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,880
Save them!

610
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,800

Thank you, Mr. Li.

615
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,950
Every time I invite you for a drink, you don't go.

616
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,300
Mainly because you're too busy.

617
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,770
Next time, we must have a couple of drinks.

618
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,850
Okay, next time.

619

624

the intelligence gathered by your comrades

625
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,280
in the Chongqing Station about Myanmar

626
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,610
is extremely valuable.

627
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,560
810 is the continuation of the Cherry Blossom Project.

628
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,950
Ohashi Kazuya is likely still alive.

629
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,160

633
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,600
According to the intelligence

634
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,110
sent back by Comrade Yaso,

635

many missing anti-Japanese personnel

636
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,380
might have been sent there.

637
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,830
That's right.

638
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,550
We also learned this

639
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,960
from the Soviet side.

640
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,510
After the Japanese decided

641
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,380
to defend the north and advance to the south,

642
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,530

643
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,050
biochemical research institutions in the south as well.

644
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,750
They are doing the same shady business

645
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,900
as the Manchurian Unit 731.

646
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,450

647
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,910

650

corroborates this.

652
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,520

to investigate 810 and Ohashi.

654
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,440
We must get ahead of them

655
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,680

656
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,080

657
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,920
Okay.

658
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,100
The higher-ups instructed us

659
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,340
to quickly find out

660
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,050

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,650

743
