00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,170
I'm Liang Yuecheng

192
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,680
Captain of the Patrol Team of the 5th Division of the Chongqing Police Department.

193
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,340
Did you bring the police here?

194
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,430
It was all arranged by Captain Wei.

195
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,870
NBIS cases

196
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,550
are none of your business.

197
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,080
Someone reported

198
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,270
that her family went missing.

199
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,270
I'm here to check.

200
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,800
Don't get me wrong.

201
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,200
It's just procedure.

202
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,440
Go on with your work.

203
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,870
Listen.

204
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,810
You can't take anyone from here.

205
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,770
Understand?

206
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,700
Yes, of course.

207
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,270
Good.

208
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,540
Three minutes and 21 seconds.

209
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
Hang in there a little longer next time.

210
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,150
Give him some water.

211
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,120
Zeng Jiwu, right?

212
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
I'll leave this place to you.

213
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,280
You better be able to get something out of them.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,230
Key Japanese war criminal Ohashi Kazuya was executed.

215

I promised 9548

262

that we'll meet at Wanding, the Chinese entrance

263
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,960
to the Yunnan-Burma Road.

264
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,170
You made such a promise?

265
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,630

266
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,710
I know.

267
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,950
But this is the only clue

268
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,560
I can remember now.

269
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,450
If you guys have connections there,

270
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,200
see if you can find out

271
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,670
if the nearby villagers have seen him.

272
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,560
Or help me find

273
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,390
if he left any clues there.

274
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,920
This man

275
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
is very dark.

276
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,440
About 174 meters.

277
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,830
Big eyes.

278
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,710
Does he have any other traits?

279
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,000
He used to play mute,

280
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,190
but in fact,

281
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,750
he can speak.

282
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,320
What about information on his identity?

283
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,310
Any identifying information?

284
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,270
I don't remember.

285
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,510
Okay.

286
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,040
I'll try.

287
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,320
One more thing.

[Japanese war criminal Ohashi Kazuya was sentenced to death by hanging]

289
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,480
The higher-ups care so much about Ohashi.

290
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,000
After we finally caught him,

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,060
why were they so eager to execute him?

292
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,660
That's what I'm most worried about, too.

293
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm worried that Ohashi

294
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,450
was willing to die

295
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,570

296
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,110
I don't think so.

297

Ohashi was caught.

298
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,450
Li Shaotang must have known.

299
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
He's not gonna do nothing.

300
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,280
Let me remind you.

301
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,480
The situation is different now.

302
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,740
You'd better not target Li Shaotang publicly.

303
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,070
It won't do you any good.

304
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,870
If I don't target him,

305
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,930
it won't do me any good either.

306
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,280

307
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,540
Yes.

308
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,910
Yes.

309
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,540
Let me ask you something then.

310
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,160
In Guizhou,

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,420

313
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,680
Ye Xuanmin and Li Manqiu's whereabouts?

314
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,130
No, no.

316
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
She only asked

317
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,680
about other people in 810.

318
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,440
I just mentioned it casually.

319
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,070
Just mentioned it casually?

320
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,850
Why didn't you mention it to me casually then?

321
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,540
She was the only one who asked me.

322
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,910
Sir,

323
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,480
if you asked me,

324
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,720
I would answer you honestly too.

325
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,210
Don't get all slick with me.

326
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,890
Lu Ziming, let me tell you.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,590
Ye Xuanmin is

328

head of the Communist Party's underground organization in Shanghai,

329
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,720
Chen Ke.

330
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,190

332
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,520
or rescuing him all these years.

333
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,390
Sir.

334
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,750
I...

335
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,370
I really didn't know anything about this.

336
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,910
I didn't know.

337
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,670
I didn't know.

338
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,510
Also,

339
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,390

340
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,560

342
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,100
Don't slander me.

343
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,270
You can't slander a good person.

344
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,480

347
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,770
You've seen what she's capable of.

348
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,570
If you don't say anything today,

349
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,370
do you think she will let you go?

350
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,790
If you don't give me an answer today,

351
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,700
I'll answer for you.

352
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,990
Captain Zeng.

353
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,230
Officer Zeng.

354
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,690
I'm begging you.

355
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,580
I will cooperate

356
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,040
and do whatever you ask.

357
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,280

358
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,460

359
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,350

360

if she's a Communist Party member or not.

361
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,400
I...

362
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,990
Fine.

363
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
I'll ask you something you know.

364
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,290
Did Ou Xiao'an visit you at the hospital?

365
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,560
Yes.

366
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,740
He did visit me.

367
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,930
Did he not ask about

368
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,460
Ye Xuanmin's whereabouts?

369
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,560
He did.

370
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,790
But...

371
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,510
But I didn't say anything.

372
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,950
-I know nothing.
-Okay.

373
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,430
Let me ask you again.

374
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,950
In 810, did Ou Xiao'an

375
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,170
get very close to the communists?

376
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,520
That's impossible.

377

let me tell you.

381
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,310

382
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,770
wanted to kill him.

383
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,300
Kill him.

388
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,140
Listen.

389
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,590
There are only two options in front of you now.

390
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,470
Either you be the communist

391
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,250
or you

392
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,880

393
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,610

395
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,810
Why don't you take your time

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
while I take my men to eat something?

397
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,440
Think about it.

398
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,380
Okay.

399
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480

I'll think.

407
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,360

Why do you take out so many?

414
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,260
You want me to peel them myself?

415
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,070
I was so anxious that I forgot to peel them.

416
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll peel them for you now.

417

the reason they're making a big deal out of it

If my hypothesis is right,

567
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,110
this person can definitely prove that,

568
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,830
when Qin Moqing was studying in China,

569
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,430
she had

570
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,360
a special relationship with the Communist Party.

571
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,200
Did you tell anyone about this?

572
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,510
Absolutely not.

573
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,280
Since I came back from Guizhou,

574
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,940
I've been in contact with him.

575
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,280
But back then,

576
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,270
I didn’t know

577
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,200
what your stance on Qin Moqing was.

578
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,660
I didn't dare to report it.

579
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,800
Now that I know, I can ask him to come.

580
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,410
Ask him to come?

581
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,350
How?

582
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,470
Are you going to suggest the same tactic?

583
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,860
Get ourselves hurt

584
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,900
so he can come and testify against Qin Moqing?

585
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,050
No. Captain.

586
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,200
I promise not.

587
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,920
This person is greedy for money.

588
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,170
I'd like to request some budget from the station.

589
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,190
How much?

590
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,780
Give him five gold bars first.

591
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,530
Promise him that after testifying,

592
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,830
he'll get another five.

593
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,360
Ten gold bars?

594
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,770
Captain.

595
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,550
Every bustling scene in the world, every bustling...

596
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,680
Whatever that saying is.

597
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,810
I promise, Captain,

598
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,340
I’ll make him spit out

599
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,920
whatever he gets.

600
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,990
Ten gold bars.

601
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,720
It's not cheap.

602
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,280
Captain.

603
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
If we really find out

604
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,280
that something is wrong with Section Chief Qin,

605
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,120
we wouldn't need to

606
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,050
return the ten gold bars, would we?

607
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,080
Leave.

608
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,330
Director Shen.

609
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,190
I'm Wei Qingming.

610
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
I have something

611
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
to report to you.

612
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,620
Who is it?

613
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,600
Are you Mr. Yao?

614
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,450
Mr. Yao?

615
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,030
We don't have a Mr. Yao here.

616
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,340
Who are you?

617
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,190
Who let you in?

618
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,570
The phone kept ringing

619
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,920
so I came in to answer it.

620
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,980
He said he was looking for Mr. Yao.

621
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,929
He got the wrong number, right?

622
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,600
Wrong number?

623
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,540
Mr. Yao?

624
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,340
Wrong number.

625
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,730
Get lost.

626
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,260
Zheng Bangyao, right?

627
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,750
Captain Zeng, it's me.

628
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,290
You received the goldfish?

629
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,159
Yes.

630
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,429
I asked you to rush to Chongqing.

631
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,710
Where are you now?

632
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,530
I'm almost there.

633
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm at Bishan already.

634
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,400
How far is it from Chengdu to Chongqing?

635
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,990
It took you three days

636
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,640
just to get to Bishan?

637
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,740
Captain.

638
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,150
I drove here.

639
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,010
I've been delayed by some business

640
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,430
on the way.

641
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,670
I'm coming.

642
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,880
At this juncture,

643
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,830
you're still working on that nonsense.

644
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,780
Captain Zeng.

645
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,310
These are all good stuff.

646
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,560
When the Japanese surrendered,

647
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,320
the Japanese rushed to leave

648
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,120
and left lots of good stuff.

649
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,600
I got a bargain.

650
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,850
In the past two days,

651
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,890
I ran into some Chongqing officials

652
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,050
who were settling down.

653
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,970
I'm all out now.

654
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,230
Zheng Bangyao.

655
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,470
Is the money I give you not enough?

656
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,150
Looks like you forgot

657
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,470
what I asked you to do?

658
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,840
No, I didn't.

659
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,950
How could I forget about your stuff?

660
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,720
But

661
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,710
you asked me

662
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
to talk to those people from NBIS.

663
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,280
I’m really scared.

664
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,670
Captain Zeng.

665
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,830
The things you asked me to dump for the Japanese

666
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,520
are national treasures.

667
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,450
If someone finds out,

668
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,980
I'll be a traitor.

669
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,040
Whether you're a traitor or not,

670
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,870
I can settle that with just a word.

671
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,700
Yes.

672
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,550
Yes.

673
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,160
To be honest,

674
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,630
I have already dealt with

675
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,190
your goods.

676
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,320
How about I return the goldfish to you?

677
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Let me go.

678
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,230
I quit.

679
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll write a whistleblower letter, okay?

680
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,300
Zheng Bangyao, let me tell you.

681
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,230
If I hadn't saved you on Scott Road,

682
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,840
you would have died.

683
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,640
Do you think you can escape?

684
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,500
Yes.

685
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,900
Thank you, Captain.

686
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,350
Do you know

687
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,460
I dream about

688
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,740
Scott Road every day and night.

689
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,560
At 3pm tomorrow, meet me

690
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,750
at the mass grave

691
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,640
a mile outside the city east.

692
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,430
I'll pick you up myself.

693
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,030
If you're even a minute late,

694
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,000
you're dead.

695
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,400
Okay.

696
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,760
I'll be there on time.

697
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,360
What car are you driving?

698
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,880
Buick.

699
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,430
Grayish blue.

700
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,970
Any important clues?

701
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,220
Did anyone speak?

702
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,560
If you couldn't get it out of them,

703
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,950
how could I have done so?

704
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Why did you run here in such a hurry then?

705
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,280
You're messing with me.

706
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
No.

707
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,730
There are clues.

708
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,720
But I didn't get them from interrogation.

709
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,580
I’ve already told Captain Wei

710
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,340
that I have a key witness.

711
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,610
He will arrive in Chongqing tomorrow afternoon.

712
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,560
I want you and Captain Wei to meet him.

713
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,850
Were you so rude

714
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,500
in front of the Japanese too?

715
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,380
In the future, if anything comes up,

716
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,570
tell me first.

717
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
If I say you can tell Captain Wei,

718
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,190
then you can tell him.

719
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,450
Yes. Okay.

720
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,370
Captain.

721
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,820
For these ten gold bars,

722
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,790
I swore an oath to Director Shen.

723
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,290
Can you guarantee that your intel

724
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,070
is accurate?

725
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,010
Absolutely.

726
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,660
Captain, don’t worry.

727
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,160
But I heard

728
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,910
you suffered losses with Director Shen

729
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,730
because of the Mao Renxing issue.

730
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,800
Don't worry, this time

731
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,790
I can definitely help you win.

732
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,660
When will Zheng Bangyao arrive?

733
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,020
He's driving here.

734
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,330
At 3pm tomorrow,

735
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,640
a mile outside the city east,

736
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,230
at a mass grave.

737
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,600
I'll pick him up myself.

738
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,360
No need.

739
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,070
I'll arrange for someone to pick him up.

740
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,180
You stay out of it.

741
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,940
What car does he drive?

742
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,360
What car does he drive?

743
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,170
A grayish blue Buick.

744
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,440
But Captain,

745
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,900
you must believe me,

746
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm still loyal to you.

747
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,870
Many people are loyal to me.

748
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,470
Mao Renxing was one too.

749
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,560
And then?

750
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,770
Leave.

751
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,380
This dog

752
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,380
is useful, right?

753
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,250
That depends on whether Zheng Bangyao

754
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,960
can bite Qin Moqing.

755
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,240
Tomorrow,

756
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,690
come with me to pick up Zheng Bangyao.

757
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,700
As long as we can get solid evidence,

758
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,370
even if Wen Yishan comes forward,

759
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,770
he won't be able to protect his apprentice.

760
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,130
Let's see what else he can do then.

761
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,840
Wang, I'm Captain Liang.

762
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,320
Help me check

763
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,880
where the call that was received

764
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,750
on this phone an hour ago

765
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,860
was from.

766
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,370
I'm worried that the code was sent in haste

767
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,820
and you'll get into trouble.

768
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,570
[Closed]

769
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,300
What's going on, Qiushui?

770
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,160
Zheng Bangyao.

771
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,300
Do you remember

772
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,550
this name?

773
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,160
Zheng Bangyao?

774
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,520
It sounds familiar. What's wrong?

775
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,910
Our comrade from another line

776
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,370
gave us some information.

777
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,030
Zeng Jiwu is secretly sending him to Chongqing

778
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,790
to identify one of our comrades

779
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,130
to prove that

780
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,070
this comrade has been in touch

781
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,370
with the organization even in Shanghai.

782
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,730
I believe that

783
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,290
the person he wants to identify

784
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,220
is you.

785
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,930
That's impossible.

786
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,400
In Shanghai,

787
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,520
I hadn't joined the organization officially.

788
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,510
All my contact with the organization

789
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,680
went through you.

790
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,800
I just attended

791
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,660
some group discussions of the Student Federation.

792
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,470
What are you looking at?

793
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,310
Don't move.

794
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,280
Why do you think the Japanese

795
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,100
have been arresting people like crazy these days?

796
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,750
It's all because of that guy.

797
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,520
He was the one who told those agents on Scott Road that

798
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Mr. Ye is in Shanghai these few days.

799
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,940
He also said

800
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,620
that he met Mr. Ye in Shanghai.

801
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,460
You remember now?

802
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,210
Who is he?

803
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,880
Qiushui.

804
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,610
This person is the one who betrayed Secretary Chen.

805
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,790
You guys split up.

806
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,510
Follow this lane

807
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,010
and get out from the back.

808
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Be careful.

809
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,220
Thank you.

810
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,750
Go.

811
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,590
Go first.

812
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,670
Did you get hurt?

813
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,170
I'm fine.

814
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,210
Come with me.

815
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,140
We can't let him come to Chongqing.

816
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,310
We can't let him contact Wei Qingming either.

817
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,100
He's at Zhicheng Hotel in Bishan.

818
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
We don't know much about him.

819
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,870
If this is a trap

820
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,080
and we send our comrades there rashly,

821
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,830
I'm afraid it'll leave a trail.

822
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,040
I understand.

823
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm afraid

824
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,920
something like this needs to be done

825
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,120
by someone from NBIS.

826
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,550
Let me think.
