[Episode 26]

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,020
Sir,

5
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,460
now that Zeng Jiwu knows

6
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,770
so much about Ohashi,

7
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,050
could he know

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,180
about Li Shaotang's identity, too?

9
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,820
Even if he knows, he won't tell.

10
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,030
Why do you think he's here?

11
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,970
He came to Captain Wei to save his life.

12
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,020
He'll reveal all that he knows

13
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,770
little by little.

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,280
That jerk

15
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,220
just wants

16
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,699
to show his loyalty

17
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,810
to Wei Qingming.

18
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,850
But why is he transfered here

19
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,530
to be interrogated?

20
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,750
I guess they want to hide it

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,610
from Feng Yunian and Li Shaotang.

22
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,440
Sir, be careful.

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,810
All right, don't worry about me.

24
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,850
Does Zeng Jiwu know

25
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,980
your relationship with Lou Mingyuan?

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,740
I'm afraid he'll tell Captain Wei.

27
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,860
Don't worry.

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,940
I think he knows you.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,770
We met once years ago.

30
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,620
Shanghai is so big.

31
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,350
It's only normal to run into unpleasant people.

32
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,140
I see.

33
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,500

he'll go there as promised.

37
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,040
You'll decide who to go and how to do it.

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,020
It's all up to you.

39
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,470
I told them to go out just now

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,020
because I was afraid others would steal your credit.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Your pledge of loyalty

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,010
is quite important.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,740
If you have a secret position in Chongqing Station,

44
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,440
I'll secure my job, too.

45
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,940
Why me?

46
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,280
To be honest,

47
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,410
before I came to Chongqing,

48
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,410
I've conducted thorough research.

At NBIS and the Inspection Office,

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,579
you're No. 1.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,260
Captain Wei,

52
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,329

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,970
That is our strength.

56
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,290
Do you have more important information

57
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,530
to tell me?

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,670

of a communist underground organization in Shanghai.

Chen Ke.

Chen Ke?

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,620
Yes.

Captain Wei,

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,620
Ou Xiao'an must have something to do with that.

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,280
As long as you know it.

79
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,409
-Wei.
-Wen.

80
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,450
You want to see me?

81
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,940
These are Ohashi Kazuya's coordinates

Zeng Jiwu confessed.

83
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,380
OK.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,530
I'll send someone from the Operations Department over.

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,760
You can't do that.

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,230
Think about it.

87
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,310
Once the Operations Department makes a move,

88
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,200
Li Shaotang

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,410

90
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,010

for this operation.

92
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,350
All of them are peripheral?

93
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,950
Yes.

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
I don't think it's appropriate.

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,760
How about this? I'll go there myself.

96
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,320
Ask Moqing and Xiao'an to go with me.

97
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,140
If Li Shaotang and the others ask about it,

98
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,090
just tell them

99
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,480
we went to search for the whereabouts of the gas bombs.

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,410
Wen, you're so thoughtful.

101
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,630
That's why I invited you here.

102
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,070
But…

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,770
you can just take Qin Moqing there.

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,290
Leave Ou Xiao'an to me.

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,050
I need someone for the case of the gas bombs.

107
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,000
are you...

Don't think too much.

I kept Ou Xiao'an

110
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,480
because he's familiar with gas bombs.

111
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,260
Understand?

112
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,570
OK.

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll do as you say.

114
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,900
Please. Please.

00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,100
You're welcome.

It's all for the work in the station.

Yes, it's all for the Kuomintang.

118
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,980
I heard that their clothes are quite nice.

119
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,590
Is it silk?

120
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,300
Yes.

121
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,080
Take a look.

122
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,470

124
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,390
OK. This one. This color is a bit…

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,530
How much is it?

131
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,690
That one is 216 yuan.

132
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,750
How about this one?

133
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,100
Same price.

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,020

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,360
OK, wait a moment.

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
I'm sorry.

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,030
Sorry.

139
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,060

of the plane to pick up Ohashi in three days.

143
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,350
He should be hiding nearby.

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,690
Is the news of Zeng Jiwu

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,670
reliable?

146
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,010
If he doesn't have any accurate information,

147
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,380
he wouldn't dare to submit to Wei Qingming.

148
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,370
I've dealt with him once before

149
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,500
in Shanghai.

150
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,650
He's been working under Ohashi.

151
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,570
All these years,

152
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,890
he was in the core division of
the Japanese Expeditionary Forces Headquarters.

153
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,930
I don't think his information is wrong.

154
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,390
You dealt with him when you were in Shanghai?

155
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
Do you remember that time

156
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,030
when our party needed a passage permit urgently?

157
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,230
When Li made the report, he said

158
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,850
a spy had been watching you all the time.

159
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,140
It was him.

160
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,880
Will he recognize you?

161
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,780
He didn't notice anything at that time.

162
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,940
He only knew that I'm Qin Jiru's sister.

163
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,740
Besides, a selfish person like him

164
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,220
will only do things

165
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,700
good for himself in this kind of situation.

166
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,760
He won't bring up his past experience

167
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,380
as a traitor.

168
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,140
This kind of person has no bottom line.

169
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,800
You should be careful anyway.

170
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,750
Understood.

171
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,100
Our priority now

172
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,740
is to save our comrades ASAP

173
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,940
before the NBIS.

174
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,690
Wei Qingming wants to

175
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,260
achieved a great feat before Dai Li with this.

176
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,540
It's such important information,

177
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
yet he didn't even inform

178
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,860
the National Revolutionary Army in Guizhou.

179
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,720
So, I think we still have a chance.

180
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,770
Do you know

181
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,110
Wei Qingming's detailed deployment plan?

182
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,860
He made the decision about the participants

183
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,120
and the plans himself.

184
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,380
I only know that the people and the motorcade of the NBIS

185
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,040
will leave tomorrow morning.

186
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,570
Then, our men

187
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,850
must hurry.

188
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,420
Understood.

189
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,660

377
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,349
Who on earth

378
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,119
is this spy?

379
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,230
This time,

380
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,800
his Japanese master has left.

381
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,420
He should give himself away.

382
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,900
What do you think, Miao?

383
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,100
Miao?

384
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,180
In my view,

385
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,130
it should be soon.

386
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,410
I think so, too.

387
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
Soon.

388
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,020
We won.

389
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,650
Yes, we won.

390
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,790
Why are you alone?

391
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,410
They all went out to celebrate.

392
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,560
Why didn't you go?

393
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm saving my celebration wine

394
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,340
to drink with my comrades.

395
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,280
Me?

396
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,420
Do you know anyone else?

397
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,020
You have to wait until

398
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,010
after my operation this time.

399
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,330
Then, I'll just wait. No hurry.

400
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,540
Your goal this time

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,210
is not only Ohashi Kazuya, right?

402
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,090
The prisoners of 810 are included, too.

403
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,960
What do you mean?

404
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,260
Let me remind you.

405
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,780
Our teacher has always been sharp-sighted,

406
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,210
but his eyes are

407
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,160
not only staring at the Japanese.

408
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,020
Don't worry about me.

409
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,610
We've won the war.

410
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,260
I will bring back

411
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,410
whoever needs to be captured or saved.

412
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,970
But, then again,

413
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,750
the Elk is still threatening

414
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,180
the safety of Chongqing.

415
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,580
That's what we should worry about.

416
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,860
I'll keep an eye on Miao Jiang.

417
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,770
She's just like Li Shaotang now.

418
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,860
We can't find evidence about them.

419
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,700
So what there's no evidence?

420
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,570
Wei Qingming trusted her so much before.

421
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,820
But now,

422
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,120
he didn't inform her about the operation.

423
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,150
It means Wei Qingming is also suspicious of her.

424
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,700
Sir.

425
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,570
We finally won.

426
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,010
Finally.

427
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,210
Moqing,

428
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,680
come with me.

429
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Where?

430
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,320
Guizhou.

431
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,930
The latest news from the Central News Agency:

432
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,460
our country is going to celebrate the victory

433
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,470
after Japan signs the surrender document.

434
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,510
The celebration is scheduled to last for three days.

435
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,630
Every organisation will have a day off.

436
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,380
The central government has made every decision.

437
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,030
And it will be carried out after all provinces and cities get the news.

438
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,360
After hearing the news of Japan's surrender,

439
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,560
the streets of Chongqing are full of people celebrating.

440
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,940
Excuse me.

441
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,210
What's going on?

442
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,810
Officer,

443
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,500
I just received a secret telegram from Shanghai.

444
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,540
The Emperor has indeed made an announcement to end the war.

445
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,050
People from Shanghai have arranged a flight for us.

446
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,020
We can leave tomorrow.

447
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,160
Inform Chongqing

448
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,790
to take action.

449
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,860
Yes.

450
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,130
Get ready.

451
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,540
Set off as soon as the plane arrives.

452
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,220
Yes.

453
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,350
What about these people?

454
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,020
You wait for my order

455
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,440
with the main force here.

456
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,070
Get Mitsui and the files on the plane first.

457
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,580
Get rid of what can't be taken away.

458
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,180
Transfer the rest to the cellar.

459
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,650
I'll arrange a car to pick you up.

460
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,400
Yes.

461
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,590
Why are you here again?

462
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,730
You are in such a hurry to leave Chongqing.

463
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,700
You haven't said goodbye.

464
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,140
Qin Moqing has started to suspect me.

465
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,540
She just doesn't have any evidence yet.

466
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,500
That's easy.

467
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,120
We can help you get rid of Qin Moqing.

468
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,950
Get rid of her?

469
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,280
How?

470
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,050
Can you get rid of everyone in the Chongqing Station?

471
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,240
The war is over now.

472
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,410
I can't help you even if I stay in Chongqing.

473
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,070
The holy war of Empire of Japan is not over yet.

474
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,580
Haven't you heard?

475
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,580
His Imperial Majesty has surrendered.

476
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,910
His Imperial Majesty won't surrender!

477
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,140
Tanaka Koji,

478
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,660
wake up.

479
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,650
Now, you are

480
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,050
a loser.

481
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,010
I'm a loser.

482
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,460
What about you?

483
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,650
You poisoned Ando Motoyoshi

484
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,250
and stole Wei Qingming's approval letter.

485
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,180
You betrayed special agents and framed Mao Renxing.

486
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,240
If Wei Qingming

487
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,860
finds out about these things,

488
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,180
you think you can live?

489
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,460
Besides,

490
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,460
if you run away now,

491
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,340
I can shoot you immediately.

492
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,080
Be good

493
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,620
and cooperate with us.

494
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
One day,

495
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,460
you'll be of no use.

496
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,130
-Miao Jiang!
-So?

497
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,770
I should just wait for you to kill me?

498
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,290
C-Calm down.

499
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,240
Miao Jiang.

500
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,090
Listen.

501
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,810
Even if I'll die,

502
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,650
I'll kill you first.

503
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,970
Miao Jiang!

504
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,680
Secretary Chen.

505
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,200
Secretary Chen.

506
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,880
Hurry up.

507
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,830
Hurry up!

508
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,580
Take these two weak men out

509
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,500
and throw them into the river.

510
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,620
Yes.

511
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,470
Secretary Chen.

512
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,080
S-Secretary Chen!

513
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,610
Secretary Chen!

514
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,860
Secretary Chen!

515
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,670
Secretary Chen!

516
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,760
Secretary Chen!

517
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,170
Manqiu.

518
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,630
Is that you?

519
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Secretary Chen.

520
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,250
Secretary Chen.

521
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,380
You're awake.

522
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,180
I'm dying.

523
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,190
Leave me here.

524
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,250
Go now.

525
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,580
F-Find our members.

526
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,060
Reveal the Japanese people's sins

527
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
to the world.

528
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,820
Secretary Chen!

529
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,320
Secretary Chen.

530
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,520
Don't worry.

531
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,870
I'll save you and take you back.

532
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,110
Captain,

533
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,100
we found traces of the Japanese people's trucks ahead.

534
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,940
They're new. They went southeast.

535
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,730
How many trucks?

536
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,500
Two.

537
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,260
Looks like there are not many of them.

538
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,690
I think we can take care of them.

539
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,400
Yan,

540
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,100
let's split up.

541
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,210
Okay. Move now.

542
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,670
Thank you.

543
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,720
What's the situation now?

544
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,260
You guys guard here, understand?

545
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,110
Yes.

546
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,420
You stay here.

547
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,140
Okay.

548
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,140
Save them!

549
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,860
Gonglai.

550
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,190
You finally came.

551
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,460
Are you okay?

552
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,370
Where is Chen Ke?

553
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,330
Secretary Chen hasn't been feeling well

554
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,610
and has been having a high fever.

555
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,150
Manqiu also got sick later.

556
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,640
The Japanese saw they were dying,

557
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,700
so they asked someone to take them away.

558
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Looks like we are still late.

559
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,260
Right,

560
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,580
Ohashi... Ohashi has run away.

561
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,470
He's at the nearby airport.

562
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,050
Ohashi!

563
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,300
Who is he?

564
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,900
He's a member of CNP.

565
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,530
Sir!

566
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,210
Please save me.

567
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,000
If you save me, I'll leave CNP

568
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,740
and join the Communist Party.

569
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,470
I'll join the Communist Party.

570
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,740
We came back together.

571
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,420
We are all brothers who have faced life and death together,

572
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,370
you can't just watch and do nothing.

573
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,240
Sir.

574
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,420
Sir, I beg you.

575
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,370
Please save me.

576
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,290
Please save me.

577
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,170
Get up.

578
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,880
Listen carefully,

579
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,210
I don't care if you're from the Chinese Nationalist Party or the Communist Party,

580
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,650
we are all Chinese,

581
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,940
and we must not fall into the hands of the Japanese.

582
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,969
Stay close.

583
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,350
Captain,

584
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,969
the Japanese are back again.

585
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,760
Captain Wu, what should we do now?

586
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,290
Retreat quickly.

587
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,420
Run!

588
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,210
Go!

589
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,889
Get up. Hurry.

590
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,409
Yan,

591
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,880
you take the wounded and retreat first.

592
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,739
What about you?

593
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,810
I'll cover you,

594
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,130
otherwise no one will be able to leave.

595
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,230
Mr. Cang.

596
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,570
Thank you.

597
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:03,900
What's wrong?

598
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,620
Major, there are enemies over there!

599
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,530
Go!

600
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,740
It's too late. Take care of the wounded.

601
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,260
Wu.

602
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,170
Gun.

603
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,540
You just barely escaped death,

604
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,820
do you want to die again?

605
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,670
Run!

606
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,960
Didn't I tell you to retreat first?

607
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,460
I also want to kill Ohashi

608
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,690
and avenge our fallen compatriots.

609
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,950
Well done!

610
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,190
Fire!

611
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,300
Wu, what's wrong?

612
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,450
Where is he?

613
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,670
Oh no! It's the Japanese's gas bombs.

614
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,840
Retreat!

615
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,920
Hurry up! Go!

616
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,660
Retreat!

617
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,330
Hurry up!

618
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,230
This way.

619
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,570
Don't go over there.

620
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,850
This way.

621
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,390
There is also gas over here.

622
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,520
Everyone, cover your mouth and nose tightly,

623
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,980
and get down on the ground.

624
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,970
Lu Ziming.

625
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,230
I'm late.

626
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,180
Everyone, put on your gas mask quickly.

627
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,540
-Gas masks.
-Hurry up!

628
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,900
-Give me one.
-Hurry up!

629
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,230
Give me one.

630
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,810
Alert!

631
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,160
Chief Ohashi.

632
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,190
What's going on?

633
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,140
There are trees blocking the road.

634
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,100
We can't pass.

635
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,480
Getting someone to clean it up immediately.

636
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,070
Yes.

637
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,450
Group one, clear the roadblocks.

638
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
Group two, stay on alert.

639
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,040
Sir, slow down.

640
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,960
The airport is right ahead.

641
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,260
The road is destroyed,

642
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,220
Ohashi will definitely stop the vehicle here

643
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,680
and have people unload the goods

644
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,340
to send them over.

645
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,120
Got it. I'll arrange an ambush.

646
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,480
We still need to wait for someone.

647
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,460
Who?

648
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,750
He should be here soon.

649
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,150
Zeng Jiwu?

650
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,500
Have Zeng Jiwu follow the original plan to meet Ohashi,

651
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,460
and then get him on the plane.

652
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,190
This way, Ohashi won't be suspicious,

653
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,850
and we'll have a chance to act.

654
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,800
Got it.

655
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,840
Vice Captain Wen, Section Chief Qin.

656
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,450
Wei has told you what to do, right?

657
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,340
Don't worry.

658
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,580
I've been with Ohashi for so many years,

659
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,840
he definitely won't be suspicious of me.

660
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
Section Chief Qin,

661
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,320
I actually recognized you the last time

662
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,530
we met at the Huajiang Villa,

663
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,180
but I was too embarrassed to say anything.

664
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,670
I apologize for any offenses I may have caused before.

665
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,470
Please forgive me.

666
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,340
It's nothing.

667
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,380
Don't mention it.

668
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm now wholeheartedly serving the Kuomintang.

669
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,760
Enough.

670
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,950
Saving those words for after we capture Ohashi

671
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,360
and expressing loyalty upon returning to Chongqing.

672
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,800
Okay.

673
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,620
Communicator.

674
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,130
Yes.

675
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,570
Send a telegram to Captain Wei,

676
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,650
and tell him everything is proceeding according to the original plan.

677
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,130
Yes.

678
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,500
Driver, drive the car away.

679
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,210
The rest of you, follow me to the mountain to ambush.

680
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,180
Yes.

681
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,220
Come in.

682
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,370
Secretary Miao,

683
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,760
this telegram is sent to Captain Wei from Guizhou.

685
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,000
Wait.

686
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,380
Guizhou?

687
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,100
Don't you know?

688
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,590
I heard that Ohashi Kazuya

689
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,790
is hidden in Guizhou.

690
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:32,770
See you.

691
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,100
Okay. Got it.

692
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,760
Secretary Miao.

693
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,160
Captain, this is a confidential report from Guizhou.

694
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,950
Take a look.

696

[Guizhou Operation Report]

697
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,880
The brigade has arrived in Guizhou,

00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,440
deployed according to plan,

699
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,190
and has reached the airport route.
