00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,980
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

194
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,040
Congratulations.

195
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,300
Congratulations.

196
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,630
Feng,

197
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,330
congratulations。

198
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,990
You have such a good son-in-law, Shaotang,

199
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,200
and you've made connections with Director Shen.

200
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,220
From now on,

201
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,780
you can rest easy.

202
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,490
Look. Now,

203
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,310
Wen has two good students,

204
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,920
while you have a good son-in-law.

205
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,800
Only me,

206
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,680
fighting alone here.

207
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,230
With a toast to you today,

208
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,670
I'll tell you the truth.

209
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,750
Aren't all these fights

210
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,880
for my position as the captain, right?

211
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,260
From now on,

212
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,230
whether you play fair and square or dirty, come at me.

213
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,290
I'll take them all.

214
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,490
Wei,

215
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,790
is that really necessary?

216
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,390
You're not kind.

217
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,390
It's Feng's daughter's wedding day.

218
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,990
Why are you bringing this up?

219
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,060
I was being honest.

220
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,260
Wen, if you say so,

221
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,940
I have to ask you.

222
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,030
It's understandable that Ou Xiao'an isn't here today.

223
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,290
What about Qin Moqing?

224
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Tell me the truth.

225
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,150
Did you secretly send them out on a mission

226
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,140
behind my back?

227
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,550
You have never respected me

228
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,940
as the captain.

229
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,340
Enough, Wei. Stop whining.

230
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,690
I'll say something honest to you.

231
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,860
I did

232
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,100
want your position.

233
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,420
See? See?

234
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,870
The captain of the station.

235
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,250
Who would not want to be the captain, right, Wen?

236
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,090
Feng,

237
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,270
I've never thought about it.

238
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,400
You've been thinking about it a lot.

239
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,790
He came down from the captain.

240
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,300
Now I see it.

241
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,530
What's the point of fighting?

242
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,510
At our age,

243
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,820
we don't have much time left.

244
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,920
After the wedding,

245
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,540
I will go to Mr. Dai.

246
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,190
I resign. I retire.

247
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,470
It's also good to stay at home

248
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,860
and teach students.

249
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,020
You can just be the captain with ease.

250
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,140
Wei,

251
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,340
Feng is making way for his son-in-law.

252
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,790
I see.

253
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,020
Feng, how about this?

254
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,500
How about I let Shaotang

255
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,190
take over my position?

256
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,550
You two.

257
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,610
Drink your wine.

258
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,940
Come on, let's drink.

259
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,510
Cheers!

260
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,570
Congratulations, Section Chief Li.

261
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,780
Thank you.

262
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,630
Shaotang.

263
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,240
Dad.

264
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,210
Meet me in the dressing room later.

265
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,630
This is the place.

266
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,110
Tell everyone

267
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,790
not to make noise. We are going to sneak in.

268
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,310
The objective of the mission is

269
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,970
to free the people trapped in the school.

270
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,000
Do it fast.

271
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,820
Understood.

272
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,230
Send a few men to find some good ambush positions.

273
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,870
Okay.

274
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,460
Let's go.

275
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,680
There's a sniper.

276
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,080
How about this?

277
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,000
You take your men to go around the side.

278
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,830
I'll take care of the sniper.

279
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,900
Otherwise,

280
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,050
none of us can get in.

281
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,750
Okay.

282
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,920
Go.

283
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,870
This way.

284
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,590
Captain Zeng,

285
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,780
Someone broke in!

286
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,340
Get them together.

287
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,500
Go.

288
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,420
Now!

289
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,180
Yes!

290
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:57,710
Come on.

291
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,660
Mr. Randal, let me introduce

292
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,140
our colleagues at Chongqing Station to you.

293
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,730
Captain Wei, Vice Captain Wen.

294
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,270
-Director Shen.
-Let me introduce.

295
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,950
This is Judge Randal.

296
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,420
Like Lieutenant Colonel Mellors

297
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,560
from the SACO,

298
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,480
he's also a guest of honor for our Generalissimo.

299
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm Wei Qingming.

300
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,930
I'm Wen Yishan.

301
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,560
The International Court of Justice has assigned me

302
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,540
to try those Japanese war criminals.

303
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,210
Your execution of Ohashi without permission

304
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,900
has caused me a lot of trouble.

305
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,740
Director Shen.

306
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,490
Alright, Mr. Randal.

307
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
In the past, we each served our own purposes.

308
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,140
Now we are working together sincerely, right?

309
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,420
We're at a wedding.

310
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,660
Let's not talk about this, okay?

311
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,510
Chi.

312
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,280
This is my wife, Chie.

313
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,710
Judge Randal's wife is...

314
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,810
Japanese?

315
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,180
Mr. Wen is asking if you're Japanese.

316
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,350
I'm an American.

317
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,900
I am... what?

318
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,620
She is

319
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,990
Japanese-American.

320
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,760
Still a Japanese.

321
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,000
May I, Chie?

322
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,790
Sure.

323
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,700
Do you like it?

324
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,710
Yes.

325
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,700
How are you? Are you tired?

326
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,180
I'm fine. I'm not tired at all.

327
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,510
Why don't we take a rest?

328
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
Groom,

329
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,290
can we borrow your bride?

330
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,730
Yes, just for a moment.

331
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,620
Okay.

332
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,390
Okay.

333
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,100
Let's go.

334
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,490
-Let’s go.
-Jingxian.

335
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,660
Be careful.

336
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,990
She will be fine.

337
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,970
Go.

338
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,020
Let's go.

339
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,270
Nice identity.

340
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,560
No wonder

341
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,000
you can still live at ease

342
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,910
under the Generalissimo's nose.

343
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,720
It doesn't matter what a person's identity is.

344
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,750
What matters

345
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,530
is his stance.

346
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,450
Then whose side are you on?

347
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,470
Japan?

348
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,690
America?

349
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,720
Why do you look so pale?

350
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,030
Are you poisoned?

351
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,240
I need the antidote.

352
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,090
I've given it to you.

353
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,140
Do you remember what I said?

354
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,160
That lipstick

355
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,780
suits you well.

356
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,790
You know what?

357
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,030
That batch of gas bombs

358
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,140
is loaded with incapacitating agents.

359
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,720
Even a small amount of inhalation

360
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,380
can cause you to lose consciousness and control of your behavior.

361
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
If you drag it out without antidote,

362
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,910
you'll die.

363
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,980
You can have it.

364
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,460
Go!

365
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,290
[Chongqing Linjiang Primary School]

366
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,880
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

367
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,130
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

368
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,929
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

369
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,300
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

370
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,650
Zeng Jiwu!

371
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,929
Put down your gun!

372
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,830
Liang!

373
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,540
So, it's you who betrayed me!

374
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,860
You're surrounded. Surrender!

375
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,500
You?

376
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,770
Shoot me if you have the guts!

377
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,310
Everyone, hold your fire!

378
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,139
Ou Xiao'an!

379
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,920
I know

380
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,400
you must be here!

381
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,250
I also know

382
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,920
that you and Qin Moqing are communists!

383
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,540
It doesn't matter.

384
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,180
You let me leave Chongqing safely!

385
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:10,920
You know

386
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,130
I worked for Ohashi

387
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,030
to survive!

388
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,760
I came to Chongqing Station

389
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,970
to survive too!

390
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,980
But there's one thing I don't get!

391
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,740
I just can’t live

392
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,410
with you and Qin Moqing around!

393
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,070
Stand straight!

394
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
All of you, stand straight!

395
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,570
Ou Xiao'an!

396
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,210
I'll give you ten seconds.

397
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,190
If you don't come out,

398
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,130
I'll kill another hostage!

399
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,300
You won't come out, right?

400
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,950
Ou Xiao'an!

401
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,080
This is what you want to see, right?

402
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,600
Fine!

403
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,060
I'll give you five more seconds!

404
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,920
If you don't come out, I'll kill all the hostages.

405
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,860
Five!

406
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,580
Four!

407
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,750
Three!

408
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,910
Two!

409
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,870
One!

410
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,670
Don't shoot!

411
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,720
Dad, you want to see me?

412
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,310
Close the door.

413
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,760
Okay.

414
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,600
What’s the matter?

415
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,600
Who is Li Dachun?

416
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,160
He is your brother, right?

417
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,560
Do you have another name,

418
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,060
Asano Aohiko?

419
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,600
Dad, what are you talking about?

420
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,480
You are working for the Japanese!

421
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,620
What do you mean? I don't understand.

422
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,260
What is the Termite Project?

423
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,230
What exactly do you want?

424
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,460
You get rid of anyone who stands in your way,

425
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,570
and those who suspect you,

426
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,270
one by one.

427
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,140
You want to be the head here!

428
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,490
Do you want the entire Chongqing Station

429
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,300
to serve your Japanese?

430
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,550
Dad,

431
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,740
I studied in Japan.

432
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,000
But I promise

433
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,710
I'm devoted to the Party,

434
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,860
and our station.

435
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,580
I'm not a fool!

436
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,900
Who is this?

437
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,720
See for yourself!

438
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,620
I've suspected you

439
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,070
and also tested you.

440
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,930
But for my daughter,

441
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,940
your marriage,

442
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,260
and her happiness,

443
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,580
I chose to trust you.

444
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,790
I've always protected you.

445
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,340
I was so blind.

446
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,820
I should have killed you a long time ago!

447
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,300
Tell me.

448
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,470
What's your relationship with Ohashi?

449
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,230
Now that he is dead,

450
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,030
he couldn't contradict you, right?

451
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,910
I don't care who you worked for,

452
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,170
or which country you are from.

453
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,710
From now on,

454
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,300
I want you to

455
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,740
cut all ties with Japan!

456
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,960
Now that you're married,

457
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,950
you have to take responsibility.

458
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,660
Be responsible for Jingxian

459
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,980
and the baby in her belly!

460
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,380
If I find out

461
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,470
that you colluded with the Japanese

462
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,330
to harm the interests of the Party, the NBIS,

463
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,090
and me,

464
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,020
I'll kill you...

465
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,800
[Dressing Room]

466
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,670
So, it's you.
