00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm fine.

379
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,110
Are you sure?

380
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,990
Stop.

381
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,180
[Power]

382
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,600
Ou Xiao'an.

383
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,620
You haven't recovered yet.

384
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,060
Do you want to wait a little longer?

385
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,960
It's okay.

386
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,830
I can handle it.

387
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,880
This is too much for your body.

388
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,010
If there's even a slight chance that I can recover my memory,

389
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,670
I'm willing to try.

390
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,520
I want to know

391
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,180
what I did the past four years.

392
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,660
Think carefully.

393
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,210
What should we do

394
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,470
if the situation worsens?

395
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,040
It won't be worse than now.

396
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,910
You can't understand the feeling of amnesia.

397
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
I don't know who I am.

398
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,250
I don't know what I've done.

399
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,750
I don't know

400
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,570
who's the enemy

401
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,270
and who my friends are.

402
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,130
You don't understand.

403
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,820
Dr. Rus, let's continue.

404
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,030
Be ready.

405
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,170
Don't sit down.

406
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Are you sure no one is following you?

407
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,350
How is the lie detector test result?

408
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,220
NBIS hasn't announced it yet.

409
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,280
So he passed?

410
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,390
But I clearly remember

411
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,430
when they asked about Mingyuan

412
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,880
cultivating me,

413
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,500
my heart was fluctuating.

414
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,950
The lie detector should have recorded it.

415
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,070
No one reviewed these questions with you?

416
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,760
No.

417
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,670
But I think they are investigating me

418
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,080
in another way.

419
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,560
They installed a bug in my house.

420
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,860
Who?

421
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,010
If I'm not mistaken,

422
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,800
it should be Feng Yunian.

423
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,530
NBIS is still investigating you?

424
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,590
I’m not sure if NBIS is investigating me

425
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,960
or if he wants to investigate me.

426
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,090
Why would he do that?

427
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,190
It must be NBIS.

428
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,250
He wants to let his daughter marry me.

429
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
Do you like his daughter?

430
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,560
We should focus on the organization.

431
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,580
Your father-in-law personally investigated you.

432
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,510
You didn't say anything, did you?

433
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,720
No way.

434
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,040
We have to find a way to get them out of here.

435
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,600
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble too.

436
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,520
How?

437
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,590
I can't tell them to remove it.

438
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,140
There are many ways to counter wiretapping.

439
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll teach you some when I'm free.

440
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,900
Vice Captain Feng.

441
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,470
I found out about the call.

442
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,160
It was from a newspaper kiosk

443
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,640
on Xintai Road.

444
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,680
Okay.

445
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,810
I see.

446
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,580
Jingxian.

447
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,980
Jingxian.

448
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,510
Dad.

449
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,180
Are you looking for me?

450
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,510
This Friday,

451
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,320
are you meeting Shaotang?

452
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,500
I was going to watch a movie,

453
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,230
but there're no tickets left, so we're not going.

454
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,360
Okay, then on Friday night

455
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,670
ask Shaotang to come for dinner.

456
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
Okay, I'll tell him.

457
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,880
Dad, where are you going?

458
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm going back to the station.

459
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,340
Could you show me around?

460
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,750
I can go look for Shaotang.

461
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,950
It's not convenient.

462
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,350
Isn't it on the way?

463
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,820
Call another taxi.

464
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,810
Ask Mrs. Wu to call one for you.

465
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,960
This

466
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,020
is our code.

467
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,910
9548.

468
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,870
I'm going to sort out the documents.

469
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,420
It's over for today.

470
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,240
You can go now.

471
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,360
Where is it?

472
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,710
What?

473
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,330
In Myanmar.

474
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,550
Where's the cloth you took from me?

475
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,050
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

476
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,400
Don't play dumb.

477
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,580
Did electric therapy

478
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,390
make you hallucinate?

479
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,850
Why didn't you report it?

480
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,500
You took the cloth.

481
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,170
I believe you also think

482
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,680
it’s an important clue to 810.

483
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
Why didn’t you report

484
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,160
such a big thing?

485
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,160
You suspect me?

486
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
I don't want to.

487
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,910
But you have to tell me

488
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,920
who you gave the 9548 cloth to.

489
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,990
How about this?

490
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,900
Let's make a deal.

491
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,520
Tell me where the banner is

492
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,360
and I'll tell you

493
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,830
about the lie detector test results of Li Shaotang.

494
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,770
Tell me.

495
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,440
During the lie detector test,

496
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,790
among the 33 questions

497
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,360
about the Japanese spy,

498
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:37,950
[Seal of the Military Commission of the Chinese Nationalist Government]

499
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,390
Your name is Li Shaotang.

500
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,250
[Name: Li Shaotang. Gender: Male]

501
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,190
Yes.

502
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,470
he was calm.

503
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,790
But for the 26 questions

504
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,230
on the Communist Party,

505
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,690
[Lie detector test]

506
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,230
Are you part of the Communist Party?

507
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,140
[Communist Party]

508
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,110
I told you.

509
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,430
I have never joined the Communist Party.

510
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,750
His heart rate was abnormal for 8 times.

511
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,410
[Heartbeat fluctuations]

512
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,360
I told you I'm not a Communist.

513
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,820
[Marked change in heart and respiratory rate]

514
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,400
[Heartbeat graph]

515
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,910
How many times do I have to tell you?

516
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,320
I suggest conducting multiple lie dectector tests

517
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,580
on the Communist Party

518
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,880
[Lie detector test failed]

519
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,710
and refer to other information

520
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,480
at the same time.

521
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,750
Didn't you forget everything?

522
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,400
That's all I remember.

523
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,850
You mean

524
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,410
Li Shaotang is not a Japanese spy,

525
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,240
but a Communist Party member.

526
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,570
A person who is suspected of colluding with the Communist Party

527
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,060
was not arrested,

528
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,700
and his lie detector test results

529
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,090
are kept confidential.

530
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,760
What do you think the higher-ups are doing?

531
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,950
Is that cloth evidence that

532
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,820
that Li Shaotong is a Japanese spy?

533
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,460
I think it's very likely.

534
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,110
That cloth belongs to my prison friend.

535
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,350
We escaped from 810 together.

536
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,430
Is he still alive?

537
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,580
The Japanese chased us closely.

538
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,430
We hid.

539
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,510
And...

540
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,990
Who is this person? What's his name?

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,950
I don't know.

542
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,710
What about his face?

543
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,830
I don't know.

544
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,190
That's all I remember.

545
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,560
But I'm sure

546
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,480
that person really exists.

547
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
It seems Dr. Rus's treatment

548
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,630
is effective for you.

549
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,980
I gave the cloth

550
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,240
to a trusted informant to investigate.

551
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,150
Just like you,

552
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,360
I don't believe the people in the station.

553
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
I'll tell you if there're any clues.

554
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,450
Vice Captain Feng.

555
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,930
Did you catch him?

556
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,340
What are you talking about?

557
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,220
It's just an ordinary telephone booth.

558
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,470
There are no clues.

559
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,670
Has Li Shaotang come back?

560
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,710
He's back

561
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,110
but he's been listening to records the whole day.

562
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,790
The monitoring results for today

563
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,520
aren't good.

564
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,380
Listening to records?

565
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,900
♫During dark nights♫

566
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,560
♫He gave me the sun♫

567
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:24,100
♫I can't let anyone take away my youth♫

568
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:34,270
♫I can't let anyone dim the light in my heart♫

569
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,210
♫The one in my heart♫

570
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,590
♫Don't be sad♫

571
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,840
♫I hope you♫

572
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,180
♫Can smile like that forever♫

573
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
Liu.

574
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,320
Remove it.

575
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,690
Remove it?

576
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,480
Withdraw the wiretapping device.

577
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,510
Brat.

578
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,240
You're too good at anti-wiretapping.

579
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,890
You still don't understand? We've been exposed.

580
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,080
♫I can't♫

581
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,600
Chief.

582
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,260
He has been sleeping for days.

583
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,150
Why hasn't he woken up?

584
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,240
I don't know.

585
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,840
Chief.

586
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,150
Look.

587
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,020
He's awake.

588
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,660
Don't be afraid.

589
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,230
Don't be afraid.

590
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,590
Don't be afraid.

591
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,540
Young man, don't be afraid.

592
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,030
I'm the village chief.

593
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,000
You're at Ajin house. His name is Ajin.

594
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,410
Yes, this is my house.

595
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,660
I'll get him some water.

596
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,600
Okay.

597
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,860
Don't be nervous.

598
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,480
Have some water.

599
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,750
Water.

600
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,600
Drink it.

601
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,800
He must be thirsty.

602
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,420
Is he mute?

603
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,390
So he's a mute.

604
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,800
Why is he here?

605
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,699
Are you Japanese?

606
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,750
No.

607
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,780
He's Chinese.

608
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,360
Chinese?

609
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,170
What are you doing here?

610
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,469
Or you're looking for someone?

611
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,040
Looking for someone?

612
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,600
What is he signing?

613
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,940
High mountains.

614
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,830
I walked a lot.

615
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,010
What are you looking for?

616
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
The box.

617
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,340
What box?

618
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,610
Gun.

619
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,550
Ajin.

620
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,290
I think I understand now.

621
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,450
Are you looking for the Chinese army?

622
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,920
Chinese army?

623
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,030
Yes, I think so.

624
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,720
Oh, I remember.

625
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,720
I heard that

626
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,200
there is a Chinese army.

627
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,590
They're not far away.

628
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,870
Don't move.

629
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,960
Don't move.

630
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,150
Calm down.

631
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,590
Yes, calm down.

632
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,750
I'll find them for you later, okay?

633
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,270
It's okay.

634
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,200
Ajin.

635
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,280
Get your mom to make some food for him.

636
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,230
Okay.

637
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,510
Have a good rest.

638
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,230
We'll help you find them, okay?

639
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,690
Have a good rest.

640
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,460
I'll get him some food.

641
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,770
Don't be nervous.

642
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,170
Rest well.

643
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,870
Rest well.

644
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,360
Rest well.

645
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,460
Come in.

646
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
Shaotang.

647
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,790
Dad.

648
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,830
You didn't sleep well?

649
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,210
I'm a little tired.

650
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
In the future,

651
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,390
call me by my title.

652
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,270
Yes, sir.

653
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,240
Have a seat.

654
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
What's up?

655
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,720
I bought you some supplements

656
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
to help you sleep.

657
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,940
Why are you so polite?

658
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,050
Jingxian really likes the furniture you bought.

659
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
As an elder,

660
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,440
you do everything with such detail.

661
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,520
As the younger generation,

662
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,050
I have to show my sincerity.

663
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,390
That's good.

664
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,310
By the way,

665
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,480
The chandelier is very beautiful.

666
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Jingxian and I both like it very much.

667
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,700
Good.

668
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,480
I'll take these.

669
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,790
Shaotang,

670
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,280
we're working now.

671
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,260
Go ahead if there's nothing else.

672
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,220
Yes.

673
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,520
Call me if you need anything.

674
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,080
Move this out.

675
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,550
It's all done.

676
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,960
The site was also restored to its original position.

677
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,120
Okay, let's go.

678
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,190
Go.

679
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
The problem of 810

680
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,900
is an old sore for Chongqing Station.

681
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,350
After so many years,

682
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,190
this old sore has become

683
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,630
a huge worry for the boss.

684
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,820
To be honest,

685
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,960
the boss is very unhappy.

686
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,870
Let me remind you.

687
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,880
Just this once.

688
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,920
Even if we have to cut the flesh,

689
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,070
we must thoroughly

690
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,240
investigate this.

691
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,360
Of course,

692
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,550
I alone

693
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,150
don't have such great power.

694
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,560
After all,

695
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,670
we still need the three Captains of Chongqing Station

696
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,110
and all of you.

697
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,300
Because you are elites from Chongqing Station.

698
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,810
Section Chief Qin.

699
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,980
Your performance in the 38th Division

700
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,840
was praised by the boss.

701
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Section Chief Li.

702
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,000
You handled Japanese gas bombs properly in Guhe

703
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,530
and contributed a lot to Chongqing Station.

704
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,240
Ou Xiao'an.

705
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,150
You were the only one in 810.

706
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,520
So I hope you can

707
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,130
get yourself sorted

708
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,880
and help us recall

709
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,510
about 810 as soon as possible.

710
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,150
Yes.

711
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,720
Although everyone here

712
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,520
is from different departments,

713
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,830
the fact that you're all participating in this operation

714
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,910
means you are capable enough.

715
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,440
So,

716
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,790
I hope everyone

717
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,880
can keep up the good work

718
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,950
and not let Kuomintang down.

719
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,830
Yes.

720
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,290
I hereby announce that

721
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
the 810 Special Investigation Team

722
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
is officially established.

723
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,160
There are two specific tasks for the group.

724
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,840
First,

725
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,990
use all the informants you have

726
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,430
and professional skills

727
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,920
to analyze the exact coordinates of 810 as soon as possible

728
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,450
and where Ohashi Kazuya is hiding currently.

729
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,190
In Myanmar,

730
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,360
the Expeditionary Force is already waiting for orders.

731
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,040
They can conduct searches at any time.

732
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,830
Find 810 and catch Ohashi alive.

733
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,670
Second, find out where

734
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,000
the gas bombs produced by 810

735
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,150
and biochemical bombs

736
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,270
are now.

737
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,950
Where is Cherry Blossom Project's

738
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,880
target.

739
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,960
I need you to find out as soon as possible.

740
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Other than these,

741
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,680
all other work and tasks

742
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
can be paused for now.

743
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,040
Everyone,

744
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,230
this is a rare opportunity for Chongqing Station

745
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,600
given by the boss.

746
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,120
I hope all of you

747
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,710
don't let the boss down

748
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,370
and complete the task.

749
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,360
Understand?

750
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,470
Yes.

751
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,070
So,

752
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,050
do you have any questions?

753
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,940
Director Shen,

754
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,240
we know what Director wants.

755
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,630
Now,

756
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,430
find 810 and the gas bombs

757
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,680
and catch Ohashi alive.

758
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,350
These are indeed urgent.

759
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,360
But if the station is not clean,

760
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,030
if there is a Japanese spy in the station,

761
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,230
then every word we say

762
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,480
will reach Ohashi

763
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,590
within a day.

764
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,660
Then our team would've been established...

765
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,670
Ou Xiao'an, sit down.

766
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,370
Yes.

767
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,960
I admire

768
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,550
your enthusiasm.

769
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
But have you ever thought that

770
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,470
if we find 810,

771
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,050
and Ohashi Kazuya alive,

772
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,160
then this person

773
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,100
would naturally surface?

774
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,660
Yes.

775
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,750
I don't care

776
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,560
how many doubts and suspicions you had before.

777
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,190
Now, put them down.

778
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,630
The task

779
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,910
of 810 comes before everything else.

780
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,690
Okay?

781
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,830
-Yes!
-Yes!

782
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,780
Dismissed.

783
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,550
Ou Xiao'an.

784
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,750
I hope we can work together

785
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,640
and find 810 as soon as possible.

786
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,680
Okay.

787
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,360
I'll admit.

788
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,400
After the accident,

789
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,800
I did suspect it was you

790
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,130
who told Ohashi Kazuya.

791
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,450
I know they have many tricks.

792
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,870
Besides,

793
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,480
many special agents in Shanghai were arrested,

794
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,120
and I saw you

795
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,110
declare your separation from Chongqing Station.

796
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,760
How could I not suspect you?

797
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,610
But after these few days,

798
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,800
I saw your loyalty to the country

799
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,040
and NBIS.

800
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,040
Maybe I misunderstood you.

801
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,160
Xiao'an.

802
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,130
The enemy is in front of us.

803
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,210
I hope we can let bygones be bygones

804
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,070
and stop suspecting each other.

805
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,050
Your business skills have gone down.

806
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,320
What do you mean?

807
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,070
You've started

808
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,120
to cover your first lie with a whole bunch of lies.

809
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,670
So,

810
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,110
you think I'm lying?

811
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,630
Let me ask you.

812
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,910
Why did you burn the Cherry Blossom information

813
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,350
on the train from Shanghai to Nanjing?
