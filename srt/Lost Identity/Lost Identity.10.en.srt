00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,310
that can completely brainwash people.

199
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,310
Impossible.

200
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,280
There's no such drug.

201
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,030
Ou Xiao'an has been brainwashed.

202
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,570
It's indeed difficult to do it

203
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,970
through drugs.

204
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,630
That's why I've included

205
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,690
a few other methods.

206
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,580
Lily!

207
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,090
Nagoya!

208
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,780
Tiger! Church!

209
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,310
Nagoya! Lily!

210
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,310
Blue. Church. Lily. Nagoya.

211
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,510
Nagoya!

212
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,560
I conducted experiments

213
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,900
on many prisoners.

214
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,910
Unfortunately,

215
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,190
their minds and brains

216
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
are too fragile.

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,470
They were either dead or had gone crazy.

218
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,730
Many people

219
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
lost their memories completely

220
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,980
after undergoing several experiments.

221
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,350
I've wasted too much time

222
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,120
on them!

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,380
We are not experimental objects.

224
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,580
We are all Chinese.

225
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,000
Mr. Ou, why don't you understand?

226
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,430
Compared to the progress of science,

227
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,670
individual life is but a speck of dust

228
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,350
in the universe!

229
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,190
You Chinese people were born

230
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,710
to be guinea pigs for the Empire of Japan!

231
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,640
It is a worthy death

232
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,020
that you and your descendants

233
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,270
die for what we, the Yamato nation,

234
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,210
have done in East Asia today!

235
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,290
Ou Xiao'an!

236
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,320
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

237
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,530
Sit down!

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,770
Sit down!

239
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,680
Sit down!

240
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,580
Sit down!

241
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Sit down!

242
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,200
I wrote

243
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,470
the Cherry Blossom Project file

244
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,670
for Ohashi Kazuya?

245
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,650
Of course.

246
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,730
At first,

247
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,450
you did resist and refused.

248
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
That's why

249
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,220
they needed my experiment

250
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,790
to hold your brain hostage

251
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,320
until we transferred from Shanghai.

252
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,310
Blue.

253
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,050
Railway.

254
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,550
Chur... Vel...

255
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,520
Velvet.

256
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,340
Tiger.

257
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,060
Lily.

258
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,970
Church! Church! Church!

259
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,720
Church!

260
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,300
Start all over again!

261
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,530
Chur... Railway.

262
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,520
Ch-church?

263
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,100
Na... Li...

264
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,430
Velvet. Tiger

265
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,260
-Tiger.
-Tiger. Tiger.

266
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
Start over. Blue!

267
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,430
Railway! Velvet!

268
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,890
Velvet!

269
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,360
Chief.

270
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,470
Tiger!

271
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,440
Did you get anything?

272
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,230
Soon.

273
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,900
Let him write it now. Now.

274
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,830
Goya.

275
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,630
Railway.

276
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Now I need you

277
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,870
to write down all the information you remember

278
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,060
about the Cherry Blossom Project.

279
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,650
Write! Write it down!

280
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,550
Write it down!

281
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,360
Church. Church.

282
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,980
Mr. Ou, write it down.

283
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,400
Write it down!

284
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,030
Lily.

285
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,520
Chief, my experiment will be a success!

286
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,630
Please trust me!

287
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,900
Tell me.

288
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,430
How long will it take

289
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,150
for him to start working for me?

290
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,860
Chief, brainwashing Ou Xiao'an

291
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,440
is not just about injecting him with truth serum.

292
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,100
Tell me how much time you need!

293
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,960
I need...

294
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
I need half a year.

295
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,480
No.

296
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,340
The Cherry Blossom Project can't be stalled for that long.

297
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,710
Chief, my experiment has just started.

298
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,780
But there is too little experimental data.

299
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,820
Plus, his brain is so strong.

300
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,590
The progress of the experiment

301
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,050
will be much faster than before!

302
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,290
Take him away!

303
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,010
The progress will be faster!

304
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,430
Chief Ohashi!

305
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,920
Chief Ohashi!

306
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,170
My experiment will be a success!

307
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,100
Please trust me!

308
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,520
I will definitely give you the file

309
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,630
for the Cherry Blossom Project.

310
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,420
I hope you can fulfill your promise

311
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,190
when you get there.

312
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,470
Where?

313
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,760
A paradise for scientific researchers.

314
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,280
I believe you will like that place.

315
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,650
Yes.

316
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,600
Chief Ohashi has been secretly preparing

317
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,000
for 810 for a long time.

318
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,850
Thanks to you,

319
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,230
I

320
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,880
was among the first batch of scientific researchers

321
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,090
from the Shanghai Institute

322
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,210
to 810.

323
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,700
Over there,

324
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,580
we started the Memory Hostage Experiment officially.

325
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,570
What exactly

326
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,660
is the Memory Hostage Experiment?

327
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,390
Memory Hostage Experiment

328
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,710
is my lifelong effort!

329
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,040
Both Chief Ohashi and I believe

330
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,570
that the way a person

331
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,400
thinks

332
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,130
and the memories of his past

333
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,190
can determine

334
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,390
how well he perceives his own identity,

335
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,930
which in turn can influence his judgement

336
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,610
and even

337
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,260
his pursuit of faith.

338
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,640
To test my theory,

339
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,890
I conducted a series of measurements

340
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,359
on your brain and memory.

341
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,240
If the experiment had been in a perfect state,

342
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,250
you'd have been completely brainwashed,

343
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,180
lost yourself entirely,

344
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,380
and become a total loyalist

345
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,339
to the Empire of Japan.

346
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,920
It's all in your imagination.

347
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,070
Really?

348
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,490
Mr. Ou,

349
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,770
do you often

350
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,230
hear voices or see images in your head

351
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,200
that are hard to distinguish from reality?

352
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,760
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

353
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,540
A Japanese spy.

354
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,500
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

355
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,880
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

356
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,290
Those are not true.

357
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,570
They're not true.

358
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,630
Let me put it this way.

359
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,410
The hippocampus in the human brain

360
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,830
is like... like

361
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,720
a delicate watch movement.

362
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,720
The neurons are almost seamless to each other.

363
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,960
But no matter how fit they are,

364
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,830
there will be a tiny gap between them.

365
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,960
The Memory Hostage Experiment

366
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,110
is to rewrite the information

367
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,060
stored in your neurons through brainwashing

368
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,580
until it becomes

369
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,340
a more efficient and refined watch movement.

370
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,190
Understand?

371
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,250
Mr. Ou.

372
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,220
See?

373
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,920
Our experiment is useful.

374
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,710
I just need a little more time.

375
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,590
Mr. Ou.

376
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,920
If you're willing,

377
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,650
we can continue the experiment.

378
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,540
Let's

379
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,170
change this world together? What do you think?

380
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,890
Mr. Ou. Mr. Ou?

381
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,060
Look at me.

382
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,420
Mr. Ou!

383
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,880
Miao,

384
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,490
tell us what you think.

385
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,070
I'd better listen to you two vice captains.

386
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,760
No.

387
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,020
Miao.

388
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,120
Captain Wei believes you.

389
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,180
You say.

390
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,790
In my opinion,

391
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,520
I think they are acting.

392
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,290
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

393
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,360
What deep grudge could exist between

394
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,390
a Japanese

395
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,770
and a traitor working for the Japanese?

396
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,370
They just put on a show for us.

397
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,830
Even Miao can see it.

398
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,280
Wen,

399
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,910
you're a senior.

400
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,330
Don't tell me you didn't tell.

401
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,130
Miao.

402
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,120
See? I told you,

403
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,720
right?

404
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,270
What you said

405
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,490
speaks to the heart of Captain Wei.

406
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,980
Dramatic.

407
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,850
Feng.

408
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,990
What do you think?

409
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,310
Nothing.

410
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
Whether Ou Xiao'an is good or bad,

411
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,160
even Wen, his mentor,

412
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
can't tell.

413
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,570
What can I say?

414
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,620
I've drunk too much tea. I'm going to the toilet.

415
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,130
I admit

416
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,360
that your willpower

417
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,140
is stronger than that of ordinary people.

418
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,660
So, I had to increase the dosage

419
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,300
and try

420
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,710
many mental drugs on you.

421
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,260
For example, scopolamine

422
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,020
and ayahuasca, etc.

423
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,630
But the side effect is

424
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,830
that your memory loss

425
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,390
will worsen.

426
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,800
So I had to turn to other methods

427
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,540
to relieve the symptom with different drugs.

428
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,700
I've been looking for a balance point

429
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,260
between the two.

430
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,060
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

431
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,360
Find the organization

432
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,600
and expose him.

433
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,000
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

434
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,820
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

435
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,200
Stop him. Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy!

436
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,280
Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

437
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,740
Find the organization

438
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,360
-and stop him!
-Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy.

439
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,440
Is this Xu?

440
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,040
Yes, Vice Captain Feng.

441
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,650
Is there anyone beside you?

442
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,330
No. Please go ahead.

443
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Section Chief Li!

444
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,690
I'm sorry

445
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,380
for all the trouble.

446
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,060
I knew you must have been innocent all along.

447
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,980
The Party needs a talent like you.

448
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,670
We are all for the Party.

449
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,530
It's not worth mentioning.

450
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,210
Yes.

451
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Section Chief Li.

452
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,750
I was just doing my job.

453
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,990
As you know, interrogating traitors

454
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,370
is a bad job for anyone.

455
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,650
You're the big man. Please forgive me.

456
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,770
I understand.

457
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
Don’t worry.

458
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,870
No wonder you are

459
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,640
the rising star in the Chongqing Station of NBIS.

460
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,330
By the way,

461
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,060
I know a good restaurant nearby.

462
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,710
Let me book a few tables for you to celebrate.

463
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Sure.

464
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,280
Let's do it another day.

465
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,890
Okay.

466
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,380
I'll get back to work.

467
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,380
See you.

468
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,390
I understand.

469
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,460
After the report is ready

470
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,210
I'll send it to Captain Wei

471
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,490
right away.

472
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,620
I understand what you mean.

473
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,470
I won't let anyone else

474
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,620
in our department get their hands on it

475
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,240
to save you the trouble.

476
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,660
Yes.

477
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,580
Got it.

478
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,800
Got it.

479
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,460
How did I escape from 810?

480
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,550
Do you really not remember anything?

481
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,960
There must be some flashes.

482
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,110
What flashes?

483
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,650
A woman.

484
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,580
A Yamato woman.

485
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,000
Her name was Reiko.

486
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,390
I don't know any Japanese women.

487
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,950
Not only do you know her,

488
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,780
but you also once saved her life.

489
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,770
Let me give you one more hint.

490
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,110
Her full name

491
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,040
was Ohashi Reiko.

492
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,390
Ohashi Reiko?

493
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,470
What's her relationship with Ohashi?

494
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,760
Mr. Ou.

495
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,480
You're going to remember everything.

496
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,590
Ohashi Reiko.

497
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
I heard that you are good at playing the piano.

498
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,110
Someone asked me

499
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,970
to give this to you.

500
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,510
Okay.

501
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,940
[Thank you, Mr. Ou]

502
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,970
What's the relationship between Ohashi Reiko and Li Shaotang?

503
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,950
Li Shaotang?

504
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,800
They had never met.

505
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,400
You didn't remember everything.

506
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,980
Otherwise, you would have remembered

507
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,450
that it was she who saved your life.

508
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,490
She helped you escape from 810.

509
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,850
You play the piano well,

510
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,780
so

511
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,720
Chief Ohashi's daughter fell in love with you.

512
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,710
But...

513
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
you used her.

514
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,840
You used her kindness and goodness

515
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,010
to help you escape from 810.

516
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,460
There is no way I'd use a Japanese woman.

517
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,040
810 is heavily guarded.

518
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,530
Then how did you manage to escape?

519
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,340
Did Chief Ohashi

520
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,020
let you out alive himself?

521
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,170
Three years ago,

522
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,490
Reiko was diagnosed

523
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,270
with multiple sclerosis.

524
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,520
When she had an attack,

525
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,970
her limbs would become stiff and cause her unbearable pain.

526
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,370
She had tried to end her life several times.

527
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,550
For Reiko,

528
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,440
Chief Ohashi asked doctors in 810

529
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,790
to experiment on the prisoners

530
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,830
in order to try to find a way to cure her.

531
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,810
Then she met you.

532
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,530
Chief Ohashi asked you to accompany Reiko,

533
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,210
play piano for her dancing, and chat with her.

534
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,260
When Reiko was in pain,

535
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,470
so many famous doctors from the Empire of Japan

536
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,870
didn't know what to do.

537
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,970
We didn't expect

538
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,970
your company

539
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,990
to help her

540
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,430
gradually cheer up.

541
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,410
For the sake of Reiko,

542
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,070
Chief Ohashi granted you freedom

543
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,800
in 810

544
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,330
under very good conditions.

545
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,190
I really don't understand

546
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,330
why Miss Reiko,

547
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,600
such an elegant and beautiful flower of Yamato,

548
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,840
would fall in love with a Chinese like you.

549
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,130
She even lost her life

550
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,900
for a Chinese like you!

551
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,020
What exactly

552
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,920
did you put in my head?

553
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,760
Reiko died because of you!

554
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,900
What did you put in my brain?

555
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,600
Reiko died because of you!

556
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,220
What did you put in my head?

557
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,630
-You killed Miss Reiko.
-Li Shaotang.

558
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,260
-You killed Miss Reiko!
-Li Shaotang!

559
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,440
Reiko died because of you!

560
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,570
Is Li Shaotang a spy?

561
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,670
Reiko died because of you!

562
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,630
Is Li Shaotang a spy?

563
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,920
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

564
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,670
Is he a spy?

565
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,490
Someone will die if this goes on!

566
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,470
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

567
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,790
-Let go of him! Let go!
-Is he a spy?

568
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,510
What are you doing? Calm down.

569
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,620
Is he a Japanese spy?

570
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,710
Ou Xiao'an!

571
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,390
Let go of him!

572
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,990
-Tell me! Is he a spy?
-Let go.

573
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,660
Ou Xiao'an, let go of him!

574
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,630
Is he really a Japanese spy?

575
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,510
Ou Xiao'an!

576
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,710
-Ou Xiao'an!
-Is he a spy?

577
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,330
Is he a spy?

578
