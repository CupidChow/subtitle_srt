50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,750

They went through the border

380
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,940
with the special Transportation Permit for Water and Land that you NBIS approved.

381
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,560
The inspection stations have no right to check them,

382
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,960
so we can only let them go.

383
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,810
From which station?

384
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,140
We don't know that.

385
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,200
Your stamp is on the permit.

386
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,530
We are indeed not qualified to inspect their vehicles.

387
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,770
OK, got it.

388
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,480
Hello, I’m Qin Moqing.

389
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,350
Doctor Qin,

390
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,440
I’m Zheng Ming from the 38th Division.

391
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,880
I've sorted out the matters

392
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,720
about Ando Motoyoshi, the Japanese military doctor,

393
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,700
that you asked me to investigate.

394
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Go ahead, please.

395
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,800
Ando

396
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,800
was caught by one of our reconnaissance companies

397
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,670
in the forest at the border.

398
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,920
After he was captured,

399
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,080
he claimed to be an army doctor from 810,

400
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,820
so the Chief ordered me to handle it.

401
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,260
But after I reported it,

402
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
people from Chongqing directly ordered us

403
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,970
to escort him from Yunnan board

404
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,080
to Xifeng

405
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,650
and deliver him to Mao Renxing, Deputy Director Mao

406
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,180
at your Chongqing Station.

407
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,750
Were all soldiers from the 38th Division

408
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,380
escorting him all the way from Yunnan to Xifeng?

409
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,100
Yes.

410
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,350
Did he see anyone else

411
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,740
along the way here?

412
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,510
I specifically asked the platoon leader in charge

413
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,190
about it for you.

414
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,310
He said it was a succeed-or-die order

415
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,290
to send Ando to Chongqing without stopping.

416
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,390
So, on the way,

417
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,960
they didn't even dare to take a rest

418
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,230
or blink,

419
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,160
and they sent him

420
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,910
to your people at NBIS Chongqing Station.

421
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,790
And your people

422
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,070
took him

423
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,840
to your own safe house.

424
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,080
What did you say?

425
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,660
He wasn't sent to the station directly?

426
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,430
No.

427
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,240
The higher-ups said

428
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,590
to keep it a secret from your station first.

429
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,230
So, Ando wasn't sent to your station directly.

430
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,090
Who was in charge of the handover?

431
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,190
Be careful.

432
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,080
Yes.

433
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Secretary Miao.

434
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,960
What’s wrong?

435
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,630
Secretary Miao, Captain Wei

436
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,760
wants to see you now.

437
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,080
Did he say what it is about?

438
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
He said a group of trucks

439
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,800
passed the inspection station at the Yunnan-Burma border

440
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,530
with a special passage permit from us.

441
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,830
Captain Wei wants you to check

442
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,300
which station has approved the passage permit

443
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,430
and what it is about.

444
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,020
You go ask the Captain

445
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,670
if I go take care of the special passage permit,

446
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,560
should we let Ge

447
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,090
archive the 810 files herself?

448
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,800
Yes.

449
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,880
The ones guarding Ando in the safe house

450
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,630
were four of our men outside.

451
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,920
But I've checked

452
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,800
that none of them

453
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,910
had met Ando alone,

454
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,270
so they didn't have the chance to poison him.

455
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,150
However,

456
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,030
the person who took them to carry out the mission

457
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,310
met Ando alone.

458
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,950
And that person is from Chongqing Station.

459
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,150
Our station?

460
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,560
Who?

461
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,890
You should know this person well.

462
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,870
Secretary Miao is monitoring

463
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,200
the archiving of 810 files.

464
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,280
She sent me over to ask

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,080
if we could

466
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,760
let Ge handle the filing alone

467
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,110
and she go check the fleet's passage permit.

468
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,150
Ask her to keep filing,

469
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,390
and get me Mao Renxing here.

470
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,590
Deputy Director Mao?

471
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Captain,

472
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,520
Deputy Director Mao has been on leave for a long time.

473
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,340
It said that he was not accustomed to the new environment in Yunnan,

474
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,520
so he needed treatment at the hospital.

475
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,870
He said you approved his leave.

476
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,820
When did I approve his leave? Go check!

477
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,230
-Captain Wei.
-Go check what he is doing right now!

478
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,120
Captain Wei.

479
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,270
What is it?

480
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,130
I have something to report

481
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,140
about Mao Renxing.

[For the Public Good]

483
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Captain,

484
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,800
what is it?

485
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,110
Where is Mao Renxing?

486
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,950
In that case,

487
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,830
Mao Renxing is that Japanese spy?

488
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,670
[Map of Chongqing Municipal District]

489
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,990
When Ando Motoyoshi was in the safe house,

490
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,670
Mao Renxing was in charge of the detention.

491
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,110
They had many opportunities to see each other alone.

492
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,540
According to the timeline,

493
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,790
it matches perfectly.

494
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,880
Plus, now Mao Renxing has suddenly disappeared.

495
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,660
So it's mostly proven

496
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,190
that he’s a Japanese spy.

497
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,240
Miao,

498
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,010
where did he get the passage permit?

499
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,510
Stolen from me.

500
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,090
From you?

501
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,920
Yes.

502
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,820
Feng,

503
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,460
as long as you didn't give it to him.

504
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,690
When we found 810,

505
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,880
we didn’t find a single gas bomb.

506
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,690
But, at the same time,

507
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,630
Ohashi sent five truckloads of stuff

508
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,360
to the mainland.

509
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,790
We can imagine

510
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,360
what's in those trucks.

511
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,030
If Mao Renxing

512
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,690
went to meet Ohashi Kazuya...

513
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,270
We must catch him immediately.

514
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,510
We've already informed all stations

515
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,040
to check and intercept him.

516
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,920
No news from them yet.

517
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,860
Mao Renxing is really capable.

518
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,000
Five trucks of biochemical bombs.

519
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,860
Where did the trucks and escorts for the bombs

520
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,290
come from?

521
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,230
Ohashi must have arranged it a long time ago.

522
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,430
Besides, Mao Renxing

523
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,430
also has the capability to arrange it.

524
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,520
All he has to do is quietly

525
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,720
transport the gas bombs outside our controlled area.

526
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,640
Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan

527
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,630
are all in the hands of the Japanese.

528
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,200
Right?

529
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,280
Ohashi took such a big risk

530
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,920
and sent the biochemical bombs into our country.

531
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,640
Where is his destination?

532
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,640
As far as I know,

533
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,270
the Japanese are amassing troops

534
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,640
to attack Zhijiang Airport.

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,520
The war drags on.

536
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,800
If biochemical bombs deployed on the battlefield,

537
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,200
the consequences would be unimaginable.

538
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
It's highly likely that the bombs were sent

539
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,870
from Kunming to Guiyang and then to other places.

544

Deputy Director Mao often went out on missions.

580
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,110
It's normal for him to stay out when there's a special situation.

581
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,120
And the situation is getting better.

582

that Mr. Qin thought highly of him.

603
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,560
At the beginning of the year, Deputy Director Mao pulled strings

604

608

Mr. Qin asked him to send his regards.

609

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,530
are involved in this, even in a small way,

754
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,520
with Mr. Dai's temper,

755
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,160
will he give us a chance to explain?

756
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,230
Ou Xiao'an is the lesson.

757
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,270
Wei. Wei.

758
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,210
I'll take this back and study it carefully.

759
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,620
Calm down. Don't rush.

760
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,230
Right.

761
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,810
See if there are any doubts.

762
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,540
Okay.

763
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,450
I'm telling you, nothing must happen.

764
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,560
Okay.

765
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,630
Look ahead.

766
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,870
Are you the officers from the Chongqing Station?

767
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,830
Who are you?

768
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,910
Sir, we're from the Xifeng Liaison Station.

769
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,840
May I know which one is Qin Moqing, Section Chief Qin?

770
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,680
I am.

771
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,630
Section Chief Qin.

772
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,390
We've just received a secret telegram from Vice Captain Wen

773
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,390
to urgently summon you back to Chongqing.

774
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,200
What is it about?

775
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
[Decipher Letter]

776
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,450
He didn't mention the specific reason.

777
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,270
I'm still in the middle of something.

778
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,130
I can't go back.

779
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,490
Section Chief Qin,

780
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,280
don't make it difficult for us.

781
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,370
[Decipher Letter]

782
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,250
Go back.

783
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,730
This way, please.

784
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,590
We are just out on the mission,

785
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,820
and Section Chief Qin has been taken away.

786
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,300
Something is fishy.

787
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,290
You don't even know this,

788
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,060
so there is no way I'd know it.

789
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,620
Why didn't you report

790
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,360
on 9548?

791
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,490
Didn't I promise

792
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,830
to prove my identity with you?

793
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,370
Catching Ohashi Kazuya will prove it.

794
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,030
Maybe both of our identities can be proven

795
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,640
after catching Ohashi Kazuya

796
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,870
and finding the biochemical bombs.

797
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
Of course.

798
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,030
Don't be a Japanese spy.

799
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,550
Don't be a communist.

800
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,340
Section Chief Qin, hello.

801
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,320
Hello, Section Chief Qin.

802
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,880
Section Chief Qin, hello.

803
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,390
Come in.

804
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,110
Sir,

805
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,390
why did you call me back in such a hurry?

806
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,660
Is something wrong?

807
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,720
Jifeng Company

808
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,430
is run by your big brother, Qin Jiru, right?

809
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,350
Yes, what's wrong?

810
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,830
If something were to go wrong with Jifeng Company,

811
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,090
where would you stand?

812
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,760
You know better than I do

813
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,160
if there is anything wrong with him, right?

814
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,300
I'll stand where I should stand.

815
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,960
Just say it.

816
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,990
I just checked Mao Renxing's night duty records.

817
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
[Duty Record]

818
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,000
On the day he left Chongqing,

819
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,030
he was supposed to be on duty at the station.

820
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,430
Later, he received a call

821
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,670
and left Chongqing.

822
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,520
That call

823
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,160
was from

824
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,130
18 Xinyi Street.

825
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,590
You mean Jiru's Jifeng Company?

826
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,040
Yes,

827
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,540
your big brother's company.

828
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,520
Mao Renxing has had

829
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,230
financial transactions

830
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,440
with Jifeng Company for all these years.

831
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,570
You don't know that?

832
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,550
I don't know.

833
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,950
I never asked him about his business.

834
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,090
[Savings Account Mao Renxing]

835
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,440
This is Mao Renxing's secret account.

836
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,000
Over the past three years,

837
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,550
a lot of remittances have been received from Jifeng Company.

838
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,590
The last one

839
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,250
was after he left Chongqing.

840
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,920
[Mao Renxing]

841
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,370
With the resources of Jifeng Company

842
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,710
backing him,

843
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,370
it's not hard to explain

844
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,910
the cars and staff that transported the chemical bombs.

845
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,150
You're suspecting that Jiru

846
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,760
is involved in the transportation of biochemical bombs?

847
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,690
I hope it has nothing to do with him.

848
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,940
Let me investigate it.

849
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
Whether he has something to do with it or not,

850
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,570
I will give the station an explanation.
