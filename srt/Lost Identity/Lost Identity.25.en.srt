[Patriotic Industrialist Qin Jiru Aircraft Donation Ceremony]

5
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,630
All aspiring people should look up to Mr. Qin.

6
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,789
Today’s ceremony

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,910
is to encourage everyone

8
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,670
to follow Mr. Qin's example.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
Jifeng Company has come this far,

10
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,350
all thanks to the support of the nationalist government.

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,560
Thank you for your appreciation.

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,960
I'll do everything for the Party.

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,650
These two planes today

14
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,190
are just my humble gesture

15
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,610
for the country.

16
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,590
I believe

17
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,460
that as long as we can sincerely and wholeheartedly

18
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,120
help the Party and continue to save the country,

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
China

20
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,570
will have a promising future!

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,380
The court judgment in the June 13 Yunnan-Burma opium smuggling case

22
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,100
is as follows:

23
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,090
The defendant,

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,980
former Captain Mao Renxing, Deputy Director of the Inspection Office

25
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,860
at the NBIS Chongqing Station,

26
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,440
is sentenced to death. Execute immediately.

27
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,990
I'm innocent! I'm not guilty!

28
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,190
I'm innocent!

29
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,220
Please have mercy on me.

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,080
I confess.

31
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,620
-Ready!
-I confess.

32
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,350
Fire!

33
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,590
We've found the gas bombs.

34
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,490
Where?

35
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,760
The organization found them

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,390
in the cellar of a Burmese village.

37
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,960
What about Ohashi? Did you find Ohashi?

38
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,720
No.

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,220
They only left a small part of the Japanese soldiers,

40
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,950
with a few Burmese guarding it.

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,630
Our men sneaked in

42
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,240
and checked on the situation.

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,300
There aren't many of them.

44
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,830
It should be just a small part of the gas bombs.

45
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,180
No germ bombs?

46
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,540
You should know more about Burma than I do.

47
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,040
We don't have the capability to operate there.

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,890
I'm afraid we can't give a definitive analysis.

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,019
According to Ando,

50
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,250
the reason Ohashi

51
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,060
delayed the evacuation from 810

52
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,920
was to transport the batch of biochemical bombs

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
for the Cherry Blossom Project.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,070
If there are no germ bombs,

55
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,680
it means

56
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,350
Ou Xiao'an's deduction is correct.

57
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,780
The goal of the Cherry Blossom Project is still Chongqing.

58
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,590
Qiushui,

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,510
once the organization

60
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,990
determines the quantity and specifics

61
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,450
of this batch of biochemical bombs,

62
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,909
please let me know in time.

63
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,050
Our men have told this news

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
to the 38th Division.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,190
I suppose

66
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,210
Wei Qingming has received the news.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
Is this the decision of the organization?

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,890
After repeated discussions by the higher-ups,

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,690
we believe that this is the only way.

70
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,409
Firstly,

71
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,120
we can control

72
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,290
this batch of gas bombs as soon as possible

73
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,610
and track down Ohashi.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,520
Secondly,

75
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,210
we can request

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,930
that they get on it as soon as possible,

77
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,300
and we will supervise the entire process.

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,470
It also gives us the initiative to take control of the situation.

79
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,470
So many gas bombs,

80
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,010
and we just hand them over on a silver platter.

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,350
This is not simply handing them over.

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,810
Prioritize and focus on the bigger picture.

83
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,250
Don't forget that the whereabouts

84
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,910
of many biochemical weapons are still unknown.

85
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,260
We don't know Ohashi Kazuya's schemes

86
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,990
or his plan.

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,440
Once the Cherry Blossom Project is implemented,

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,240
it will turn the tide in the entire Far East battle.

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,720
Understood.

90
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,260
Ou Xiao'an.

91
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,450
It's been three days.

92
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,980
It's been three days. Where are the gas bombs?

93
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,670
You didn't find any clues.

94
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,290
Captain, it's easy to overlook what's right in front of us.

95
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,880
We need to start from the inside.

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,240
Just tell me

97
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,270
that we need to investigate Li Shaotang!

98
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,440
Don't give me that.

99
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,900
Captain,

100
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,050
after I came back,

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,040
I ran through the whole thing,

102
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,370
back and forth, carefully.

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,580
We were ambushed by the Japanese

104
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,220
on the day we escorted the car back.

105
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,510
Li Shaotang chased the Japanese soldiers away

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,390
and disappeared for a long time.

107
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,550
And on the way,

108
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,230
I captured a Japanese soldier alive.

109
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,590
I was about to interrogate him,

110
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,800
but Li Shaotang returned

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,330
and shot that soldier to death.

112
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,500
What do you think this is?

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,370
It is most likely that the Japanese lured us away

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
to create time for Li Shaotang

115
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,210
to meet the Japanese

116
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,950
or

117
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,850
to meet Ohashi Kazuya himself.

118
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,930
I've been investigating this for so long.

119
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,900
Li Shaotang

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
probably plays an important part

121
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,330
in the Cherry Blossom Project.

122
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,140
It must have taken you a long time

123
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,850
to gather those investigation materials.

124
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,280
Did you start after Mao Renxing's arrest?

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,460
I've been thinking about it

126
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,630
since I was taken at 810.

127
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,210
That's not important, Captain.

128
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,690
I stand by my opinion.

129
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,190
Li Shaotang must be a Japanese spy.

130
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,270
He must.

131
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,990
I hope we can restart

132
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,510
the secret investigation into him.

133
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,630
Wen, you agree with him?

134
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,580
Captain...

135
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,700
Don't drag my teacher into this.

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,830
Don't you

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
suspect Li Shaotang too?

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,450
You two want to investigate

139
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,670
his identity.

140
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Just do it.

141
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,830
Why do we

142
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,060
have to bring it out in the open?

143
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,300
Captain, we can investigate,

144
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,290
but we don't have the right to access

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,200
the documents or files without your signature.

146
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,120
Xiao'an and I

147
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,550
investigate him in secret.

148
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,210
Even if we were to find the evidence,

149
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,140
Feng Yunian wouldn’t admit it.

150
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,580
Then, Shen Congwu would likely say

151
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,740
we're having internal conflicts again.

152
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,400
Once everything got muddled,

153
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,330
we still wouldn't be able to get to the truth.

154
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,100
Wei,

155
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,180
our Chongqing Station

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,500
is getting restless.

157
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,950
We haven't won the war against the Japanese yet.

158
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,920
But everyone is already thinking about

159
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,900
how to reap the benefits without putting in any effort

160
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
or considering a backup plan.

161
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,130
Only we are thinking about

162
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,060
catching that Japanese spy.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,680
Wen,

164
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,240
I respect your opinion.

165
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,570
How about this?

166
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,050
To investigate Li Shaotang's identity...

167
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,120
I'll leave it to Ou Xiao'an to investigate

168
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,650
all cases

169
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,970
related to this Japanese spy.

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,940
I'll grant you special approval

171
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,140
to access and review

172
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,030
all relevant files at the station.

173
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,789
As for the deployment,

174
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,440
you can ask your teacher directly. He's in charge of it.

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,909
Okay.

176
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,240
I only have one request.

177
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,909
Fast.

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
I can't bear the responsibility

179
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,880
for a truckload of gas bombs entering Chongqing.

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,030
What if they explode one day, right?

181
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,230
Got it.

182
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,050
Wei,

183
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,100
your decision is so wise.

184
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,620
We're on it now.

185
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Fast.

186
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,990
Okay. Fast.

187
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,770
-Yes, sir.
-Remember to be fast!

188
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,370
-Okay. Leave it to us.
-Fast.

189
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,750

But, Xiao'an,

Sir,

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,540
if the higher-ups came down on us later,

199
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,100
threw me out, and I'd take the blame.

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
Vice Captain Wen, hello.

201
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,910
You can’t take this alone.

202
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,090
If the words of the investigation

203
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,140
about Li Shaotang got out,

both Wei Qingming and I

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,850
wouldn't end well.

208
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,070
how much longer will it take?

209
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,570
At least seven days.

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,710
Seven days?

211
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,340
No, three days at most.

212
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,990
You must finish it within three days.

213
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,730

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,090
They would die for it.

217
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,540
I'll send NBIS technicians

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,820
to supervise you.

219
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,840
I'd like to see who will die.

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,930
that Chongqing is just short of this one shelter.

222
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,330
Company Commander Shao,

223
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,080
the higher-ups attach great importance to this project.

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Please finish it as scheduled.

225
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,770
Officer Li, it's not that we are slacking off,

226
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,250
but your plan is too hard.

227
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,370

228

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,940

that it's hard for you and our men.

this bomb shelter

234
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,580
is a project

235
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,730
that Mr. Dai values highly.

236
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,510
If you and your brothers

237

238
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,050

you don't want this credit.

241
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,360
Alright.

242
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,110
I'll go and urge them.

243
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Thank you, Company Commander Shao.

244
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,900
Come on.

247
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,760

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,500
have you noticed

253
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,260
that after Mao Renxing's case,

254
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,250
Mr. Dai and Director Shen

255
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
didn't treat us the same as before?

256
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,980
So,

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,920
this bomb shelter

258
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,390

Look, the gas bombs

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,460
have entered Chongqing.

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
If Ohashi implemented the Cherry Blossom Project,

262
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,530
the consequences would be unimaginable.

263
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,370
So,

264
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,510
the 129th bomb shelter will

265
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,150
undoubtedly become the only refuge

266
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,950
for the key members of the Party.

267
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,690

And he dared not report it.

If something happens,

275
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,730
it's a serious crime not to report it.

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,710
Do you understand what he means?

379
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,830
Yes.

380
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
I will redeem myself.

381
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,880
This is your only way out,

382
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,830
and the only way out

383
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,980
for the whole Chongqing Station.

384
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,810
As for the rest,

385
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,390
we'll talk about it after this.

386
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,430
-Yes.
-Yes.

387
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,650
[Map of Chongqing Municipal District]

388
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,530
Connect to 18847.

389
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,070
It's me.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,560
Please speed up what I said last time.

391
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,880
Feng Yunian!

392
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,870
I have never seen him make any effort

393
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,320
to deal with Japanese.

394
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,660
But he goes all out

395
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,270
to deal with us.

396
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,700
Wen,

397
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,790
it was the three of us's decision

398
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,560
not to report it, right?

399
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,410
Yes.

400
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,240
It must have been that old bastard who reported it!

401
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
Also,

402
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,950
he knows all along

403
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,380
that Li Shaotang has been constructing the shelter.

404
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,070
It's fine that he wants to take all the credit,

405
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,440
but why throw us under the bus?

406
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,500
When I think of his old face,

407
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm pissed!

408
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,710
Wei. Wei.

409
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,440
Calm down. Calm down!

410
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,500
It's not worth it

411
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,670
to get yourself all worked up.

412
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,200
I meant to let him hear it!

413
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,740
Alright, enough.

414
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,260
That's it.

415
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,579
I'm as good as dead to Mr. Dai.

416
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,490
Wen,

417
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,560
you have to help me.

418
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,290
Wei,

419
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,609
we are

420
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,230
in the same boat now.

421
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,810
How can I help you?

422
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,650
Mr. Wen, Mr. Wen,

423
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,510
don't play dumb with me.

424
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,680
Just now, Director Shen

425
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,340
announced in front of everyone

426
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,380
that your student, Ou Xiao'an,

427
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,180
was reinstated and asked him to redeem himself.

428
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
What does it mean?

429
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,870
This means

430
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,860
that Ou Xiao'an's abilities

431
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,390
and what he did

432
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,530
have reached Mr. Dai.

433
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,210
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

434
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,150
You're in the clear now.

435
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,410
Wei, thank you!

436
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,390
Actually, I've always been confident

437
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,610
about Ou Xiao'an.

438
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,040
I have faith in Ou Xiao'an too.

439
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,480
Yes.

440
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Alright, let's not talk about this.

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,630
Leave the 129th bomb shelter project

442
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,950
to Li Shaotang,

443
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,770
which means

444
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,160
putting

445
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,140
all of Chongqing's people

446
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,770
in a major suspect's hands.

447
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,110
How can we do that?

448
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,900
You're right.

449
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,400
We can't.

450
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,180
So, we have to send your men there

451
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,560
to supervise them.

452
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,460
If anything happens over there,

453
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,440
you have to tell me immediately

454
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,870
so that I can be prepared.

455
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,910
Wei,

456
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,200
is it your idea

457
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,000
to send my men to supervise them?

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,910
Of course.

459
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
I thought Miao

460
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,290
took the liberty of making the decision herself.

461
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,260
I did tell Miao about these.

462
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes. Yes.

463
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,610
Yes, she should listen to you.

464
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,210
Yes.

465
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,850
Don't worry.

466
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,090
If anything happens,

467
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,510
I won't hide it from you.

468
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,900
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

469
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,420
You're welcome.

470
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,400
We are

471
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,640
in the same boat.

472
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,390
You're right. You're right.

473
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,750
You old fox.

474
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,440
Vice Captain Feng,

475
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,650
didn't we act too hastily

476
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,770
on this?

477
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,200
At least you could have told Captain Wei

478
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,590
and Vice Captain Wen about it

479
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,890
before calling Director Shen.

480
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,020
Or you could have discussed it with me.

481
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,960
Discussed it with you?

482
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,490
About what?

483
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,730
Do you really think Mr. Dai and Director Shen

484
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,280
trust you 100%?

485
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,600
If that's the case,

486
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,110
he wouldn't have reinstated Ou Xiao'an

487
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,900
at this critical juncture!

488
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,710
Discuss it with you?

489
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,620
Congratulations, Section Chief Ou.

490
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,230
-Congratulations, Section Chief Ou.
-Congratulations, Section Chief Ou.

491
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,860
Section Chief Ou,

492
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,080
this is your desk from now on.

493
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,820
-Okay.
-If you need anything,

494
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,270
just come to the General Affairs Office to ask for it.

495
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,510
Okay, thank you.

496
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,550
Don't mention it.

497
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
Congratulations, Section Chief Ou.

498
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,440
You have to treat me to dinner tonight.

499
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,860
You're quick.

500
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,270
Dinner on me.

501
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,420
Why do you think

502
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
Director Shen prompted me back to my old position?

503
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,200
There aren't many people like you.

504
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,390
People like me?

505
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,300
What kind of person am I?

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,070
Everyone at the station

507
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,110
wants to take advantage of this opportunity

508
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,700
to get promoted.

509
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,830
That's true.

510
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Do you think

511
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,650
we are the same kind of people?

512
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,480
It doesn't matter whether we are the same kind of people or not.

513
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,640
What matters is

514
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,010
that we are all working hard for one thing.

515
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,480
Well said.

516
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,230
Look.

517
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,430
I think that Director Shen

518
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,770
doesn't trust him as much as he used to.

519
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,320
It's hard to say.

520
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,470
But I always think Ando's death

521
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,580
is too strange.

522
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,870
I'm also thinking

523
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,050
about who wanted to silence him.

524
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,510
Who was there when Ando died?

525
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,670
Is he a Japanese spy?

526
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,510
Let go of him!

527
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,310
Ou Xiao'an!

528
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,440
Ou Xiao'an, let go of him!

529
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,530
Ou Xiao'an!

530
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,890
Mr. Ou!

531
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Ando. Ando!

532
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,000
I've thought about...

533
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,170
this question.

534
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,710
It's definitely not Mao Renxing.

535
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,990
If it really was Mao Renxing,

536
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,590
the problem would be solved.

537
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm worried

538
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,270
that there is more than one Japanese spy

539
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,950
in our station.

540
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,510
Everyone here is suspicious.

541
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,130
We should keep our guard up.

542
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,740
All right, I gotta go.

543
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,940
You owe me one dinner.

544
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,330
Let's go together.

545
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,070
You just got promoted to section chief.

546
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,700
So many people are watching you.

547
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,420
Don't go.

548
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,490
Then be careful.

549
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,600
Nice clothes.

550
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,870
Sir, news from Chongqing

551
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,180
that the biochemical bombs have all been hidden.

552
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,240
The Cherry Blossom Project can be carried out anytime.

553
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,980
Did people from Shanghai reply?

554
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,350
Yes.

555
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,250
The plane will arrive at the scheduled time for you.

556
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,870
Tell Tanaka

557
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,650
that we can give the final instructions to Elk.

558
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,370
Yes!

00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,890
Take care, sir.

568
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,950
Please come in.

569
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,130
Follow her.

570
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,470
Section Chief Qin, she’s in.

571
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,810
Let's get off.

572
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,340
Check it.

573
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,120
Secretary Miao?

574
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,370
Why are you here?

575
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,880
Section Chief Qin,

576
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,490
why are you here?

577
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,770
I'm just doing a small business.

578
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,690
What's the need for all this fuss?

579
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,780
Are you

580
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,860
following me here, aren't you?

581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,280
What a coincidence.

582
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,710
Ohashi's biochemical bombs

583
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,130
are still nowhere to be found.

584
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,920
The station ordered me to investigate.

585
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,530
I just received a report

586
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,890
that someone is doing black market business.

587
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,890
So I came to see if there was any clue.

588
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't expect to see you again.

589
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,740
This is just a small business.

590
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,400
I don't think it'd have anything to do with biochemical bombs.

591
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,160
Right.

592
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,760
But people who can do business

593
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,050
in the black market

594
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
are complex.

595
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,420
Especially now,

596
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,470
when the Japanese are on the verge of defeat.

597
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,000
There are a lot of Japanese

598
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,810
and Japanese spies

599
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,940
to sell their goods.

600
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,370
Who knows

601
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,730
if someone will have something to do with Ohashi?

602
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,740
Am I right?

603
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,470
Are you suspecting me?

604
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,910
Didn't I tell you?

605
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,280
This is just a routine check.

606
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,980
Open it.

607
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,590
Such beautiful costumes.

608
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,320
Secretary Miao,

609
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,630
why are you so urgently selling it?

610
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,970
Section Chief Qin, I'll be frank with you.

611
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,370
Since Mao Renxing's case,

612
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,590
the station forbids us from doing black market business.

613
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,110
I had no choice.

614
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,840
My family is sick.

615
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,310
I need this money.

616
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,410
So,

617
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,910
could you please

618
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,820
keep it a secret, Section Chief Qin?

619
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,420
I understand. I understand.

620
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,790
Why didn't you tell me?

621
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,670
So we wouldn't have this misunderstanding.

622
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,580
How many gold bars is this box of stuff worth?

623
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,220
Five...

624
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,830
Five gold bars.

625
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,160
That expensive?

626
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,320
You're Section Chief Qin, right?

627
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,850
It has nothing to do with me.

628
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,560
Besides,

629
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,330
Ms. Miao has brought all the good stuff.

630
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,900
Look.

631
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,290
This is the Phoenix Cornet

632
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,720
that Empress Dowager Cixi gave to Tian Jiyun.

633
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,920
This is the bronze mirror of Tian Jiyun.

634
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,090
How about this?

635
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,430
Don't sell the stuff to him.

636
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,310
Sell them to me.

637
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,370
He's offering you five gold bars.

638
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,500
I'll give you eight.

639
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,760
I don't think it's a good idea.

640
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,560
My big brother

641
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,540
has a third concubine.

642
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,470
It's her birthday in a few days.

643
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,350
I was wondering what to give her.

644
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,000
Aren't you in need of money?

645
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,840
We're working at the same station. I'll help you.

646
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,600
Deal, then.

647
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I'll send the gold bars to you at the station tomorrow.

648
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,970
Keep your mouths shut, you all.

649
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,950
If anyone dares to tell anyone about what happened today,

650
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,080
don't blame me for being rude.

651
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,800
Yes.

652
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,860
It's a misunderstanding.

653
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,830
I've checked the box.

654
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,880
There's really nothing

655
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,470
revealing her identity.

656
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,590
But I can feel that

657
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,790
there was a moment

658
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,210
when she wanted to kill me.

659
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,640
If she really has something to do

660
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,960
with Ando's death,

661
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,100
she is going to be on the run

662
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,470
selling these things now.

663
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,420
I’ve asked the owner of the tea house.

664
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,140
Miao Jiang is a regular there.

665
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,090
You should stop stalking Miao Jiang for now. Let me do it.

666
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
It's a good thing you're both here.

667
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,580
Xiao'an, turn on the radio.

668
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,260
Okay.

669
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,940
Today, around 8 a.m.,

670
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,710
the U.S. Army dropped a new type of bomb

671
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,890
on Hiroshima, Japan.

672
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,350
The explosion was so powerful

673
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,020
that the former army city

674
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,900
was scorched to the ground,

675
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,340
resulting in the deaths and injuries of numerous people.

676
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,400
After this battle,

677
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,910
the Japanese people are in turmoil, and their morale is destroyed.

678
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,460
We're just days away from them throwing in the towel.

679
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,250
Our soldiers must be determined

680
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,330
and stay on high morale

681
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,280
-for the final victory.
-Great.

682
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,110
We won.

683
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,190
If a bomb

684
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,780
can be so powerful,

685
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,390
we are indeed getting closer

686
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,550
to victory.

687
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,540
A bomb.

688
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
But the problem is

689
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,870
that the missing gas bombs

690
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,010
are still putting Chongqing people at risk.

691
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,400
A single American bomb

692
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,460
can't solve all our problems.

693
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,080
Our final battle with the Japanese

694
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,240
has to rely on ourselves in the end.

695
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,550
You two, come with me.

696
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,150
Where?

697
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,310
To meet someone

698
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,200
who makes him want to tear him apart.

699
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,390
[To Secretary Miao]

700
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,680
[To Secretary Miao]

701
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,720
Xiao'an.

702
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,110
Let me introduce an old friend to you.

703
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,640
Captain Ou.

704
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,660
It's been a long time.

705
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,820
You've survived a great disaster.

706
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,370
Good fortune must be coming your way.

707
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,409
Captain Zeng,

708
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
it's all thanks to you.

709
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,610
Let's catch up.

710
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,210
Sure.

711
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Don't move.

712
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,469
Alright.

713
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,260
Let's get down to business.

714
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,120
Captain Ou.

715
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,100
I've turned to the dark side and come to you.

716
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,220
I was brainwashed

717
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,410
by Wang

718
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,710
and made a living for the Japanese.

719
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,830
But over the years,

720
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,310
I've witnessed the cruelty of the Japanese.

721
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,040
The reason I stayed there

722
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,710
was to take advantage of my position

723
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,160
and secretly work for our Party,

724
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,790
and endure the humiliation for the Party.

725
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,840
You indeed forsake darkness for light.

726
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,880
Tell us.

727
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,240
How much valuable information

728
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,330
are we getting

729
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,700
through your hard work?

730
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,850
There is a lot of information.

731
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,740
What do you want to hear, Captain Wei?

732
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,110
But I know

733
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,110
that there is a Japanese spy

734
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,710
at your Chongqing Station.

735
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,270
Man...

736
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,410
Manqiu.

737
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,690
Manqiu.

738
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,870
What's wrong,

739
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,870
Secretary Chen?

740
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,060
Don't close your eyes.

741
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,070
Hang in there.

742
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,840
You too.

743
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
We still

744
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,640
have hope

745
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,420
to get out of here alive.

746
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,410
The Party

747
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,750
will never abandon us.

748
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,120
As long as we're alive,

749
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,380
there's ho... hope.

750
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,540
How could this happen?

751
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,410
Didn't you say

752
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,630
all of them

753
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,670
have antibodies

754
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,090
to the KW30 virus?

755
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,690
What's going on with these two?

756
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,320
The experiment is still ongoing after all,

757
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,070
so we need to observe them for a while.

758
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
I took a big risk

759
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,400
to bring them out of 810

760
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,130
so that you can continue your research

761
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,740
when you return to Japan!

762
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,370
Don't tell me

763
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,010
they are worthless!

764
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,480
Yes, I understand.

765
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,590
You monsters!

766
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,780
Secretary Chen.

767
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,100
You...

768
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,960
You animals!

769
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,070
You animals!

770
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,870
You will die a horrible death!

771
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,580
Die in hell!

772
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,520
Manqiu!

773
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,260
Manqiu!

774
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,600
Manqiu!

775
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,360
Manqiu!

776
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,380
You'd better tell the truth.

777
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,110
Of course. My pledge of loyalty to the Party.

778
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,260
The code name of this Japanese spy

779
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,120
is Elk.

780
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,330
He did many things for Ohashi.

781
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,880
Think about it.

782
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,680
Such an important person.

783
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,040
The Japanese must have contacted him directly.

784
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,250
And only Ohashi

785
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,650
and his contact know his real identity,

786
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,550
while I only know his code name,

787
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,510
not his actual name.

788
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,960
What did he do for the Japanese?

789
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,680
The Japanese got the list of the Shanghai District of NBIS

790
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
from this man.

791
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,330
By the way, Captain Ou,

792
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,380
you won't forget this, right?

793
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,730
A few days after Captain Ou was arrested,

794
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,020
the Japanese used this list

795
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:01,000
and wiped out the intelligence network of NBIS

796
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,930
in the Shanghai District.

797
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,460
I did this for the Japanese.

798
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,220
But I had no choice at that time.

799
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,380
One thing

800
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,580
I need to clarify for Captain Ou.

801
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,010
When he was in the prison on Scott Road,

802
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,020
he showed great resilience

803
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,160
and didn't say a word

804
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,060
despite Ohashi's tyrannical abuse.

805
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,670
I can definitely

806
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,590
prove it.

807
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,270
Wei, listen.

808
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,710
Cut the crap.

809
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,880
Can you say something valuable?

810
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,750
Later, Ohashi published

811
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,840
Captain Ou's declaration of turning to Wang Jingwei in the newspaper

812
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,330
because he wanted to

813
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,340
shift the blame for the leak of

814
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,140
the Shanghai intelligence network to Captain Ou

815
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,940
in order to protect Elk.

816
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,130
Do you think

817
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,340
this man is valuable?

818
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,590
Say something we don't know.

819
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,160
What else do you know besides his code name?

820
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,250
That's not all.

821
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,810
I also know

822
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,380
that Ohashi had already started the Cherry Blossom Project

823
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,810
when he evacuated from 810.

824
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,180
When he evacuated from 810,

825
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,170
he didn't bring you with him.

826
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,960
How do you know

827
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,530
about such a secret plan?

828
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,060
After Ohashi went to Burma,

829
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,150
I was able to access some information

830
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,350
from him about the Expeditionary Forces Headquarters

831
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,230
in the Shanghai organization.

832
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,640
However,

833
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,800
I also know

834
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,020
that Ohashi is now

835
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,710
in Guizhou.

836
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,480
Ohashi contacted Japan's

837
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,950
Expeditionary Forces Headquarters in Shanghai

838
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,320
to arrange  a plane to pick him up in Guizhou.

839
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm also the one who did this.

840
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,000
Besides those biochemical experts,

841
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,040
he also brought a group of prisoners from 810 with him.

842
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,710
Why did he take the prisoners?

843
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,290
I don't know that.

844
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,070
The information from three days ago

845
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,360
said so.

846
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,690
Three days have passed, and you're telling us now?

847
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,950
Ohashi would already have fled by plane!

848
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,630
No. No.

849
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,270
I'm pretty sure

850
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,720
that Ohashi

851
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,980
must be in Guizhou.

852
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,430
[August, Showa 20]

853
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,550
This is the date they agreed on.

854
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,090
[August, Showa 20]

855
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,070
The plane will pick him up in Guizhou in four days.

856
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,760
Otherwise,

857
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,890
how would I dare to come to Chongqing?

858
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,600
[August, Showa 20]

859
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,160
[18th Airspace Headquarters]

860
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,440
Captain Wei,

861
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,760
isn't what I said

862
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,250
enough

863
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,130
to show my loyalty to the anti-Japanese cause?

864
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,600
What are the exact coordinates and location of the plane?

865
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,130
I want to talk to Captain Wei

866
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,070
about this alone.
