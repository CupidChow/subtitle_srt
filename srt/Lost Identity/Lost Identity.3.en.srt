there were students causing trouble out there?

194
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,560
Did you

195
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,010
let them come in to hide?

196
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,730
It's a fabric shop

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,960
in which I sell silk fabrics.

198

My customers

199
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,860
are all officers and their wives.

200
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,980
Why would students come here?

201
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,510
I've checked upstairs. There's no one.

202
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,000
What about the warehouse?

203
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,860
The rent is so high nowadays.

204
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,410
These silk fabrics

205
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,860
take a year or more to sell.

206
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,490
How can I afford a warehouse?

207
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,500
Well, sirs,

208
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,820

209
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,680
There's no one.

210
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,190
There's no one.

211
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,650

215
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm sorry, Qiushui.

216
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,130
I didn't expect their search range to be...

217
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,290
If I hadn't heard the gunshots,

218
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,420
I wouldn't have known something this big was happening.

219
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,970
The organization has no idea

220
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,420
about today's Student Federation activity.

221
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,060
It was an assassination operation initiated by the Student Federation.

222
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,410
They said today is

223
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,580
the best chance to assassinate Ohashi Kazuya.

224
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,420
We're just responsible for rescuing people.

225
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,370
Just?

226
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,790
You're all well-educated students.

227
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,740
I thought I didn't need to explain a lot of things.

228
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,780
Qiushui,

229
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,620
I know

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,610
that killing one or two Japanese

231
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,020
may not change anything.

232
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,500
But I can't just sit idly by

233
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,020
and watch my classmates

234
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,460
die at the hands of those people

235
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,900

236
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,220
I'm just trying to save people.

237
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,250
I just want to save as many as I can.

238
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,980
Am I wrong to save people?

239
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,130
Most of the time,

240
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,650
we need to stay calm.

241
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,310
There are many ways to save people.

242
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,730
Sacrificing yourself in vain

243
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,060
is the most foolish one.

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900

Chief Ohashi, everything has been done as you instructed.

Those rioting students

248
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,180
were all our own people whom I arranged in advance.

249
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,930
As for those suicide attackers,

250
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,530
they did it in service of the Empire of Japan...

251
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,900

I'm sorry!

256
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,890
I'm sorry, Chief Ohashi.

257
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,820
From what I saw in that crowd,

258
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,610
there were indeed students causing riots.

259
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,360
Yes, I arrested some of them.

260
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,560
There were some from St. John's,

261
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,970
some from Aurora University School of Medicine,

262
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,180
and some from St. Mary's Girls' Middle School.

263
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,380
All of them have participated

264
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,900
in the reading group of Ye Xuanmin's works.

265
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,460
According to this list,

266

I arrested a bunch of suspects.

After investigation,

268
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,410
I found that behind this,

269
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,730
there must be someone manipulating.

This Ye Xuanmin

271
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,700
has published quite a few reactionary articles.

272

274
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,150

If he were just a literary figure,

276
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,980

Everyone we arrested

is a student,

but the skills of those who attacked you

349
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
seem beyond

350
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,130

Thank you.

384
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,780
Thank you, Chief.

385
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,170
By the way,

386
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,420
I heard that you are good at playing the piano.

387
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,770
Someone asked me

388
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,690
to give this to you.

389
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,130
Yes.

390

392
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,990
I heard that besides me,

393
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,670
you also saved a girl that day.

394
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,530
Yes.

395
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,760
She specifically asked people to find out about you

396
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,650
and insisted on giving you a gift

397
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,110
to express her gratitude.

398
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
Thank you, Chief.

399
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,340
Take it.

400
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,620
It's just a little girl's gratitude.

401
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,860
Chief,

402
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,710
please convey my thanks

403
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,780

404
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,290
By the way,

405
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
I checked your file this afternoon.

406
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,920
You defected from Chongqing to Shanghai

407
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,840
in the 14th year of Showa.

408
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,140
It's been two years, hasn't it?

409
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,760
Yes.

410
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,190
I was at the NBIS Station in Chongqing at the time,

411
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,750
but there were some disagreements between the station and me,

412
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,580
so,

413
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,040
I left.

414
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,940
It was just some disagreements?

415
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,250
Yes.

416
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,380
You've killed two of your NBIS colleagues.

417
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,900
I didn't expect you to be so ruthless.

418
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,690
Chief,

419
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,460
at that time,

420
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,870
there was really no other choice.

421
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Alright.

422
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,900
Since you can't go back,

423
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,380
stay here with me then.

424
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,090
Yes.

425
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,940
Here. Take it. Take care.

426
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,620
Okay.

427

433
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,460
The deposit you gave me was more than enough.

434
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,130

Was the deposit enough? Did you advance money for me?

441

No, I didn't.

442

we should meet this person if we have a chance.

466

I haven't met this person either. The higher-ups arranged this person.

467

472

Do we need to send it back?

474
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,810
Yes. Have you memorized it?

475

Ohashi has been asking me

476
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,260
about my defection from the NBIS these past two days.

477
