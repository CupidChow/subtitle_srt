I will.

380
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,770
And the country is in crisis.

381
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,200
If you have a big wedding,

382
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,830
people will talk behind.

383
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,640
So,

384
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,560
I want to ask

385
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,170
if you can

386
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,270

387
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,540
I understand.

388
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,300
I'll listen to you.

389
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,910
Indeed, we haven't defeated the Japanese.

390
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,330
It's too early to have our wedding.

391
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,710
The country is in crisis.

392
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,570
We should look at the big picture.

393
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,380
It's good that you think so.

394
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,910
Can you tell Jingxian

395
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,780
it's your idea

396
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,730
to delay the wedding?

397
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,130
Otherwise,

398
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
she'll be mad at me.

399
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,050
I understand.

400
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,370
You said Li Shaotang

401
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,010
wanted to burn the documents?

402
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,920
We were discovered by some Japanese soldiers

403
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,930
and had nowhere to go.

404
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,890
He thought we couldn't let Ohashi have them,

405
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,420
even if we had to destroy it.

406
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,330
What happened next?

407
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,900
Did you have the documents

408
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
or did he have it?

409
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,710
I found him and the documents in the bathroom.

410
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,630
After getting rid of those Japanese soldiers,

411
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,030
I was afraid he'd be found again,

412
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,820
so I kept the documents with me.

413
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,750
I gave them back to Li Shaotang

414
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,850
when we arrived in Chongqing,

415
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,060
and asked him to give them to Vice Captain Wen.

416
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,300
So,

417
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,800
the documents you brought back to the NBIS

418
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,430
were already incomplete, right?

419
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,550
Only a small part of them were burned.

420
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,790
Most of them remained.

421
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,770

422
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,610
Yes.

425
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,510

Otherwise,

444
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,220
why would I bother looking for you?

445
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,830
Anyway, if you ask me,

446
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,660
I think Li Shaotang is good.

He died and left all of this behind.

565
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
took part in the Sundial Operation.

566
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,780
And

567
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,170
he escorted Li Shaotang back to Chongqing.

568
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
That must be what they talked about.

569
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,070
So Ou Xiao'an

570
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,400
is still going after Li Shaotang.

571
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,900
Let’s wait.

572
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,550
See what he will do.

573
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,630
By the way, Captain Wei,

574
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,630
there's something I want to discuss with you.

575
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,560
Don't say that. Just instruct me.

576
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,190
I've been taking over your meeting room

577
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,580
ever since I got here.

578
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,000
You can't have meetings

579
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,300
while I'm in here.

580
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,400
Maybe

581
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,520
you could find a room for me

582
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,710
so you can have your meeting room back.

583
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,110
You mean...

584
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,230
You…

585
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,860
You want an office.

586
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,240
We have no choice.

587
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,240
I can't leave under the circumstances.

588
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,200
No problem.

589
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,700
No problem.

590
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,230
I'm afraid our Chongqing Station

591
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,929
is unworthy of your talents.

592
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,880
You are much more valuable

593
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,219
when you are around the boss.

594
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,080
Right?

595
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,270
Captain Wei,

596
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,610
do you want me to leave?

597
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,570
I didn't mean that.

598
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,429
I mean…

599
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,500
Director Shen,

600
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,550
you misunderstood Captain Wei.

601
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,710
He tells us every day

602
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,449
that he hopes you can stay here

603
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,530
a while longer.

604
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,639
So that you can guide our work

605
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,310
and we can learn from you.

606
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,030
Right, Captain Wei?

607
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,290
Right.

608
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,719
We say that all the time.

609
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,790

611
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,219
the big office that Captain Wei

612
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,250
likes the most.

613
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,510
You take good care of Director Shen

614
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,420

615
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,150
Go.

616
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,570
Got it.

617
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,200
What Wen said.

618
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,960
Thank you, everyone.

619
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,230
It's okay.

620
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,350
We all work for the Kuomintang.

621
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,610
It doesn't matter where we work.

622
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,730
Right.

623
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,070
Come in.

624
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,790
Miss Qin, how are you?

625
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,530
-Long time no see. -Hello.

626
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,820
Dr. Rus, this is Ou Xiao'an,

627

who I mentioned on the phone.

628
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,900
Brain specialist, George Rus.

629
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,320
-Hello. -Hello.

630
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,910
Dr. Rus has been in China for many years.

631
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,110
He was our professor

632
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,090
at the Aurora University before Shanghai fell.

633
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,260
Very impressive.

634

These

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,330
are the equipment I brought from America.

636
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,970
They have a good effect

637
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,100
on brain damage.

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,510

639

I can only

640
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
try.

641
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,820
Haste does not bring success.

642
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,780
We can't rush it.

643
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm afraid he can't take it.

644
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,700
Don't worry.

645
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,600
As long as he gets his memory back asap,

646
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,790
his can take it.

647
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,650
No problem, right?

648
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,460
Am I allowed to have a problem?

No.

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,440
I'll give him a check-up today,

652
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,840
and I'll make a treatment plan

653
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,060
based on his physical condition, okay?

654
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,230
Okay, thank you.

-Okay. -try to remember things.

I'm not sure, but I think

664

Yes.

I'm afraid if you continue your hunger strike, your fever won't go away

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,960

756
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,610
Do you understand?

757
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,350
Yes.

758
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,190
Yes.

759
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,080
You can trust me.

760
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,120
We have the same goal.

761
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,470
Yes, I know.

762
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Clean carefully.

763
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,180
Hurry.

764
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,440
Miao,

765
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,640
Captain Wei’s new office

766
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,990
is really magnificent.

767
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,660
It's Director Shen's.

768
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,510
It's Director Shen's?

769
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Why is it Director Shen's?

770
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,520
Director Shen is having

771
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,990
an office here?

772
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,680
Here at the Chongqing Station,

773
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,090
Captain Wei is our boss.

774
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,000
What does he mean?

775
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,210
Obviously, he wants to make him a figurehead.
