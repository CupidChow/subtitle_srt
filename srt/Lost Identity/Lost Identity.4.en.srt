He's here for me.

I'll go inform Manager Lou right away.

remember

you say you bought them in front of the Xinyue Ball Room.

28

I heard

38
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,960
that Captain Ou often comes here, right?

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,790
So you and Captain Ou are colleagues.

40
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,720
That's right. He comes here often.

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Where is he now?

42
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,880

it can get you out of the habit of lying.

No.

166
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,750
I am.

167
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,310
Who is your downline?

168

169
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,190
I think he said that you're his downline.

170
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,900
There is no use in resisting.

171
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,350
People's wills can't beat science.

172
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,900

173
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,350
Who are your upline and downline?

174
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,430

Why are you dressed like this?

196
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,740
It's easier for underground work.

197
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,300
The dress is just a facade.

198

that make you a real underground worker.

200
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,470

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,540
Today,

383
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,790
I'll come to the bogus government

384
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,060
on behalf of everyone!

385
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,860
Down with the bogus government!

386
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,750
Down with the bogus government!

387
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,460
Down with the bogus government!

388
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,260
Down with the bogus government!

389
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,150
Down with the bogus government!

390
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,310
As you all know,

391
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,380
since April 9th,

392
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,300
Shanghai has been shrouded

393
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,340
in the despairing White Terror.

394
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,460
Students and teachers.

395
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,760
They just said what they wanted to say

396
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,940
and thought about what you wanted.

397
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,990
On our own land,

398
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,180
find a way out

399
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,020
for our country!

400
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,660
What's wrong with that?

401
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,970
The Japanese once considered

402
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,780
changing Shanghai to Dadao City.

403
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,060
They thought that by doing this,

404
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,670
the children of this city

405
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,950
would forget their motherland

406
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,900
and follow the crowd.

407
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,150
But they are wrong!

408
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,260
We never forget who we are!

409
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,230
And we'd never acknowledge our enemy as our father!

410
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,390
Down with Japanese imperialism!

411
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,180
Down with the bogus government!

412
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,260
Down with Japanese imperialism!

413
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,220
Down with the bogus government!

414
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,350
Down with Japanese imperialism!

415
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,260
Down with the bogus government!

416
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,580
Protect Mr. Ye!

417
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,510
Down with Japanese imperialism!

418
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,150
Down with the bogus government!

419
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,790
Down with Japanese imperialism!

420
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,380
Down with the bogus government!

421
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,190
Down with Japanese imperialism!

422
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,830
Down with the bogus government!

423
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,690
Down with Japanese imperialism!

424
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,380
Down with the bogus government!

425
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,240
Down with Japanese imperialism!

426
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,060
Down with the bogus government!

427
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,920
Down with Japanese imperialism!

428
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,070
Stop!

429
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,940
Stop!

430
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,110
Please spare these students.

431
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,790
I'll go with you.

432
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,150
Students,

433
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,740
listen to me.

434
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Today,

435
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,870
I saw a group of Chinese people

436
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,820
with a strong backbone and an uncompromising spirit.

437
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,300
You are all great!

438
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,790
But I still hope

439
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,820
that you can stay calm

440
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,900
and never make

441
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,260
unnecessary bloodshed and sacrifice.

442
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,140
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

443
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,980
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

444
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,260
Mr. Ye!

445
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,150
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

446
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,460
Be careful, Mr. Ye!

447
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,820
Mr. Ye, you can't go.

448
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
Mr. Ye.

449
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,020
You can't go, Mr. Ye!

450
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Mr. Ye!

451
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,470
You can't go!

452
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,390
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

453
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,550
Let's go.

454
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,380
Thank you, sir.

455
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,760
Idiot!

456
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:18,990
Who asked you to arrest him

457
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,120
in front of so many foreign reporters?

458
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,740
Sir,

459
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,220
that's Ye Xuanmin.

460
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,630
Do you think Ye Xuanmin is as stupid as you?

461
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,350
A reactionary writer

462
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,430
who has never appeared in public

463
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,220
dared to stand in front of you,

464
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,950
which means he's ready for what comes next.

465
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,470
So many reporters.

466
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,100
Tomorrow, the front pages of newspapers worldwide

467
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,030
will be about Ye Xuanmin's arrest.

468
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,350
Tell me.

469
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,550
Even if you catch him, what can you do with him?

470
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,790
All it takes is one small leak,

471
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,220
and all my hope will be destroyed.

472
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,480
Do you understand?

473
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,550
What should we do about Ye Xuanmin now?

474
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,750
Ask Ou Xiao'an to see him.

475
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,400
Yes.

476
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,720
Wait.

477
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,320
Tell everyone in the institute

478
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,750
that no one shall leave

479
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,870
without my permission.

480
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,100
Yes.

481
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,610
Mr. Ye,

482
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,260
what you did today

483
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,400
puts the Japanese in a very difficult position.

484
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,230
So, they sent

485
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,980
those Chinese like you

486
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,230
to arrest

487
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,350
those unarmed students?

488
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,230
It has nothing to do with me.

489
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,070
Now it's Chief Ohashi who has given in.

490
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,860
He'd like to hear your thoughts.

491
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,300
My thought is simple.

492
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,630
Release those students now.

493
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,020
Then am I to understand

494
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,500
that

495
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,220
as long as those students are released,

496
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,670
you will go out and clarify the misunderstanding

497
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,950
between us to the reporters?

498
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,470
Misunderstanding?

499
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,230
You call this a misunderstanding?

500
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,990
Mr. Ye,

501
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,560
let me show you a way out.

502
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,140
Open your eyes and see the situation.

503
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,780
Now you're in Shanghai,

504
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,270
in Japanese territory.

505
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,200
You want to keep those students alive,

506
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,090
so you have to show them some respect.

507
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,790
As long as you can persuade the reporters outside to leave,

508
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,850
you can make any conditions you want.

509
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,590
My condition is simple.

510
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,710
Release those students

511
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,590
now.

512
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,870
Let Mr. Ye go!

513
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,500
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

514
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,740
Mr. Ye!

515
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,740
He's out!

516
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,980
Mr. Ye!

517
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,460
Mr. Ye, are you alright?

518
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,550
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

519
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,870
Listen to me.

520
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,950
Quiet down, everyone.

521
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Listen to me!

522
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,150
Please calm down, everyone.

523
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,470
Please...

524
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,600
Fellow journalists,

525
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,990
regarding the security of Shanghai,

526
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,440
the safety of students,

527
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,970
and the lives of the people,

528
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,380
the Empire of Japan and Mr. Ye

529
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,120
share the same concern.

530
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,850
I invited Mr. Ye here this time

531
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,340
to discuss how to better

532
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,990
maintain peace in Shanghai with him.

533
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,310
I really hate to see

534
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,980
such a tense situation.

535
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,540
I hope you can understand

536
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,540
that China and the Empire of Japan

537
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,500
are friendly neighbors across the sea.

538
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,960
We are close to each other.

539
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,030
We are friends working together

540
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,180
to achieve the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere!

541
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,590
We will seek

542
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,430
peace for Shanghai

543
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,860
and the happiness of the people ourselves.

544
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
Chinese people who are hardworking

545
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,620
and don't want to be enslaved

546
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,830
will never accept

547
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,110
any act of invasion

548
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,460
under the guise of goodwill.

549
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,270
Well said, Mr. Ye! Well said!

550
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,790
Well said, Mr. Ye!

551
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,500
Well said, Mr. Ye!

552
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,710
Good. Very good.

553
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,750
Mr. Ye.

554
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,870
Well said.

555
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,890
I won't shake hands with the invaders.

556
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,710
Mr. Ye is right!

557
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,500
Can I leave now?

558
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,510
-Of course.
-Mr. Ye!

559
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,150
Please.

560
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,180
Well said, Mr. Ye!

561
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,910
Well said, Mr. Ye!

562
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,940
Everyone, let's go back.

563
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,950
Tell him.

564
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,480
Keep an eye on Ye and arrest him immediately.

565
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,660
Don't move. Don't move.

566
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,989
What are you looking at? So fierce.

567
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,100
Why do you think the Japanese

568
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,560
are arresting people like crazy these days?

569
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,739
It's all because of that guy.

570
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,750
He was the one who told those agents on Scott Road

571
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,860

579

In order to protect the students in the march,

585
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,950
Mr. Ye confronted the Japanese.

586
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,190
Several agents

587
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,630
took him away

588
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,170
in the name of negotiation.

589
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,060
Strangely,

590
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,110
they released him in the end.

591
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,540
But after that,

592
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,510
he went missing.

593
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,140
We searched everywhere for him,

594
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,940
but we couldn't find him.

595
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,940
We haven't heard from him until now.

596
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,530
Has the Japanese already discovered

597
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,130
Secretary Chen's identity?

600

601

Hello, Mr. Ye.

602
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,820
Have a seat.

603
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,280
Come on.

604
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,420
Mr. Ye,

605
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,980
we've always been respectful to men of literature and writing.

606
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,350
We invited you here

607
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,710
because we'd like to ask you

608
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,590
some questions in private.

609
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,270
As long as you answer,

610
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,390
you can go back.

611

Mr. Ye,

613
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,550

614
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,790
What do you mean?

615
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,380
Recently, some communists suddenly appeared around me.

616
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,350
They've done something that really upsets me

617
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,860
and gives me a headache.

618
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,870
I got some intel and I suddenly have a feeling

619
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,020
that those people came to Shanghai

620
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,510
at the same time as you did.

621
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,580
Mr. Ye,

622
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,620
do you believe in coincidences?

623
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,030
Mr. Ye.

624
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,980
Do you know this person?

625
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,310
Then this man

626
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,050
should be familiar to you.

627
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,210
Sir.

628
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,350
Excuse me,

629
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,770
where did you buy your plums?

630
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,220
I'll see you at 51 Sauce Garden Lane

631
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,630
in two days, at half past nine in the evening.

632
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,550
Take a bag of plums with you.

633
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,710
If someone asks where you bought them,

634
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,450
you say you bought them in front of the Xinyue Ball Room.

635
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,250

639

you say they're very sour.

640
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,500
Very sour.

I wanted to go to Lou Mingyuan that day,

651

but when I went to Oz Ball Room,

652
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,540
I knew something had happened when the lights were replaced.

653
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,210
Because we had agreed beforehand

654
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,460
that he'd change the lights

655
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,300

I couldn't steal the materials that day.

662
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,030
So, I set the fire on purpose

663
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,490
and fled amidst the chaos.

664

665
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,990

666

Have you been tailed

669
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,260
when you went to the Oz Ball Room?

670
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,670
Lou Mingyuan taught me how to counter-stalk.

671
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,270

672
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,460
