Give me a rifle.

One o'clock. Bottom of the bamboo grove.

Aim.

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,530
Shoot!

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,660
Go!

9
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,510
Don't move.

10
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,110
Don't worry. I won't move.

11
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,500
Did Ohashi Kazuya send you here?

12
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,910
Who are you here to kill?

13
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,990
Who asked you to shoot?

14
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,030
I was saving you.

15
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,310
Who asked you to shoot?

16
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,030
I was saving you.

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,050

18
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,470
He got away.

19
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,900
Stop it. It's dangerous here.

20
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,670
Let's go!

21
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,380
Where is Mao Renxing?

22
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,310
It hurts!

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,409
You know who I am.

27
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,530
Why were the Japanese ambushing us here?

28
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,970
You were their targer.

29
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,580
Good question. I also want to know why.

30
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,110
Yet you said you weren't working for the Japanese.

31
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,990
Are you stupid?

32
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,140
I want to know too.

33
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,070
Ask the Japanese. How would I know?

34
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,260

Yamei,

42
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,030
you need to be careful with this one.

43
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,160
You've lost seven rounds in a row.

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,350
are really lucky today.

I've made all of you win.

51
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,650
I have bad luck.

52
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,220
Yeah. You're not the type to deny a debt.

53
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,950
Right.

54
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,810
Of course.

55
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,260
Sisters, I don't have any more money on me.

56
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,620
If you like

57
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,040
these little things,

58
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,970
just take them all and consider them my debt.

59
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,410
Yamei,

60
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,540
we just play mahjong

61
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,640
to entertain ourselves.

62
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,900
Why are you paying you debt

63
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,620
with such valuable things?

64
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,700
You must have heard

65
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,470
what happened

66
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,860
to my husband.

67
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,310
My husband mentioned it.

68
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,950
But,

69
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,110
Mr. Qin has connections and financial resources.

70
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,390
I'm sure he can

71
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,070
settle the thing with money, right?

72
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,830
It's different this time.

73
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,310
We got into something serious this time.

74
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,790
He'll be made the fall guy.

75
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,740
If he can't

76
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,409
get through this,

77
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,230
these junk

78
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,630
will mean nothing to me.

79
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,990
You've always been nice to me.

80
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,870
I'm begging you

81
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,180
for your help.

82
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,620
You husbands

83
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,750
can talk to

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,220
the chairman.

85
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm begging you,

86
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,180
please help us.

87
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,340
Well…

88
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,590
What do you mean?

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,010
I lost money in our game.

90
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,640
It has nothing to do with me asking for your help.

91
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,690
Yamei,

92
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
it's not that I don't want to help you.

93
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,140
But we can't decide

94
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,870
what those men do at work.

95
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,580
Yeah.

96
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,930
-Yeah.
-Right?

97
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,500
I understand what you mean.

98
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,680
My husband wants to

99
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,840
give your families

100
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,390
40% shares of Jifeng

101

102
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,860
We'll also take care of

103
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,390
the money to buy off people.

104
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,090
We just want your husbands

105
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,030
to show us a way out.

106

107
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,170
You're making me sleepy.

108
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,370

110
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,510
Colonel Zhou,

111
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,780
the 20,000 dollars

112
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,470
is my humble contribution

113
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,870
to the war.

114
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,190
Also, I promise

115
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,650
my Jifeng company

116
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,340
will donate two more C47 planes.

117
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Chairman Qin is really generous.

118
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460
Now the Kuomintang needs

119
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,030
patriotic businessmen like you

120
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,420
to contribute to the war.

121
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,260
Colonel,

122
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,220
the business Mr. Dai and I do

123
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,560
is indeed ugly.

124
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,000
But you know what?

125
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
We've put more money

126
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,240
into the intelligence and activity fees.

127
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,180
You should know

128
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,590
that is a lot of money.

129
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,740
The Kuomintang can’t afford it.

130
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,780
Mr. Dai has to

131
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,410
to find a way out.

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Yes, he is corrupt.

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,760
But who isn’t?

134
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,180
But I promise you Mr. Dai

135
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,890
has put most of the money

136
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,960
into work.

137
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,650
So I hope you can put in a good word for us

138
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,830
in front of the chairman.

139
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,940
Mr. Qin,

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,720
let me be candid.

141
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,780
Actually,

142
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,950
if you had told Miss Qin about it earlier,

143
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,450
she wouldn't have misunderstood

144
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,710
Mao Renxing was working for the Japanese.

145
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,230
She wouldn't have let me

146
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,380
go over Director Dai

147
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,700
to the chairman.

148
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,310
Moqing is loyal to the Kuomintang.

149
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,370
As her brother,

150
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,250
I shouldn't tell her things like that.

151
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,080
So she doesn't know anything

152
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,790
about my business.

153
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,220
I believe you.

154
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,900
But you really

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,510
walked into it.

156
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,720
The chairman wants to make a deterrent

157
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,400
to warn Director Dai.

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,960
But he knows

159
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,450
he needs

160
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,330
Dai Li for intelligence.

161
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,090
So,

162
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,530
as long as there is a decent explanation,

163
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,820
he will

164
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,630
be fine.

165
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,220
So will you.

166
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,860
Colonel Zhou,

167
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,500
I'm relieved

168
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,460
to hear you say that.

169
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,940
Have some tea.

170
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,740
Have some tea.

172
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,550
Are you Mr. Li?

173
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,700
Yes.

174
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,830
We're from the Military Committee.

175
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,070
We have an order

176
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,910
to take over

the five truckloads you brought back

179

and transport them to the military warehouses.

180
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,910
What about the prisoner?

181
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,140
Take him back to Chongqing Station

182
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,600
and let Special Commissioner Shen handle the investigation.

183
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,670
Got it.

184
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,700
Good. I can finally have a good sleep.

185

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,940
Vice Captain.

196
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Vice Captain Wen.

197
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,330
Vice Captain Feng.

198
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,500
I want to report

199
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,900
Qin Jiru.

200
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,060
Qin Moqing,

201
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,780
go home and ask your brother

202
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,530
whether the people, the trucks and the goods

203
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,130
all belong to him.

204
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,620
He even paid for the paint on the trucks.

205
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,310
I work for them.

206
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,980
Don't act like a crazy dog.

207
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,110
Save some dignity for yourself.

208
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,420
Director Shen.

209
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,880
Director Shen.

210
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Director Shen.

211
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Director Shen, what are you doing?

212
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,750
Take the prisoner Mao Renxing away.

213
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,650
Director Shen, you know

214
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,940
I work for the boss!

215
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,150
You know that!

216
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,350
How dare you mention the boss?

217
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,790
Take him away.

218
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,290
Shen Congwu!

219
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,830
Don't force me!

220
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,450
I'll confess to everything if you force me!

221
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,180
The transportation permit...

222
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,760
Shaotang!

223
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,349
Shaotang, what's wrong?

224
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,270
Come here!

225
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,660
He's badly injured.

226
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,569
Hurry. Send him to the infirmary.

227
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,410
Hurry up!

228
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,460
Shaotang.

229
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,710
What is it? Are you okay?

230
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,240
I'll go get the doctor.

231
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,410
Jingxian.

232
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,380
Shaotang.

233
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,360
Tell me what's wrong with you.

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
Jingxian.

235
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,100
I'm here.

236
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,110
Did I hurt you?

237
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,420
I'm fine. Lie down.

238
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
Don't move.

239
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,350
Look at you.

240
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,110
You sweating so much.

241
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,500
Are you feeling okay?

242
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,720
Have you been here this whole time?

243
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,860
Some people from your station came by.

244
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,540
Thank you.

245
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,770
You must be tired.

246
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,470
Go back and rest.

247
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,780
Come on.

248
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm not tired at all.

249
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,870
I'm your fiancee.

250
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,830
If I don't take care of you,

251
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,100
who will?

252
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,510
Jingxian.

253
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,970
I had a dream just now.

254
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,780
I dreamt I almost didn't make it back.

255
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,580
That I could never see you again.

256
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,670
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,030
Don't you remember?

258
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,860
You promised me.

259
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,220
You said you'd work as a teacher

260
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,440
and teach nature in our school

261
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,830
when we won the war.

262
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,790
You weren't lying, were you?

263
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,330
Of course not.

264
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,920
Shaotang,

265
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,740
when you recover,

266
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,480
let's live an ordinary life.

267
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,630
Okay?

268
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,920
Okay.

269
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,610
Section Chief Li's wound is deep in the muscle layer.

270
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,260
It's become inflamed because it wasn't

271
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,500
stitched up in time.

272
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,750
So the wound is why

273
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,130
he has a fever

274
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,870
and fainted?

275
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,550
It has something to do with his fatigue for days.

276
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,460
Doctor,

277
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,270
he said he was cut

278
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,090
by a bayonet.

279
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,470
Like this one.

280
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,260
Do you think his wound

281
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,820
is cut by this knife?

282
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,820
I'm not sure.

283
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,780
But it is a sharp weapon.

284
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,800
Similar to this dagger.

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,830
He was injured on his left abdomen.

286
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,020
If the enemy wanted to kill him,

287
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,390
he should've stabbed him with the bayonet

288
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,640
instead of scratching him, right?

289
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,340
Well…

290
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,490
Ou Xiao'an.

291
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,460
What do you mean?

292
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,410
Doctor, Shaotang is awake.

293
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,890
But his wound still hurts.

294
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,400
Please take a look at him.

295
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,110
Okay.

296
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,830
That agent told me

297
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,260
Shaotang was with you

298
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,250
when he got hurt.

299
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,330
But now, you're suspecting him

300
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,530
and investigate him?

301
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,630
Do you think

302
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,220
it's fair to Shaotang?

303
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,480
I know very well

304
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,030
what kind of person he is.

305
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,320
He's my fiance and a good man.

306
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,310
I hope...

307
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,180
you can trust him.

I'll get you a passage permit,

341

and you have to make the NBIS think

342
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,630
Mao Renxing is killed by Ohashi

343
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,840

00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,300

he's the mole in the NBIS.

346
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,620

347
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,320
he came back alive.

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,580
But they didn't find anything.

385
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,160
If they were Ohashi's soldiers,

386
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
he might be in Guizhou.

387
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,900
Li Shaotang,

388
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,070
the boss asked me to tell you

389
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,350
he appreciates

390
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,670
your talent.

391
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,510
He also knows

392
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,100
you're loyal to the Kuomintang.

393
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,510
But you didn't

394
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,140
do a good job this time.

395
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,060
That wasn't something a smart person should've done.

396
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,150
If only you had told me

397
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,990
the whole truth

398
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,140
on the phone.

399
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,730
I should've told you what?

400
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,130
That Mao Renxing had been smuggling goods for the boss

401
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,530
for more than half a year?

402
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,960
Do you have any idea how much time

403
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,490
and energy it cost us?

404
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,350
The Cherry Blossom Project…

405
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,220
Nonsense!

406
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
You know nothing!

407
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,330
The boss doesn't let you get involved

408
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,590
because he wants you to do something big.

409
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,540
Although

410
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,260
there'll be an internal investigation inside the NBIS,

411
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
Mo Renxing will go to the Military Court.

412
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,900
The Military Committee will send someone

413
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,580
to talk to you and Ou Xiao'an.

414
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,390
It'll be a mere formality.

415
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,500
But at this critical moment,

416
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,300
you should know

417
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,420
what to say or not to say

418
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,300
in front of others.

419
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,020
Understand?

420
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,460
Yes.

421
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,750
Take care.

422
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,190
Director Shen, Ou Xiao'an...

423
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,720
He's none of your business.

424
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,870
Ohashi's goal

425
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,840
is to deliver the last batch of gas bombs

426
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
safely.

427
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
He didn't need to such a conspicuous thing.

428
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,300
Indeed, he didn't need to attack you

429
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,470
at the risk of

430
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,580
exposing himself.

431
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,390
Maybe it was the passing remnants of the Japanese army.

432
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,520
Maybe it has nothing to do with Ohashi.

433
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,420
The Japanese

434
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,230
were targeting Mao Renxing.

435
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,750
If Mao Renxing

436
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,870
only smuggled a few trucks of goods,

437
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,130
why did the Japanese want to kill him?

438
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,580
Think again.

439
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,820
Did you miss

440
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,440
any important information?

441
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,580
Have some tea.

442
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,500
Mao Renxing did this on his own.

443
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,490
I've never liked

444
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,730
Mao Renxing.

445
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,970
But I don't think it's that simple.

446
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,190
Sir,

447
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,810
where is Mao Renxing being held now?

448
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,440
Why don't we interrogate him again?

449
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,380
He is now in the detention center of the Military Court.

450
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,380
The goods

451
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,940
is already in the Military Commission's warehouse.

452
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,670
It's already in the warehouse?

453
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,180
Are they closing the case?

454
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,770
What are you thinking?

455
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,710
Before Mao Renxing was taken away,

456
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
he said the trucks he used to smuggle

457
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,190
didn't belong to the NBIS.

458
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,650
They were converted trucks of Jifeng Group.

459
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,360
Since my brother and Mao Renxing

460
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,690
could smuggle goods in the NBIS's trucks,

461
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,020
why couldn't Ohashi have used

462
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,060
the NBIS's trucks

463
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,670
to deliver gas bombs?

464
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,790
Xiao'an,

465
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,510
you checked those trucks

466
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,390
when they passed the checkpoint.

467
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,820
Could they have swapped the goods

468
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,550
after passing the checkpoint?

469
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,310
If they swapped the goods

470
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,680
after the checkpoint,

471
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
there'll be a big mess.

472
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,520
You two need to stop analyzing.

473
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,740
Listen carefully.

474
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,500
The chairman

475
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,460
sent his trusted subordinate,

476
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,830
Director Shen, to investigate this

477
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,940
because he values Mr. Dai.

478
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,940
What does it mean?

479
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,220
It means the chairman

480
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,220
doesn't want to look into it.

481
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,260
Director Shen asked me to pass a message to you.

482
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,980
If the superiors ask about it in the future,

483
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,220
you must say

484
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,870
Mao Renxing did it on his own.

485
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,460
No one else was involved.

486
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,390
He stole

487
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
the transportation permit

488
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,510
from Captain Wei's office.

489
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,940
It has nothing to do with Jifeng Group.

490
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,060
And Mr. Dai knows nothing about it.

491
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,730
Got it?

492
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,400
Yes.

493
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,790
Go.

494
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,020
Stop! You're not allowed to enter the warehouse.

495
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,940
Inspection Section.

496
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,670
Go get your superior in charge.

497
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,300
Inspection Section?

498
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,710
Don't you understand Chinese? Hurry up!

499
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,950
Okay, wait here.

500
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,070
Inspection Section?

501
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,350
One step at a time.

502
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,470
Coming.

503
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,060
Which officer from the Inspection Section are you?

504
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,190
Give me the warrant.

505
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,780
Wait...

506
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,990
Sergeant Wang.

507
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,360
Yes.

508
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,650
I know him.

509
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,910
I'm Ou.

510
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,480
We joined the army the same year. Don't you remember?

511
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,740
I got injured and left.

512
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,660
Have you forgotten?

513
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,500
You are?

514
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,390
Let me introduce you.

515
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,940
This is the special commissioner

516
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,950
for the Mao Renxing smuggling case.

517
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,880
Hello.

518
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,150
You know him?

519
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,780
Yes.

520
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,900
So?

521
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,310
I'll talk to him first.

522
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,260
Okay, hurry up.

523
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,220
These are the goods

524
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,630
Mao Renxing smuggled, right?

525
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,690
Yes, that's right.

526
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,620
Something went wrong.

527
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,820
The special commissioner is here to make an arrest today.

528
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,950
Why?

529
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,130
The goods are gone.

530
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,620
That's impossible.

531
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,910
We had an order yesterday

532
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,990
when the goods went in.

533
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,190
Keep the boxes intact, do not open them.

534
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,310
They got swapped on the way.

535
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,600
It's none of our business.

536
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,930
We only take care what's in the warehouse.

537
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,410
I interrogated Mao Renxing secretly.

538
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,130
He sold the goods.

539
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,780
He can't get them back.

540
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,520
So, he's gonna die anyway.

541
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,820
He wants to take someone with him.

542
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,190
He's gonna blame it

543
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,510
on your warehouse.

544
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,260
How did it go? We're running out of time.

545
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,210
There's a misunderstanding. I'm taking care of it.

546
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,950
Come on.

547
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,740
Check if anything is missing.

548
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,380
We can't open them. It's an order.

549
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,740
We'll be dead if we open them.

550
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,270
You don't have to open them.

551
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,670
Just check if any of the goods are missing.

552
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,440
The special commissioner is waiting. Hurry.

553
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,930
Take the tarpaulins off. Check now!

554
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,650
Yes!

555
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,120
Sir, the goods are gone!

556
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,130
What's going on?

557
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,140
Where are the goods?

558
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,030
I was misled

559
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,550
by Ohashi Kazuya this time.

560
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,610
He turned our attention

561
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,490
to Mao Renxing.

562
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,710
Then used our trucks

563
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,350
to transport the gas bombs to Chongqing.

564
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,110
Ou Xiao'an,

565
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,170
you are the one who came to me and said

566
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,530
Mao Renxing was transporting gas bombs.

567
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,700
Now you're telling me you got misled.

568
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,380
Who'll be responsible for something

569
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,350
this big?

570
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,140
Wen, say something.

571
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,140
Captain,

572
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,210
we got something.

573
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,180
At least we know

574
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,160
the target of the Cherry Blossom Project is in Chongqing.

575
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Wei,

576
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,000
now's not the time to talk about responsibilities.

577
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,280
Just report it.

578
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,580
Report what?

579
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,990
You think they haven't offended the boss enough?

580
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,980
What should we say?

581
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,000
That we helped Ohashi

582
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,130
transport the gas bombs to Chongqing?

583
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,350
How do you expect Captain to report?

584
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,360
Ou Xiao'an.

585
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,350
Are you sure

586
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,730
you aren't misled now?

587
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,430
Now the gas bombs

588
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,910
are already in Chongqing.

589
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,070
Ohashi could drop them at any moment.

590
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,660
If he does,

591
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,980
it'll be disastrous.

592
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,260
I'm with Ou Xiao'an.

593
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,700
We can't risk the lives

594
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,580
of so many people in Chongqing

595
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,050
only because we don’t want to lose face.

596
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,170
You two, stop taking a stand.

597
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,410
We'll all

598
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,630
listen to Captain Wei.

599
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,050
Wen.

600
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,870
Now you'll

601
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,180
listen to me?

602
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,230
What were you doing earlier?

603
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,219
How about this?

604
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,179
We'll send out everyone

605
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,659
at the station we can.

606
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,020
We'll say the NBIS has lost a batch of guns

607
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,860
and need to search the whole city.

608
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,139
Remember, if you have any clues,

609
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,540
report to me first.

610
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,020
I have to have something real

611
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,570
before I can go to the boss.

612
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,360
We can't trouble him anymore.

613
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,100
Especially you two, understand?

614
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,380
Easy.

615
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,380
We're from the NBIS!

616
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,620
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

617
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,380
-Sir, what's going on?
-Open them.

618
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,830
The rest of you, go upstairs.

619
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,340
Yes!

620
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,360
What's going on?

621
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,900
Sir, what did I do?

622
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,969
We're in a legitimate business.

623
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,860
Take them and the goods back.

624
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,020
Yes! Move!

625
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,250
Sir!

626
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,460
-Take them back.
-Move!

627
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,260
Sir!

628
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,450
-Nothing suspicious was found.
-Nothing.

629
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,400
Nothing suspicious.

630
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,030
Is there any problem?

631
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,020
No.

632
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,230
Let them pass.

633
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,500
Check carefully.

634
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,210
Okay.

635
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,010
Allow me, Section Chief Ou.

636
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,230
Miao.

637
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,750
You don't need to do

638
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,940
this kind of dirty work.

639
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,160
Go do something else.

640
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,020
Captain Wei cares about you so much.

641
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,800
He asked me to do the work for you.

642
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,640
Really?

643
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,020
Get some rest.

644
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,770
Wait.

645
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,330
Routine check.

646
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,870
Sir, these are just some...

647
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,240
some novels of our customers.

648
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,500
We're doing our job.

649
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,300
No, Sir.

650
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,830
I'm afraid I can't

651
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,660
touch our customers' things, Sir. I…

652
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,460
Open it.

653
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,380
Sir, these…

654
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,350
I dare not touch them, Sir.

655
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,430
What do you mean?

656
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,460
Open it!

657
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,870
Sir, these…

658
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,370
I dare not touch them, Sir.

659
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,480
Please cooperate.

660
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,680
Be nice.

661
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,910
What's going on?

662
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,300
These are just some novels of our customers.

663
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,070
We don't dare to touch them, Sir.

664
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,910
We can't

665
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,880
let you pass until we check those.

666
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,580
Open it.

667
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,120
Look at the one in the back.

668
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,270
They are all books.

669
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,390
All books. Normal books.

670
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,120
These are just some novels of our customers, Sir.

671
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,960
Anything else?

672
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,080
No, no.

673
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,050
Okay, you can pass.

674
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,350
Thank you, Sir.

675
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,040
Just some books. Why are you panicking?

676
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,860
Did you check those?

677
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,920
We don't dare to touch our customers' things,

678
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,390
Ma'am.

679
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,150
Leave.

680
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,030
You wanted to see me?

681
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,210
Let's burn incense for Mom and Dad.

682
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,360
Dad.

683
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,930
Mom.

684
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,970
The Qin family is in trouble this time.

685
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,160
I don’t know if we can make it.

686
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,940
Please bless us,

687
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,430
bless our family to get through this.

688
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,140
Let the Qin family

689
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,210
live in peace.

690
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,550
[Memorial tablet of our beloved mother, Qin Shuying]

691
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,550
[Memorial Tablet of our beloved father, Qin Renfa]

692
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,460
You're the one

693
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,720
who reported Mao Renxing, aren't you?

694
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,910
I can't believe

695
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,510
you would place righteousness above family.

696
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,900
Brother,

697
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,360
I didn't do it for justice.

698
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,070
You did something wrong.

699
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,520
What did I do wrong?

700
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,340
Everything I did,

701
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,540
I did it for you.

702
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,980
Otherwise, you could never have got

703
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,740
this position in Chongqing.

704
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,910
Do you think everyone humours you

705
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,110
and trusts you because you are capable?

706
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,260
That's because you're from the Qin family.

707
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,460
Because you're my sister.

708
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,340
They value my money more!

709
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,940
Moqing,

710
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,090
are you still with the Qin family?

711
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,440
Do you still regard me as your brother?

712
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,760
If you really have done something wrong,

713
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,840
or taken the wrong path,

714
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,200
even though you are my brother,

715
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,710
I will do what I should do.

716
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,760
Brother.

717
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,850
Have you thought about it?

718
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,900
If something happens to you,

719
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,830
what should I do?

720
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,960
What about this family?

721
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,590
Even if you can survive today, what about tomorrow?

722
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,950
You can't just think for yourself.

723
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,420
Brother.

724
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,360
We haven't won the war yet.

725
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,430
The soldiers on the front line are still sacrificing themselves.

726
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,730
So many innocent people

727
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,170
died in the bombing of the Japanese.

728
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,770
But you and those people?

729
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,360
You act evilly together and devide the loot.

730
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,370
Do you think you did the right thing?

731
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,300
Do you think a government like this can be saved?

732
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,840
Do you know what you're talking about?

733
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,550
What a joke!

734
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,270
You're so childish!

735
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,880
You always say you want to change the world.

736
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,240
Can you change it?

737
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,510
Let me tell you

738
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,940
what the real world is like.

739
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,400
Even if you have the evidence now,

740
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,260
what can you do?

741
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,500
We can still let Mao Renxing

742
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,630
take the blame.

743
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,420
And I

744
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,460
will be on the headlines tomorrow.

745
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,540
They will say

746
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,070
I'm a patriotic businessman.

747
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,190
And you can't

748
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,760
even touch those big shots

749
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,430
who are behind those things.

750
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,020
That is the truth!

751
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,590
Moqing, I'm telling you.

752
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,440
If you are really smart,

753
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,960
leave the NBIS now.

754
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,540
I'll send you to the US

755
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,020
to continue your study and learn medicine to save lives.

756
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,500
You should live the rest of your life

757
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,230
and think about your marriage.

758
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,510
That's what matters.

759
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,630
The world is not something we can't change

760
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,960
just because you say so.

761
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,600
You're my only family.

762
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,560
I've arrested Mao Renxing. I don't want to

763
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,680
arrest you in the future.

Everyone,

Talented people can bring peace and stability to the country.

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,050
With such patriotic businessmen as Mr. Qin,

770
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,050

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,950
Of course,

774
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,380
Mr. Qin is the best there is.

775
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,060
Through today’s ceremony,

776
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,700
we'd like the whole world

777
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,550
to follow in Mr. Qin's footsteps.
