[Guizhou Operation Report]

5
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,759
The main force has arrived in Guizhou

6
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,590
and has been deployed completely according to plan.

7
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,850
They have reached the main airport road.

8
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,370
When did we send people to Guizhou?

9
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,630
How come I didn't know?

10
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,030
It was a last-minute mission.

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,790
Alright, I'll go back now.

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,820
This style suits you very well.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,720
Since the victory in the Anti-Japanese War,

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,180
ladies have been ordering

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,050
fabric with this pattern.

16
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,030
It's going to be the next big trend.

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,500
This fabric is quite nice.

18
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,510
You look great in it.

[Wang Chun, the Liaison of the Communist Party]

37
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,670
I have been following your progress over these years.

38
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,000
And I know that your work hasn't been easy.

39
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,450
I also heard about your brother,

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,970
Wang Yunjie.

41
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,130
On behalf of the organization,

42
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,190
I express our respect for both of you.

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,240
The Japanese have surrendered.

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,430
The CNP has extended an open invitation to our party

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,470
to discuss the agenda for future peace talks.

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,829
The organization urgently needs me to come to Chongqing

47
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,400
to understand the current situation.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,579
So,

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,380
the CNP doesn't know

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,900
that you have already arrived in Chongqing?

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,530
Yes.

52
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,570
The situation in Chongqing is quite complex.

53
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,510
There is still a carload of Japanese biochemical bombs

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,510
unaccounted for.

55
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,960
And we don't have detailed information

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,190
on the Cherry Blossom Project.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,610
The National Government's open invitation

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,740
to attend the celebration at this time

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,650
makes me think

60
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,110
there might be something wrong.

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,710
Yes.

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,620
The organization shares your concerns.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,940
We've also learned that

64
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,370
the one in charge of organizing this reception

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,290
is Commissioner Zhang.

66
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,980
That makes it even more suspicious.

67
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,180
Commissioner Zhang is known as a peace advocate

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,040
within the National Government.

69
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,200
They usually keep a close watch on him,

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,770
fearing he might defect to our side.

71
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,670
Now that they have him in charge of receiving our comrades,

72
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,070
I think the organization

73
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,880
should refuse this invitation.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,870
On the 14th,

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,430
Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,690
inviting the Chairman to Chongqing for peace talks.

77
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,370
After careful consideration, the organization believes

78
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,130
that if we directly refuse,

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,159
they will use public opinion to create a narrative,

80
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,080
claiming that we are not sincere about peace talks.

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,540
Moreover, the CNP not only invited our party

82
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,560
but also foreign representatives.

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,380
The organization has ultimately decided

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,840
to accept the invitation.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,230
The organization has also considered that,

86
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,860
on one hand,

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,280
sending our representatives could help us

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,730
understand the situation of the peace talks.

89
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,330
Chiang Kai-shek must be up to something.

90
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,290
As for what exactly that is

91
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,110
and how to thwart it,

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,510
it requires our comrades

93
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,980
to probe and find out.

94
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,270
On the other hand,

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,540
once our representatives arrive,

96
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,620
they can investigate the whereabouts

97
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,880
of the biochemical bombs

98
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,210
under the guise of security.

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,650
Such a large batch of biochemical weapons

100
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,450
remains

101
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,630
in Chongqing.

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,320
The CNP knows about it but didn't report it.

103
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,410
It poses a constant threat to the lives

104
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,270
of so many citizens in Chongqing.

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,200
We must seize this opportunity

106
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
to turn the tables and gain the initiative.

107
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,100
Alright,

108
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,600
I will make contacts immediately,

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,590
mobilize all intelligence lines,

110
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,130
and expedite the investigation to eliminate the threat as soon as possible.

111
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,770
Okay.

112
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,770
Director Wang,

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,180
although we have now won the  Anti-Japanese War,

114
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,490
from now on,

115
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,780
we need to be even more cautious.

116
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,310
Please tell our comrades

117
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,100
to hang in there

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
until the day of liberation.

119
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,090
Chief,

120
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,140
we are just two kilometers away from the airport.

121
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,230
There's a section of road in front of the airport that is inaccessible.

122
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,230
What should we do with our documents and files?

123
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,930
I have arranged for enough personnel

124
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,870
to transport them onto the plane.

125
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,330
Do we have enough troops and weapons?

126
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

127
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,620
Even if we are ambushed by the Chinese,

128
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,280
we will be able to handle it.

129
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,910
Tell them not to delay,

130
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,870
and the faster the transportation process, the better.

131
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,380
Yes.

132
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,560
They're here.

133
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,470
Captain Zeng.

134
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,100
How many brothers did you bring

135
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,090
when you escaped from Scott Road?

136
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,800
Six.

137
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,070
We need six men to protect Captain Zeng.

138
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,659
Yes!

139
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,940
Section Chief Qin, that's not necessary.

140
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,090
They are all from the NBIS.

141
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm afraid they'll be recognized by Ohashi.

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Alright.

143
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,070
Listen to Section Chief Qin.

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,530
Remember,

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,930
first confirm if the documents are there.

146
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,310
I'll head over now.

147
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,720
Later, don't start shooting randomly.

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,160
Let's go!

149
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,690
Chief.

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,500
Long time no see, Captain Zeng.

151
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,220
Thank you for your hard work.

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,920
Chief Ohashi,

153
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,750
the road ahead is impassable by car.

154
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,290
Let me to escort you.

155
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,220
Alright.

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Are all the documents and personnel in the car?

157
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,230
Yes, they are.

158
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,280
Wait.

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,810
How did you get injured?

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,940
It's just a surface wound. It's nothing.

161
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,740
You're so careless.

162
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,230
Chief,

163
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,000
you know I've always been fighting out there.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's inevitable.

165
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,700
Chief!

166
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,710
You betrayed me!

167
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
Let's move, Sir.

168
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,760
Wait a moment.

169
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,299
Let's see how they continue their act.

170
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,220
Chief Ohashi...

171
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,480
Attack!

172
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,730
Move!

173
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,990
Destroy those documents!

174
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,480
Yes!

175
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,450
Don't let Ohashi escape!

176
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,940
Capture him alive!

177
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,940
Bring him here.

178
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,440
A whole carload of documents,

179
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,470
and you destroyed them just like that!

180
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,630
Those are my years of effort.

181
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,330
Do you think

182
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,880
I'd hand them over to you so easily?

183
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,980
Are you National Revolutionary Army troops?

184
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,950
Yes.

185
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,070
It's a bit inappropriate

186
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,430
for you Eighth Route Army to act like this

187
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,600
on our turf, isn't it?

188
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,540
We're all Chinese. When it comes to fighting the Japanese

189
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,720
and resisting their invasion, it doesn't matter who we are.

190
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,900
How did you know the Japanese are here?

191
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,010
We were passing by

192
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,490
and saw some Japanese soldiers.

193
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,290
We couldn't just ignore it, could we?

194
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,320
Which unit are you from?

195
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,890
We're from the 20th Army.

196
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,770
Messenger,

197
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,530
send a telegram to the 20th Army,

198
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,070
telling them we've encountered the Eighth Route Army here

199
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,870
and requesting reinforcement.

200
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,340
Yes.

201
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,130
Wait.

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,810
Sir,

203
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,350
Captain Wei has instructed that

204
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,830
the 20th Army must not know about this operation.

205
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,170
This is the territory of Commander Yang of the Sichuan Army.

206
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,420
He doesn't get along with the Director.

207
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,520
If we start shooting here

208
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,980
without informing him, it might not be good.

209
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,350
Moreover, we are escorting Ohashi,

210
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,050
a highly important war criminal.

211
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,850
If their people take a step before us,

212
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm afraid he'll be taken by the Ministry of War

213
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,530
before reaching Chongqing.

214
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,020
They don't look like people from the 20th Army.

215
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,280
They look more like people from the NBIS.

216
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,580
He's Captain Wen from our NBIS.

217
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,000
He really has the nerve to bluff.

218
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,950
So, you’re friends from the 20th Army.

219
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,830
Let's all put our guns down,

220
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,520
sit down, and have a proper talk.

221
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,560
We've rescued quite a few of your people

222
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,260
from 810.

223
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,370
People from 810?

224
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,860
Where are those rescued now?

225
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,120
They retreated earlier.

226
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,980
I can bring them over later.

227
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm Lu Ziming

228
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,690
from our headquarters.

229
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,550
They did indeed rescue us.

230
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,980
The rest of our people

231
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,140
left with their Political Commissar.

232
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,240
When Regimental Commander Yang of your 20th Army

233
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,370
was defending Libo,

234
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,630
I led the militia

235
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,820
to help.

236
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,050
At that time, he stepped on a landmine set by the Japanese.

237
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,860
It was I who defused it.

238
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,660
If you don't believe me, call Yang Jieli over

239
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,860
and ask him if he still owes me, Wu, a leg.

240
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,470
Sir,

241
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,550
they already know

242
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,050
we're not from the 20th Army.

243
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,450
They have already shown us enough respect.

244
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,010
Messenger,

245
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,350
send a telegram to Captain Wei

246
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,650
and tell him that Ohashi has been captured.

247
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,970
And the situation here...

248
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,720
Don’t mention the situation here to him.

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Wei would love nothing more than to see me die here.

250
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,310
So, you’re friends of Regimental Commander Yang.

251
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,400
What a fortunate misunderstanding.

252
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,860
We're all on the same side.

253
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,210
Put down your guns.

254
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,540
Put them down.

255
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,560
Captain.

256
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,570
They captured Ohashi?

257
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,740
Yes, we've captured him and are transporting him back.

258
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,850
[Ohashi Kazuya has been captured]

259
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,030
Great!

260
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,660
Have you gotten the location of the gas bombs?

261
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,800
It's not easy to make Ohashi talk.

262
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,500
But

263
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,950
I will find a way

264
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,590
to make him talk.

265
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,540
Captain,

266
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,070
if the location of the gas bombs

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,140
hasn't been confirmed yet,

268
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,730
I suggest

269
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,630
postponing

270
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,010
our victory rally.

271
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,870
Right now, the whole of Chongqing

272
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,190
is still under the threat of the Cherry Blossom Project.

273
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,730
Cherry Blossom Project again.

274
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,570
You’ve been talking about it since you came back.

275
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,060
The Japanese have already been defeated,

276
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,030
and we haven’t seen any sign of this Cherry Blossom Project being implemented.

277
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,060
Do you think it could be a ruse

278
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,780
by Ohashi

279
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,990
to scare us

280
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,400
and keep us on edge?

281
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,030
Captain,

282
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,030
even if it’s a ruse to scare us,

283
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,500
we have to take it seriously.

284
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,410
If those biochemical weapons are really deployed,

285
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,070
it would affect generations.

286
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,290
So,

287
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,400
we must find them.

288
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,950
It looks like this rally

289
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,640
must be held.

290
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,740
We need to give them a target.

291
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,470
Once they have a target, they'll take action,

292
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,040
and we'll be able to capture them.

293
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,800
Captain,

294
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,100
we can't gamble with so many lives.

295
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,760
Captain.

296
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,420
You're right.

297
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,590
However...

298
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,980
whether we hold it or not is not up to me.

299
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
It's up to the higher-ups to decide.

300
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,470
Yes, understood.

301
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,430
Ou Xiao'an,

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,860
be honest with me.

303
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,160
You always talk about gas bombs.

304
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,490
Have you ever seen them with your own eyes?

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,570
No, I haven't.

306
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,620
I have given you the opportunity.

307
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,060
You have searched all over Chongqing,

308
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,380
and you didn't find a single one, did you?

309
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,790
So, they might not even exist.

310
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,210
Captain,

311
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,760
there’s actually one place we haven’t searched yet.

312
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,680
Where?

313
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,170
The 129th bomb shelter.

314
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,310
Go!

315
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,260
Take some people to search it immediately.

316
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,900
Yes.

317
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,000
Search thoroughly!

318
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,619
Is it Secretary Miao?

319
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,650
Who is it?

320
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,650
You're too careless.

321
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,300
You threw Tanaka Koji into the

322
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,690
Jialing River just like that.

323
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,210
We had to fish him out overnight for you.

324
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,490
You finally contacted me.

325
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,700
Who would have thought you'd kill your own contact?

326
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,420
I needed some time to weigh this matter.

327
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
And?

328
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,950
Five minutes later,

329
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,930
get in the car across the street.

330
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,050
We’ll talk there face to face.

331
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,300
Sirs,

332
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,660
why are you here?

333
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,830
We’re from the Chongqing Station of the NBIS, here for an inspection.

334
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,510
Well,

335
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,000
Section Chief Li and Vice Captain Feng

336
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,530
have already inspected it.

337
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,920
Even though it’s been inspected,

338
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
it still needs a second inspection.

339
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,470
Is Section Chief Li here?

340
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,040
Yes.

341
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,010
Inform Section Chief Li.

342
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,610
Yes.

343
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,840
No need.

344
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Hi, Section Chief Li.

345
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,340
Section Chief Ou, what brings you

346
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,060
to my humble place today?

347
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,930
You're working so hard out here

348
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,230
all by yourself.

349
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,080
The station is concerned about you.

350
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,340
They sent me here to see how you’re doing

351
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,620
on behalf of everyone.

352
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,930
Concerned about me?

353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,130
There's no need to bring

354
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,810
so many people for that, right?

355
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,400
I was afraid there might be issues

356
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,980
I couldn't handle alone.

357
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,720
Let's go.

358
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,700
Show me around.

359
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,720
What kind of gas is this?

360
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,500
It’s all oxygen.

361
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,070
All of it?

362
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,810
Yes.

363
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,850
What are these covered things?

364
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,870
Some spare oxygen tanks.

365
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,750
Open them up and let me see.

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,940
The air raid shelter is an enclosed space.

367
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,690
A lack of oxygen could have severe consequences.

368
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,280
If you're not convinced, you can test it.

369
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,530
How is it?

370
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,480
Fresh.

371
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,970
Don’t leave them there for too long.

372
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,730
What are these rooms for?

373
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,200
They're all storage rooms.

374
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,320
They hold oxygen, drinking water,

375
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,070
and food.

376
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,430
How many rooms like this

377
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,080
are there in the air raid shelter?

378
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,220
Seven or eight.

379
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,340
Give me your architectural drawings.

380
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,140
This is also Captain Wei's order?

381
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,730
Yes.

382
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,500
After you give me the architectural drawings,

383
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,020
I'll inspect them for you.

384
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,350
You can go back and take a rest.

385
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,970
You've been working too hard lately.

386
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,810
Everyone,

387
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,030
check every corner

388
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,460

389
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,650
If you find anything unusual,

390
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,020
report it to me immediately.

391
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,610
Yes!

392
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,750
Section Chief Li, what should we do?

393
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,110
Give him the drawings.

394
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,330
Yes. I'll get them.

395
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,800
Miss Miao.

396
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,750
This way please.

397
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,680
Miss Miao, this way please.

398
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,040
Please change your shoes.

399
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,750
Ms. Miao is here.

400
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,830
I've seen many of your photos.

401
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,030
You look even better in person.

402
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,300
What photos of mine?

403
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,220
What a pity.

404
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,900
Among so many people,

405
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,510
no one captured

406
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,180
Miss Miao's beauty.

407
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,490
So, you've been not only following me

408
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,830
but also Tanaka Koji?

409
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,830
You don't even trust

410
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,880
your own people.

411
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,970
Miss Miao, you are smart.

412
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,470
I forgot to introduce myself.

413
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,090
My name is Chie Hoko.

414
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,980
You can call me Hoko.

415
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,390
The South Mountain?

416
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,690
This place is quite nice.

417
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,010
You're being so blatant

418
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,910
under the generalissimo's nose?

419
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,600
If I tell you

420
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,760
some people think we surrendered too early,

421
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,270
too suddenly,

422
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,460
would you believe it?

423
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,100
Whether it's peace talks or civil war,

424
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,240
some people haven't had time to prepare.

425
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,190
Some people

426
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,130
don't want us to leave now.

427
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,780
They want us to do a bit more.

428
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,030
It means

429
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,340
we still need you

430
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,350
to continue working for us.

431
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,470
What if I don't?

432
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,210
At 11:52 last night,

433
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,900
you cut Tanaka Koji's throat.

434
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,640
By 2 a.m.,

435
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
the Army Headquarters was already holding a meeting

436
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
to discuss how to deal with you.

437
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,140
Ms. Miao,

438
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,020
you actually killed your own contact.

439
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,290
This is really tricky.

440
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,710
Not to mention in the Empire of Japan,

441
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,450
there's no precedent for this

442
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,260
even in China.

443
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,260
So what was the result of the discussion?

444
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,560
These men.

445
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,050
They held a long meeting

446
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,850
just to discuss

447
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,200
how to kill a woman.

448
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,460
Later, I said,

449
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,320
as a fellow woman,

450
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,030
I understand

451
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,900
and admire Miss Miao's actions.

452
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,440
We all witnessed

453
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,510
Tanaka Koji's years of abuse

454
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,110
toward you.

455
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,390
Killing Tanaka Koji

456
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,670
does not necessarily mean

457
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,800
you have betrayed the Empire of Japan.

458
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,750
I am willing to

459
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,380
personally step in

460
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,420
and become your direct contact.

461
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,630
and vouch for

462
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,180
all your future actions.

463
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,960
I don't need your vouching.

464
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,980
Ms. Miao,

465
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,640
you have always asked Tanaka Koji

466
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,420
when your work for us would end.

467
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,040
He had been lying to you,

468
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,230
leaving you hopeless and working unconditionally.

469
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,070
But I won't do that.

470
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
I can tell you right now,

471
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,890
this is the last thing

472
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,510
I need you to do for us.

Captain Wei,

491
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,940
was it you who instructed Ou Xiao'an

492
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,830
to search the 129th bomb shelter?

493
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,780
Shaotang, you came at the right time.

494
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,790

It's perfect that you're here to explain.

You haven't answered my question.

00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,580
About Ou Xiao'an...

500
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,810
He's just like me.

501
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,590
He doesn't know anything about air raid shelters.

502
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,290

00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,680
since the victory in the Anti-Japanese War,

536
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,790
You could say

that the whole world's eyes

I understand, Captain Wei.

543
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,000

565
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,830
Hurry back

566
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
and keep working.

567
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,680
Thank you, Captain Wei.

568
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,380
We've searched everywhere.

569
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,710
Nothing has been found.

570
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,250
Section Chief Ou,

571
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,740
Captain Wei called and said

572
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,250
that if there's nothing,

573
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,880
you can go back.

574
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,370
Well, thank you.

575
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,440
Explain it.

576
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,110
Section Chief Ou,

577
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,470
this room stores construction debris

578
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,310
generated during the building

579
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,870
of the air raid shelter.

580
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,390
The construction timeline was really tight,

581
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,570
so we temporarily piled it up here.

582
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,260
But we will clear it out soon.

583
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,660
Haven't you already inspected it?

584
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,650
This is up to standard?

585
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,050
Section Chief Ou, the construction timeline was really tight.

586
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,110
Please forgive...

587
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,989
What? Looking at the drawings?

588
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,420
Ask Wei Qingming if he can understand them.

589
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,989
I think

590
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,850
it was because he and Wen couldn't find the gas bombs

591
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,949
and are jealous of our achievements in the 129th.

592
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,679
Speaking of Vice Captain Wen, I found it strange.

593
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,050
I just passed by the Operations Department,

594
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,050
and there was hardly anyone inside.

595
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,130
Neither Qin Moqing nor Vice Captain Wen was there.

596
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,889
I heard about that.

597
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,060
Wen is looking for the gas bombs with them.

598
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,020
I haven't seen them for a few days.

599
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm worried

600
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,810
that these two old guys

601
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,739
are up to something behind my back.

602
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,590
Wei Qingming is not someone who accepts losses easily.

603
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,960
Last time, in front of Director Shen,

604
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,000
I set him up.

605
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,530
He won't let it go.

606
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,290
Shaotang,

607
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,500
you've been busy with the 129th.

608
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,400
You haven't seen Jingxian for a long time, have you?

609
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,470
Yes.

610
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,200
I haven't seen her for half a month.

611
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,260
Since you’re in town today,

612
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,650
go and see her.

613
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,640
Okay.

614
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,360
Everyone, please read with me.

615
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,860
Okay.

616
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,070
Before my bed a pool of light —

617
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,430
Can it be hoar-frost on the ground?

618
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,630
Looking up, I find the moon bright;

619
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,950
Bowing, in homesickness I’m drowned.

620
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,900
Everyone,

621
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,140
do you miss your hometown?

622
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,870
Yes!

623
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,770
When the war is over,

624
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,750
[Thoughts on a Tranquil Night, Tang Dynasty, Li Bai]

625
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,990
there will be no more sirens and bombings.

626
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,700
By then, we can safely and peacefully reunite

627
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,490
with our families.

628
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,870
Is that good?

629
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,510
Yes!

630
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,470
Shall we read it again together?

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,870
Ms. Feng.

632
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,800
Meng, is there something you'd like to ask?

633
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,330
Miss, when will the war end?

634
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,150
Yes, Ms. Feng.

635
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,590
When will it end?

636
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,810
When will the war end?

637
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,110
Yes, when?

638
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,050
When will the war end?

639
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,990
When will the war end?

640
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,440
When?

641
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,490
-Everyone...
-It’s almost over.

642
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,650
Everyone,

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,470
it won't be long

644
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,010
before the war ends.

645
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,040
And we will win this war.

646
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,440
By then,

647
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,200
just as Ms. Feng said,

648
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,950
everyone can go home

649
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,540
and reunite with their families

650
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,280
safely and peacefully.

00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,110

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,570
But who would have thought,

754
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,130
in the end,

755
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,940
they didn’t make it back alive.

756
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,900
As long as you're alive.

757
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,150
Get some rest. Don't think too much.

758
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,960
Yes.

759
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,530
As long as I'm alive.

760
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,980
As long as I'm alive.

761
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,370
As long as I'm alive.

762
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,940
As long as I'm alive!

763
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,220
As long as I'm alive.

764
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,320
As long as I'm alive.
