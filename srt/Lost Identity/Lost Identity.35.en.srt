Captain Liang.

5
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,400
Thank you.

6
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,750
Thank you.

7
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,990
No big deal.

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,710
I've taken care

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
of Zeng Jiwu.

10
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,630
These guys

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,600
can't go back to the police station, right?

12
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,670
I told them

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,020
since we rebelled,

14
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,280
they should go with me

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,710
to the Communist Party's territory.

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,510
We're no longer their henchmen.

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,520
Besides,

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,030
if the group is disbanded here,

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,090
what if someone betrays you someday?

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
It's a hidden danger.

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,410
You're still worried about me.

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,560
Xiao'an.

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
Xiao'an,

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
I knew it was you.

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,690
I knew you would come to save us.

26
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,640
Xiao'an,

27
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,500
where

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,660
should we go now?

29
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,620
If we stay in Chongqing,

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,200
we will be killed sooner or later.

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,740
We'll die anyway.

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,190
Xiao'an,

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,330
I've always been a coward.

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Let me follow you.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,360
Let me work with you.

36
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,140
You leave Chongqing

with Captain Liang.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
It wasn't easy for you to survive.

39
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,400
Don't follow me.

40
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,960
Live well.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,560
Live well.

42
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,430
Okay.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,870
It's a good thing too.

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,520
Just follow me from now on.

47

When they talk about this in the future,

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,200
we'll be among the first ones to liberate Chongqing.

I still have a mission.

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,840
And

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,790
my identity is a bit complicated.

60
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,440
About what happened today,

61
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,390
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,030
Don't worry.

63
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,460
Go back.

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,540
Section Chief Qin is waiting for the news of victory tonight.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
Go.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,820
You look much better.

67
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,200
Much better.

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,270

But actually,

71
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,720
they have their own intentions.

73
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,190
wants Li Shaotang, his son-in-law,

74
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,070
to help him

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,260
take the position of captain from me.

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
wants to defeat me through his two disciples

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,710
and become the captain again.

79
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,070
Miao,

80
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,090
you're the only one I can count on.

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,160
Look at

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,920
Director Shen, the backer of Li Shaotang.

83
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,230
He's favored by the boss.

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Well,

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,820
he's flattering those Americans.

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,440
The American man's wife

87
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,750
is a Japanese American.

88
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,350
She's still Japanese.

89
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,680
There must be something serious behind this.

90
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,900
Come on, Captain.

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,360

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,050
I can't believe you.

You think I'll believe that?

97

It's true.

No.

Sir,

153
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,030
there is a reason for that. Show some understanding.

154
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,880
So,

155
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,160
is this also the reason why you didn't go to the wedding?

156
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,290
No.

157
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,710

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,360
Stop giving each other an out.

Everyone knows you two are close.

161

This is the autopsy report.

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,490
The alcohol concentration found

164
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,490
in Feng Yunian's stomach is not high enough

165
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
to make him drunk

166
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,920
and unconscious.

167
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,010
There was no sign of poisoning either.

168
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,990
What took his life

169
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,610
is the six stabs

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
on his abdomen.

[There are six stabs and a spleen rupture]

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,660
He suffered a spleen rupture and died from excessive blood loss.

There was no sign of a fight at the scene.

The door and windows are not damaged.

176

Xiao'an.

178
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,020
What do you think?

179
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,320
The murderer caught him unprepared

180
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,110
and killed him instantly.

181
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,140
What else could the reason be?

182
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,870
Sir, what do you think?

183
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,190
Yes. It must be someone close to him.

184
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,950
Feng

185
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,720
had seen a lot of bloodshed.

186
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,990
If the murderer is not someone close to him,

187
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,680
he couldn't have got close to him, right?

188
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Li Shaotang?

189
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,430
Tell me. On that day,

190
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,250
how many people

191
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,640
had access to the dressing room?

192
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,910
No way.

193
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,310
Why would he

194
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,850
stab his father-in-law to death at his wedding?

195
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,640
Unless...

196
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,190
Captain Feng

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
had something on him.

198
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,140
If the murderer really is Li Shaotang,

199
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,500
the wedding has offered him

200
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,780
the best protection.

201
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,550
I don't care who the real murderer is.

202
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,620
I hope the murderer caught by you two

203
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,900
is Miao Jiang.

204
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,570
Miao Jiang?

205
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,990
Look. There were three captains

206
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,020
in the station,

207
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,730
right?

208
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,570
Now that Feng is dead, there are only Wei Qingming and me.

209
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,140
I want to take advantage

210
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,350
of Feng's death

211
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,240
to eliminate Wei Qingming's men.

212
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,300
This is

213
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
what I really want.

214
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm afraid Wei Qingming thinks like this too.

215
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
Luckily,

216
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,560
Section Chief Qin and I didn't go to the wedding.

217
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,950
If we went there,

218
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,940
we would be the scapegoat.

219
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,240
Now I'm aware of the situation.

220
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,050
What we do and say

221
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,600
will directly affect

222
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,890
our teacher's future career.

223
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,410
So,

224
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,120
Section Chief Qin,

225
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,490
from now on,

226
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,000
no matter what we say or do,

227
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,300
we must be careful.

228
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,850
We can't make any mistake.

229
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,990
Xiao'an,

230
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,760
Moqing,

231
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,250
what I want

232
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,910
is to take back

233
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,240
my former position

234
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,030
from Wei Qingming.

235
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,040
It's time for you two

236
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,510
to do something.

237
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,480
If we lose this chance,

238
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll be the one

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,850
lying in the morgue.

240
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,190
This morning,

241
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,790
I went to see the boss.

242
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,470
The boss is very upset

243
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,460
about Vice Captain Feng's death.

244
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,070
Right,

245
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,500
is Vice Captain Feng's funeral about to be held?

246
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,790
Has the funeral committee been organized?

247
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,390
It was organized last night.

248
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,930
That's good.

249
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,880
If you're short of manpower,

250
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,280
I can transfer some from the headquarters.

251
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,540
The boss said

252
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
we must give Vice Captain Feng

253
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,840
a decent funeral.

254
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,750
The boss

255
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
also said

256
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,050
this case

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,140
must have something to do with the Communist Party.

258
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,020
It has something to do with the Communist Party?

259
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,690
They didn't invite a communist

260
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
to the wedding yesterday.

261
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,710
But Miao went somewhere during the wedding.

262
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,950
Right?

263
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,400
Wen,

264
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,180
don't you understand

265
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,220
what the boss means?

266
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,350
The boss said

267
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,460
it must have something to do with the Communist Party.

268
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,380
There were so many guests yesterday.

269
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,880
Do you think the communist

270
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,710
would tell you his identity?

271
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,710
Even if it was done by the Communist Party,

272
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,600
we have to catch the murderer.

273
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,610
You want to tell everyone the Communist Party did it

274
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,280
without even catching the murderer.

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,840
Isn't this a joke?

276
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,320
Wen,

277
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
you've been doing this job

278
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,590
for so many years.

279
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,940
You shouldn't have said that.

280
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,240
There were so many people

281
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,180
in Chongqing Hotel.

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,660
Maybe one of the waiters is a communist.

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,690
He saw Feng was alone, so he took the chance to kill him.

284
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,160
Is it possible?

285
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,520
Captain Wei,

286
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,570
I should thank you.

287
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,350
You just did what the Operations Department

288
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,160
should do.

289
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,080
I was just saying.

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,520
It's your duty

291
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,360
to catch criminals.

292
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,350
What do you think, Director Shen?

293
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,900
Vice Captain Wen, thank you for your hard work.

294
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,030
I'm going back to the headquarters to report to the boss now.

295
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,870
I'll tell him

296
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,100
you two have identified the suspect

297
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,670
and should be able to solve the case before the funeral

298
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,170
to let Vice Captain Feng rest in peace.

299
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,900
The boss can rest assured.

300
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,120
We can solve the case within three days.

301
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,320
Captains, thank you for your hard work.

302
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,550
Let's work together

303
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,800
to overcome the difficulties.

304
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,690
Wen,

305
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,060
you were talking nonsense.

306
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,260
Li Shaotang is the biggest suspect now,

307
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,040
but you tried to get Miao involved.

308
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,080
Enough.

309
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,230
Wei Qingming, let's stop arguing.

310
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,180
The problem now is not whether we should investigate Li Shaotang.

311
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,710
The problem is in a few days,

312
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,500
Li Shaotang will take up Feng's position.

313
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,270
Impossible.

314
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,920
Impossible?

315
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,010
Both of us

316
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,150
are old men from the era

317
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,940
of the China Reconstruction Society.

318
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,750
At that time, we had to make contributions

319
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,430
in order to get promoted.

320
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,160
The rule doesn't apply

321
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,180
to today's young people.

322
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Come in.

323
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,390
Captain Wei, Secretary Miao is on the phone.

324
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,450
Wen,

325
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,690
you need three days to solve this case?

326
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,350
Maybe

327
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,090
I can solve it before nightfall today.

328
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,570
I believe in you.

329
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,090
[Chongqing Linjiang Primary School]

330
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,810
[Diligent] [Benevolent]

331
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,580
Captain.

332
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,950
What happened?

333
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,780
This place was empty when I came here this morning.

334
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,670
I didn't see anyone here.

335
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,550
There are traces of a gunfight.

336
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,990
And this.

337
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,800
This is a bullet shell used by the police.

338
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,880
The police did it?

339
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,960
This

340
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,990
is the captain of the fifth division of the Chongqing Police Department,

341
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,920
Liang Yuecheng.

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,430
He disappeared

343
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,710
along with other policemen overnight.

344
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,060
There must be someone behind them.

345
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,380
Otherwise, they wouldn't have had the guts

346
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,480
to do such a thing.

347
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,990
Where is Zeng Jiwu?

348
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,710
I don't know.

349
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,830
I sent someone to look for him,

350
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,200
but they still haven't found him.

351
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,190
These guys who were traitors before

352
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,410
are unreliable.

353
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,630
Keep looking for him.

354
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,630
Captain,

355
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,940
maybe Zeng Jiwu already died.

356
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,560
Could it be that Qin Moqing

357
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
or Ou Xiao'an did this?

358
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,880
The two of them

359
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,970
didn't go to the wedding yesterday.

360
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,270
You have no evidence.

361
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,510
I want solid evidence.

362
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,380
Okay.

363
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,190
But this does look like something

364
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,960
Wen Yishan's Operations Department would do.

365
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,540
Clean up this place first.

366
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,090
Keep a close eye on Ou Xiao'an and Qin Moqing.

367
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,350
Once I have evidence,

368
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,640
I won't let them off.

369
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
Yes.

370
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,200
You look much better.

371
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,840
Why did you come here in such a hurry?

372
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,570
The experiment can no longer continue.

373
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,720
What happened?

374
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,970
Last night,

375
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,070
someone emptied the entire school.

376
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,480
Who did it?

377
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,990
I haven't found it out yet.

378
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,120
I think

379
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,350
Ou Xiao'an did it.

380
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,630
Do all the hostages in the school know you?

381
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,640
Will your identity be exposed?

382
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,020
I don't think so.

383
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,320
The gas bomb experiment

384
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,920
was small-scale and was carried out secretly.

385
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,520
Where is the experimental data?

386
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,420
[Experiment Records]

387
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,510
Are you scared because someone

388
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,520
took away your prisoners?

389
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,720
[Experiment Records]

390
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,970
Something's wrong.

391
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
Why did it take so long

392
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,760
for someone downwind to pass out?

393
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,310
I reduced the dosage.

394
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
How much?

395
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,850
I reduced it by 50%.

396
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,140
That's fine.

397
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,450
The data can be calculated.

398
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,080
But listen,

399
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,790
you are a spy planted in the NBIS by Ohashi.

400
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,670
You can't be afraid of death.

401
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,450
I don't want you to die before the enemies die

402
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,870
or before the Cherry Blossom Project succeeds.

403
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,950
Understand?

404
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,480
[Feng Yunian, a vice captain of the Chongqing Station of the NBIS, was assassinated. Two communists were caught]

405
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,160
Mr. Li,

406
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,250
I'm Mrs. Wu.

407
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,360
Mrs. Wu.

408
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,620
Miss Feng is awake.

409
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,710
Jingxian is awake?

410
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,630
Okay.

411
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,750
Do you want to come back?

412
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,710
I'll be right back.

413
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,480
Okay.

414
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,270
Any clue?

415
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,740
On the night before Feng Yunian was killed,

416
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,360
someone was hit by a car on the street and died on the spot.

417
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,080
It was Feng Yunian's car.

418
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,820
He killed someone on the street

419
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,200
on the night before his daughter's wedding?

420
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,160
Who did he kill?

421
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,010
Li Dachun.

422
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,910
I checked all his information.

423
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,230
The place of household registration he registered in the NBIS

424
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,900
[Name: Li Dachun] [Gender: Male]

425
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,370
is the same as that of Li Shaotang.

426
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,710
Well, this is too coincidental.

427
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,420
Look at this.

428
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,360
Feng Yunian, a vice captain of the Chongqing Station of the NBIS,

429
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,820
was assassinated at the wedding. Two communists were caught.

430
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
Two waiters did it?

431
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,280
They just branded them as murderers?

432
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,700
This is obvious.

433
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,660
Someone high up doesn't want to find out the truth.

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
I found it at the crime scene.

435
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,060
Let's go take a look.

436
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,870
Yujiang Hotel.

437
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,510
Let's go.

438
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,590
Sorry.

439
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,790
We didn't know Mr. Li

440
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,920
had a car accident until this morning.

441
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,560
So we still haven't cleaned up the room.

442
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,590
Did anyone else come here before?

443
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,990
No.

444
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,360
Since we knew something happened to Mr. Li,

445
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,080
this room has been locked.

446
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,500
Go back to work.

447
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,710
Move it over here.

448
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,380
He even bought a new outfit.

449
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,490
Are these Pai Gow tiles?

450
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,350
Obviously, he's a gambler.

451
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,150
He carried Pai Gow tiles with him wherever he went.

452
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,310
So many identical photos.

453
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Let me take a look.

454
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,210
Take a look.

455
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,470
Is this Li Shaotang?

456
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,710
Li Shaotang.

457
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,140
He really is Japanese.

458
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,380
What should we do?

459
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,550
Should we report this to the station?

460
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,060
Not now.

461
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,920
When Shen Congwu interrogated me back then,

462
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,040
he released me on purpose.

463
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,170
Have you forgotten?

464
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,870
You mean...

465
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,170
Arresting him now is useless.

466
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,670
We don't know how Ohashi died.

467
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,840
We don't know where the gas bombs are either.

468
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,940
If we arrest him now,

469
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,340
he won't say anything.

470
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,750
Li Shaotang thinks only Vice Captain Feng

471
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,080
and Li Dachun knew this.

472
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,050
He thinks he can rest assured after killing them.

473
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,980
He'll be more brazen in the future.

474
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,260
This is exactly what I want.

475
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,560
As long as he becomes arrogant and lowers his guard,

476
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,870
we can have a chance.

477
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,830
He will give himself away sooner or later.

478
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,390
Arresting him is not the purpose.

479
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,390
Our purpose is to destroy the Cherry Blossom Project.

480
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,210
Got it.

481
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,180

Mrs. Li,

496
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,300
we've caught the murderer.

497
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,130
He admitted

498
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,750
he is a communist.

499
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,830
So,

500
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,830
the boss has conferred the title of Colonel on Vice Captain Feng.

501
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,430
It's a way

502
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,570
to comfort Vice Captain Feng's soul.

503
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,200
The boss will also

504
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,570
ensure your safety in the future.

-Yes.

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,280
I want to talk to you privately.

Does Feng Yunian's death

521
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,050
have anything to do with you?

522
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,120
He knew Ohashi is still alive.

523
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,110
So,

524
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,690
I had to kill him.

525
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,590
Did he tell anyone else?

526
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,500
He didn't have the chance.

527
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,460
I see.

528
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,870
Go to work early tomorrow.

529
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,560
You'll be given a new mission.

Qiushui,

531
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,370
why did you suddenly change the meeting location?

532
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,380
Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War,

533
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,230
the cheongsam shop's business

534
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,520
has suddenly boomed.

535
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,080
The guests are wives of high officials of the CNP.

536
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,810
There are too many people in the shop,

537
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,540
so we changed the meeting location.

538
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,200
We'll meet here in the future.

539
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,930
Okay.

540
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,840
Qiushui, you asked me here urgently.

541
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,230
Is it because you've gained information on Secretary Chen?

542
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,880
According to our investigation,

543
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,080
Secretary Chen is not

544
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,920
in the CNP's prison.

545
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,160
I guess Secretary Chen has been transferred

546
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,760
to another detention place.

547
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,400
This has caused a lot of trouble

548
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
to our underground activities.

549
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,790
The information

550
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,600
on Secretary Chen's health condition you told us

551
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,660
is very important.

552
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,190
We have checked all the public hospitals

553
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,110
and clinics in Chongqing.

554
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Only Mettley Clinic

555
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,760
run by Henry Lau, an American,

556
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,610
has such medicine.

In other words,

559
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,250
if we find Doctor Henry,

560
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,270
we can know where Secretary Chen is.

561
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,540
We've checked all the social relationships

562
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
of Henry Lau.

563
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,230
He's a Chinese American.

564
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,900
Also,

565
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,450
he's an old friend of my brother, Wang Yunjie.

566
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,990
Although we've made arrangements,

567
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,590
we still need to be careful.

568
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,870
After all, the special agents have been watching us closely.

569
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,560
Got it.

570
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,600
My suggestion is

571
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,200
you can ask Ou Xiao'an to carry out this mission

572
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,600
and get a map of the place.

573
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,170

574
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,450

575
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,600
He stopped Zheng Bangyao

576
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,290
and rescued the people in the abandoned school.

577
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,590
The organization thinks

578
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,900
he should be the candidate for party membership

579
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,340
that Mingyuan wanted to cultivate.

580
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,020
As long as we save Secretary Chen,

581
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,650
the mystery of his identity

582
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,770

to report to you.

590
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,390
Yes.

This is Li Shaotang when he was little.

592

It's him.

Do the higher-ups of the NBIS

596
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,930
know this secret?

597
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,330
I'm not sure.

598
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,530
I haven't heard anything about this in the NBIS for now.

599
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,210
Theoretically, after Feng Yunian died,

600
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,270
the NBIS should take measures on him.

601
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,130
But the current situation is they leave it unsettled

602
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,790
and Li Shaotang has benefitted the most from it.

603
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll report to the organization as soon as possible.

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,760
Go in.

759
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,710
Doctor Henry

760
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,870
is sick.

761
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,950
I'm his student.

762
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,650
So I came to give you treatment today.

763
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,520
Ou...

764
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,200
Don't move.

765
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,340
Lie down. Don't move.

766
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,860
Don't move. Lie down.

767
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,660
Any abnormal reaction recently?

768
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,270
Everything's been fine.

769
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,880
Let me give you a brief diagnosis.

770
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,590
Does it hurt when I press here?

771
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,410
No.

772
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,900
Do you feel any pain here?

773
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,400
Not very much.

774
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,830
What about here?

775
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,480
It hurts here?

776
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,580
It hurts too when I press here?

777
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,060
You don't feel any heart discomfort, right?

778
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,280
Okay.

779
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,820
Nothing serious.

780
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,900
It's not easy to find your blood vessels.

781
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,730
Let me see.

782
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,670
Okay.

783
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,030
Okay.

784
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,000
Doctor,

785
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,670
I don't think I have much time left.

786
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,020
Don't come again.

787
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,520
We

788
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
are doctors.

789
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,130
Doctors treat patients and save lives.

790
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,050
Rest assured.

791
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,340
Don't worry about your illness.

792
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,220
I...

793
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,860
will give you an injection again the day after tomorrow.

794
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Wear it.

795
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,760
How did it go?

796
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,090
I saw Secretary Chen.

797
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,890
How is Secretary Chen?

798
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,090
Not good.

799
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,230
But his life is not in danger for now.

800
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,360
We need to figure out a way to save him as soon as possible.

801
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,230
I roughly drew a map

802
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,350
based on the locations.

803
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,430
The place where Secretary Chen

804
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,480
[Mettley Clinic]

805
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,320
and Li Manqiu are imprisoned is a bit hidden.

806
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,060
[Yanghe Village]

807
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,770
But there aren't many guards there.

808
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,530
There are about ten guards

809
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,660
with light weapons.

810
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,260
These information is very important.

811
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,300
We'll save them as soon as possible.

812
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,840
One more thing.

813
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,630
Today, Shen Congwu came to the station

814
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,990
to announce the personnel changes in the station.

815
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,650
Li Shaotang has been appointed as Vice Captain.

816
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,590
Also,

817
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,010
he was sent to the Longquan Prisoner Camp.

818
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,070
The point is

819
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,640
you and I are not included.

820
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
Shen Congwu promoted Li Shaotang?

821
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,740
He sent Li Shaotang on a solo mission.

822
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,100
He definitely is up to something.

823
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,910
Secretary Chen

824
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,820
is only safe for now.

825
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,550
It's not that easy

826
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,600
to enter the prisoner camp.
