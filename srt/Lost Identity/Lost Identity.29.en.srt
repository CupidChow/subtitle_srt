Well, who gave you the right to change the ward?

5
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,550
I'm doing this for our own good.

6
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,960
After all, you're one of...

7
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,700
the communists, right?

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,180
What do you think?

9
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,199
Captain Zeng, you're really thoughtful.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
But I'm warning you.

11
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,930
Whether these two people are useful or not,

12
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,760
if anything happens to them when they're in our hands,

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,160
it'll be hard to explain.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
I understand.

15
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,650
I'm aware of that.

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,970

Ohashi has been caught?

20
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,550
Yes. He was just taken back to Chongqing today.

21
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,810
You must make him tell us the whereabouts

22
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,430
of the gas bombs and biochemical weapons.

23
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,110
Got it.

24
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,540
Qiushui,

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,900
I've found Secretary Chen and Li Manqiu.

26
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,000
Secretary Chen is still alive?

27
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,600
Captain Wu's men

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,730
couldn't find them.

29
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,000
When I found them,

30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,750
I couldn't contact Captain Wu.

31
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,020
Secretary Chen was badly injured.

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,770
At that time,

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,660
I could only bring him back first.

34
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,640
Now, Secretary Chen and Li Manqiu

35
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,840
are under house arrest

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,310
in Ward 206 of the Army Hospital

37
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,570
in the name of treatment.

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,320
Zeng Jiwu is keeping an eye on them

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,630
with a few special agents.

40
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,390
Zeng Jiwu is keeping an eye on them?

41
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,579
Will they be in danger?

42
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,840
Not for now.

43
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,680
But this is just a temporary plan.

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,430
So I hurried back to discuss with you

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,560
how to save them as soon as possible.

46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,150
It's easy since we know where they are.

47
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,880
The two parties are about to have peace talks.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,760
At this time,

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
as long as we give them

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,690
the specific names and address,

51
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,020
they have to let them go.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,280
Save them as soon as possible, Qiushui.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,410
I'm worried something might go wrong.

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,140

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,510
Go to Shen's Rice Shop

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,910
and ask the shopkeeper to come here now.

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,680
Moqing,

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,650
you must stay calm at this moment.

59
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,410
Wait for orders from the higher-ups.

60
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,140
Got it.

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,830
It's been so many years.

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,510
You've become maturer.

63
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,170
You saved Secretary Chen this time.

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,110
I think

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
it's time for you

66
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,930
to let it go.

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,630
It's good as long as we can get him out of there.

68
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,160
Mr. Ou,

69
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,750
I know what you mean.

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,760
I will keep your secret to myself,

71
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,530
just like I keep the Cherry Blossom Project secret.

72
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,280
You know my secret?

73
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,510
I can talk about your friendship

74
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,980
with Lou Mingyuan and Ye Xuanmin, two communists,

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,080
for three days and nights.

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Also,

77
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,580
you managed to escape from 810.

78
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
The Communist Party must have helped you a lot, right?

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,970
About these things...

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,900
Let me put it this way.

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,050
Now I am

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,730
the section chief of the Operations Department of the NBIS.

83
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,310
They have investigated

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,720
what you just said

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,360
many times.

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,300
Now I'm worried about you.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,210
Since you have been taken here,

88
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,590
I guess they'll start

89
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,200
to interrogate you soon.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,640
You're going to suffer.

91
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,340
I know.

92
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,710
But I don't know

93
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,380
what you want to know either.

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,430
You know who the spy you planted is,

95
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,440
right?

96
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,130
Secretary Miao.

97
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,600
What do you mean?

102
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,960

The middleman is dead now.

105
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,830
I was taken here by you

106
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,880
before I could find out the truth.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,960
Well...

108
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Section Chief Ou,

109
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
you're drinking.

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,040
Looks like you two are close.

111
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,690
What's wrong with the NBIS?

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,900

of the captain,

117
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,240
what's so important?

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,730
Captain Wei said from now on,

119
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,750
I should take care of the things related to Ohashi Kazuya.

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,100
No one else

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120

The order I received from Captain Wei

123
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,560
is to find a place

124
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,090
to detain Mr. Ohashi secretly.

125
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,200
No one else is allowed to get involved.

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Why didn't I hear anything about what you said?

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,470
Really?

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,030

Mr. Ohashi,

133
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,110
take care.

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,270
Goodbye.

135
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,320
Chief Ohashi, sorry

136
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,540
for meeting you here.

137
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,800
Long story short.

138
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,159
Since you're under arrest,

139
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,820
the Cherry Blossom Project has been suspended.

140
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,920
The higher-ups are in urgent need

141
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,180
of knowing the real identity of Lanshan.

142
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,040
What happened

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
to Tanaka Koji?

144
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,350
I killed him.

145
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,400
Yet you are still alive

146
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,410
and are here asking me who Lanshan is.

147
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,380
Lanshan is inactive now.

148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,650
The higher-ups want to use him again.

149
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,560
So you have to tell me

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,440
who Lanshan is.

151
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,510
If I tell you who Lanshan is,

152
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,660
I'll die sooner.

153
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,170
Lanshan is my work.

154
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,170
The Cherry Blossom Project is also my work.

155
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,530
No one can take them away from me.

156
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,220
I'll be honest with you, Ohashi.

157
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,179
Call me Chief.

158
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,350
Got it.

159
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,640
You're just my pawn.

160
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,710
I asked Tanaka

161
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,820
to give you the order of killing Ando.

162
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,880
How dare you call my name directly!

163
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,290
I just want to remind you

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,730
since you are in Wei Qingming's hands,

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,500
it's impossible for you to get out alive.

166
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,500
Even if I'll die,

167
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,310
the Cherry Blossom Project will be carried out.

168
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,920
Right,

169
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,450
who is your new contact

170
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,140
appointed by the higher-ups?

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,860
Chie Hoko.

172
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,580
Congratulations.

173
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
If it's her,

174
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,490
you won't have much time left.

175
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,920
Director Wang,

176
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,920
you're taking me somewhere

177
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,130
in the middle of the night.

178
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,880
Is this the place?

179
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,640
Yes.

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,560
Director Wang,

181
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,700
don't keep me guessing.

182
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,320
Just tell me what happened.

183
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
Kidnapping and confinement

184
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,390
violate the principles and spirit

185
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,950
of the peace talks between the two parties, right?

186
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,750
Of course.

187
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
A few days ago in Guizhou,

188
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,150
our guerrilla

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,590
saved some people from Ohashi Kazuya.

190
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,250
We gave your members

191
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,670
[Zhang Donglin, Commissioner of the Second Commission of the Political Department of the Military Commission of the National Government]

192
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,910
back to you immediately.

193
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,360
But you

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,080
put two of our members

195
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
under house arrest here.

196
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,890
These are the names and photos.

197
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,690
One is Ye Xuanmin,

198
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,740
and the other is Li Manqiu.

199
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,120
[People put under house arrest by the Chongqing Station of the NBIS: Ye Xuanmin and Li Manqiu]

200
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Commissioner Zhang,

201
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
when we met yesterday,

202
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,920
you said

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,100
your generalissimo invited the chairman

204
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,830
to Chongqing to talk face to face with sincerity.

205
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,030
Is this the sincerity of your generalissimo?

206
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,480
Director Wang,

207
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,260
don't worry.

208
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll take care of it.

209
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,400
If this is true,

210
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,090
I'll make sure they release them.

211
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,080
[Nurse Station]

212
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,210
Please.

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,510
Sir!

214
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,240
Whose men are you?

215
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,260
Speak!

216
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,590
Sir,

217
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,460
we are members of the Chongqing Station of the NBIS.

218
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,220
Move.

219
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
Move!

220
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,830
Move!

221
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,410
Sir.

222
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,280
-You can't go in.
-Commissioner Zhang.

223
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,480
What brings you here?

224
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,530
Captain Wei,

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,100
it's in the middle of the night. You are...

226
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,420
The Operations Department

227
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,210
saved our men imprisoned in 810

228
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
in Guizhou.

229
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,370
So I came to take a look.

230
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,020
You came at the right moment.

231
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,950
This is Director Wang from Yan'an.

232
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,600
Indeed.

233
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,320
We also saved two communists

234
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,940
in 810.

235
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,920
Do you want to meet them?

236
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,890
Open the door.

237
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,320
Please.

238
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,390
Director Wang,

239
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,280
see if they are the men you're looking for.

240
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,010
No.

241
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,830
Did you replace them?

242
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,700
How could you say that?

243
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,820
Are you communists?

244
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

245
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,310
Where

246
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,970
were you saved?

247
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,170
In Guizhou,

248
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,150
where Ohashi was hiding.

249
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,310
I was right, wasn't I?

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,310
Now is the crucial time for the peace talks between the Communist Party and the CNP.

251
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,390
How could we possibly do such a thing?

252
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,140
We're friends with communists now.

253
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,590
So I specially transferred them

254
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,250
to a twin room

255
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,120
and asked the best military doctors

256
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,560
to treat them with the best medicine.

257
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,450
Comrade,

258
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,630
do you want

259
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,060
to take them away today

260
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,420
or leave them here for further treatment?

261
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,320
Director Wang,

262
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,840
is there

263
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
a misunderstanding?

264
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,470
Or...

265
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,360
is your information wrong?

266
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,690
Commissioner Zhang,

267
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,620
it's indeed a misunderstanding.

268
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,470
Director Wang.

269
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,530
Thank you, Commissioner Zhang.

270
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,280
I've locked them in the confinement room.

271
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,220
Director Wang.

272
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,640
Director Wang, let me explain.

273
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,410
Director Wang, let me ex...

274
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,920
I would never come here

275
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,150
to ask for them for no reason.

276
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,710
We gave all your men

277
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,120
we saved from Ohashi Kazuya

278
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,430
back to you.

279
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,460
We only want

280
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,390
two of our men back,

281
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,830
but you are putting on a show.

282
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,460
Director Wang,

283
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,090
I understand how you feel.

284
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,950
You know my attitude.

285
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,630
But

286
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,730
if you want me to ask the Chongqing Station for them,

287
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,330
you have to show me evidence.

288
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,160
As long as

289
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,310
you tell me their names

290
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,040
and the place where they are imprisoned,

291
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll take you

292
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,520
to Wei Qingming to ask for them immediately.

293
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
I promise.

294
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
Commissioner Zhang,

295
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,320
I came to Chongqing

296
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
in hope of peace.

297
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,580
But what I saw and heard just now shows

298
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,470
you want to take our men aboveboard under the cover of peace talks.

299
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,160
I can hardly imagine us

300
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,930
negotiating successfully

301
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,640
and establishing

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,470
a new China together in the future.

303
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,230
Do you think

304
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,560
the CNP

305
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,770
is still worthy of our trust?

306
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,350
D-Director Wang! Director...

307
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,600
Section Chief Li,

308
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,780
you're still working at this hour.

309
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,260
Why have you lost weight again?

310
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,240
Because I've been busy.

311
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,640
I haven't eaten for days.

312
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,050
Miao, why did you suddenly

313
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,600
come to my bomb shelter?

314
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,780
Ou Xiao'an came here a few days ago, right?

315
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,210
He gave some suggestions.

316
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,680
Captain Wei doesn't understand the blueprints.

317
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,400
So he asked me to have a field visit

318
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,930
with engineering experts.

319
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,950
Okay.

320
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,170
Company Commander Shao,

321
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,530
show them around.

322
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,180
Yes.

323
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,630
This way, please.

324
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,380
Section Chief Li,

325
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,070
I remember the purpose of your 129th bomb shelter

326
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,700
is to protect us from Ohashi's gas bombs, right?

327
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,580
Yes.

328
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,880
If Ohashi is captured by us,

329
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,670
your 129th bomb shelter

330
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,450
will be useless, right?

331
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
You are implying something.

332
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,810
I don't mean anything else.

333
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,840
I just think

334
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,570
based on our current progress,

335
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,170
Ohashi will be caught sooner or later.

336
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,360
Before Ohashi is caught,

337
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,330
you should share things about your bomb shelter

338
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,590
while someone is still interested in it.

339
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,390
After all, you need Captain Wei's approval

340
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,720
to get the money to build the bomb shelter.

341
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,900
I don't mean anything else. I'm just saying.

342
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,290
Don't take it to heart.

343
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,620
Go on with your work.

344
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,680
Secretary Chen and Manqiu are missing?

345
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,560
Someone from Shen's Rice Shop told me

346
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,440
Director Wang went there himself.

347
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,610
But Wei Qingming replaced them.

348
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,319
Wen Yishan must have reported it to Wei Qingming.

349
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,000
It's my fault. I shouldn't have come out.

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,869
I should have figured out a way

351
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,260
to save them immediately.

352
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,210
No one can foresee this situation.

353
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,359
Since they have replaced them,

354
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,180
how do you know

355
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,060
they are not using Secretary Chen as a bait

356
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,520
to lure us into their trap?

357
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,569
I think they did this

358
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,440
because they are still worried about the peace talks.

359
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,589
So even though they have hidden them,

360
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,069
they dare not do anything.

361
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,270
Secretary Chen and Manqiu

362
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,660
should be safe for now.

363
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,750
We are so close

364
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,080
to save Secretary Chen.

365
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,630
Moqing,

366
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,160
calm down.

367
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,250
I know you've tried your best.

368
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,770
If it weren't for you,

369
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,200
maybe we wouldn't have known

370
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,530
the whereabouts of Secretary Chen by now.

371
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,260
How about this?

372
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
You go back first.

373
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,860
I'll figure out a way as soon as possible.

374
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,120
Okay.

375
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,600
You brought Ye Xuanmin back?

376
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,680
Wei Qingming replaced him

377
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,670
right after I brought him back at night.

378
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,700
The Communist Party's representative got angry in the hospital.

379
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,980
Commissioner Zhang in charge of the peace talks

380
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,140
was so embarrassed.

381
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,350
I brought him back.

382
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280
But considering what happened,

383
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,450
I'm afraid it's inconvenient for me to go to the hospital again.

384
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,620
I understand.

385
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,030
You want me to help you

386
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,310
investigate Ye Xuanmin's whereabouts.

387
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,030
I don't want to affect the peace talks

388
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,960
because of someone I brought back.

389
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,550
I'll ask my brother to contact Commissioner Zhang

390
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,070
and arrange a meeting between me and him.

391
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,290
At least I should let him know

392
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,550
I have nothing to do with replacing them.

393
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,740
Considering the current situation,

394
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,000
no matter who you go to,

395
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,530
remember this:

396
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,720
don't make it too obvious.

397
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,190
[Graphic design of the bomb shelter]

398
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,130
The whole bomb shelter is here, right?

399
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,640
Don't worry.

400
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,580
We've done field measurement for it.

401
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,380
Thank you, Section Chief Miao.

402
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,840
You know what to do, right?

403
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,840
Don't worry.

404
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
I won't tell anyone.

405
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,530
Get off.

406
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Okay.

407
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,250
Director Shen.

408
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,190
Is it necessary to think about this?

409
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,550
Done?

410
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,000
Your skill is really poor.

411
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,590
Captain Wei.

412
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,600
Director Shen.

413
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,130
Why are you here?

414
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,670
You're playing chess.

415
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,730
I'll play with you.

416
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,440
Sit.

417
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,030
You...

418
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,050
Sit.

419
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400
Whose turn?

420
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,450
Where is Ohashi Kazuya imprisoned?

421
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,740
You came at the right time.

422
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,200
I was just about to report to you and the boss.

423
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Vice Captain Wen

424
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,390
has caught Ohashi Kazuya.

425
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,740
They just transferred him to the station.

426
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,000
Nice move.

427
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
Wei Qingming.

428
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,440
You're playing tricks with the wrong person.

429
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,070
You sent someone to Guizhou without telling the boss

430
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,550
and created such chaos.

431
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
You think you can hide it from us?

432
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,260
I've never wanted to hide it. Never.

433
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,280
I was worried Zeng Jiwu's information was wrong.

434
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,230
So I wanted to catch him

435
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,770
before reporting to the boss.

436
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,640
I've never wanted to hide it.

437
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,690
You call this reporting to the boss?

438
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,450
Yes.

439
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,550
I searched everywhere in the Chongqing Station,

440
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,380
but I couldn't find Ohashi.

441
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,680
You want to imprison him and interrogate him yourself, right?

442
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,560
No, no.

443
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,440
I've never thought like this.

444
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,330
No.

445
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,780
In my opinion,

446
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
the Chongqing Station wants to be the home of the NBIS.

447
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,190
That's not true, Director Shen.

448
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,760
No matter how bold I am,

449
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,590
I wouldn't dare think like that.

450
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,140
I... Well...

451
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,340
Well, you said it yourself.

452
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,090
There is a mole in the Chongqing Station.

453
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,330
So I dare not

454
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,860
imprison Ohashi Kazuya in the station.

455
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,200
If anything happens,

456
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,500
how should I explain to you and the boss?

457
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,000
I give you an hour.

458
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,760
Transfer him to the headquarters.

459
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,400
I'll wait for you downstairs for five minutes.

460
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,440
Otherwise, you go explain to the boss yourself.

461
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,300
Director Shen.

462
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,220
Director Shen.

463
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,720
Captain,

464
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,320
which one do you think

465
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,650
is more important to you now

466
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,870
between Ohashi and Ye Xuanmin?

467
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,180
Of course Ohashi is more important.

468
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,840
If we find the gas bombs,

469
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,870
it'll be a tremendous achievement.

470
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,230
How can we give him to them?

471
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,780
Got it.

472
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,740
Director Shen, sorry

473
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,230
for keeping you waiting.

474
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,390
Get in.

475
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,690
Take me to him.

476
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,460
Director Shen,

477
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,580
he is in the station.

478
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,680
Open the door.

479
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,570
Miao,

480
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,920
who is this man?

481
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,930
Director Shen,

482
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,200
you've been with the boss for so many years.

483
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
You must have heard of

484
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,770
Ye Xuanmin, right?

485
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,060
He has another name.

486
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,340
Chen Ke, the person in charge of the Communist Party's underground organization

487
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,380
in Shanghai.

488
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,830
He was imprisoned in 810 for so long,

489
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,860
but the Communist Party has never given up looking for him.

490
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,930
It shows

491
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
how important he is

492
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,370
to the Communist Party.

493
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,970
Isn't this the person you want?

494
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,540
Chen Ke.

495
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,240
You are Chen Ke?

496
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,370
If you're not at the table, you're on the menu.

497
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,620
I just escaped from the Japanese,

498
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,980
but now I've fallen into

499
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,640
the CNP's hands.

500
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,020
Good.

501
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,870
Where is Ohashi?

502
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,430
I'm taking you to him now.

503
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,320
Secretary Sun, take him with us.

504
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,550
Aren't you looking for Ohashi?

505
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,850
I want both of them.

506
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,080
Director Shen,

507
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,990
it's not appropriate.

508
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,510
Everyone in the Chongqing Station

509
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,700
has worked hard for so long

510
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,750
in order to find 810.

511
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,430
We just made some progress.

512
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,480
You should at least

513
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
leave one to us.

514
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
What do you think?

515
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,310
Take Chen Ke away.

516
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,080
Thank you, Director Shen.

517
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,400
Thank you.

518
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,710
Miao,

519
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,920
well done.

520
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,720
It's nothing.

521
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,050
But it will take some time to get the information we need

522
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,280
from Ohashi.

523
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,970
No hurry. Take your time.

524
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,310
What a pity.

525
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,470
We just gave Chen Ke, an important person,

526
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,750
to Director Shen.

527
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,870
Captain.

528
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,200
I have something to tell you.

529
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,910
Right after Chen Ke was taken to the hospital last night,

530
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,760
Director Wang of the Communist Party went to ask for him.

531
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,590
In your opinion,

532
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,400
who leaked the information?

533
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,230
I suspected Qin Moqing.

534
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,850
But she brought him back from Guizhou.

535
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,380
Who else could it be?

536
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,950
What about Zeng Jiwu?

537
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,150
Impossible.

538
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,280
It's impossible that he has anything to do with the Communist Party.

539
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,230
Then it was...

540
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,440
someone in the hospital.

541
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,150
There are so many patients,

542
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,650
doctors, and nurses in the hospital.

543
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,470
It's not easy to find it out.

544
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,860
I'm still wondering

545
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,280
who told the boss about Ohashi.

546
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,860
These two vice captains are not easy to deal with.

547
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,980
Invite them to my office to have tea.

548
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,750
Yes.

549
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,440
Feng.

550
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
Can you explain

551
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,350
why Shen Congwu

552
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,910
found out

553
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,240
we've caught Ohashi so soon?

554
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,970
You want me to explain?

555
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,550
I just found out Ohashi has been caught.

556
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,810
What should I explain?

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,260
You really didn't leak the information?

558
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Wei Qingming!

559
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,000
You sent men to Guizhou

560
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,550
to catch Ohashi secretly.

561
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,130
Because you want to take the credit behind my back, right?

562
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,020
But now,

563
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,480
someone else wants to take the credit.

564
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,000
So you are blaming it on me.

565
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,360
I'm telling you, no way!

566
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,830
Feng.

567
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,160
Calm down.

568
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,080
Well, look at him.

569
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,120
Sit.

570
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,580
Listen to me.

571
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,880
Sit.

572
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,470
This matter

573
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,250
really has nothing to do with Feng, Wei.

574
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,790
When we went to catch Ohashi that day,

575
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,360
in order to deal with the Communist Party's guerrilla,

576
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,350
I asked the 20th Army of the CNP for reinforcements.

577
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,520
Who would have thought Regimental Commander Yang Jieli

578
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,340
of the 20th Army

579
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,420
wants to take a share of everything?

580
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,460
Catching Ohashi is a tremendous achievement.

581
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,440
Of course he wants to take the credit in front of the higher-ups.

582
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,080
Wen,

583
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,410
why didn't you tell me this earlier?

584
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,560
Look, it's all your fault.

585
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,080
I wronged Feng.

586
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,200
You really...

587
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,130
But

588
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,660
don't blame me.

589
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,560
I directly told Wen

590
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,700
to catch Ohashi.

591
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,180
How did the Communist Party's guerrilla

592
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,500
find out so soon?

593
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,330
Also,

594
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,530
right after Ye Xuanmin

595
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,110
and Li Manqiu arrived at the hospital,

596
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,520
the Communist Party's representative went there to ask for them.

597
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,460
Who leaked the information so quickly?

598
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,580
There's a mole in our station.

599
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,920
But don't worry.

600
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,860
Before the victory rally,

601
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,630
I will

602
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,280
catch the spy who betrayed

603
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,580
our party and country.

604
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,230
Wei,

605
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,080
let me make it clear.

606
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,950
If my men leaked the information,

607
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,630
I won't go easy on them.

608
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,540
I have the same attitude as Wen.

609
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,870
Let me make it clear too.

610
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,920
The three of us have worked together for years.

611
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,400
We should trust each other.

612
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,850
Help me keep an eye on my men.

613
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,880
If you find out

614
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,920
my men leaked the information,

615
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,420
I won't let them off.

616
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,270
Okay.

617
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,700
Open the door.

Section Chief Ou, sorry.

620
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,440
We received an order

621
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,490
that no one in this ward

622
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,470

Who is he to give me orders in the NBIS?

00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,210
It's really you.

637
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,540
You really are alive.

It's good that you're alive.

It's good that you're alive.

00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,960
You're better than me.

I heard

643
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,660
you're Section Chief Ou now.

644
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,350
It's useless.

645
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,640
Being able to get out alive

646
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,510
is better than anything, right?

647
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,480
Yes.

648
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,480
Being alive is all that matters.

649
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,620
Don't think about anything now.

650
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,560
Take good care of your health.

651
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,500
If you need anything after you recover,

652
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,630
feel free to tell me.

653
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,990
Me?

654
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,650
I'll just wait for the higher-ups' arrangement.

655
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,480
But after I recover,

656
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,510
I don't want to do legwork anymore.

657
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,080
It's so scary.

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,780

660
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,550

661
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,560
do you have any connection?

662
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,750
Help me find a cushy job

664
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,750
You still want a cushy job after you recover?

665
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,700
Fine.

666
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
I'll pay attention to it for you.

667
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,880
That's good.

668
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,060
I looked around

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,580
when I just came in.

670
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,030
Ye Xuanmin and Li Manqiu

671
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,500
aren't with you?

672
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,850
They said there are too many people here.

673
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,870
It's too crowded.

674
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,290
They prepared

675
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,860
a bigger and more comfortable place for them.

676
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,640
They are so lucky.

677
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,170
They were transferred?

678
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,310
Who took them away?

679
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,510
Zeng Jiwu.

680
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,080
Listen,

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,290
he's a fence-sitter.

682
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,970
He's full of bad ideas.

683
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,440
He is just like

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,540

685
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,540
There's one thing

686
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,060
I can't remember.

687
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,380
Who escaped from 810 with me

688
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,360
back then?

689
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,760
You escaped yourself.

690
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,720
Have you forgotten?

691
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,040
I was a rat in 810 for a long time.

692
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,150
There are many things

693
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,790
I can't remember.

694
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,960
You're right.

695
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,570
We suffered a lot in 810,

696
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,350
a horrible place.

697
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,810
We should feel lucky

698
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,280
that we didn't go crazy.

699
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,130
Indeed, someone escaped from 810

700
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,450
with you.

701
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,030
Let me think.

702
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,080
Let me think.

703
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,960
Think who it was.

704
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,710
Let me think.

705
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,780
Why can't I remember?

706
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,100
Lu Ziming.

707
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,360
It's okay. How about this?

708
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,660
I... Well...

709
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm going out to buy some roast chicken for you.

710
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,700
-Roast chicken?
-And some rabbit heads.

711
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,540
Rabbit heads?

712
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,670
I'll also buy you a bottle of wine.

713

You can have a drink and take your time.

714
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,140
Okay?

715
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,960
Have a drink.

716
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,130
Then I can definitely remember.

717
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,160
I can definitely remember.

718
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,830
Okay.

719
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,000
I can definitely remember.

720
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,950
Wait for me.

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,600

How has your brother been?

730
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,770
My brother has been fine.

731
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,790
He always talked about you.

732
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,429
He wants to treat you to a meal.

733
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,679
But you've been

734
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,040
very busy.

735
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,370
I've been busy with the cooperation between Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

736
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,620
You came at the right time.

737
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,949
I also wanted to see you.

738
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,830
I heard

739
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,909
two injured communists in the Army Hospital

740
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,330
were brought back by you.

741
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,350
Yes.

742
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,730
Help me confirm

743
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,139
if they are these two.

744
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,900
No.

745
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,699
I've never seen these two before.

746
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,400
Are you sure?

747
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,530
I'm sure. I've never seen them before.

748
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,410
What about these two?

749
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,180
I think yes.

750
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,950
But the two communists were covered with wounds yesterday.

751
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,400
I couldn't see clearly.

752
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,550
But they are definitely not these two.

753
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,600
Then the situation is clear now.

754
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
These are the photos of them

755
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
before they were imprisoned in 810.

756
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,960
Wei Qingming

757
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
is really cunning.

758
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,060
He almost fooled me.

759
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,310
Commissioner Zhang,

760
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,900
actually, this is also why

761
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,510
I came to you.

762
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,190
I'm worried once this matter is exposed,

763
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,090
it will affect the peace talks.

764
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,850
You're right.

765
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,940
This afternoon,

766
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,340
I'll talk to Wei Qingming

767
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
and get them back.

768
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,230
Is there anything you want me to do?

769
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,260
I know you work in the station.

770
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,770
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

771
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,450
However,

772
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,460
if Wei Qingming refuses to admit it, I hope

773
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,890
you can step forward

774
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,830
and tell the truth.

775
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,810
Don't worry about this.

776
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,210
I'm leaving.

777
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:22,930
Bye.

778
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,030
What's going on here?

779
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,170
The hospital is empty.

780
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,200
Empty?

781
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,360
What do you mean? Have you checked?

782
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,810
I've checked all the wards,

783
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,050
the warehouse,

784
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,690
and the basement.

785
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,020
I didn't see anyone.

786
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,880
Was everyone here when you came in the morning?

787
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,210
Everything was normal.

788
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,040
I just went out to buy some food and wine.

789
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
It became like this when I came back.

790
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,100
Well, how is this possible?

791
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,580
Dozens of people

792
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,320
just vanished into thin air

793
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,720
within such a short time?

794
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,050
The air defense warning.

795
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,810
What are you doing?

796
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,410
Who are you?

797
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,730
What...

798
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,210
What are you doing?

799
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,940
Who on earth are you?

800
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,170
Read it.

801
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,240
What is this?

802
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,180
Read it!

803
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,390
Doctors, nurses,

804
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,280
and patients, attention please.

805
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,730
We're going to have an air defense drill.

806
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,600
The Japanese army will bombard

807
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,230
the Army Hospital in five minutes.

808
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,070
Doctors and nurses,

809
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,260
stop what you are doing

810
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,450
and get the patients

811
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,450
into the military truck at the door immediately.

812
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,620
Remember,

813
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,570
nothing happened today.

814
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,720
Understand?

815
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,340
Yes.

816
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,550
Mr. Li, what's going on?

817
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,040
There's no need to get in the truck if it's a drill, right?

818
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,430
I don't know. We went to the basement

819
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,910
when we had an air defense drill before.

820
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,420
President, what's going on?

821
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,300
I don't know.

822
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,240
Everyone,

823
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,350
Captain Wei of the Chongqing Station of the NBIS

824
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,310
asked me to take you to a safe place.

825
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,810
It's very dangerous here.

826
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,720
Dangerous?

827
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,450
What's so dangerous?

828
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,120
When I fought the Japanese back then,

829
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,300
I saw all kinds of danger.

830
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,340
This?

831
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,640
What's so dangerous?

832
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,110
Everyone,

833
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,460
get in the truck now.

834
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,210
-Get in the truck.
-Get in the truck.

835
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,140
Carry him into the truck.

836
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,820
Yes.

837
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,550
Hurry, get off. Everyone.

838
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,030
Get off.

839
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,900

You didn't go to the 129th bomb shelter?

854
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,500
Only some final tasks are left.

855
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,310
There is no need to keep a constant eye on it.

856
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,840
It will be checked and delivered in a few days.

857
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,270
What's the use of it?

858
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,970
Everything you did is in vain.

859
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,550
It's obvious.

860
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,530
What's the purpose of building the 129th bomb shelter?

861
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,520
To protect us

862
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,320
from Ohashi's gas bombs, right?

863
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,580
But now,

864
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,470
Ohashi has been caught.

865
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,350
The bomb shelter

866
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,990
is useless.

867
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,600
Isn't that good?

868
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,620
I hoped there wouldn't be a need for the bomb shelter in the beginning.

869
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,350
Shaotang,

870
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,750
do you really not understand or are you pretending?

871
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,200
How much manpower and money

872
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,370
have you used to build the 129th bomb shelter?

873
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,410
But now, Ohashi has been caught.

874
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,300
The 129th bomb shelter is a joke.

875
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,240
How should we explain

876
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,110
to the boss

877
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,640
and Director Shen?

878
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,920
Wei Qingming and Wen Yishan are cunning.

879
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,300
They pulled the rug from under us.

880
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,170
They're so ruthless.

881
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
They want to kick us out

882
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,150
of the Chongqing Station.

883
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,800
To be honest,

884
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,050
I'd rather they didn't catch Ohashi.

885
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,830
From what you know about Captain Wei,

886
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,100
where do you think he will imprison Ohashi?

887
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,740
Chongqing is not big.

888
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,400
He is either in a hotel

889
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,200
or in a factory.

890
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,520
What?

891
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,120
You want to find him?

892
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,380
So what if you find him?

893
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,300
Do you want to get him out?

894
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,010
You're right.
