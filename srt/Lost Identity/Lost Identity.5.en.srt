00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,080
Go.

374
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,780
I'll let you know once there is a conclusion.

375
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,900
Yes.

376
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,430
Wen, don't be angry.

377
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,190
Go back and listen to what he's going to say.

378
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,060
Come.

379
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,280
Only you and Lou Mingyuan

380
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,050
were the direct contacts

381
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
of these five comrades in Shanghai.

382
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
After you two were arrested,

383
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,110
they were exposed immediately.

384
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,860
Did you

385
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,830
betray them?

386
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,610
It has nothing to do with me.

387
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,290
I never betrayed anyone.

388
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,000
Then Lou Mingyuan betrayed them.

389
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,830
They gave me so many drugs that my brain has been damaged.

390
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,160
There are a lot of things I can't remember.

391
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,920
I don't know if it was Lou Mingyuan.

392
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,910
That's his business.

393

Are you...

394
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,760
a communist or not?

395
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,740
I joined Kuomintang when I was a teenager.

396
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,630
I risked my life for the NBIS.

397
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,880
Why do you suspect that I'm a communist?

398
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,320
Because Lou Mingyuan is a communist.

399
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,250
You worked with him in Shanghai for so long.

400
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,150
Do you really have nothing to do with the Communist Party?

401

take a good look.

407
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,200
As the saying goes, a famous teacher has accomplished disciples.

408
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,830
Wen, look at your disciple.

409
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
He really makes you proud this time.

410
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,280
So back then,

411
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,760
you leaked the information on our

412
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,590
intelligence network in Shanghai to the Japanese

413
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,650
just to save the spy of the Communist Party.

Am I right?

415
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,380
No.

416

is not just a democratic writer, right?

Is he a communist or not?

So from the beginning,

462
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,600
he was a spy of the Communist Party in the NBIS.

463
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,550
You knew Lou Mingyuan's background clearly,

464
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,060
but you still sent me to Shanghai

465

561
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,290
You, come here.

562
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,980
Lou Mingyuan.

563
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,740
I'm fine.

564
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm okay.

565
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,590
Eat some.

566
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,389
No.

567
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,489
Eat some.

568
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,540
No.

569
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,080
No.

570
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Have some water.

571
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,560
No.

572
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,720
Have some water!

573
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,610
It's okay.

574
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Don't push your luck. Do you hear me?

575
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,670
Do you hear me?

576
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,430
Have some water!

577
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,980
I've contacted Sundial successfully.

578
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,530
I'll get him out of Shanghai as soon as possible.

579
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,710
Kill me.

580
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,660
Kill me.

581
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,090
I'll get you out of here soon.

582
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,010
No.

583
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,050
I'm not important.

584
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,350
You must save...

585
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,520
Ye Xuanmin.

586
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,680
I will save him

587
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,680

Keep an eye on him.

594
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,130
Okay.

595
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,380
If anything happens to him,

596
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,540

Since you can't remember anything,

604
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,950
let me ask you something else.

605
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,730
Ohashi painstakingly made this plan for you.

606
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,310
What's his purpose?

607
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,840
What plan did he make for me?

608
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,230
Keep pretending.

609
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,260
Come.

610
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,510
Look carefully. You already died.

611
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,160
How did you come back to life?

612
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,160
So this was your mission?

613
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,230
Yes.

614
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,960
But two days after that,

615
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,890
The Yomiuri Shimbun

616
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,730
confirmed the death of Ohashi.

617
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,250
That's your problem.

618
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,000
Ohashi is not dead.

619
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,070
These are Ohashi's conspiracy.

620
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,340
What's his conspiracy?

621
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,020
A substitute looking exactly like you.

622
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,550
The same time and location, and the telegram.

623
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,430
Ou Xiao'an,

624
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,050
who are you?

625
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,100
He planned all this for you.

626
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,020
The Cherry Blossom Project.

627
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
We're finally getting to the point.

628
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,960
I've been thinking these days

629
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,120
why Ohashi did this for you.

630
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,030
Now there is an explanation.

631
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,590
Because you have a very good memory.

632
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,040
You can remember everything you see.

633
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,200
Even though Sundial

634
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,950
burnt the files of the Cherry Blossom Project,

635
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,750
you can write them down

636
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,250
and give them to Ohashi.

637
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,220
Right?

638
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,090
He

639
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,960
used the fire

640
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,790
and your fake death

641
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,180
to make us think

642
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,860
the Cherry Blossom Project failed completely.

643
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,100
In fact, he's still carrying on with the project in 810.

644
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,370
I will never help Ohashi Kazuya

645
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,780
harm Chinese people.

646
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,780
Where exactly is 810?

647
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,840
Where exactly is Ohashi Kazuya?

648
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,830
Did he send you back?

649
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,700
Why did he send you back?

650
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,770
Tell me!

651
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,380
I'm not a Japanese spy.

652
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,890
I'm not.

653
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,050
If you're not,

654
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,960
am I?

655
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,660
I don't care.

656
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,110
I'm not.

657
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,810
Back then, Sundial,

658
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,310
namely Li Shaotang,

659
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,060
didn't give the files

660
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,220
to the NBIS, right?

661
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,350
What do you mean?

662
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,170
Li Shaotang gave the files of the Cherry Blossom Project

663
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,560
to Ohashi Kazuya.

664
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,350
Li Shaotang helped Ohashi Kazuya

665
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,130
carry out the Cherry Blossom Project secretly.

666
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,960
Li Shaotang?

667
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Let me tell you.

668
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,840
When Li Shaotang came back,

669
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,000
he immediately

670
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,460
gave the files of the Cherry Blossom Project to the NBIS.

671
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,950
We asked experts to verify them

672
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,890
and confirmed

673
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,440
they are the original files of the Cherry Blossom Project.

674
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,200
Li Shaotang...

675
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,710
What's Li Shaotang's position

676
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,400
in the NBIS now?

682
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,100
we intercepted encrypted emergency messages of the Japanese.

683
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,650
We've deciphered all of them.

684
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,690
When did you intercept them?

685
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,700
An hour ago.

686
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,370
[Jiang Zhanxin, Section Chief of the Deciphering Section of the Special Technology Research Lab in the Chongqing Station of the NBIS]

687
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,610
They were all written with the Japanese army's general codes.

688
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,650
There are five letters in total.

and yellow bombs mean?

692
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,750
According to the information,

693
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,910
red and yellow bombs represent

694
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,170
gas bombs used by the Japanese army.

695
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,000

as what Section Chief Li found in Guhe.

697
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520

712
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,270
there is a spy in the Chongqing Station.

You want us to believe a traitor

720

and believe Shaotang is a spy?
