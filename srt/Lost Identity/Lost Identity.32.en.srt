[Episode 32]

4
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,400
I've thought it over and over.

5
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,910
I feel like I can only come to you about this.

6
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,360
How about it?

7
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,960
This matter is not easy.

8
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,270
If it were

9
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,880
just kidnapping someone,  it would be doable.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,810
But his identity is too sensitive.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,440
So many people are watching.

12
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,950
And I need to get information out of him.

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,610
That's not easy.

14
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,590
I know it's difficult.

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,990
If it were easy, I wouldn't have come to you.

16
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,840
Let me tell you,

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,310
if this goes

18
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,230
even slightly wrong,

19
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,040

At this critical moment,

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,240
don't do anything that complicates things further.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,220
If one link is disrupted,

23
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,070
the whole chain will fall apart. Do you understand?

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,810
Are you bargaining with me?

25
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,160
Not bargaining.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,810
It's just really hard to do.

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,020
I can help you find Lu Ziming and his men.

28
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,000
You have news of Lu Ziming?

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,390
My brother has connections in Chongqing.

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,320
You shouldn't underestimate him.

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
Your brother is so capable.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
Why don't you ask him to handle it?

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,790
Well.

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
What leverage do they have over you?

35
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,800
Alright, I won't hide it from you anymore.

The purpose was to save those students.

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Were you there too?

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,230

to bring Zheng Bangyao to Chongqing

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,410

Involving him at this point

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,060
is still very risky.

152
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,450
Definitely accurate.

153
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,070
Qin Moqing saved me back then.

154
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,190

with Ye Xuanmin.

156
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,280

157
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,690
back on Scott Road?

158
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,650
I didn’t know

who she was back then.

160
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,850
Besides, she saved me.

161
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,110
It was just a few days ago

162
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,190
that Captain Zeng sent me a photo

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,250
to identify her.

164
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,180
He also said

165
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,310
there would be a reward of ten gold bars

166
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,170
for significant contributions.

167
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,040
That's why

168
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,520
I came forward.

169
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,570
Captain Zeng promised to give you ten gold bars?

170
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,500
Besides Captain Zeng,

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,470
did you tell anyone else about this matter?

172
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,520
No, I haven’t told anyone.

173
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,800
Captain Zeng specifically instructed me

174
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,110
not to mention it to anyone

175
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,550
until I arrived in Chongqing.

176
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
Of course.

177
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
You're not an outsider.

178
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
That's good.

179
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,140
It's been two hours.

180
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,270
Go back to the station.

181
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,950
Yes.

182
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
Captain Ou.

183
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,230
This isn’t the way to the east of the city.

184
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,660
Where are you taking me?

185
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,170
The station is afraid of leaks,

186
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,350
which could compromise your safety.

187
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,440
So they instructed me

188
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,080
to take you to our safe house.

189
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,380
Safe house?

190
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,950
Safe house.

191
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,180

[129 Air Raid Shelter Floor Plan]

381
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,030
Good.

382
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,950
Your task

383
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,550
is already partially completed.

384
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,110
You're so kind.

385
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,170
You even treat me to a meal?

386
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,260
Ms. Miao, I admire you.

387
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,460
I want to be friends with you.

388
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,940
Is that okay?

389
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,920
Aren’t we friends already?

390
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,950
If we're friends,

391
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,000
why don't you wear the lipstick I gave you?

392
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,590
It doesn't suit me.

393
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,850
You're pretty.

394
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,090
Actually, you can be gentler.

395
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,470
Thank you.

396
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,930
Here.

397
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,930
Try it. This is the specialty from my hometown.

398
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,810
Sukiyaki.

399
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,720
Alright.

400
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,750
Hoko.

401
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,940
I came to talk to you

402
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,670
about Ohashi.

403
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,320
I met with him.

404
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,690
He’s tight-lipped.

405
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,680
So

406
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,280
I haven’t gotten anything about Lanshan.

407
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,220
My old classmate

408
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,230
still has the same temperament.

409
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,170
You and he are classmates?

410
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,550
We were taught by the same mentor.

411
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,350
We are classmates and competitors.

412
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,090
Just because he’s a man,

413
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,430
our mentor always favored him more.

414
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,980
So I had to compete with him in everything.

415
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,850
Unfortunately, this time

416
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,960
he led the Cherry Blossom Project.

417
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
It seemed

418
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,870
like he won.

419
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,800
He's dead.

420
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,630
The Cherry Blossom Project

421
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,290
should end, right?

422
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,230
So this is my chance.

423
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,490
Those people from 810

424
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,920
are in your hands, right?

425
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:44,890
Yes.

426
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,920
This might be

427
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,430
an opportunity for us

428
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,700
to lure out Lanshan.

429
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
So the poison gas bombs from Ohashi before,

430
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,280
plus these people,

431
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,300
are the best bait, right?

432
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,130
Have you heard of

433
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,020
Ohashi locking a group of people in a room

434
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,580
and releasing gas before?

435
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,100
Yes.

436
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,760
It was to test 810's gas bombs.

437
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,280
I think

438
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,070
Ohashi was too stupid.

439
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,650
He painstakingly developed

440
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,130
the poison gas bombs

441
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,160
but tested them

442
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,910
by locking people in a room.

443
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,690
What’s the point of the gas bombs then?

444
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,390
If we could put these people

445
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,320
in an open field,

446
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,670
allow them to run freely,

447
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,100
and then release the poison gas bombs,

448
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,720
calculate the effective killing radius

449
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,110
of the gas bombs outdoors.

450
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,800
That’s the proper test for the poison gas bombs,

451
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
isn’t it?

452
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,660
You’re ruthless.

453
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,150
So where are the poison gas bombs?

454
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,720
Ohashi went to great lengths

455
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,310
to transport the poison gas bombs to Chongqing.

456
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,750
He could deceive NBIS

457
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,320
and the Communist Party,

458
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,790
but he couldn’t fool me.

459
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,770
I understand.

460
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,920
Ohashi played his cards well

461
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,460
and led the Cherry Blossom Project.

462
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,430
And you

463
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,320
came to take over.

464
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,270
Who did the higher-ups reassign

465
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,310
as your contact?

466
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,670
Chie Hoko.

467
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,150
Congratulations.

468
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,390
If it's her,

469
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,230
then you don’t have much time.

470
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,770
You intercepted me

471
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,880
and the poison gas bombs.

472
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,670
So Ohashi’s capture

473
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,450
was also your plan.

474
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,590
You even want to intercept Lanshan.

475
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,150
But Lanshan

476
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,190
is Ohashi’s operative.

477
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,030
So you want to find him

478
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,760
and kill him,

479
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,160
right?

480
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,690
You

481
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,450
killed Tanaka Koji.

482
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,580
You should’ve been dead long ago.

483
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,880
Why have I kept you until today?

484
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,510
Because you're smart.

485
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,160
Quick, try it. It’s fresh.

486
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,810
Dad.

487
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,340
You were looking for us?

488
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,130
Dad.

489
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,430
I’m picking a date for you.

490
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,860
Do you still believe in this?

491
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,750
Of course, you need a good day

492
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,010
for such an important event as marriage.

493
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,320
I’ve picked it. Here.

494
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,520
The 14th of the 8th lunar month. That'll be the day.

495
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,810
That’s soon.

496
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,670
The sooner, the better.

497
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,310
Hurry up and get ready.

498
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,460
Go take your wedding photos soon.

499
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,140
I want to announce it.

500
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,840
I want everyone to know

501
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,730
that I, Feng Yunian, is marrying off my daughter.

502
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,310
Jingxian.

503
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,150
You know what?

504
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,730
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

505
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,570
Besides,

506
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,170
this studio

507
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,310
is the best in all of Chongqing.

508
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,870
If they

509
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,150
don’t take good photos of you,

510
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,600
I’ll have this place smashed.

511
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,880
Groom and bride.

512
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,120
We're ready.

513
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,440
Okay.

514
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,030
Groom and bride.

515
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,590
Don't blink. Keep smiling.

516
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,280
Ready.

517
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,150
Three, two, one.

518
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,110
I won.

519
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,290
You’re good today.

520
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,820
This time big, last time small.

521
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,300
Trust me, bet small.

522
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,390
Open, open, small.

523
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,580
Trust me.

524
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,060
Bet on small next time.

525
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,230
Of course.

526
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,150
Small.

527
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,590
Dachun, you’re here again?

528
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,800
You lose every day and still come.

529
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,950
Do you have money?

530
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,220
Who do you think you’re looking down on?

531
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,180
What?

532
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,670
Did you steal the money again?

533
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,120
Not yours anyway.

534
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,580
Go get me some water.

535
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,800
Get me some water.

536
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,350
I'm leaving.

537
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,120
Go.

538
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,440
Again. Come on.

539
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,270
Bet. Bet. Bet.

540
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,040
Big. Big.

541
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,310
Again. Again.

542
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,960
Double. Double.

543
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,440
Double.

544
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
Double. Double.

545
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,110
Pay up!

546
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,230
Pay up! hurry up!

547
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,199
Next round.

548
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,040
Trust me, guys, this round is odd.

549
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,870
Come on, place your bets.

550
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,800
Place your bets.

551
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,409
Odd.

552
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
We won.

553
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,870
I'm right, aren't I?

554
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,860
Look at you two.

555
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,070
Next round is still odd.

556
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,980
Come on.

557
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,220
Yes, odd.

558
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Alright, place your bets.

559
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,120
Three, four, five.

560
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,850
Good. Come on.

561
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,150
Odd.

562
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,350
Three, four, five.

563
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,130
Odd.

564
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,430
Odd.

565
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,470
Odd.

566
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,390
We won!

567
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,000
Three, four, five. I take all.

568
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,280
Wait.

569
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,480
What are you doing?

570
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,070
Darn it.

571
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,330

If your party remains obstinate,

670
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,420

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,470
If you can change your allegiance,

681

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,650
that the generalissimo will hold you in high regard.

683
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,380
Of course, I understand

684
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,800
that someone like you

685
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,380
is prepared to sacrifice for your beliefs.

686
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,830
But after a life of military struggle

687
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,590
and enduring hardships,

688
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,430
you may not even

689
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,670
live to see

690
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,510
your so-called belief shine and prosper.

691
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,580
Why bother?

692
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,580
Do you know what belief is?

693
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,590
Do you understand belief?

694
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,240
Do you have belief?

695
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,760
It’s because of people like you,

696
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,120
who exploit the nation's suffering to line your pockets,

697
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,540
ignoring the clamor

698
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,120
of war

699
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,280

700
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,720
while hypocritically claiming

701
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,230
to serve the country and the people,

702
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,200
that makes you despicable.

been prepared to sacrifice.

709
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,630
Though the war against Japan is won,

710
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,190
the fight isn’t over.

711
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,610
As long as people like you are alive

712
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,160

713
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,430
armed,

714
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,560
we will

715

717

I respect your choice.

718
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,030
But I must tell you

719
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,910
that you and your party

720
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,250
only have a few days to consider.

721
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,550
I hope to hear soon

722
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,910
that you have abandoned your party

723
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,170

724

a brighter path.
