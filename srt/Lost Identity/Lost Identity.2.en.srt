[Episode 2]

4
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,660
Where is he?

5
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,690
Hurry up and find him.

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,740
This place is a dump.

7
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,490
Do people actually live here?

8
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,500
Really.

9
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,460
Don't move.

10
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,010
What is

11
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,450
this place?

12
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,050
Bro.

13
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't understand

14
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,700
what you're saying.

15
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,010
Are you Chinese?

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,370
And you?

17
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,810
Bro.

18
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,270
Whether you're Chinese

19
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,700
or... Or Japanese,

20
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,890
I advise you to put the gun down.

21
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,750
There is the Expeditionary Force everywhere here.

22
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,660
What year

23
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,770
is it now?

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,230
The 34th year

25
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,780
of the Republic of China.

26
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,730
The 34th year of the Republic of China?

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,350
The 20th year of the Showa era.

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,950
1945.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,340
You can say whatever you want.

30
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,260
Where is this place?

31
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,290
This is Lashio, Myanmar.

32
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,650
Lashio?

33
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,650
Lashio.

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,450
What's the unit number?

35
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,490
The 114th Regiment

36
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,140
of the 38th Division

37
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,940
of the Chinese-American Combined Expeditionary Forces

38
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,200
stationed in Myanmar.

39
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,420
Who's the commanding officer?

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,610
The Chief of Staff,

41
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,840
Du Guolun.

42
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
Chinese-American Combined Forces?

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,790
Yes.

44
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,210
Why are there Japanese flags?

45
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,970
This camp was originally

46
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,180
the Japanese command post.

47
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,290
But not anymore.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,570
Now it's the Expeditionary Forces'.

49
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,329
Where is he?

50
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,050
Where is he? Find him!

51
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,130
Where is he?

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,700
B-b-b... Bro.

53
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,780
Are they here to capture you?

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,020
I'm telling you.

55
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,380
This place is all primeval forest.

56
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,220
You can't escape.

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,570
Don't talk.

58
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,180
Stand against the wall.

59
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,490
He's here.

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Here.

61
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Quickly, come back.

62
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,850
Hurry up!

63
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,420
Don't shoot!

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
I am

65
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,200
from the Republic of China...

66
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,580
How dare you threaten me!

67
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,020
Where am I?

68
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,170
You're awake?

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,340
Let me ask you a few questions.

70
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,330
Are you Chinese or Japanese?

71
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,020
What's your name?

72
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,850
Who are you?

73
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,690
I'm asking you questions.

74
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,340
What's your name?

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,140
Why did you handcuff me here?

76
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,250
I'll say it again.

77
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,580
Now I'm the one asking you.

78
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,690
I know you're asking me.

79
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,170
Where am I now?

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,270
You'd better think carefully.

81
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,890
Even if you are not Japanese,

82
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,490
you're at least a traitor and a lackey.

83
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,820
I can kill you right now.

84
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,100
No one can stop me.

85
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,380
I'm Chinese.

86
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,020
Chinese.

87
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,260
I'll say it again.

88
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,050
What's your name?

89
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,050
Say it.

90
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,010
Chief of Staff Du.

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,070
Chief of Staff Du.

92
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,130
Calm down.

93
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you.

94
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,450
It’s him.

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,460
Chief of Staff Du.

96
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,170
Section Chief Qin.

97
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,020
I just thought he looked a bit familiar.

98
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,570
So

99
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,660
I made a round of calls

100
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,650
to our station.

101
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,040
I finally remembered.

102
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,090
I've seen his photo in the NBIS archives.

103
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,370
He

104
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,780
is Wen Yishan's most prized disciple,

105
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,620
who killed two NBIS guys

106
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,409
and became a Japanese lackey.

107
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,450
He is Ou Xiao'an!

108
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,110
What lackey?

109
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,420
You're saying he's Ou Xiao'an?

110
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,650
Yes.

111
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,420
You and he

112
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,310
are both disciples of Wen Yishan.

113
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,450
Logically,

114
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,810
you should call him Senior.

115
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,620
Wasn't he executed back then?

116
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,780
Yes, he was shot by Captain Wei and Miao

117
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,690
in Hong Kong

118
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,770
back then.

119
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,910
Right. So did he come back to life?

120
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,490
Let me take another look.

121
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,370
Chief of Staff.

122
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,670
Since he is a traitor from our Chongqing Station,

123
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,130
I suggest we handle his interrogation.

124
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,810
Since he's a traitor,

125
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,780
fine.

126
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,010
I'd rather avoid trouble.

127
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,940
I'll leave him to you.

128
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,880
Thank you.

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,220
I'll treat you to some good wine tonight.

130
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,420
Section Chief Qin, you interrogate him.

131
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,350
I'll supervise.

132
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,290
My name is Qin Moqing.

133
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,170
I am also a disciple of Mr. Wen.

134
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,660
We can be considered as having the same teacher.

135
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,190
Don't worry. I'll help you.

136
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,730
You are also Wen Yishan's disciple.

137
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,130
We're both from NBIS, right?

138
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,870
Yes, we are both from NBIS.

139
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,330
Then where is this place?

140
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,340
Why are you handcuffing me here?

141
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,980
You were executed by the Chongqing Station

142
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,140
because you betrayed Kuomintang.

143
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Did you mistake me for someone else?

144
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm not Ou Hyo'an, am I?

145
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,340
Ou Xiao'an.

146
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,330
Don't play dumb. Don't play dumb!

147
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,700
Are you interrogating him or me doing it?

148
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,580
Sorry.

149
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,940
Did you lose your memory

150
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,210
or are you out of your mind due to the attack?

151
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,380
You are sent to pick me up

152
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,390
by the Chongqing Station, right?

153
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,930
Ou Xiao'an.

154
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,900
If you keep playing dumb with me,

155
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,360
I won't be able to help you.

156
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,730
Do you remember where you escaped from?

157
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,610
I’m not pretending. I…

158
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,540
Do you remember 810?

159
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,330
Did Chongqing Station send you

160
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,100
to pick me up?

161
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,820
What about Ohashi Kazuya?

162
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,810
Both you and Ohashi Kazuya were shot dead back then.

163
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,740
Did you come back to life together?

164
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,300
What do you mean?

165
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,010
Who is Ohashi Kazuya?

166
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,410
Why did you handcuff me here?

167
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,780
Well.

168
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,460
Why did you change my clothes?

169
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,810
He's pretending to have amnesia.

170
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,980
I didn't.

171
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,970
I'm asking you why you handcuffed me.

172
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,300
He doesn't seem to be pretending.

173
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,330
Who's pretending to have amnesia?

174
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
What happened?

175
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,140
I don't think he's pretending.

176
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,220
Let go.

177
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,490
Give him sedatives.

178
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,410
Give him sedatives.

179
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,210
Let go of me.

180
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,410
Based on the X-ray examination of his brain,

181
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,340
it appears that he has suffered considerable damage,

182
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,070
so his memory is very confused.

183
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,980
He can't remember many things.

184
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,870
I hit him.

185
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,120
He is emotionally unstable.

186
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,980
Did he lose his memory?

187
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,880
Impossible.

188
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,090
He's pretending.

189
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,610
You... You were tricked.

190
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,370
Even if he can trick me,

191
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,230
he can't trick this.

192

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,450
with you two.

378
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,330
Who?

379
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,100
Your other student,

380
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,650
who almost

381
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,820
became Feng's son-in-law.

382
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,580
Ou Xiao'an?

383
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,930
Hurry.

384
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
The station has arranged it.

385
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,020
We'll stay here tonight.

386
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,570
It's shabby. Can it work?

387
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,530
You guys, take a look over there.

388
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,940
This way, please.

389
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,660
Have a rest. Call me if you need anything.

390
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,330
Okay.

391
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,530
That's it?

392
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,580
Just make do with it.

393
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,840
You two stay in this room. I'll stay outside.

394
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,340
Come here.

395
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,050
Sit down.

396
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,810
You're so meticulous.

397
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,620
So professional.

398
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,850
Thank you. In our line of work,

399
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,740
our heads are always held high.

400
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,860
What should I do?

401
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,660
What should I do?

402
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,130
Besides,

403
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,610
if you run away,

404
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,530
how am I supposed to report back?

405
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,870
Don't move while checking your blood pressure.

406
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,820
Checking blood pressure again?

407
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,770
Darn it.

408
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,340
This place is so shabby.

409
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,020
There's no hot water in the room.

410
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,620
Please get a pot downstairs.

411
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,530
You want me to go?

412
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,500
Who else?

413
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,480
I'll go.

414
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,530
Your blood pressure is fine.

415
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,860
How do you feel these days?

416
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,060
I feel dizzy.

417
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,290
I keep hearing things that aren't there. And I can't hear clearly.

418
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,500
The headache is a normal physical reaction

419
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,780
after your injury.

420
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,290
Currently, medical conditions are limited,

421
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,210
so we can only provide conservative treatment.

422
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,050
As for the hallucinations you mentioned,

423
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,910
they might be part of your memory recovery process.

424
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,800
If you remember anything,

425
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,260
please inform me promptly

426
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,110
to facilitate further recovery treatment.

427
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,230
You seem quite interested in my affairs.

428
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,300
I'm a doctor.

429
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,670
And you are my patient.

430
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,890
I saved you from the pile of dead people.

431
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,810
Of course, I don't want

432
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,610
my efforts to be wasted.

433
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,130
It's also my responsibility

434
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,970
to help you recover your memory.

435
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,210
You are also interested in my identity.

436
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,410
When I saved you,

437
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,610
you were in Japanese military uniform.

438
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,250
I'm not only a doctor,

439
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,930
but also a Chinese soldier.

440
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,540
The situation is chaotic now.

441
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,570
Of course, I have to stay alert

442
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,540
to an unidentified person

443
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,060
like you as I should.

444
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,290
Where is the cloth in my pocket?

445
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,810
Is that cloth important?

446
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,730
Does it have anything to do with you wearing Japanese military uniform?

447
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,750
You said you saved me from the pile of dead people.

448
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,860
Where is my stuff?

449
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,260
I saved you.

450
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,610
But the doctor wasn't in charge of cleaning the belongings.

451
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,010
How is he?

452
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,450
He won't die, right?

453
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,450
He's fine.

454
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,850
Keep an eye on him.

455
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,770
The Chongqing Station is waiting to interrogate him.

456
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,300
If anything happens to him,

457
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,090
we don't know who will die.

458
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,610
How can you talk to me like that?

459
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,000
Behave yourself!

460
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,420
Don't move.

461
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,970
[Feng Jingxian, Fiancee of Li Shaotang]

462
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,360
She always plays the same song.

463
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,740
Shaotang.

464
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,810
What do you think

465
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,010
of Ou Xiao'an's sudden appearance?

466
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,170
I just didn't expect

467
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,040
he was still alive.

468
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,170
Yes.

469
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,860
He's not only alive,

470
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,530
but he's also back.

471
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,990
I feel there's more to this

472
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,670
than meets the eye.

473
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
Let's not let Jingxian know for now.

474
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,140
Okay.

475
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
But

476
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,020
my stance hasn't changed.

477
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,070
Whether Ou Xiao'an

478
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,380
returns or not,

479
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,770
one thing is certain.

480
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,290
You and Jingxian

481
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,010
will get married.

482
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,180
You're the son-in-law I've chosen.

483
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,020
Got it?

484
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,740
Ou Xiao'an

485
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,130
is a traitor of Kuomintang.

486
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,060
Chongqing Station can't save him,

487
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,450
nor Wen Yishan.

488
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,750
Whether he comes back or not

489
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,290
doesn't matter.

490
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
In my opinion,

491
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,450
you two should

492
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,420
get married as soon as possible.

493
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,810
Thank you, Vice Captain Feng.

494
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,810
That'll be great.

495
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,190
Hearing what you said,

496
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm relieved.

497
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,530
Relieved of what?

498
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,690
Dad, Shaotang.

499
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,310
What are you talking about?

500
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,010
Ask him.

501
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,660
Vice Captain Feng just suggested

502
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,700
us to

503
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,530
hold the engagement ceremony as soon as possible.

504
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,620
Really?

505
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,010
Dad, you agree?

506
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,410
Of course.

507
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,650
Master, My Lady.

508
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,220
Mr. Li, time to eat.

509
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,670
Okay.

510
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,340
Shaotang.

511
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,480
Your trip to Guhe this time was tough.

512
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,730
Jingxian and I hosted a reception for you today.

513
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,330
Let's have a few more drinks.

514
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,960
Vice Captain Feng.

515
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,290
I won't eat dinner.

516
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,090
Tomorrow morning, I still need to report to Director Shen.

517
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,420
I haven't finished the data.

518
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,500
Is there a new task?

519
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,420
There's a job related to biochemical and protective measures.

520
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,050
I think my superior thinks I'm familiar with it.

521
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,850
Okay.

522
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,950
This is the trust of your superior.

523
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,970
Prepare well

524
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,420
and seize the opportunity.

525
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,750
Yes, Vice Captain Feng.

526
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Still calling me Vice Captain Feng?

527
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,730
You are right.

528
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,560
Dad.

529
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,060
Okay, get back to work.

530
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,970
Okay.

531
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,700
Dad, let's eat.

532
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,310
What do you mean?

533
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,650
You can sleep on the bed.

534
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,170
But you don't have the right to put on a quilt.

535
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,450
Really.

536
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,780
Just make do with a blanket.

537
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,660
Ou Xiao'an.

538
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,990
Stop pretending to be asleep.

539
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,870
I have something to ask you.

540
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,650
In the 31st year of the Republic of China,

541
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,290
I just entered Chongqing Station.

542
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,460
At that time,

543
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,580
I heard that

544
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,860
there was an outstanding figure

545
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,320
in the Operations Section

546
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,510
called Ou Xiao'an.

547
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,420
He's good at martial arts,

548
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,740
has good shooting skills,

549
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,410
and has a super-powerful brain

550
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,060
so that he can remember things really quickly.

551
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,990
His experience is more legendary.

552
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,170
First, he betrayed NBIS

553
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,960
and then joined the Japanese.

554
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,700
When a man is talented,

555
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,010
he has many ways.

556
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,460
And he can gain popularity.

557
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,340
Impressive.

558
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,590
Now it's just the two of us. Tell me the truth.

559
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,290
Which side are you on?

560
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,650
Guess which side I am on.

561
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,410
Stop it. I'm asking you.

562
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,490
You don't want to be punished, do you?

563
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,690
I can kill you.

564
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,450
Tell me.

565
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,610
Let me tell you about my past.

566
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,810
Sure.

567
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,610
Tell me.

568
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,010
When I

569
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,980
was only five,

570
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,010
I was caught by the Japanese.

571
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,460
They took me back

572
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,790
to a secret base in Japan

573
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,260
to receive strict training.

574
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,760
I learnt martial arts,

575
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,090
shooting skills,

576
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,730
surviving techniques,

577
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,740
and information test.

578
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,410
They want me to go back to China

579
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,330
to be their spy.

580
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,890
But I had grown up.

581
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,010
I knew I'm Chinese.

582
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,810
I wanted to go back to my hometown.

583
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,410
You didn't forget your origin.

584
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,450
I needed to help the Chinese beat them up.

585
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,090
And then?

586
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,090
One day,

587
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,650
I ran out

588
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,810
when they didn't pay attention.

589
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,180
I ran through the jungle

590
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,330
and went on.

591
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,530
There were mountains behind me.

592
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,490
I kept running

593
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,610
in the jungle.

594
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,650
They were going after me.

595
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,700
I kept running...

596
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,850
Then what happened? Where did you go?

597
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,690
Where did you go?

598
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
Are you stupid?

599
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,090
You even fell asleep while you were telling the story.

600
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,900
Fine. Continue the story tomorrow.

601
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
It's only midway through the story.

602
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,870
You are making me curious.

603
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,560
They are Japanese.

604
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,489
We can't stay here anymore.

605
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,820
We must go back to Chongqing immediately.

606
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,449
Ou Xiao'an.

607
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,380
Bastard!

608
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,489
Put the gun down!

609
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,739
Put the gun down!

610
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,870
Section Chief Qin, take him...

611
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,179
Mr. Ou.

612
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,690
I know with your ability,

613
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,460
if you want to leave,

614
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,610
we can't stop you.

615
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,300
But your brain has been hurt.

616
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,900
If you still want to know the truth,

617
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,940
put down your gun

618
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,710
and go back to Chongqing with us.

619
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,850
If you don't go back to Chongqing,

620
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,850
or figure out what happened

621
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,090
in these years,

622
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,530
then your name will be engraved

623
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,260
on the pillar of shame of betraying your country.

624
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,450
Report this mission

625
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,880
to Mr. Dai directly.

626
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,580
You don’t need to report to me.

627
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,610
Keep it a secret.

628
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,980
Don’t worry.

629
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,110
Please tell Mr. Dai

630
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,530
I will complete the task.

631
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,930
I'll wait for your information.

632
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,690
Okay.

633
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,330
Shaotang.

634
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,850
Come up and have some tea.

635
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,180
Yes.

636
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,770
The Lu'an Guapian Tea that has just arrived.

637
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,370
Try it. It'll cool you down.

638
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,610
Captain Wei.

639
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,170
If you need anything, just tell me.

640
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,920
You're always

641
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,690
reporting to Director Shen.

642
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,190
How could I dare to give you orders?

643
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,170
What mission

644
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,140
did Director Shen give you?

645
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,250
Sorry, Captain.

646
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,970
Director Shen told me not to tell anyone.

647
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,220
But I think Mr. Dai

648
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,900
will tell you personally.

649
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,770
I won't rush.

650
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,710
I understand.

651
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,960
I understand.

652
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,900
This mission was personally assigned by Mr. Dai.

653
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,300
Not only do I understand,

654
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,660
but I will also fully support it.

655
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,900
Thank you, Captain.

656
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,980
Shaotang.

657
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,810
Every place has its own rules.

658
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,530
Whether it's Vice Captain Wen,

659
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,860
or your father-in-law,

660
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,050
Vice Captain Feng,

661
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,890
they are both my subordinates.

662
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,810
You are their subordinate.

663
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,650
Tell me then.

664
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,570
My subordinates' subordinate

665
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,690
surpassed me

666
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,810
and was assigned a mission

667
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,700
by my superior directly.

668
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
As the Captain,

669
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,260
I don't know what the mission is.

670
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,850
Do you think

671
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,210
this is good?

672
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,680
It's indeed not proper. Captain.

673
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
But have you ever thought

674
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,740
if I did a good job in this mission,

675
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,290
it's all thanks to your guidance, Captain Wei.

676
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,850
It's all thanks to the entire Chongqing Station.

677
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,980
If I screw it up,

678
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,610
it's all my fault.

679
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,290
So, Captain,

680
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,500
you’d better

681
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,740
not know.

682
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,290
Feng taught you well.

683
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,090
You are so sophisticated

684
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,100
at such a young age.

685
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,380
No wonder

686
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,610
Mr. Dai trusts you so much.

687
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,610
Captain.

688
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,020
If there's nothing else,

689
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,370
I'll get going.

690
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,940
There's nothing else.

691
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,780
Go ahead.

692
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,990
Sorry, Captain.

693
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,090
I’m leaving.

00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,410
-Why are you still here?
-Dad.

697
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,180
Didn't you say you'd come down after you're dressed?

698
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,010
After considering all the options,

699
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,870
I still think this one looks good.

700
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,050
What do you think?

701
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,860
This one?

702
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,570
This looks familiar.

703
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,890
This is

704
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,010
the one I chose

705
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,610
when Ou Xiao'an and I were getting married.

707
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,310
Has Shaotang seen this?

708
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
No.

709
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,540
Only you and Ou Xiao'an know about this.

710
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,330
Besides,

711
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,210
he's gone now.

712
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,370
What if he is alive?

713
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,680
What?

714
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,180
-Dad.
-Master.

715
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,650
Your secretary is here.

716
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,050
He said he had something important to report to you.

717
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,360
Okay, I'll be right there.

718
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,130
Okay.

719
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,290
Dad, you...

721
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,770
It's not good if Shaotang knows about it.

722
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,900
Change another one.

723
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,700
Go pick the best and the most expensive one tomorrow.

Something happened in Yunnan.

731
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,310
They met assassins sent by the Japanese.

732
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,020
Are they okay?

733
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,750
Fortunately, our men are fine.

734
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,330
They've got on the plane safely.

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,370
They will arrive in Chongqing in two hours.

737
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,030
to take Ou Xiao'an to the station.

738
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,460
Take him to the station?

739
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,140
Yes.

740
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,930
What?

741
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,210
Ou Xiao'an is still alive?

742
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,640
Liu, go back first.

743
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,930
Tell the staff at the Special Technology Research Lab

744
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,850
to go back to the station.

00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,560
Yes.

746

756
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,910
Forward.

757
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,540
Back, ready.

758
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,090
Cross left and right. Go.

759
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,380
One, da, da. Two, da, da.

760
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,930
Three, da, da. Four, da, da.

761
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,210
Back, ready. Left, right, da, go.

762
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,290
One, two.

763
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,610
Three, four. Right.

764
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,140
One, da, da.

765
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,300
Put your hand on my arm. Yes.

766
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,900
Come.

767
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,090
Xiao'an.

768
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,300
You're here.

769
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,740
You're practicing dancing?

770
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,050
Your fiance is here.

771
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,750
We won't disturb you then.

772
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,380
Let's go. Hurry up.

773
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,470
We're leaving.

774
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,260
Bye.

775
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,010
Let's go.

776
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,190
Xiao'an, practice with me for one more time.

777
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,790
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll embarrass myself at the wedding.

778
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,590
Come on.

779
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,810
What's wrong?

780
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,130
Jingxian.

781
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,660
What is it?

782
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,290
About the wedding...

783
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,130
I don't think

784
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,700
it can be held.

785
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,730
I'm here today

786
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,170
to say goodbye.

787
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,850
I'm leaving Chongqing.
