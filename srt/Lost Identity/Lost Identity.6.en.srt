74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,690
I found this strip of cloth in his coat

75
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,090
when he was unconscious.

76
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,910
Obviously, he was hiding it.

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,770
This material doesn't look like

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,360
ordinary Japanese military uniforms or prison uniforms.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,930
Yes.

80
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,310
When he was in a coma,

81
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,150
he kept talking about 810.

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,910
So I suspect

83
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,530
this strip might have something to do with 810.

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,930
You took it secretly.

85
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,090
The NBIS must have known.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,260
At that time,

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,060
I wasn't sure about his identity.

88
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,920
I wasn't sure if he was gonna wake up.

89
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,180
Even if he did,

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,410
I wasn't sure

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,310
I could get anything

92
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,570
out of him without knowing his identity.

93
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,610
So I had to take the risk

94
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,010
and bring it to you.

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,190
I thought maybe this strip

96
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,270
would lead us to 810.

97
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,430
I'm not blaming you.

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,950
I know you're worried about me.

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,870
But back in Myanmar,

100
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,870
that was the closest I'd been to 810.

101
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,300
I didn’t want to miss

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,730
any opportunity.

103
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,040
Yes, I wasn’t cautious enough.

104
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,730
But I never thought

105
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,350
Ou Xiao'an was from the NBIS.

106
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,110
If this strip

107
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,950
is really related to 810,

108
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Ou Xiao'an will definitely look for it

109
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,100
when he wakes up.

110
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,820
I asked him about it.

111
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,120
But he can't remember anything

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,970
that happened after 1941.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Even if he remembers it later,

114
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,660
he was in the jungle for so long

115
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,320
before he was saved.

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,100
He can't be sure

117
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
he lost this strip after he met me.

118
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,480
Don't worry.

119
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,210
Things are chaotic now.

120
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,590
It's already hard for you to be undercover alone.

121
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,220
You need to protect yourself first.

122
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,510
Don't worry, Qiushui.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760

125
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,870
In your opinion,

126
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,430
is there any medical explanation

127
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,090
for Ou Xiao'an's memory loss?

128
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,500
His head was severely injured.

129
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,350
It's possible that he lost his memory.

130
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,470
But medically,

131
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,550
nothing is 100% sure.

132
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,590
So I still need to investigate

133
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,150
his connection with 810.

134
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,270

137

The three director generals are also involved.

139

140
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,980
he is a hot potato.

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
But I think

142
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,930
he’s the key

143
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,740
for us to find 810.

144
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,140

Comrade Mingyuan died for our beliefs.

151
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,810
So we're not sure

152
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,390

00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,590
does that mean...

which led to the big manhunt in those days.

the kidnapping of Secretary Chen

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,590
Would you like some fresh pastries?

380
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,540
Wait.

381
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,710
Miss, would you like some pastries?

382
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,180
The pastries look good.

383
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,190
I'll have three packets.

384
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,070
Okay.

385
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,990
How much?

386
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,050
15. Here you are.

387
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,270
Hold on.

388
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,070
Keep the change.

389
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,600
Okay.

390
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,220
Okay.

391
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,750
-Thank you. -Thank you.

392
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,020
-Pastries! -Guys.

393
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,370
Here, have some pastries.

394
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,370
Help yourselves.

395
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,750
Come on. Help yourselves.

396
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,060
Miss Qin, I’m flattered.

397
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,110
-No, no. -We're only doing our job.

398
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,230
Help yourselves.

399
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,000
Captain Zeng.

400
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,180
Are you gonna keep following me?

401
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,070
What do you mean?

402
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,350
It's not safe out here.

403
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
I'm protecting you.

404
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,800
Protecting me?

405
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Fine.

406
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,730
I have to go to my driver's home now.

407
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,030
The things are heavy. Could you take them?

408
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,160
Thank you.

409
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,230
Thank you.

410
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,150
This way.

411
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,030
[Be dutiful to your parents at home, be respectful to your big brothers when away from home]

412

[Sweet Dew Lane]

413
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
Uncle Zhang.

414
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,800
Miss.

415
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,250
What are you doing here?

416
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,780
You're ill. I came to see you.

417
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,870
And they are?

418
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
They're here to protect me.

419
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
It's dangerous out here.

420
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,790
Here.

421
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,660
You brought me so many things.

422
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,540
Thank you so much.

423
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
It's nothing.

424
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,580
Take them.

425
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,330
Come on. Let's go inside.

426
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,470
It's okay.

427
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,800
Take care. I’m gonna go.

428
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,640
Sit.

429
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,000
It's…

430
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,770
You've worked hard today, Captain Zeng.

431
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,500
Would you like to come in and have some tea?

432
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,530
It’s my honor

433
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,040
to escort you home.

434
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,260
I won't go upstairs.

435
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,620
Okay.

436
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,010
See you.

437
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,010
Miss Qin.

438
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,280
We will see each other again.

439
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,630
Captain.

440
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,990
Captain.

441
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,530
That man is indeed the driver for the Qin family.

442
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,410
He usually drives Miss Qin to school.

443
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,640
He had an asthma attack two days ago.

444
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,440
How about we search her place?

445
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,900
Even Ohashi will show her brother some respect.

446
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Search the place?

447
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
How?

448
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Do you know how big their mansion is?

449
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,080
They let her go and started to investigate her secretly.

450
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,040
That's dirty!

451
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,250
Comrade Qiushui.

452
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,530
We should find a way

453
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,770
to rescue Secretary Chen.

454
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,700
Secretary Chen specifically said

455
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,440
no matter what happened,

456
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,750
we must complete the mission first.

457
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,620
As for the rest,

458
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,320
I'll report to my superiors, and they'll make the decisions.

459
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,800
Right now, the medicine

460
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,630
Secretary Chen brought in need to be sent off asap.

461
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,510
All our contact points,

462
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,680
including the two transceivers,

463
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,200
must be transferred immediately.

464
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,710
The Japanese are strictly controlling

465
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,810
the issuance of the Exit-Entry Permits of Shanghai.

466
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,270
Given our current situation, I'm afraid...

467
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,330
I'm afraid it'll be hard to get one.

468
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,570
I asked

469
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,590
a new recruit to do it.

470
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,440
But now there's a big problem,

471
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,640
I've told her to abort the mission.

472
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,750
Didn't Comrade Mingyuan say

473
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,010
we could get a permit

474
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,900
from someone who worked for Ohashi

475
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,870
in the NBIS?

476
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,430
Mingyuan has been arrested.

477
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,550
I'm afraid

478
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,060
it's a dead end.

479
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,550
I'm worried about whether our people in the NBIS

480
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,170
can accomplish Operation Sundial.

481
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,960
If they can't escort Sundial

482
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,830
to leave Shanghai with the information about Cherry Blossom,

483
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,180
the project of the Japanese

484
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,500
will continue.

485
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,320
It will be a great disaster

486
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
to the whole China.

487
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,480
Lee, what happened?

488
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Comrade Qiushui.

489
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,430
-A permit. -A permit?

490
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,350
[Shanghai Military Police Headquarters, Passage Permit]

491
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,190
Where did you get it?

492
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,560
An underground liaison gave it to me.

493
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,230
[Shanghai Military Police Headquarters, Passage Permit]

494
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,350
How much is it?

495
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,000
Fifteen. Here you are.

496
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,150
Hold on.

497
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,800
Okay.

498
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,530
Keep the change.

499
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,310
Okay.

500
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,580
There were Japanese spies following her

501
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,500
when we met.

502
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,370
I guess that's why

503
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,760
she went to see me

504
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,410
instead of contacting you.

505
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,210
Now that we have a permit,

506
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,030
we can't waste any more time.

507
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,550
Start the plan now.

508
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,010
-Yes, Ma'am. -Yes, Ma'am.

509
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,330
Comrade Qin Moqing,

510
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,550
you did a great job this time.

511
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,440
As for what happened to Secretary Chen,

512
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,130
the organization has affirmed

513
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,260
it's not your fault.

514
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,950
Don't beat yourself up.

515
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,550
I have a new mission for you.

516
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,910
The NBIS is setting up a special training class.

517
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,740
The admission requirements are strict.

518
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,280
In consideration of your capabilities

519
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,790
and your brother's connections with the leaders of the NBIS,

520
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,770
the organization hopes

521
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,170
you can join the NBIS

522
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,760
as an undercover agent.

523
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,270
Yes, Ma'am.

524
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,600
From now on,

525
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,260
your code name will be

526
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,340
Wild Grass.

527
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,250
You'll only contact me.

528
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,570
I'm the only one in the organization

529
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,450
who knows your identity.

530
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,540
My code name is

531
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,020
He.

532
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,430
Comrade Qin Moqing,

533
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,900
I hereby announce that

534
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,430
you have been officially acceptted as a member

535
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,230
of the Communist Party of China.

536
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,820
We'll have a simlified ceremony. Repeat the oath after me.

537
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,350
I hereby declare, on oath.

538
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,310
First,

539
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,460
I'll fight for communism for the rest of my life.

540
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,070
Second,

541
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
the interests of the Party

542
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,680
come before all else.

543
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,040
Third,

544
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,320
I'll observe Party discipline.

545
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,470
Fourth,

546
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,400
I won't fear difficulties

547
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,330
and I'll always work for the Party.

548
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,130
Fifth,

549
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,610
I'll play an exemplary role for the people.

550
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,730
Sixth,

551
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,550
I'll protect Party secrets.

552
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,930
Seventh,

553
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,290
I'll have confidence in the Party.

554
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,690
Eighth,

555
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,680
I'll never yield in spite of reverses

556
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,210
and never betray the Party.

557
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,140
The oath-taker,

558
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,350
Qin Moqing.

559
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,220
You've improved a lot these years.

560
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,590
Especially this time,

561
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,040
you volunteered to investigate 810 in Myanmar.

562
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,320
You found out more than we expected.

563
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,460
According to the clues I have now,

564
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,960
the Japanese are conductng

565
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,830
some kind of biochemical experiment

566
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,600
at a place called 810 in Myanmar.

567
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,800
And this experiment

568
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,690
may be related to the Cherry Blossom Project.

569
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,140
But the Cherry Blossom Project

570
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,740
was shut down four years ago.

571
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,360
And the NBIS

572
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,920
had Wano Ohashi assassinated a long time ago.

573
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,080
Even if it's not Ohashi,

574
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,610
there will be someone else.

575
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,220
The Japanese won't give up

576
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240

578
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,650

579
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,880
I can go to Myanmar

580
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,870
as an ordinary medic.

581
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,670
So,

582
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,130
I hope the organization can approve it.

583
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,930
Moqing,

584
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,700
your rank in the NBIS

585
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,000
is of vital importance for us to get intelligence

586
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,350
inside the NBIS.

587
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Qiushui.

588
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,890
Once the Cherry Blossom Project is restarted,

589
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,150
the consequences will be unimaginable.

590
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,710
Our operational capability in Myanmar is limited.

591
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,710
If you go alone,

592
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,670
I'll be worried about your safety.

593
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,120
You don't need to worry about me.

594
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,000
I won't do anything

595
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,640
beyond my capability.

596
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,030
Okay.

597
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,460
I'll pass it on

598
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,380
to the organization.

599
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,070
You should wait for the superiors to reply.

600
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,210
I request the organization

601
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,010
to let me follow the lead.

602
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,280
Now you have three tasks.

603
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,990
First,

604
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,480
find out if Ou Xiao'an's memory loss is real

605
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,540
as soon as possble.

606
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,660
Get as much information as you can about 810

607
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,450
and report to the organization in time.

608
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,120
Yes, Ma'am.

609
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,360
Second,

610
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,700
help Ou Xiao'an as much as you can

611
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
until you can confirm his identity.

612
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,640
But under one condition,

613
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,510
you can't expose yourself.

614
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,780
Not to the NBIS,

615
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
nor to Ou Xiao'an.

616
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,780
Yes, Ma'am.

617
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,640
The third one is tricky.

618
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,810
We found there are several Japanese spies

619
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,330
active in Shapingba.

620
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,720
It's in Chongqing.

621
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,400
So it's not convenient for us to take action.

622
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,720
I hope you can send soldiers from the NBSI to arrest them,

623
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,450
in case they sabotage anythng.

624
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Yes, Ma'am.

625
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,640
These are the three of them.

626
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,500

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,690
Okay, yours?

757
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,840
Ticket?

758
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,740
Show me.

759
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,200
Ticket?

760
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,150
ID?

761
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,160
Ticket?

762
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,080
Yours?

763
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,930
You're from Singapore.

764
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,590
I do tea business.

765
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,160
I came back to Nanjing to visit my relatives.

766
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,850
Thank you.

767
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,650
What's in your suitcase?

768
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,510
Clothes and tea.

769
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,520
Open it.

770
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,980
Hurry up!

771
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,660
Just my clothes.

772
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,970
What are you looking at?

773
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,770
What are you doing?

774
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,030
Now you're hitting me?

775
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,330
Bastard!

776
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,810
Why are you hitting me?

777
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,630
He hit me first.

778
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,690
Sir.

779
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,670
I'm a good citizen.

780
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,820
He started it.

781
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,930
What are you doing?

782
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,780
You...

783
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,760
He hit me!

784
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,430
Stop!

785
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,450
I...

786
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,790
I'll stop.

787
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,250
Don't let him come near me.

788
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,830
Stop!

789
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,540
Stop!

790
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,720
Stop!

791
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,140
Bastard!

792
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,350
Get out!

793
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,070
[Feng's Residence, Chongqing, 1945]

794
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,190
Ms. Wu.

795
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,210
Master, you are back.

796
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,660
Where is Jingxian?

797
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,080
She called from a restaurant,

798
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,700
said she and Mr. Li wouldn't be back for dinner.

799
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,450
It's late.

800
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,020
What are you doing?

801
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,260
Sir, you're forgetful.

802
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,340
These are Miss and Mr. Li's

803
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,750
engagement invitations.

804
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,010
They're done today. Just delivered.

805
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,410
I'll have someone take them to the post office tomorrow.

806
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,820
Except for those who live far away,

807
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,060
the ladies and gentlemen in Chongqing

808
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,090
will receive it the day after tomorrow.

809
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,980
No.

810
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,940
You will not mail any of them

811
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,270
without my permission.

812
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,670
Do you hear me?

813
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,080
Put those away.

814
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,960
Okay.

815
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,780
Hurry up.

816
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,290
Dad!

817
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,010
What are you yelling about?

818
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,850
You're back.

819
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,200
Dad.

820
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,530
Ms. Wu, are those the invitations to my engagement party?

821
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,370
Jingxian.

822
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,090
Don't worry about that.

823
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,870
I need to talk to Shaotang.

824
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
You go upstairs and rest.

825
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,580
Okay, take your time.

826
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,800
Dad, you should also sleep early.

827
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,480
Okay.

828
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,410
Sleep early.

829
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,350
Sit.

830
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,640
What's wrong, Dad?
