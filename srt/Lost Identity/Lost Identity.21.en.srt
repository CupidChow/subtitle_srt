4
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,320
I'm afraid

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,720
they will never see their family again.

6
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,850
I beg you.

7
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,570
When you go out,

8
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,000
make sure to deliver each of these letters.

9
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,790
What I just gave you are the names

10
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,370
of the senders and the mailing addresses.

11
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,180
Memorize them as soon as possible.

12
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,590
Destroy them before you go out,

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,530
so they won't fall into enemy hands

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,260
and endanger their families.

15
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
I'll do my best to memorize them.

16
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,620
I'll do my best to memorize them.

17
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,870
I'll do my best to memorize them.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
I'll do my best to memorize them all.

19
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,670
Dad, what happened to Ou Xiao'an?

20
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,550
Reiko,

21
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,260
your health and complexion have improved a lot recently.

22
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,570
Dad, what happened to Ou Xiao'an?

23
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,400
This is not your concern.

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,890
Do you understand, Reiko?

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,810
Why are you using Ou Xiao'an

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,790
as an experiment subject as well?

27
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,080
Dad,

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,310
you promised me to treat Ou Xiao'an well.

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,810
Ou Xiao'an is just an inferior man.

30
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,010
He was born

31
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,740
to be a slave and an experimental subject

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,130
for our Yamato nation,

33
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,540
just like the pet dog I gave you.

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,900
There is no difference between them.

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,380
Reiko,

36
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,130
you don't have feelings

37
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,410
for this inferior man, do you?

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
But Dad, I...

39
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,350
I'm telling you.

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,579
My daughter's future husband

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,320
will only be a nobleman of the Empire of Japan,

42
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,540
an elite of our Yamato nation.

43
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,260
He will never be an inferior man

44
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,150
like Ou Xiao'an.

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,820
Understood?

46
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,470
But I am also Chinese.

47
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,010
Shut up!

48
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm telling you,

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,420
if you dare speak nonsense like this again,

50
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,250
you will never see him again.

51
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,770
But I was born Chinese.

52
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,630
I was adopted by you.

53
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,310
You received Japanese education.

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,790
You are Japanese.

55
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,530
No.

56
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,510
Now I feel

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
I am Chinese.

58
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,400
You...

59
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,830
Keep her under guard!

60
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,420
Dad! Dad!

61
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,440
Dad! Dad!

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,990
Untie him.

63
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,659
I was ordered

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,010
to strengthen the supervision of him.

65
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,330
I told you to untie him.

66
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,960
Yes.

67
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,240
Get out.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,570
But Chief...

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Get out!

70
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,010
Yes.

71
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,180
Ou Xiao'an,

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
let's dance.

73
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
Go.

74
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,190
What?

75
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,650
Ohashi Kazuya won't let you go.

76
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,390
You can only stay alive by leaving here.

77
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,200
I'll help you.

78
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,380
How are you feeling?

79
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,960
Are you feeling better?

80
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,909
The medicine they injected me with

81
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,710
destroyed my central nervous system.

82
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,370
Normally, it's okay.

83
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,470
When it flares up,

84
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,030
I'm like a lunatic.

85
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,040
The China-India Road has opened.

86
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,630
This is

87
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,390
the newspaper report

88
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,110
about the opening.

89
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,350
The China-India Road has opened?

90
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,430
Alright, let's escape back along it.

91
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,140
[The China-India Road has opened!]

92
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,650
Once we pass Wanding,

93
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,230
we'll be in China.

94
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,280
[The China-India Road has opened!]

95
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
I've drawn the route map on the back.

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,300
On the 10th,

97
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,440
Ohashi will take his people to headquarters for the meeting.

98
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,060
That's when this area will be the least guarded.

99
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,440
We'll take action

100
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,270
on the 10th.

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,330
We'll discuss

102
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,620
the follow-up situation later.

103
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,480
Have you memorized the addresses of those letters?

104
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,900
Yes.

105
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,350
Okay.

106
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,240
Tell everyone

107
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,560
to hang in there.

108
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,230
We must get out alive.

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,060
Prison cell checking!

110
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,120
Prison cell checking!

111
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,870
Hide these letters

112
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,590
for me.

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,910
I'll pick them up when I leave.

114
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,480
These are letters

115
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,429
our fellow inmates wrote

116
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,100
to their families.

117
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,150
They can be considered their last words,

118
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,929
and they are also the news

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,850
their families

120
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,230
have been eagerly awaiting day and night.

121
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,690
They entrusted them to me.

122
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,380
I must

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,420
deliver them personally to their families.

124
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,380
Got it.

125
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,530
Make sure to hide them securely.

126
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,550
Okay.

127
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,230
Inside these letters,

128
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,090
there are words of faith, revolution,

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,910
and communism everywhere.

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,730
The biggest problem now

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,850
is how so many letters from communists

132
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,460
were carefully hidden

133
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,090
in the Japanese living zone.

134
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,780
At least, it illustrates three points:

135
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,020
Firstly,

136
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,740
in 810, the communists

137
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,490
were organized and active.

138
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,280
Secondly,

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,610
there was someone among the communists

140
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,280
who was able to freely enter and exit

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,120
the Japanese living zone.

142
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,170
Thirdly, the communists believed

143
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,560
that this person could escape from 810 alive

144
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,190
and deliver these letters

145
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,920
to their families.

146
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,060
This person

147
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,740
is you, Ou Xiao'an, right?

148
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,060
Captain Wei,

149
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,390
are you suggesting

150
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,620
that I risked my life to escape from 810

151
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,950
just to deliver letters for the communists?

152
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,030
Then tell me,

153
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,390
was there anyone else

154
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,210
among the communists in 810 who, like you,

155
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,780
could freely enter and exit their living quarters

156
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,960
to play the piano for Ohashi Reiko?

157
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
No, there wasn't.

158
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,340
But there were many military doctors,

159
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,730
military police, and other personnel

160
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,530
who entered and exited her room.

161
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,590
Section Chief Qin,

162
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,390
this is your first time

163
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,190
with these letters, right?

164
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,660
Yes.

165
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,080
Have you noticed any commonalities?

166
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,040
There is no recipient information,

167
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,490
no addresses nor names.

168
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,380
Exactly.

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
There is no recipient information,

170
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,400
no addresses nor names.

171
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,040
But these are farewell letters.

172
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,760
People who wrote them must have wanted

173
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,810
these letters delivered to their families.

174
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,570
So, what kind of person did they need?

175
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
They needed someone

176
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,200
with an exceptional memory

177
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,140
to remember these mailing addresses

178
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,610
and the names

179
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,870
of their families.

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
And Ou Xiao'an,

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,990
you used to have

182
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,000
an exceptional memory.

183
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,660
Right?

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,870
Captain,

185
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,210
our focus in today's 810 team meeting

186
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,080
is on finding Ohashi Kazuya

187
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,010
and the gas bombs, isn't is?

188
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,550
Why are you starting to suspect me of colluding with the Communist Party again?

189
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,070
Don't change the subject.

190
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,380
So many eyes are watching.

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,050
Do you think you can fool us?

192
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,100
Besides, you didn't give me a straightforward answer

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,450
and ask him to hurry back.

381
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,910
They also ordered you

382
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,490
to deploy squads from Ground Zone 1 and 2

383
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,700
to suppress them with full force.

384
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,880
Except for those involved in the KW30 experiment,

385
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,450
shoot all others

386
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,520
on sight.

387
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay, I got it.

388
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,020
Go down there now!

389
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,700
Yes!

390
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,000
Wait.

391
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,330
You can't shoot them all.

392
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,230
Down there, except for the test subjects,

393
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,430
everyone else is for live experiments.

394
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,530
You can't kill them.

395
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,330
Chief Ohashi still needs them.

396
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,340
You can't kill them.

397
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,340
Okay.

398
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,480
You two, escort Miss Reiko inside.

399
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,790
Do not leave her room for a single step!

400
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,430
Yes!

401
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
Miss Reiko,

402
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,760
I need to go back to stop the riot.

403
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,830
Please, do not step outside this room!

404
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,670
Okay.

405
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,830
Come with me!

406
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,450
Let's go.

407
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,940
Slow down.

408
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,560
What are you doing following me up here?

409
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,640
Go down and see what's going on.

410
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,460
Yes!

411
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,180
Reiko, let's go.

412
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
This way.

413
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,750
I've already got the window ready for you.

414
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,430
Okay.

415
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,950
You can go down from here.

416
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,870
You go first. I'll help you down.

417
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,440
No.

418
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,420
If I leave,

419
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,400
Ohashi Kazuya won't let you off.

420
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,060
Go.

421
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,910
Hurry up and go down.

422
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,590
Well...

423
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,800
Are you staying here?

424
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,130
Of course I'm going to stay here.

425
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,100
I have to stay here.

426
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Quickly, quickly!

427
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,850
Hurry up. They'll come up here soon.

428
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,520
Hurry up.

429
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,480
But...

430
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,320
I haven't picked up the letters Mr. Ye gave me yet.

431
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,750
Letters? Okay.

432
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,010
I'll go get the letters for you.

433
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,610
I'll throw them down to you from the window later.

434
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,610
You go down first.

435
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,890
Alright? Go.

436
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,830
Reiko.

437
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,670
You must be careful.

438
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,050
Thank you.

439
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,940
Take care.

440
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,510
Are you saying

441
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,790
that with Ohashi Reiko's help alone,

442
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
you managed to escape from 810?

443
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,650
Right?

444
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,790
Yes.

445
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,580
You recalled how you escaped.

446
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,200
So you must have recalled

447
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,890
where you had hidden the letters at that time.

448
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,280
Ohashi Reiko is Chinese.

449
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,460
She is an orphan

450
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,010
adopted by Ohashi.

451
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,740
I think

452
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,940
she is so kind-hearted

453
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,020
that she might be patriotic.

454
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,340
She probably wanted to help her fellow countrymen.

455
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,550
Xiao'an, let's go.

456
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,850
Wait a minute.

457
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,830
Let's go.

458
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,770
Wait a minute.

459
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,600
I haven't taken the letters that Mr. Ye gave me.

460
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,670
Let's go!

461
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,070
We can't wait any longer. Let's go.

462
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,310
-Let's go.
-Wait.

463
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,570
Wait a little longer!

464
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,630
Let's go.

465
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,020
Go!

466
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,830
Go!

467
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,320
Hurry up!

468
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,870
My Lady! My Lady!

469
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm here.

470
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm here!

471
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,350
Miss Reiko.

472
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,050
What are you doing here?

473
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,210
Where's Ou Xiao'an?

474
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,830
I...

475
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,070
Sir!

476
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,270
Ou Xiao'an ran away!

477
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,730
And he killed two of our men!

478
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,850
What? Go after him!

479
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,610
Yes!

480
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,570
Chief!

481
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,080
Chief!

482
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,690
Bastard!

483
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,950
I just went out and such a big mess happened.

484
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,920
Those prisoners took the opportunity and riot.

485
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,050
Where is Ou Xiao'an?

486
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,660
Ou Xiao'an ran away.

487
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,510
What are you waiting for? Go find him!

488
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,570
I've already sent people to find him!

489
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,390
Where's Reiko?

490
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,860
Miss Reiko is fine.

491
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,210
She's in her room now.

492
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,290
Dad, you almost lost

493
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,300
the chance to see me again.

494
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,830
Were you the one who let Ou Xiao'an go?

495
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,440
Yes, I was.

496
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,950
Not only did I let him go,

497
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,970
I'm also planning

498
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,350
to leave with him.

499
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,330
Bastard!

500
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,830
Do you think Ou Xiao'an loves you?

501
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,370
He was using you!

502
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,960
Using you to escape!

503
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,780
But aren't you using me too?

504
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,870
I'm Chinese!

505
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Bastard!

506
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,120
I adopted you to serve the empire.

507
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,450
The empire needs to defeat China

508
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,330
not only with military force but also in spirit and thought.

509
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,730
You are a weapon to numb the Chinese people.

510
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,050
I've seen through you long ago.

511
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,060
You are a hypocrite.

512
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,750
But you can't fool us Chinese.

513
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,350
You are Japanese.

514
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm Chinese.

515
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,230
I'll say it again,

516
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,690
you are Japanese.

517
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,360
I'm Chinese.

518
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,930
Do you think I dare not kill you?

519
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,440
Do you think I dare not kill you?

520
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,600
From now on,

521
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,180
if you dare to go against me again,

522
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,030
this will be your end.

523
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,400
You caused

524
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,860
his death.

525
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,260
I didn't!

526
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,260
I didn't!

527
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,010
I really didn't!

528
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,170
Yes!

529
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,630
The riot has been suppressed.

530
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,480
But two people escaped.

531
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,120
Yes!

532
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,060
We've already sent people to chase after them.

533
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,820
Yes!

534
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,070
Yes!

535
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,870
Hurry!

536
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,250
Hurry!

537
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,820
Hurry!

538
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,430
Stop!

539
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,770
Did he tell you

540
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,969
to deliver the letters for them?

541
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
That's my guess.

542
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,430
As for these letters,

543
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,110
I really don't remember.

544
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,330
Then let's read these letters

545
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,390
and jog your memory.

546
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,330
Section Chief Qin,

547
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,390
you read them.

548
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,950
Yes.

549
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,040
Dad, Mom,

550
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,110
it's me, Manqiu.

551
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,940
Back then, to fight the Japanese

552
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,530
with the guerrillas without Dad knowing,

553
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,740
I asked Mantun to tell you

554
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,130
that I went up the mountain to pick grass.

555
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,740
I didn't expect that it has now been five years.

556
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,640
Traitor!

557
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,120
Shameless bastard!

558
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,470
Get lost!

559
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,300
Let go of me!

560
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,070
Let go of me!

561
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,320
Let go of me!

562
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,780
Where did you get this?

563
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,930
I stole it.

564
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,480
Where did you steal it from?

565
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,640
I stole it. That's all.

566
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,530
It's none of your business where I stole it from.

567
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,930
Say it again!

568
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,900
Bastard!

569
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,050
Dad,

570
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,290
Mom,

571
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,830
it's me, Manqiu.

572
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,220
Back then,

573
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,130
to fight the Japanese with the guerrillas without Dad knowing,

574
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,740
I asked Mantun to tell you

575
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,030
that I went up the mountain to pick grass.

576
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,070
I didn't expect

577
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,680
that it has now been five years.

578
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,830
Don't blame Mantun.

579
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,010
It was my idea.

580
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,970
I'm sorry.

581
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,750
Mom,

582
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,800
your eyesight is poor.

583
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,230
From now on,

584
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,960
don't shed tears for me.

585
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Please forget this unfilial son.

586
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,160
I am illiterate.

587
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,160
This letter was written by one of my comrades.

588
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,470
I hope I'm educated.

589
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,830
Dad, Mom,

590
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,970
for raising me up,

591
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,610
I will do everything I can

592
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,960
in my next life to repay you.

593
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,980
Your unfilial son,

594
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,080
Manqiu.

595
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,020
Brother Zhaoling and Sister-in-law:

596
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,190
Lately, enemy forces have been eyeing the southwest,

597
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,800
and the Yunnan-Burma border is under threat.

598
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,920
The frontline battles are tough, and the future is uncertain.

599
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,530
My wife, Min, has already sacrificed herself for the country.

600
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,230
And I have prepared for the same fate.

601
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,710
The only concern I have is for our son, Zhenzhong.

602
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,940
Indeed, for Zhenzhong,

603
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,230
Min and I are his irreplaceable parents.

604
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,390
But for China,

605
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,210
we are just a drop in the ocean.

606
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,440
However, it is a soldier's duty to die for the country.

607
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,720
When the country is in trouble,

608
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,000
if we do not step forward, who else will?

609
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,570
I have complete confidence

610
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,350
in entrusting Zhenzhong to you.

611
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,500
I only fear it may burden you.

612
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,570
Your brother,

613
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,160
Siping.

614
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,530
Alright.

615
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Stop reading.

616
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,570
Yes.

617
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,840
Captain Wei, Sir,

618
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,130
I need to wash my hands.

619
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,400
[810 Special Investigation Team]

620
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,240
Xiao'an,

621
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,420
it's extraordinary times,

622
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,380
and with the involvement of the Communist Party,

623
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,910
this is a sensitive matter.

624
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,540
Given your situation in 810,

625
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,000
you had no choice

626
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,620
but to work with the Communist Party.

627
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,370
We are all

628
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,270
reasonable people.

629
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,170
You need to trust the Kuomintang.

630
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I do trust the Kuomintang very much.

631
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,610
But there's one thing I don't understand.

632
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,620
Isn't our 810 team’s goal

633
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,310
to find the gas bombs?

634
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,880
Why are you always suspicious

635
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,210
of me colluding with the Communist Party?

636
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,020
Captain Wei asked you like that

637
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,660
just to expedite the progress of the work.

638
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,900
Captain Wei.

639
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,130
Am I right?

640
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,290
Everyone,

641
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,950
let me make a suggestion.

642
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,840
If we can't confirm today

643
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,610
that Ou Xiao'an is a communist,

644
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,830
then before Ohashi Kazuya is caught,

645
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,430
let's not question his identity anymore.

646
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,740
Why not?

647
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,780
Even if he's not a communist,

648
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,560
he still has the identity of a traitor.

649
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,740
If we don't clarify his identity,

650
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,460
how can we catch Ohashi Kazuya?

651
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
What do you think?

652
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,160
I can't hide it anymore.

653
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,160
Captain Wei,

654
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,440
I am a communist.

655
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,790
Good.

656
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,920
Guards! Arrest him!

657
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,030
Wei! Wei!

658
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,830
He said it out of anger.

659
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,950
Don't be angry.

660
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,910
Sit down, sit down.

661
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,190
He admitted that he is a communist.

662
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,370
Shouldn't I arrest him?

663
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,450
He said it out of anger.

664
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,010
Xiao'an,

665
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,350
what nonsense are you talking about? Are you crazy?

666
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,440
I'm crazy.

667
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,920
Since the day I returned to the Chongqing Station,

668
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,550
Captain Wei has always suspected me

669
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,280
of colluding with the Communist Party, hasn't he?

670
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,800
You suspect I'm a communist, don't you?

671
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,310
You suspect I'm in league with Lou Mingyuan, right?

672
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,590
We formed the 810 team

673
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,390
to find the gas bombs!

674
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,070
Now we're back to interrogating me for colluding with communists again!

675
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,800
Fine.

676
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,180
Then I'll have to be a communist.

677
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,310
If I'm not,

678
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,870
we can't continue our work!

679
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,570
I'm a communist.

680
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,400
Shoot me. I confess.

681
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,750
Okay.

682
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,510
Okay.

683
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,500
As you wish.

684
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,060
Guards!
