00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,200
Keep up!

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,240
Their car is catching up.

6
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,910
We can't escape like this.

7
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,570
This is the only way

8
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,500
to eliminate suspicion about you.

9
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,820
How's your injury?

10
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm fine.

11
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,829
If I can’t make it to the pier in time,

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,220
tell Secretary Chen

13
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,410
not to wait for me.

14
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,450
Absolutely not.

15
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,240
You must wait for me in Yan'an, do you understand?

16
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
The journey ahead is dangerous.

17
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,500
Take care,

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,750
Comrade Midnight.

19
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,400
Take care,

20
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,280
Comrade Wild Grass.

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,470
Turn!

22
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,340
Keep up!

23
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,850
Qiushui,

24
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,130
believe me,

25
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,490
I didn't make this decision impetuously.

26
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,760
Given the current situation,

27
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
this is the best choice we have.

28
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Qiushui,

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,600
do you remember what you said

30
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,460
when Yunjie sacrificed himself?

31
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,600
You said that Yunjie's sacrifice was worth it

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,080
for the bigger picture.

33
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,800
Yunjie could do it, so can I.

34
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,150
Comrade Qin Moqing,

35
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,820
do you know what you are talking about?

36
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,220
I firmly oppose it.

37
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,360
I will report this to the organization,

38
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,159
and they will make the decision.

39
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,460
Qiushui,

40
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,670
Ou Xiao'an was right.

41
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,040
We don't have time.

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,970
We don't have time to hesitate.

43
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,150
The trial is tomorrow.

44
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,040
You must make this decision for the organization.

45
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,320
Between Wild Grass

46
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
and Midnight,

47
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,800
we can only save one.

48
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,400
Comrade Qin Moqing,

49
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,909
your code name is Wild Grass.

50
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,650
You have been undercover in Chongqing Station for 4 years

51
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,070
and have excellently completed

52
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,330
the tasks assigned by the organization.

53
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,020
Over the past 4 years,

54
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,670
you went to Burma with the Expeditionary Force,

55
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,540
rescued Ou Xiao'an,

56
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,690
and suppressed the outbreak of local epidemics.

57
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,960
You cooperated with our comrades

58
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,970
and captured Japanese spies in Chongqing.

59
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,460
You withstood numerous investigations

60
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,950
by the NBIS.

61
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,190
You went to Guizhou,

62
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,750
captured Ohashi Kazuya,

63
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,650
and rescued Secretary Chen Ke,

64
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,140
who is me.

65
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,000
At the prisoner-of-war camp,

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,460
you exposed the collusion

67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,830
between the NBIS and Ohashi

68
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,280
and halted

69
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,160
the implementation of the Cherry Blossom Project.

70
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,000
Here,

71
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
on behalf of the Party and the organization,

72
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
I express

73
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,490
the highest respect and affirmation for you.

74
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,900
Have you caught up with Qin Moqing?

75
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,320
Block all the routes!

76
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,930
Set up checkpoints! And enforce martial law!

77
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,530
What about Ou Xiao'an?

78
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,750
Keep searching.

79
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,150
Dead or alive, I must see him!

80
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,020
Vice Captain Li.

81
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,600
Vice Captain Wen.

82
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,590
Have you caught up with the good student?

83
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,720
The personnel from the station, the dock,

84
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,920
and the Operations Department have all been dispatched,

85
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,450
but we haven’t found him.

86
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,809
And Ou Xiao'an?

87
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,190
No news yet.

88
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,450
Vice Captain Wen,

89
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm afraid...

90
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,910
Mr. Wen.

91
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,830
Xiao'an?

92
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,640
What happened?

93
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,170
You didn't catch up with her?

94
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,710
No.

95
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,200
What about Director Shen?

96
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,910
He's fine.

97
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,580
What happened to you?

98
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,210
There were too many communists,

99
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,310
and they were holding Director Shen hostage.

100
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,850
We needed to rescue him.

101
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,080
We couldn't let Director Shen get hurt.

102
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,560
Qin Moqing

103
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,330
shot me.

104
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,690
She's gone mad.

105
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,340
Vice Captain Li,

106
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
please contact Director Shen

107
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,530
and find out

108
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,490
if what he said is true.

109
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,080
Which way did the communists go?

110
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,170
From where we intercepted them,

111
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,070
it seems they headed northwest.

112
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,160
You may leave.

113
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,230
Is this Operations Department?

114
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,260
Director Shen,

115
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,330
I couldn’t be reassured just by a phone call,

116
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,930
so I came to see you in person.

117
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,640
I’m fine.

118
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,950
Qin Moqing

119
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,220
was shot by you.

120
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,670
In such deep water, she’s undoubtedly dead.

121
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,800
Let’s not mention Qin Moqing anymore.

122
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,320
About Ohashi Kazuya,

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,630
what should we do?

124
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,310
What’s the higher-ups' plan?

125
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,800
The Attendant Section has given the guidance.

126
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,230
Ohashi Kazuya must die.

127
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,030
No one can save him.

128
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,570
They’re particularly unhappy

129
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,750
about the fact that we helped Ohashi

130
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,090
fake his death before.

131
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,620
I've reported this long ago.

132
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,040
They’re pretending not to know.

133
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,830
What about the Americans?

134
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,990
Didn’t they always want to save Ohashi?

135
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,440
You can’t count on these people.

136
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,640
As soon as the court verdict was out,

137
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
they all showed up to condemn us,

138
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
accusing us of being schemers

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,130
who are colluding with war criminals.

140
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,390
Anyway,

141
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,590
people from the Attendant Section will be here tonight

142
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,500
for the final interrogation of Ohashi.

143
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,260
Of course,

144
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,020
this will only be a formality.

145
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,870
Ohashi won’t say anything.

146
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,680
But Li Shaotang,

147
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,540
I must warn you,

148
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,600
no matter what your relationship with Ohashi Kazuya is,

149
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,230
you cannot

150
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,990
save him anymore.

151
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,880
Right now, I just hope

152
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,290
that his death

153
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
won’t implicate you.

154
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,930
I’m telling you, Li Shaotang,

155
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,150
the reason

156
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,320
you were not brought to military court

157
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,000
with Ohashi Kazuya

158
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,470
was that your experiments

159
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,830
were our ultimate weapon

160
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,430
against the Communists.

161
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Do your job well as the Vice Captain.

162
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,950
Yes.

163
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Secretary Chen, Ou Xiao'an is here.

164
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,780
Quickly, have him come in.

165
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,720
Secretary Chen,

166
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,860
I am Ou Xiao'an,

167
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,440
a member of the Communist Party,

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,040
with the code name Midnight.

169
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,470
I am here to report to you.

170
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Comrade Xiao'an.

171
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,870
Secretary Chen.

172
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
How is your health?

173
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,820
Much better.

174
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,630
Secretary Chen, please have a seat.

175
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,080
You too.

176
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,760
Okay.

177
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,080
How is the situation in the Chongqing Station now?

178
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,390
Don't worry, Secretary Chen.

179
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,480
The Chongqing Station didn’t find any evidence against me.

180
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,410
Secretary Chen,

181
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm here today

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,390
to ask

183
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,080
if Comrade Wild Grass is...

184
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,350
Don't worry.

185
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,000
I just received news

186
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,390
that she has been successfully rescued

187
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,560
by our comrades

188
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
and should now be on a ship leaving Chongqing.

189
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,270
That's great.

190
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,110
I’m relieved.

191
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
Today, Comrade Li Manqiu and I

192
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,190
are about to set off.

193
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,670
However,

194
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,510
it’s not safe for you to stay in Chongqing now.

195
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,990
I want you

196
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,080
to move with us

197
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
and leave Chongqing.

198
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,890
Secretary Chen,

199
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,600
have a safe journey.

200
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,630
I can't leave yet.

201
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,230
I still have many tasks to complete.

202
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,600
Although Ohashi Kazuya has been brought to justice,

203
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,130
the NBIS is still conspiring with Li Shaotang

204
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,550
on biochemical weapons.

205
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,440
This poses

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,970
a significant threat to us.

207
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,570
I never expected that,

208
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,190
despite knowing Li Shaotang is a Japanese spy,

209
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,070
the NBIS

210
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,910
still sheltered him

211
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,510
and let him continue his biochemical experiments.

212
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,550
The CNP

213
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,390
is now resorting to all means

214
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,310
to counter us.

215
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,200
Your situation within the NBIS

216
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,770
is very dangerous.

217
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,030
Therefore,

218
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,440
I do not support you

219
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,320
staying undercover.

220
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,240
I have ways.

221
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,760
Qin Moqing and I

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,240
made this plan

223
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,480
to gain

224
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,000
their trust in me.

225
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,070
Besides,

226
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
I now have Shen Congwu to testify for me.

227
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Secretary Chen,

228
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,930
it’s not just about these.

229
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,840
The large number of gas bombs from 810

230
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,270
must be hidden somewhere in Chongqing.

231
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,520
I need to find out where they are.

232
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,790
Don't worry.

233
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,870
Well,

234
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,000
the organization will make other arrangements.

235
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,350
You'd better move with us.

236
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,120
Secretary Chen.

237
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,710
Yan'an

238
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,550
doesn't lack a soldier like me.

239
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,240
However, Yan'an definitely needs

240
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,510
an intelligence officer inside the Chongqing NBIS

241
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,240
with firsthand intelligence.

242
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,170
Secretary Chen,

243
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,630
I request

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,440
to stay undercover.

245
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,000
Secretary Chen,

246
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,530
please don’t hesitate any longer.

247
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,170
We’ve made it through all these years.

248
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,590
When we were in 810,

249
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,830
you told me

250
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,640
that beyond the high walls,

251
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,390
there are countless comrades

252
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,830
with the same goal

253
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,270
and dream as ours:

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
to strive tirelessly

255
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,230
for China,

256
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,030
for a new China that is prosperous,

257
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,400
free from oppression, and where people live

258
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,590
and work in peace.

259
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,870
This has also been my goal

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,540
for all these years.

261
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,830
Secretary Chen,

262
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,390
let me continue to uphold this mission.

263
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,780
Let me complete my mission

264
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,700
for the Party

265
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,850
and the people.

266
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,750
Comrade Xiao'an,

267
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,630
Comrade Lou Mingyuan was right about you.

268
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,380
We'll be waiting for your

269
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,089
victorious return.

270
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,599
Secretary Chen,

271
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,609
victory is just around the corner.

272
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,190
We'll soon see the dawn.

273
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,150
Open the door.

274
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,830
Yes.

275
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,390
Ohashi Kazuya,

276
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,800
Judge Randal from America is here to see you.

277
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,260
I don't want to see anyone.

278
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
Mr. Ohashi.

279
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,440
Your Honor,

280
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,760
the trial is over.

281
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,950
Why have you come to see me?

282
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,310
Mr. Ohashi,

283
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,600
you know

284
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,950
that our stance with the National Government

285
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,030
is to protect you.

286
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
It was those communists

287
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,670
who secretly exposed your identity

288
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,270
that led to this outcome.

289
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,790
Leave.

290
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
I'll die anyway.

291
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,320
I won’t hand over the results of years of my efforts

292
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
to the CNP,

293
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,110
nor

294
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,350
to you

295
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,230
perfidious Americans.

296
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,520
I’m here today

297
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,770
not to persuade you.

298
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,860
The person who wants to see you

299
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,190
is my wife.

300
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,080
Honey.

301
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,300
Take your time.

302
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,350
Senior Brother,

303
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,270
long time no see.

304
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,830
Hoko?

305
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,200
How did you end up like this?

306
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,080
Are you mocking me?

307
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,810
What are you talking about?

308
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,640
Senior Brother,

309
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,560
let’s sit down and talk.

310
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,630
I heard that

311
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,400
you were going to be tried,

312
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,470
and I’ve been very worried.

313
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,240
I even asked my husband

314
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,810
to go to the National Government to vouch for you.

315
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,210
I never expected

316
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,630
it to end up like this.

317
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,470
Enough!

318
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,110
Stop lying.

319
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,870
Tell me,

320
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,350
did you come here

321
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,790
as a Japanese

322
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,960
or as an American?

323
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,520
You know very well

324
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,470
that I've been in close contact

325
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,600
with the Japanese Army Headquarters.

326
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,160
Naturally,

327
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,890
I am here representing their will.

328
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,030
Good.

329
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,470
Then tell them

330
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,950
that even though I am about to die in China,

331
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,360
I, Ohashi Kazuya,

332
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,550
will die

333
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,530
as a proud soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army.

334
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,510
I have never betrayed

335
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,030
the spirit of Bushido.

336
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,670
Ohashi,

337
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,040
all these years,

338
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,510
we’ve been rivals.

339
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,510
We’ve tried countless times to replace

340
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,900
or even eliminate each other.

341
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,760
But this time is different.

342
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,840
Although I can’t save your life,

343
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,830
I hope

344
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,840
I can complete

345
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,600
your work for you.

346
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,480
Don’t you want to see

347
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,650
the beautiful cherry blossoms

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,190
falling upon this land?

349
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,830
You can complete my Cherry Blossom Project?

350
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,110
Of course.

351
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,410
Even if you die,

352
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,750
I will ensure your name

353
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,990
is forever remembered

354
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,950
for the Cherry Blossom Project.

355
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Trusting me

356
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,780
is your only chance.

357
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,600
If you could complete the Cherry Blossom Project on your own,

358
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
why are you here to see me?

359
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,560
I need you

360
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,470
to tell the Chinese where the gas bombs are.

361
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
Aren't the gas bombs in your hands?

362
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,790
Yes.

363
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,720
So, I will give you an address.

364
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,210
You just need to reveal it.

365
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,100
Only when the threat is neutralized

366
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,760
can the Chinese hold their victory rally as planned.

367
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,310
This way, your Cherry Blossom Project can be implemented.

368
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,470
If I reveal the location of the gas bombs

369
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,980
and the Chinese destroy them,

370
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,780
how will you implement the plan?

371
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,150
That's my concern.

372
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,970
Also,

373
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,740
even the Communist Party knows

374
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,620
that you have an Elk in the Chongqing Station.

375
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,420
As long as this person is around,

376
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,030
the threat to the Communist Party won't be neutralized.

377
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,200
You need to identify "him" as well.

378
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,560
Isn’t Elk your Miao Jiang?

379
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,750
That's why I came to you.

380
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,220
Think through what you're going to say.

381
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,190
I'll arrange

382
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,570
the last interrogation for you before your execution.

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
Ohashi,

384
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,660
your sentence has been confirmed

385
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,020
as the death penalty.

386
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,190
Do you have any objections

387
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,270
to this decision?

388
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,230
No need.

389
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
All the Chinese people want me dead.

390
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,870
The CNP can't save me,

391
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,560
and neither can the Americans.

392
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,670
Ohashi,

393
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,710
today, I'm here representing the National Government's Attendant Section

394
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,800
to see you.

395
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,760
I don't care what conditions

396
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
those who sheltered you promised you,

397
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,190
but I must make it clear

398
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,900
that our National Government

399
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,160
will absolutely not tolerate such filthy behavior.

400
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,390
So?

401
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,680
Then why don't you

402
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,560
just execute me directly?

403
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,480
As far as we know,

404
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,610
before you were arrested,

405
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,910
you secretly transported a batch of gas bombs

406
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,630
to Chongqing.

407
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,350
And the one who helped you complete this task

408
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,890
is your mole in the Chongqing Station,

409
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
codenamed "Elk."

410
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,650
We hope

411
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
you can provide

412
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,400
the whereabouts of the gas bombs

413
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,630
and

414
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,600
identify

415
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,260
who Elk is.

416
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
Why should I tell you?

417
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
If you cooperate,

418
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,010
we can make an exception

419
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,880
and use diplomatic channels

420
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,200
to send your ashes

421
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,680
back to Japan.

422
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,040
That should be

423
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,510
the best outcome for you.

424
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,880
There are 1400 gas bombs

425
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,910
in the Wulong Furong Cave.

426
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,240
That’s all I can tell you.

427
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,610
Verify it.

428
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,540
Yes.

429
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,170
What about Elk's identity?

430
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,670
This Elk

431
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,400
is among you.

432
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,550
Young lady.

433
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,560
Come here.

434
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,250
I have a few words to say to you.

435
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Just say it.

436
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,540
I heard that

437
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,390
you were the one who found 810.

438
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,240
Yes.

439
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Why?

440
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,970
You're the same age as my daughter,

441
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,940
yet

442
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,570
you are so decisive.

443
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,960
It's a pity

444
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,930
that you don't work for me.

445
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,940
Mr. Ou.

446
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,490
Can I have a word with you?

447
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,520
Reiko

448
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,810
is buried beneath the dance room in 810.

449
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,180
I hope

450
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,270
you can have her remains

451
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,800
moved back to Tokyo

452
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,480
to be buried with me.

453
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,650
Don’t think too much.

454
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,120
Just have a few words with Li Shaotang.

455
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,620
Asano Aohiko.

456
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,300
Tell everyone

457
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,330
that you are Elk

458
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,990
You are the spy that I have planted

459
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,920
in the Chongqing Station of the NBIS all these years.

460
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

461
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,950
Aren't you

462
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,990
surprised?

463
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,930
I can explain everything to you.

464
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,130
Back then,

465
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,560
there was a young man named

466
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,300
Asano Aohiko under my command.

467
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,360
Later,

468
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,170
he took on the identity of Sundial

469
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,610
and infiltrated your NBIS special agents

470
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,380
using an incomplete document

471
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,830
of the

472
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,430
Cherry Blossom Project.

473
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,030
This Asano Aohiko

474
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,080
is the person standing before you,

475
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,460
Li Shaotang.

476
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,170
Over the years,

477
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,490
I've been building 810 in Burma

478
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,740
and later

479
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,750
strategically relocating to Yunnan and Guizhou.

480
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,270
The NBIS

481
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,890
has been trying to capture me.

482
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,760
But it was thanks to him

483
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,170
providing me with information

484
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,380
that I was able to escape.

485
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,520
Nonsense.

486
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,100
Ohashi, are you just making wild accusations

487
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,420
because you know you're about to die?

488
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,340
Li Shaotang’s identity

489
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,960
was personally verified by the boss and me.

490
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
It's impossible that he's Elk.

491
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,430
Director Shen,

492
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,940
you kept me alive for so long.

493
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,360
Honestly,

494
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
I am very grateful to you.

495
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,600
But Li Shaotang

496
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,360
is my most beloved student.

497
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,240
I have seen everything

498
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,080
he has done.

499
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,450
You are accusing Vice Captain Li of being Elk.

500
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,530
Do you have evidence?

501
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,780
My words are the evidence,

502
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,710
unless you don't believe me.

503
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,910
Vice Captain Li,

504
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,050
do you admit

505
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,830
to his accusation?

506
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,810
Why are you doing this?

507
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,550
Bastard!

508
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,130
Take him away.

509
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,940
[Uphold Justice][Face Justice]

510
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,920
Wei,

511
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,450
for such a significant matter as executing Ohashi,

512
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,150
Director Shen should be here.

513
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,140
He helped Ohashi fake his death first,

514
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,620
and then sheltered Li Shaotang, a Japanese spy.

515
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,670
If he had the nerve to show up,

516
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,670
I would really admire his mental fortitude.

517
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,040
Xiao'an.

518
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,790
Sir.

519
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,590
Li Shaotang has been identified,

520
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,650
and Ohashi is about to be executed.

521
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,770
Why aren't you happy?

522
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,880
I always find it strange

523
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,000
that Ohashi identified Li Shaotang

524
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
at this time.

525
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,810
Strange?

526
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
It was unnecessary for him to expose Li Shaotang.

527
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,770
He could have

528
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,860
let Li Shaotang stay undercover in the NBIS.

529
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
It's no problem.

530
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,380
I think Li Shaotang

531
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,630
might be a scapegoat

532
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,120
and that their conspiracy is still ongoing.

533
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,080
Captain Wei,

534
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,210
I think

535
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,230
Ohashi's target

536
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,600
is the victory rally in three days.

537
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,390
But those 1400 gas bombs

538
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,390
were indeed found in Wulong.

539
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,490
Are you suggesting that

540
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,150
the Japanese have some other conspiracy?

541
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,120
Do you believe Li Shaotang is Elk?

542
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,450
I don’t.

543
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,590
Prepare for the execution.

544
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,330
Execute.

545
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,880
Ohashi’s sudden identification of Li Shaotang

546
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
was at your instigation, wasn’t it?

547
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,640
I said I would help him

548
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,650
complete the Cherry Blossom Project,

549
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,100
but he must expose Elk

550
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,910
to ensure

551
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,030
your safety.

552
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,190
It's been so long,

553
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,050
and you haven’t told me

554
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,420
the specifics of

555
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,040
the Cherry Blossom Project.

556
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,410
Haven’t you personally experienced

557
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,150
the effects of those gas bombs?

558
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,880
If the gas bombs are detonated

559
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,270
at the victory rally in Chongqing,

560
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,470
it will be the best result for the Cherry Blossom Project.

561
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,400
This

562
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,350
is the KW30 virus.

563
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,310
This

564
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,390
is the KW30 vaccine.

565
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,270
Don’t worry.

566
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,719
It has been tested countless times in 810

567
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,870
and can definitely prevent the viral infection.

568
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Ms. Miao,

569
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,320
the next steps

570
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,310
are up to you.

571
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,909
What if the gas bombs don’t explode,

572
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,780
and they don’t

573
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,719
go to the bomb shelter as expected?

574
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,480
What should we do then?

575
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,080
Who is it?

576
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030
Ms. Liu?

577
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,270
What brings you here at this hour?

578
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,070
Miss Feng,

579
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,440
the station sent me

580
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,350
to inform you about Li Shaotang.

581
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Shaotang?

582
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,970
What happened to him?

583
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,080
Li Shaotang committed treason.

584
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,640
The station has already arrested him.

585
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,030
What?

586
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,570
It was that Japanese, Ohashi Kazuya, who identified him.

587
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,930
He said Li Shaotang

588
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,340
was a Japanese spy

589
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,590
planted in our Chongqing Station.

590
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,850
Li Shaotang has already admitted in court

591
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,290
that he personally

592
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,960
killed Vice Captain Feng.

593
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,150
Jingxian,

594
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,450
I promise you

595
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,310
that our wedding will proceed as planned.

596
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,530
By then,

597
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,810
you'll be the happiest bride ever.

598
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,230
Marry me.

599
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,390
Everyone,

600
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,070
it won't be long

601
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,470
before the war ends.

602
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,480
And we will win this war.

603
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,190
Just as Ms. Feng said,

604
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,030
everyone can go home

605
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,670
safely and peacefully

606
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,860
and reunite with their families.

607
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,320
I, Li Shaotang,

608
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,990
am certainly a person loyal to the Kuomintang.

609
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,610
I will publish this in the newspaper.

610
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,280
I want everyone to know

611
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,080
that Feng Yunian’s daughter is getting married.

612
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,230
Bride and groom, please exchange rings.

613
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,230
Dad! Dad!

614
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,900
Dad, what happened to you?

615
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,560
Come in.

616
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,960
Mr. Wen.

617
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,280
Xiao'an.

618
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,370
Take some people from the Operations Department

619
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,410
to Qin's Mansion.

620
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,440
[Search Warrant]

621
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,660
The entire NBIS knows

622
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,720
that you and Qin Moqing

623
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,670
are my two prized students.

624
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,990
I must have been blind not to see through her.

625
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,460
You ended up in a direct confrontation.

626
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,080
What about you?

627
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,530
I'll do it right away.

628
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,860
This is your lifetime’s savings.

629
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,690
Don't you feel sad?

630
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,320
Better to be a dog in peaceful times

631
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,390
than a human in chaotic times.

632
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,590
I had already anticipated this day.

633
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,590
You have a good mindset.

634
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,840
Have you read "The Story of the Stone"?

635
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,860
"Like birds who, having fed, to the woods repair,

636
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,580
They leave the landscape desolate and bare."

637
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,250
Even if I were immensely wealthy,

638
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,510
there would still be a day when it's all gone.

639
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,830
You’ve brought this on yourself.

640
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,570
You can’t blame anyone else.

641
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,580
Yes.

642
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,310
I know I’m a fat piece of meat.

643
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,960
Everyone who sees me wants to take a bite.

644
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,990
The Japanese,

645
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,550
Wang Jingwei,

646
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,740
your NBIS,

647
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
and those Americans—

648
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,140
none of them can be relied on in the end.

649
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,600
Once they had taken all the meat off my bones,

650
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,300
they naturally left.

651
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,600
I know

652
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,620
that I’ve gained wealth and benefits

653
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,970
by selling my dignity and integrity,

654
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,700
which is not worth mentioning.

655
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,300
But I raised a wonderful sister.

656
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,400
Qin Moqing is exceptional

657
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,710
and the priceless treasure of our family.

658
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,820
Thinking of her

659
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,350
brings me peace of mind.

660
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,650
My sister was right.

661
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,320
This world can be changed.

662
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,960
You did raise a good sister.

663
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,130
Here’s the deal.

664
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,990
I’ll give you

665
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,320
two hours.

666
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,360
It's up to you to decide

667
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,610
how we'll do it.

668
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,220
Captain Chen.

669
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,530
It's me, Ou Xiao'an.

670
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,470
Let me ask you.

671
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,090
Where will the batch of gas bombs from Wulong

672
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
be sent to be destroyed?

673
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,520
Okay.

674
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,000
Take me there to have a look.

675
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,110
Okay.

676
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,720
Slowly.

677
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,670
Easy, easy.

678
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,200
Hurry up.

679
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,690
Easy.

680
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,610
Be careful.

681
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,450
Who are you?

682
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,180
This is a military restricted area. Entry is prohibited.

683
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,850
This is Section Chief Ou from the Chongqing Station of the NBIS.

684
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,720
He is here on the orders of Captain Wei from the Chongqing Station

685
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,280
to inspect today's gas bomb destruction operation.

686
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,530
I did receive news that someone from the NBIS would be here to inspect.

687
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,990
However, please present your credentials.

688
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,630
We’re here to check on

689
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,110
the gas bomb destruction.

690
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,120
[Name: Ou Xiao'an]

691
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,990
Come in, please.

692
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,600
Okay.

693
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,290
These are the gas bombs to be destroyed today.

694
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,150
Over there is the chloramine solution destruction pool.

695
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,840
How many boxes are there in total?

696
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,000
140 boxes.

697
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,510
Ten bombs per box.

698
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,730
A total of 1400 bombs.

699
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,550
Why aren't you wearing protective equipment

700
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,390
for destroying the gas bombs?

701
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,060
Before the official destruction,

702
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,350
wearing that is inconvenient for the work.

703
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:21,920
We’ll put it on shortly.

704
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,760
Open it and let me take a look.

705
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,510
Open it.

706
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,120
Open the ones at the back too.
