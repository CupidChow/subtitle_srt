[Episode 9]

4
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,160
Let me give you a suggestion.

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,729
Authorize me to review the files.

6
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,880
I'll re-examine the whole of it for you.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
Now it's the NBIS investigating you.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,710
Not you investigating the NBIS.

9
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,890
I'm clean.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,110
If you are clean,

11
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,860
why would Ohashi send you back

12
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,950
to stage such a grand resurrection act?

13
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,870
What's the conspiracy here?

14
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,900
Where is 810?

15
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,150
Where are those gas bombs

16
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,320
hidden?

17
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,710
Listen, you need to

18
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,070
get Li Shaotang to talk about this matter.

19
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,800
Understand?

20
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,150
Interrogate him.

21
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,360
If you can't get him to talk,

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
I can help you.

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,430
You consciously work with Lou Mingyuan

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,460
for the Communist Party, right?

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
I have never worked with Lou Mingyuan.

26
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,180
I have also never done anything

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,210
for the Communist Party.

28
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,040
Are you a Communist?

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,740
No, I'm not.

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,610
I'll ask you again.

31
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,800
Are you a Communist?

32
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,690
I said I'm not.

33
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,510
If you're not a Communist,

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,470
why do you and Lou Mingyuan

35
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,600
have secret codes for communication?

Li Shaotang, answer me again.

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,360
Are you a Communist or not?

39
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,160
[Are you a Communist or not?]

40
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,560
I said I'm not a Communist!

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,980
How many times do I have to tell you?

42
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,290
I'm not a Communist!

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,350
Come on.

44
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,610
You are now being interrogated by us.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,580
Ou Xiao'an,

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,640
the Japanese are at death's door, alright?

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
Why are you still counting on Ohashi?

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,890
Are you out of your mind?

49
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,370
Are you stupid?

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,410
If you confess today,

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,210
help us find that batch of gas bombs,

52
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,680
and assist in catching Ohashi,

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,910
you might be considered a repentant traitor,

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,130
who has forsaken darkness for light, okay?

55
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,800
The punishment is inevitable.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,370
But I can put in a good word for you.

57
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,630
Perhaps you can avoid the death penalty.

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,170
Does that mean I can live or not?

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,290
Come on!

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,250
Why are you nitpicking what I said?

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,420
How about this?

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,450
Let me tell you the real situation.

63
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,240
We have already captured the person

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,180
who can identify you.

65
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,220
Captain Wei is interrogating him now.

66
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,050
If he identify you later,

67
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,079
my words

68
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,110
won't be as polite as they are now.

69
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay, who did you capture?

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,090
Ando Motoyoshi.

71
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,610
The pain you are experiencing now...

72
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,700
Stop.

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,380
At 810,

74
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,370
I was only responsible for cerebral research

75
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,930
and related memory manipulation experiments.

76
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,140
The Cherry Blossom Project is a biochemical project

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,520
[The path of going astray is boundless, but turning back leads to salvation.]

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,590
that I wasn't involved in.

79
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,080
What is 810?

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,900
It's a prison,

81
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
and a research institute

82
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,890
where we utilize inmates

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,720
for scientific research.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,420
Was that Ohashi's order?

85
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,500
No, no, no.

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,250
It was His Imperial Majesty's order.

87
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,040
Chief Ohashi, however,

88
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,360
is the most astute executor

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,310
who can set up the most strategic chessboard

90
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,420
and watch you step by step fall into it.

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,210
The most strategic chessboard set by Ohashi?

92
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,310
[The path of going astray is boundless, but turning back leads to salvation.]

93
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,090
So, was he and Ou Xiao'an's faked death

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,120
also a move in this chess game?

95
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,110
Yes.

96
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,770
You take great satisfaction in the gains and losses

97
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,920
of a single chess piece right in front of you,

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,490
while every move made by Chief Ohashi

99
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,380
is designed to ensure that you lose the entire game.

100
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,740
If needed,

101
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,470
Chief Ohashi can provide you

102
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,810
with various versions of such false intelligence.

103
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,890
So tell me,

104
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,730
what was Ohashi's faked death for?

105
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,330
The Cherry Blossom Project.

106
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,320
Chief Ohashi would never easily give up

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,780
the fruit of his hard work.

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,520
So you mean

109
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,900
Ohashi's rebuilding of 810 in Myanmar

110
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,750
is for his Cherry Blossom Project,

111
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,320
using Chinese prisoners

112
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,310
for live experiments, right?

113
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,350
This is a way for them to die in a meaningful way.

114
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,480
To die in a meaningful way?

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Yes.

116
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,230
To die in a meaningful way?

117
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,670
Why don't you let you Japanese people

118
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,070
die in a meaningful way?

119
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,200
Tell me!

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,260
How far has the Cherry Blossom Project progressed?

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,470
Let go of me,

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,290
then I can speak!

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,630
Let go of me!

124
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,850
The Cherry Blossom Project is the highest secret of 810.

125
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,970
I don't know the specifics.

126
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,570
I only heard that

127
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,380
the vaccine and the virus

128
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,430
are almost successfully developed.

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,390
What virus?

130
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,140
I only know its code name.

131
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,580
It's KW30.

132
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,070
It's used to develop highly contagious

133
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,030
and deadly biochemical bombs.

134
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,380
The yellow bombs and the red bombs, right?

135
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,800
The yellow bomb and the red bomb

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,130
are just names for the biochemical bombs.

137
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,450
They've already started being mass produced.

138
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,940
How many of them have been produced?

139
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,340
I don't know.

140
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,380
But

141
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,440
I heard that

142
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,220
before I left 810,

143
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,540
they had already begun to be transported

144
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,500
to their target locations.

145
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,310
Where are the target locations?

146
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,150
I don't know.

147
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,890
-I'm just a doctor.
-Then what do you know?

148
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm just a doctor.

149
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,380
I'm not a biochemical expert.

150
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,670
Where is Ohashi?

151
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,770
Section Chief Li, please don't be angry.

152
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,710
When most of us

153
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,250
undergo a lie detector test for the first time,

154
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,160
we will experience fluctuations in data

155
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
due to some physical

156
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,500
and emotional discomfort.

157
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,730
That's why we need to

158
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,530
repeatedly ask you questions.

159
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,800
It's normal.

160
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,310
How about this?

161
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,180
Let's take a break.

162
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,810
Get Section Chief Li a glass of water.

163
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,490
Yes.

164
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Deputy Chief Xu.

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,610
There were significant fluctuations in data...

166
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,630
There were significant fluctuations in data

167
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,200
when Section Chief Li was asked certain questions.

168
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,300
What should we do?

169
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,830
We can't keep interrogating him like this.

170
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,430
And Vice Captain Feng is not here.

171
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,760
Hurry and inform Vice Captain Feng

172
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,159
about Section Chief Li's situation.

173
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,390
I'll be here keeping an eye on him.

174
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,190
Go.

175
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,950
Where is 810?

176
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,610
And the target! The location!

177
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,030
When we experts and medical staff

178
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,510
enter and leave 810,

179
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,200
we are blindfolded

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,410
and transported by a special vehicle.

181
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,370
I don't know the exact location;

182
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,250
I can only vaguely remember it based on intuition.

183
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,430
It's about a 30-hour drive from Rangoon,

184
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,140
in a mountainous area.

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,140
You'll have to find the specific location yourselves.

186
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,640
But even if you do find it,

187
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,820
it won't help.

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,559
What do you mean?

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,669
Chief Ohashi has already ordered

190
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,550
the removal of all items from 810.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,910
What about the prisoners?

192
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,170
Of course they have been cleared as well.

193
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,600
How were they cleared?

194
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
With poison gas.

195
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,240
You think you are smart!

196
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,030
When interrogating Li Shaotang,

197
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,550
just do as necessary.

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,340
But Vice Captain Feng,

199
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,780
isn't Section Chief Li supposed to

200
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,520
be engaged to Miss Feng soon?

201
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,830
So Deputy Chief Xu and I were considering

202
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,950
recording what we should record

203
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,640
and pretending we didn't hear

204
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,120
what we shouldn't record.

205
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,850
Just record.

206
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,000
Write down every word.

207
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,510
If there's any problem with Li Shaotang,

208
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,810
I won't cover for him.

209
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,560
Yes.

210
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,040
Wait.

211
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,470
Are Qin Moqing and the two from the Inspection Office

212
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,270
still there?

213
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,060
Yes.

214
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,070
You may go now.

215
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,720
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

216
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Section Chief Li,

217
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,170
are you feeling better?

218
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Then let's continue.

219
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,860
Since you said Lou Mingyuan is not your contact,

220
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,970
there is another person who is, right?

221
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,530
No.

222
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,630
So Lou Mingyuan is indeed

223
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,450
your contact in the Communist Party in Shanghai,

224
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,290
right?

225
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,900
Lou Mingyuan is not my contact.

226
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,410
And I don't have any other contacts.

227
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,400
I've said before, I didn't join the Communist Party.

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,340
[Combining Punishment with Leniency]

229
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,300
So it seems that you are very important in Shanghai.

230
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,490
You don't have a contact.

231
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,690
You only need to recruit operatives, right?

232
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,990
I've said countless times,

233
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,260
I did not join the Communist Party in Shanghai.

234
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,000
You didn't join the Communist Party in Shanghai.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,030
So did you get inspired

236
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,570
by the Communist Party's ideology

237
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,610
during your studies in Tokyo

238
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,870
and join the Communist Party?

239
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,590
Yes or no?

240
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,550
Liu,

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,710
I have said so many times,

242
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,280
I did not join the Communist Party,

243
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,110
no matter when I was in Shanghai,

244
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,050
Japan, or Chongqing.

245
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Section Chief Li,

246
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,250
I never mentioned Chongqing.

247
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,400
The result is obvious.

248
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,590
You joined the Communist Party in Chongqing.

249
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,640
Lou Mingyuan is not your contact;

250
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,300
you have another contact, right?

251
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,850
I have said so many times,

252
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,910
I did not join the Communist Party.

253
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,030
Since I was born, besides Fengtian,

254
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,910
I have only been to Shanghai,

255
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,130
Tokyo, and Chongqing.

256
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,630
That was why I mentioned Chongqing.

257
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,760
It has nothing to do with Lou Mingyuan.

258
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
You know these people, don't you?

259
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,070
[The path of going astray is boundless, but turning back leads to salvation.]

260
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Yes.

261
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,250
These were the people arrested

262
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,710
back in the day on Scott Road

263
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,630
in Shanghai.

264
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,260
You remember them quite clearly

265
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,580
after so many years.

266
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,610
During the interrogation,

267
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,730
Chief Ohashi told me to inject them

268
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,380
with truth serum.

269
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,930
I recorded their reactions

270
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,040
after the injection,

271
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,430
so I remember these people.

272
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,350
What happened to them later?

273
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,860
They were executed.

274
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,580
Because they were deemed

275
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
to have no further research value.

276
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
How did Ohashi find them?

277
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,280
Chief Ohashi naturally has his own way.

278
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,350
What way?

279
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,980
Perhaps...

280
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,010
there's a traitor

281
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
within your ranks?

282
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,200
Who is this traitor?

283
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,600
I don't know.

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,310
I really don't know.

285
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,800
Okay.

286
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,070
[The path of going astray is boundless, but turning back leads to salvation.]

287
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,420
You used

288
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,280
truth serum on them, right?

289
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,990
Yes, I did.

290
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,630
You conducted various experiments on them?

291
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, I did.

292
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,570
Okay.

293
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I'll perform

294
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,780
the same truth serum injections

295
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,770
and all the experiments on you

296
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,030
until you remember! Say it!

297
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,680
I really don't know.

298
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,610
I'm just a doctor,

299
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,450
not a biochemical expert.

300
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,550
I've told you everything I know.

301
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,220
In the 30th year of the Republic of China,

302
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,030
did you follow the Communist Party's steps

303
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,090
and come to Chongqing from Shanghai?

304
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,040
In the 30th year of the Republic of China,

305
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,030
I came to Chongqing

306
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,960
following the steps of the Kuomintang.

307
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,820
It had nothing to do with the Communist Party.

308
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,880
[Question: Did you come to Chongqing in the 30th year of the Republic of China?]
[Answer: Yes]

309
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,030
Before the Cherry Blossom Project's file was sent to Chongqing,

310
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,950
did the Communist Party escort you here

311
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,470
in the name of the Kuomintang?

312
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,880
It was the Kuomintang's soldiers,

313
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,330
Wang Sen and Ou Xiao'an,

314
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,820
who escorted me here.

315
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,390
Bastard!

316
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,030
Get out!

317
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,840
What are you doing?

318
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,350
Even...

319
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,960
Even if we have to burn it,

320
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,910
we cannot let the Japanese take it back.

321
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,710
Nonsense!

322
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,070
This file must be taken back to Chongqing.

323
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,060
We can't stay with this train any longer.

324
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,660
We need to find a way to leave.

325
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,320
Stop!

326
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,740
Hurry!

327
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,130
Bastard!

328
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,360
I...

329
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,560
Help me!

330
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,560
What are you waiting for?

331
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,080
Give me a hand!

332
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,230
Let's go!

333
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Do you want to go back and get killed?

334
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,270
When the train slows down, let's jump off.

335
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,710
No matter where it stops, we get off.

336
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,170
After getting off the train, we go our separate ways

337
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,200
and meet up in Chongqing.

338
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,520
I'll take the file now and give it back to you in Chongqing.

339
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,700
Understood?

340
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,330
After returning to Chongqing,

341
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,480
did you hand over the Cherry Blossom Project's file

342
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
to the NBIS?

343
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,530
Section Chief Li.

344
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,560
After returning to Chongqing,

345
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,460
did you hand over the Cherry Blossom Project's file

346
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,570
to the NBIS?

347
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,890
Yes.

348
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
After returning to Chongqing,

349
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,790
did you hand over the Cherry Blossom Project's file

350
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,030
to Ohashi Kazuya?

351
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,840
No.

352
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,440
Did you take actions to betray the NBIS?

353
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,220
No.

354
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,360
Do you think

355
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,200
Ou Xiao'an

356
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,740
betrayed the NBIS to Ohashi?

357
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,360
He...

358
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,040
Yes or no?

359
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,890
Yes.

360
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,910
Do you think Ou Xiao'an accusing you

361
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,310
of collaborating with the Japanese is a lie?

362
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,110
Yes.

363
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,690
Do you suspect Ou Xiao'an

364
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,370
of collaborating with the Japanese?

365
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,210
Yes.

366
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,790
Let me ask you again.

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,110
Do you suspect

368
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,770
Ou Xiao'an of collaborating with the Japanese?

369
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,970
I've told you.

370
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,390
Yes, I do.

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,300
Li Shaotang.

372
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,350
I'll ask you one last time.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,210
Do you suspect Ou Xiao'an

374
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,290
of collaborating with the Japanese?

375
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,650
I'll ask you one last time.

376
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,110
Do you suspect Ou Xiao'an of collaborating with the Japanese?

377
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes.

378
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,690
Ou Xiao'an, you once said

379
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,870
that Ohashi once ordered Ando

380
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,750
to administer truth serum to Lou Mingyuan.

381
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,900
Did he inject it into you too?

382
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,490
After you were injected with truth serum,

383
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,090
did you betray our Party,

384
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,420
abandoning the faith of the Kuomintang?

385
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,050
Were you the one who betrayed

386
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
those brothers of the Party?

387
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
No.

388
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,770
Lou Mingyuan is dead.

389
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,580
Those brothers in Shanghai were all caught and killed.

390
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,840
Why are you the only one

391
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,800
who was detained by Ohashi and still alive?

392
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,640
What transaction did you and Ohashi make

393
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,050
at No. 25 Scott Road and 810

394
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,250
that made him, a ruthless person

395
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,840
who killed a lot of people,

396
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,100
spare your life

397
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,460
and even release you

398
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,900
to cause havoc at our Chongqing Station?

399
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,530
Here's the deal.

400
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,850
If you confess everything,

401
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,300
I can grant your request.

402
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,950
I'll request the higher-ups

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,130
to arrange a meeting for you with Ando.

404
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,140
Let me think about it.

405
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,080
Yes.

406
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,230
The problem must lie with

407
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,110
Li Shaotang.

408
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,860
Sundial betrayed the NBIS.

409
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,240
After meeting with me,

410
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,100
he immediately revealed my identity to Ohashi.

411
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,490
Ohashi forced me to hand over the Cherry Blossom Project's file.

412
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,120
And...

413
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,440
he also tried to persuade me to defect,

414
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,970
hoping to extract more intelligence from me.

415
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,670
However, Sundial had already given

416
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,850
the Cherry Blossom Project's real file to Ohashi long ago.

417
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,890
So,

418
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,570
this plan of Ohashi

419
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,320
really hit two birds with one stone.

420
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,070
Not only did he retrieve the file,

421
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,920
but he also planted a pawn

422
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,500
deep within the NBIS.

423
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,880
Well, tell me.

424
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,090
How did you

425
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,960
help Li Shaotang

426
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,000
evacuate Shanghai together?

427
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,360
The evacuation mission

428
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,860
was scheduled on April 18th, in the 30th year

429
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,190
of the Republic of China.

430
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,450
At that time, I arranged for two brothers

431
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,450
to secretly protect him on the train.

432
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,950
[Shanghai To Nanjing]

433
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,890
The train departed at 2:08 in the afternoon.

434
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,510
At 2 p.m.,

435
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,560
I saw Li Shaotang off onto the train

436
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
at Platform 9.

437
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,850
[Second-class carriage]

438
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,680
Before he boarded,

439
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,250
I handed him the file I had hand-copied

440
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,530
and then watched him get on the train.

441
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,730
And I only left after the train departed

442
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,920
from the platform.

443
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,900
And then?

444
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,920
Where did you go?

445
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,580
Why didn't you come back

446
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,940
with Li Shaotang according to the plan?

447
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,030
And...

448
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,630
After that,

449
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,490
I went to rescue someone.

450
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,750
Who?

451
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,620
Who was it?

452
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,870
Lou Mingyuan.

453
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,670
The Chief is here.

454
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,910
Stop sleeping.

455
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,500
There are things you need to do. Wake up.

456
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,000
I knew the guys

457
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,320
on duty on that day.

458
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,600
On that day, I gave them a few bottles of wine

459
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,130
laced with sleeping pills.

460
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,750
It was impossible that they would wake up.

461
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,510
Who are you?

462
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,410
Mr. Ye.

463
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,530
You are Ou Xiao'an?

464
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,320
Yes.

465
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,850
How did you get in?

466
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
Lou Mingyuan asked me to come.

467
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,910
I came to get you out of here.

468
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,700
Let's go.

469
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,120
Go.

470
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,920
Go.

471
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,290
After them!

472
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,630
Hurry. Get out. Go.

473
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,090
Captain Zeng, you were right.

474
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
I'll leave Captain Ou to you.

475
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Yes.

476
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,660
Captain.

477
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,830
What? Are you tired?

478
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,790
You still won't talk, huh?

479
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,600
You're quite tough.

480
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,100
By the way,

481
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,720
this electric chair

482
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,780
was specially prepared for you.

483
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,950
Would you like to give it a try?

484
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,340
Ou Xiao'an.

485
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,720
I've long suspected you.

486
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,010
Was it you who let those students go

487
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,190
on the day Ohashi was attacked?

488
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,880
Zeng Jiwu,

489
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,800
let's cut the small talk.

490
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,820
Hurry up.

491
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,370
Okay.

492
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,540
This thing looks quite new.

493
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,130
But there's one thing I haven't quite figured out.

494
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,860
When you were saving Ye Xuanmin,

495
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,480
were you with the NBIS

496
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,590
or with the Communist Party?

497
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,150
I am...

498
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,350
What?

499
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,550
I'm your dad.

500
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,660
Well, louder.

501
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,610
I'm your dad!

502
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,020
-Son.
-Alright.

503
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,800
You are my dad, huh?

504
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm your grandpa!

505
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,230
Captain Zeng.

506
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,920
Chief!

507
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,750
How could you do this to Captain Ou?

508
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,540
Look at him.

509
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,550
Does it hurt?

510
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,070
Look at you.

511
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,340
You're quite clever.

512
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,750
It's a pity that you can't see the current situation clearly.

513
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,510
However,

514
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
I still admire you.

515
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,590
So,

516
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,710
I can offer you the highest courtesy:

517
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,820
allowing you

518
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,410
to commit seppuku.

519
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,130
Chief.

520
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,230
What is it?

521
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,980
Where is he?

522
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,550
We didn't catch him.

523
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,610
Where is the thing?

524
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,640
Bastard!

525
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,280
Yes!

526
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,180
Go find it now!

527
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,930
Yes!

528
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,460
Where is the file?

529
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,440
What?

530
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,120
Where is the file?

531
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,670
What file?

532
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,580
Where is the Cherry Blossom Project's file?

533
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,940
I forgot.

534
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,000
Captain Zeng.

535
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,610
Help him freshen up

536
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,990
and bring him to my office.

537
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,750
Yes!

538
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,220
Mr. Ou,

539
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,370
please have a seat.

540
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,220
Please. Have a seat.

541
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
Mr. Ou.

542
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,820
My office,

543
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,030
over these years,

544
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,300
you've been here no less than a hundred times.

545
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,520
You've done a lot for me.

546
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,840
If you could turn over a new leaf,

547
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,300
I'd still hate to lose you.

548
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,070
This time, I'll return your dignity to you.

549
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,880
I hope

550
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,990
you can feel my sincerity.

551
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,480
Here, Mr. Ou.

552
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,350
Mr. Ou, here.

553
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
A toast to you.

554
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,230
Drink it yourself.

555
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,520
I hope you drink to death.

556
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,640
Mr. Ou,

557
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,430
I know your memory the best.

558
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,470
I'm aware of

559
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,340
your photographic memory.

560
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,380
As long as you can write down the Cherry Blossom Project

561
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,730
you have seen,

562
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
I can give you a way out.

563
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,190
In the future, within the empire,

564
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,550
I can ensure you high rank and riches.

565
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,660
High rank and riches?

566
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,170
What is

567
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,940
Cherry Blossom Project?

568
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,610
Tell me.

569
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,080
Mr. Ou,

570
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
this is your last chance from me.

571
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,770
I hope you can seize it.

572
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,210
Captain Zeng,

573
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,450
bring him here.

574
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,560
Mr. Ou,

575
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,950
I thought you came back to save Lou Mingyuan.

576
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,660
Thanks to Captain Zeng reminding me,

577
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,480
it turns out that you went to save Ye Xuanmin first.

578
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,560
I want to ask you,

579
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,280
between Lou Mingyuan and Ye Xuanmin,

580
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,680
who is more important to you?

581
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,960
It's none of your business.

582
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,930
It's okay.

583
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,150
Although I can't get

584
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,560
a definite answer right now,

585
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,040
I can kill them one by one,

586
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,520
or slowly torture them

587
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,050
in front of you

588
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,020
until you're willing to cooperate with me!

589
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,070
Captain Zeng,

590
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,280
I'll leave him to you.

591
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,820
Enough!

592
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,250
Stop torturing him.

593
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,489
It's just the Cherry Blossom Project, isn't it?

594
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,730
It's in my head.

595
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,810
I'll write it for you.

596
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,000
I'll just write it for you.

597
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,290
Stop him!

598
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,520
Hurry! Stop him!

599
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,830
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

600
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,100
No way!

601

please don't give me away.

619

638

Come on.

639
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,870
It's a story

640
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,140
you just made up.

641
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,700
Even if I made it up,

642
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,070
you still have to listen, right?

643
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,510
Look at these people.

644
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,480
His name is Li Shaotang.

645
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,650
We worked together at the Shanghai Institute

646
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,840
years ago.

647
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,260
Although he's Chinese,

648
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,760
I heard

649
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,700
he studied at Tokyo Imperial University in his early years

650
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,890
and speaks Japanese.

651
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,300
We talked once or twice.

652
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,570
He seems to be from the biochemical unit,

653
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,970
an experimental technician for the Cherry Blossom Project.

654
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,590
He didn't interact much with others normally.

655
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,760
That's all I know.

656
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,310
After all these years,

657
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,360
with just a few occasional conversations,

658
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,780
you remember him so well?

659
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Because later on,

660
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,440
the Cherry Blossom Project was sabotaged,

661
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,250
and the lab's database caught fire.

662
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,780
A lot of data was destroyed.

663
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,310
Chief Ohashi suspected

664
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,680
there was a mole in the institute.

665
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,550
So they started investigating one by one.

666
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,180
Before they got to him,

667
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
he escaped.

668
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,790
He escaped?

669
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,420
Yes, he became a key suspect.

670
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
During that time,

671
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,400
Military Police Officers showed his photo

672
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,020
to experts repeatedly to ask us about him.

673
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,750
So, I have an impression of him.

674
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,920
Do you know

675
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,440
this person?

676
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,000
Mr. Ou!

677
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,100
Ou Xiao'an.

678
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:27,990
Mr. Ou.

679
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,010
He's still alive?

680
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,280
In Shanghai,

681
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,090
did you use truth serum on him?

682
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,970
Yes, I did.

683
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,650
But most of the time,

684
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,210
it was used when he was at 810.

685
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,970
So,

686
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,900
he had been detained at 810 all this time?

687
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,590
He was Chief Ohashi's

688
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,930
most trusted Chinese person,

689
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,690
and my favorite partner.

690
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,120
What did he do for Ohashi?

691
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,270
He could write very complex chemical formulas

692
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,520
and experimental data

693
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,910
word for word from memory.

694
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,180
It was truly a miracle.

695
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,760
His brain is simply a miracle.

696
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
What formulas?

697
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,970
Data from the Cherry Blossom Project.

698
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,370
So, he wrote the data

699
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,480
from the Cherry Blossom Project from his memory

700
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,720
and gave it to Ohashi, right?

701
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,540
Yes.

702
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,750
Chief Ohashi asked me to brainwash him

703
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,940
using the memory manipulation experiment

704
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,770
to make Ou Xiao'an work for him.

705
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,870
The experiment started smoothly.

706
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,970
But halfway through the experiment,

707
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,290
Ou Xiao'an's memories began to decline.

708
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,860
Chief Ohashi was afraid it would affect his memorization

709
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,240
of the data from the Cherry Blossom Project,

710
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,160
so he stopped my experiment.

711
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,570
If the experiment had continued,

712
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,860
today's success

713
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,860
would not have belonged to

714
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,030
the virus and vaccine of the Cherry Blossom Project,

715
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,390
but rather to me!

716
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,220
My memory manipulation experiment! Understand?

717
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,920
Keep going.

718
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
That's all.

719
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,360
I've told you everything I know.

720
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,230
Can you let me go now?

721
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,360
I've already said everything.

722
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,440
Well then,

723
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,270
I'll perform all the experiments you've conducted

724
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,470
on yourself.

725
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,560
So you can

726
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,680
die meaningfully.

727
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,320
And then I'll let you go.

728
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,330
You lied to me? You lied to me!

729
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,160
You lied to me! You lied to me!

730
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,040
[The path of going astray is boundless, but turning back leads to salvation.]

731
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,980
Wei,

732
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,770
we've had quite a harvest today.

733
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,700
I'm particularly concerned about the records from Room Three.

734
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,080
During Li Shaotang's polygraph,

735
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,970
there were so many abnormal fluctuations.

736
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,430
If he really has problems,

737
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,600
handle it according to protocol.

738
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,270
Has the final test report come out?

739
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,950
Not yet.

740
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,690
Xu is working on it urgently.

741
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,180
If you're not reassured,

742
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,160
we can ask another department to do it.

743
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,560
If that's not enough, we'll have the Americans do it.

744
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,440
Feng,

745
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,250
let me give you a piece of advice.

746
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,480
When something happens,

747
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,900
don't just think about clearing yourself of any involvement.

748
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,540
I...

749
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,280
Shaotang's matter may not be

750
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,370
as complicated as you think.

751
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,970
Don't be too sensitive.

752
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,270
Our top priority

753
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,510
is to resolve the issue with Ou Xiao'an.

754
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,660
Ando insists

755
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,280
that Ou Xiao'an was working for Ohashi.

757
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,310
But Ou Xiao'an insists on denying it.

758
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,700
And he just proposed

759
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,120
to confront Ando.

760
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,650
We've never had a precedent

761
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,850
of having two suspects

762
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,310
confronting each other face-to-face.

763
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,640
What if they collude in false confession?

764
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,120
Agree to it, Wei.

765
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,300
Let them confront each other.

766
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,250
I'd like to see

767
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,960
what Ou Xiao'an has done

768
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,410
in these past four years.

769
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,640
Do you think it's okay?

770
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,560
Yes.

771
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,610
How about Feng?

772
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,830
Okay.

773
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,530
Okay.

774
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,230
I'll trust your judgment

775
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,860
and let them confront each other face-to-face.

Have you

780
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,770
always been in charge of the file room?

781
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,370
Yes.

782
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,950
I'm responsible for managing the files.

783
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,950
No one else has freely entered and exited the file room, right?

784
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,630
Yes.
