00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,180
Really?

196
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,840
They've only met once. Will it work?

197
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,480
Let me tell you, Sister.

198
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,350
Master

199
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,140
has introduced a lot of people to her.

200
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,230
But Moqing

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,570
always ignores them.

202
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,350
She does?

203
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,550
This time,

204
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,170
you can wait for the wedding.

205
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,370
That's enough.

206
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
Come, have a look.

207
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,860
I won't.

208
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,350
This is nice.

209
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,790
-Colonel Zhou is good. -He has good taste, right?

210
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes.

211
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,450
What else is there?

212
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,180
Mr. Zhou,

213
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,510
the dishes you ordered have been here for a long time.

214
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,330
They're already cold.

215
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,060
How about I heat them up for you?

216
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,140
Okay.

217
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,150
Take them.

218
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,910
Okay, please wait a moment.

219
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,970
It's okay.

220
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,480
Please enjoy.

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,330
I'm sorry, Section Chief Zhou.

222
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,820
It takes time

223
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,350
for a woman to dress up.

224
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,500
It's okay.

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,410
This cheongsam really suits you.

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,370
Section Chief Zhou has good taste.

227
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,630
The experienced tailors of that shop

228
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,790
are quite skilled.

229
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,090
Even ugly people look prettier

230
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,680
when they wear

231
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,390
their cheongsams.

232
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,980
That’s not what I mean.

233
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,760
Miss Qin is a born beauty.

234
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,180
This cheongsam

235
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
is just a bonus.

236
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,710
Thank you. I'm flattered.

237
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,350
Here.

238
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,540
Section Chief Zhou,

239
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,080
you are not what I expected.

240
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,600
What kind of person

241
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,100
did you think I am?

242
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,230
You became the section chief of the Secretariat

243
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,070
of the Military Commission at such a young age.

244
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,230
I thought

245
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,000
you must have been resourceful and slick.

246
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm clumsy of speech.

247
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,690
I got this job

248
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,690
thanks to

249
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,250
our Chairman's patronage.

250
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,530
So the Chairman is your connection?

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,740
Just little connection.

252
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,070
The Chairman's chief bodyguard and I

253
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,290
come from the same town.

254
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,720
We also went to the Huangpu Military Academy together.

255
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,420
So, I got the job

256
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,750
on the strength of his recommendation.

257
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,090
You're being too modest.

258
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,250
Working for the Secretariat of the Military Commission,

259
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,710
that's really promising.

260
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,500
I don't

261
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,070
really have much ambition.

262
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,610
Although I'm a section chief,

263
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,770
I'm just muddling along in the office.

264
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,550
I just want to

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,480
live in peace,

266
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,640
that's all.

267
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
We've been chatting.

268
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,350
Let's eat.

269
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,430
Okay.

270
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm clumsy. Sorry. Sorry.

271
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,790
It's okay.

272
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,020
I can do it myself.

273
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,790
Section Chief Zhou,

274
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,590
you don't have to

275
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,190
be so careful eating with me.

276
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,380
Here.

277
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,330
Have some.

278
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,850
Section Chief Zhou,

279
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,670
there's another thing

280
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,130
that's been bothering me.

281
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,910
Go ahead.

282
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,940
Actually, this isn't the first time we've met.

283
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,110
I suppose you've known about

284
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,490
my temper from what my brother have told you.

285
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,140
From what I know about you,

286
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,740
you shouldn't have been

287
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,400
interested in a girl like me.

288
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,340
You're smart.

289
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,440
I’ll tell you the truth.

290
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,950
Go ahead.

291
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,730
I know,

292
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,210
the difference between us

293
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,550
is too big.

294
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,790
I’m not good enough for you.

295
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,000
But Shen kept setting us up,

296
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,480
I couldn't turn him down.

297
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,150
Please

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,950
don't mind it

299
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,500
if I've disturbed you.

300
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,310
Shen?

301
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,980
You mean

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,820
Director Shen Congwu?

303
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,810
Yes.

304
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,590
We're close in private. So,

305
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,070
he's always been worried about my marriage.

306
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,350
I see.

307
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,670
If there's anything bothering you,

308
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,980
please let me know.

309
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,640
I won't bother you again.

310
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,300
Nothing's bothering me.

311
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,550
It's my honor

312
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,730
to be friends with you.

313
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,410
Here.

314
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,210
Let’s eat.

315
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,340
Zhou,

316
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,100
you know the Qin family's conditions.

317
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,070
Are you really gonna drop this?

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,910
Shen,

319
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,870
thank you for your kindness.

320
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,950
But Miss Qin

321
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,550
is way out of my league.

322
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,930
What are you talking about?

323
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
Well,

324
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,270
did you find something different about her?

325
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,310
Different?

326
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,890
So different.

327
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,690
I really can’t

328
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,310
deal with her temper.

329
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,140
How was it?

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,550
I expected this man

331
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,060
to get close to Qin Moqing

332
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,630
and find out her true identity.

333
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,690
I didn't expect him

334
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,270
to be so petty.

335
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,050
He can't even handle a lady.

336
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,770
If Ou Xiao'an told us the truth,

337
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,890
Qin Moqing was knocked out by him,

338
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,099
Then we can ruled out Qin Moqing.

339
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,099
Qin Jiru is not simple.

340
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,050
We've been investigating him thoroughly,

341
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,440
but there's no problem.

342
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,599
So we can't touch Qin Moqing.

343
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,770
Anyway,

344
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,260
I can't interfere

345
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,930
in your Chongqing Station.

346
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,560
Just keep an eye on Ou Xiao'an.

347
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,490
Yes.

348
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,750
The case of Wild Grass

349
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,150
is closed by the boss.

350
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,510
The most important things now are 810

351
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,590
and catching Ohashi Kazuya alive.

352
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,660
Also,

353
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,960
we need to find the Japanese spy inside of Chongqing Station.

354
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
Don't worry.

355
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,070
The boss still relies heavily on your service.

356
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,750
He needs you to deal with the Japanese

357
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,210
and biochemical weapons.

358
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,970
I understand.

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,010
By the way,

360
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,860
how is

361
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,230
the bomb shelter?

362
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,580
The blueprint is ready.

363
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,910
We can start the construction at any time.

364
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
I think we can

365
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,180
tell Feng Yunian about it.

366
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,370
Although your father-in-law

367
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,570
is a snob,

368
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,550
he's different from those careerists

369
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,790
like Wei Qingming.

370
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,920
He always sits on the fence.

371
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,490
You need to let him know

372
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,700
the boss still thinks highly of you.

373
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,980
It'll be good for you.

374
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,230
Yes.

375
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,030
Miao, watch your steps.

376
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,790
Miao, let’s take a break.

377
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,150
Get lost.

378
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,120
Okay.

379
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,160
Ma'am!

380
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,770
Any discovery?

381
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,670
Ma'am,

382
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,100
there's a building two kilometers ahead.

383
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,260
It's probably 810.

384
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,080
Let’s go.

385
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,800

They knew we were coming,

390

These are Japanese soldiers' clothes

and letters.

415
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,010
There are still a few boxes behind. They are taking them here.

416

let’s get out of here.

Too many people died here. There's this resentment vibe.

Where did they live when they were alive?

437
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,910

I contacted the search team immediately.

445

That night,

446
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,430
we went into the mountain.

447
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,890
Burma is mostly

448
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,220
covered by primitive forest.

449
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,380
So we had to open new roads along the way.

450
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,590
And we could meet the Japanese at any moment.

451
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,960
We came to a valley.

452
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,260
We had to

453
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,600
build a scalng ladder there

454
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,820

Although all the Japanese had evacuated,

456
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,100
we didn't expect

457
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,220
they had buried explosives there.

458
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,470
So,

459
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,240
those who entered the valley first

460
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,270
were ambushed.

475
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,120
for 810.

476
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,880
810 was so big.

477
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,680
They needed quite a lot of explosives

478
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,200
to bomb it into oblivion.

479
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,340
Actually, 810 had two parts.

480
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,720
There were three small buildings on the floor.

481
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,880
Judging from what’s left after the explosion,

482
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,290
it should've been the living area for the Japanese.

483
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,480
The real prison and lab

484
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,910

and blew up the bearing walls,

487
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,960
810 would be completely buried.

489

No.

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,560
♫Eyes filled with tears♫

579
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,760
Ou Xiao'an wants to eat!

580
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,130
♫Because of his ideal♫

581
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,920
♫Carrying old wounds♫

582
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,470
♫Threatened by crises on the battlefield♫

583
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,280
♫Look into the distance♫

584
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,930
♫Far away, yet so close♫

585
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,770
♫Emotions surging♫

586
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,600
♫Hot blood boiling♫

587
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,880
♫The journey before dawn is long♫

588
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,060
♫The further we go, the brighter it gets♫

589
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,220
♫Light shines into the battlefield♫

590
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:43,310
♫And breaks through the darkness♫

591
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,690
Mr. Ye.

592
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,480
Lou Mingyuan said

593
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,830
you are

594
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,950
a very strong person.

595
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,450
Don't give up easily.

596
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,380
What's your relationship

597
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,410
with Lou Mingyuan?

598
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,280
He was

599
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,970
our best comrade.

600
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,770
So,

601
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,950
Lou Mingyuan

602
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,100
was really a Communist.

603
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,000
When I first saw him,

604
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,510
he was still a child.

605
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,720
But he went down the mine

606
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,020
and did slave labour

607
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,610
with those men who were in their prime.

608
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,550
He lost his mother when he was little.

609
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,150
His father died in the mine.

610
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,240
He was raised

611
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,670
by those miners.

612
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,480
He was illiterate.

613
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,400
He almost

614
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,100
never left that mine.

615
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,160
At the age of 12,

616
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,380
he was

617
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,310
very mature.

618
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,300
He did slave labour with those miners

619
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,020
in the mine.

620
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,990
They smoked together and chatted.

621
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,250
He was already

622
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,050
a heavy smoker at a young age.

623
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,230
At that time,

624
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
I went to the mine to organize a workers' movement.

625
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,630
I lived

626
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,630
in the shed.

627
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,020
I read

628
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,650
and gave lectures to them

629
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,300
everyday.

630
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,600
Soon I noticed Lou Mingyuan.

631
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,130
He was smart

632
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,240
and sharp.

633
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,380
He had great comprehension.

634
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,190
Once I played a record for them.

635
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,620
He was very fascinated.

636
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,110
Then he asked me

637
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,310
if I could give him

638
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,510
the record.

639
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,600
I asked him why he wanted it.

640
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,950
He said

641
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,970
the music

642
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,640
made him think

643
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,600
the ideal of Communism

644
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,300
could be realized.

645
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,830
And that he wanted

646
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,770
to leave the mine for the first time

647
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:33,120
to go outside and fight for the ideal

648
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,650
of Communism.

649
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,040
It was

650
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,930
the Chopin Piano Sonata, right?
