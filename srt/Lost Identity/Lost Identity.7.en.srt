1
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,240
sit down

2
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,640
What's going on, dad?

3
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,240
Shaotang

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Usually at the station

5
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
You are always the last one to leave

6
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,800
Why has Ou Xiaoan been interrogated in the past two days?

7
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
Are you going to get off work when you arrive?

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
I don’t see you asking about it either.

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
The result of the interrogation

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,200
Are you avoiding something?

11
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,320
dad

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Based on my relationship with Jingxian

13
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,520
You have to avoid any suspicion to some extent.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,040
Besides, you know me

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
Things you shouldn’t ask

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
I never ask

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,320
What if this matter has anything to do with you?

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
what do you mean

19
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,280
Teacher Wen

20
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,280
rare

21
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,440
Can you still remember Wen Yishan?

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,680
My brain has forgotten everything

23
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,360
But back to Chongqing Station

24
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,200
I still know the teacher

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,880
It's great to be back alive

26
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,440
When I sent you to Shanghai

27
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Just because you are my best student

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
disappoint you

29
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Not disappointed

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,760
I hate it to the core of my bones

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Thanks to you

32
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
I changed from the webmaster to the deputy webmaster

33
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,079
Just focus on this

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Don’t you want to tell me something?

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
You ask

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,760
What have you been through these years?

37
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
Don't you have any impression at all?

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
I really forgot

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Not a single fragment

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
I only have a few images in my mind

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
I remember that time

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm in a

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
in the laboratory

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,280
Biochemistry laboratory

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,600
There are many medicine bottles around

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
Someone give me treatment

47
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,200
Then inject me with medicine

48
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,279
Then

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Ask me questions

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
What did I ask you?

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,840
I really can't remember

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,159
sitting next to me

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
Is he that good student of mine back then?

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Is it Ou Xiaoan who is loyal to the party and state?

55
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,640
teacher

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
I am definitely your good student

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
If I help you

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,760
if not

59
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Please help me recall my memories first

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,600
At that time, Teacher Wen sent me to Shanghai

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,320
What mission is it performing?

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
Find out the Cherry Blossom Plan

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
Smash Ohashi Kazuno's conspiracy

64
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
but you failed

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,920
Information about the Cherry Blossom Project

66
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
It was brought back by Li Shaotang

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Lai Shaotang

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,520
Is there no problem?

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
You said you were loyal to the party-state

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,080
He said he was loyal to the party-state

71
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,080
you two

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,880
Someone has to prove his innocence

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,640
live well

74
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
today

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,400
Ou Xiaoan identified you as a Japanese spy

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
What

77
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
what? What

78
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
Ou Xiaoan identified you as a Japanese spy

79
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,720
dad

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Ou Xiaoan’s current mental state

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
you know best

82
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
what he said

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
How can anyone believe it?

84
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,680
Moreover

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
When I returned to Chongqing

86
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,840
Get the information right away

87
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,800
Gave it to Boss Dai

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
You and several experts

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
I've tested it myself, too.

90
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,920
besides

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Records of my actions in military command over the years

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,680
All on file

93
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,200
you won't

94
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
Because of his accusation

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,520
Just doubt me

96
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Shaotang

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
You and Jingxian are getting engaged

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,680
There are some things you have to choose clearly for yourself

99
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm not your judge

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,760
Believe it or not, you have nothing to do with me

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
If someone really throws dirty water at you

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
You have to clean yourself

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,640
Don't make it last

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,040
No one can get off the stage

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,560
I just want to let you know

106
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Go back and think about it for yourself

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Thank you dad

108
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
You should also go to bed early

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
Shizuka

110
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,920
About the wedding

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,440
should

112
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
Can't be held

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm coming today

114
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,960
I'm saying goodbye to you

115
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Take it to Chongqing

116
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Leave it to the webmaster of Chongqing Station

117
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm not allowed to leave your sight, you know?

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,640
Ou Xiaoan committed suicide

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,800
Call an ambulance quickly

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,840
quick

121
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,880
hurry up

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
hurry up

123
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,200
Ou Xiaoan is willing to die to express his ambition.

124
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Who will he die for?

125
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,320
Lao Wen

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,760
without my permission yesterday

127
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
You go and meet him privately

128
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
Now the station is trying to catch a traitor

129
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,360
Are you hitting the muzzle of the gun?

130
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,640
How old are you?

131
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Must go to see him

132
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,480
That was also my student

133
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll go see if there's anything wrong with him

134
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
There's a problem, you can't explain it clearly?

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
He committed suicide after you met him.

136
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Lao Wen, let me ask you

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
He's cuffed there

138
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,720
How did he get that pen into his hands?

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,520
I'll put this here

140
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,480
Before the traitor can be found,

141
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,560
Ou Xiaoan must not die

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,640
Lao Wen

143
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
When you went to see Ou Xiaoan yesterday,

144
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,240
You didn't bring a pen?

145
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
You let him continue the trial?

146
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
Where did that sum of money come from?

147
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,800
What are you in a hurry for?

148
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,120
Aren't we analyzing?

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
The relationship between master and disciple is deep

150
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,760
The shopkeeper's

151
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,080
I just cleaned the house

152
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I found this thing as soon as I turned around.

153
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
What the hell

154
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,160
Are we being watched?

155
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,680
Will it expose the target?

156
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,400
Transfer now

157
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,680
etc.

158
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
When you just saw this glutinous rice cake

159
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
what does it look like

160
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,400
Things are upside down

161
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,680
The mouth is open

162
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Sir's clothes are in tatters like this

163
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,480
It's time for a new body

164
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,160
Shoulder width one foot three

165
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,640
Sleeve length one foot nine

166
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Pants length three feet three

167
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,360
Don't worry, I'm safe

168
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
Two feet seven

169
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,920
haven't seen you for a long time

170
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
I miss you so much

171
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
elder sister

172
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,040
Sister can't even believe me

173
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
Why did you come to Chongqing?

174
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,400
two years ago

175
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
I ended the lurking mission in Jiangbei

176
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
Organizationally, I was transferred to the base area

177
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
Work in Social Security Section 1

178
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,120
You and Comrade Weeds

179
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,960
reported to the central government

180
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,040
About Ou Xiaoan

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,280
Superiors attach great importance to

182
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
After multiple verifications

183
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,720
A more complex situation was discovered

184
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,320
So I sent me here to help you deal with it.

185
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
What is the specific situation?

186
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,400
Lou Mingyuan back then

187
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Did develop a secret party member

188
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
To ensure his safety

189
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,280
He only reported to Secretary Chen Ke alone

190
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,160
And Secretary Chen

191
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
He also reported secretly to the organization

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,680
The organization has verified this matter

193
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
but

194
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,160
There is no organizational record

195
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
The exact identity of this person

196
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,120
If it is really Ou Xiaoan

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,280
He must be allowed to establish contact with the organization as soon as possible

198
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,920
This is also my main mission here

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,480
good

200
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
we have a few things

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Need to find out as soon as possible

202
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,800
First is 810

203
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,280
The problem with Kazuno Ohashi

204
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
There is also

205
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,880
Secretary Chen and his line

206
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
gay situation

207
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,240
And these situations

208
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,600
They all need the help of that secret party member

209
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you have contact information?

210
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
have

211
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,840
Lou Mingyuan back then

212
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,200
I left him a contact information

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,360
This time the organization discovered during the verification

214
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,160
But even if Ou Xiaoan

215
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,720
It's the secret party member

216
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,520
He has lost contact with the organization for so many years

217
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Given his current situation

218
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
It would be risky to contact him directly.

219
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,440
The organization has also considered this matter

220
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
But when things are urgent, follow the right

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
As long as Ou Xiaoan can connect with me

222
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,480
At least it can explain

223
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,000
He is the secret party member

224
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
But if Ou Xiaoan didn't show up

225
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Then his identity

226
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,560
It's still suspicious

227
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,320
good

228
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,160
sister

229
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
This time I come to Chongqing

230
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,600
I am the young owner of a drug store from Guangdong.

231
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Called Huo Daming

232
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,800
I'll be in the paper tomorrow

233
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,920
Log out the connector password

234
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,880
If Ou Xiaoan is the secret party member

235
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
if he saw

236
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,200
You will definitely come to see me

237
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
According to organizational regulations

238
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,600
I can only stay for three days

239
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
If no one shows up in three days

240
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I must evacuate

241
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,120
But the information returned by Comrade Yecao

242
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
Ou Xiaoan attempted suicide

243
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Already been sent to the hospital

244
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
Comrade Weed

245
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Can you ask her to do some cooperation?

246
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,720
Boss Huo has come up with new materials from now on

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
I'll notify you as soon as possible

248
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,800
Sorry to trouble you

249
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,680
The shopkeeper's

250
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,000
Come

251
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
Take it

252
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Thank you very much, shopkeeper. I will take my leave now.

253
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Walk slowly

254
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,880
Stay

255
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,200
The shopkeeper's

256
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,599
This comrade sent by the organization

257
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,119
It's your brother

258
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Although he is my biological brother

259
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,319
But the organization requires

260
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,720
One-way contact is required

261
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,359
Miss Tan's matter

262
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
must be kept confidential

263
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
clear

264
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,359
Sold the newspaper, sold the newspaper, sold the newspaper

265
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,079
Beautiful sister, buy a newspaper

266
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,760
No thanks

267
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
Sister, you look so good-looking

268
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,720
Sent to you

269
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm selling newspapers. I'm selling newspapers. I'm selling newspapers.

270
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
Zhang Pingyang from Taiyuan

271
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,440
No news for more than ten years

272
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,640
See the report letter

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,080
Anyone with knowledge please report

274
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,760
No. 28, Lane 15, Zizhong Road, Shanghai

275
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,000
Zhang Jingmao

276
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
this

277
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,960
It's our secret code

278
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
woke up

279
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,840
why are you here

280
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,120
Come and see you, senior brother

281
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,400
Why do you still think of committing suicide?

282
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
What did you use to tie it?

283
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,120
No tools

284
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,840
Just bite it with your teeth

285
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
Cut your wrists with a pen

286
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,080
Also cut crookedly

287
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
This is for escape

288
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,640
You are so cruel to yourself

289
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,200
This will only be used once

290
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll have to pierce my eyes next time

291
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,120
It's okay, you don't have to look at me here

292
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
I can't commit suicide anymore while I'm busy with you

293
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,400
Something happened

294
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Business

295
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
What's serious

296
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,680
You have been following that bridge for so long

297
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Thousands of poison gas bombs were produced on August 10th

298
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
You know this, right?

299
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
Now this batch of poison gas bombs

300
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
Already shipped to China

301
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
May be delivered at any time

302
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,800
Where will this gas bomb be dropped?

303
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
This is what I want to ask you

304
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,000
No one told me either

305
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
Don't think carefully

306
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
really do not know

307
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,760
What is 9548?

308
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
nine five forty eight

309
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,160
You were talking in your sleep just now

310
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
nine five forty eight

311
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,080
It's just there in my mind, I can't remember it

312
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
What's coming

313
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,920
Okay, you should have a good rest.

314
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,920
There's a wonton restaurant downstairs that's pretty good

315
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,760
You can try it later

316
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,720
OK

317
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,760
gone

318
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,080
Slow down

319
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,640
When he committed suicide last night

320
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
What have you both done?

321
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
Because it is our own confinement room

322
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,000
We didn't look that carefully

323
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
Go back and send more manpower

324
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Something happened to him

325
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,360
You two can't take this responsibility

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,360
Pay close attention to everyone

327
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,720
yes

328
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,360
Section Chief Li has been losing weight lately.

329
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
Thank you for your concern, Xiaomiao

330
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,800
Shaotang

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm really sorry, Webmaster Wei.

332
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
I have something urgent at the moment

333
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,520
See you later

334
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,840
What's up

335
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Said I have something to do with you

336
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,800
Came here early in the morning

337
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Ou Xiaoan

338
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Ou Xiaoan

339
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,520
Ou Xiaoan

340
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,360
Sir, where are you going?

341
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,040
master

342
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
Chongqing is so familiar to you

343
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,280
Are you sure you haven't?

344
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,000
The house number is nine thousand five hundred and forty-eight.

345
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,560
I've walked so many streets

346
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
Indeed not

347
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,760
Isn’t there number ninety-five?

348
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,240
Is there any number on the 48th?

349
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,840
It depends on which street you go to.

350
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
Then take me to see them all

351
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll give you double fare

352
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,880
Take a look at them all

353
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,560
You have to sit down

354
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,320
This medicine should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening.

355
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,320
Be sure to remember it well

356
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,240
Good morning sir

357
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
What medicine should I take?

358
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
Angelica one or two and nine cents

359
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
Poria cocos four taels a penny

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,480
Honeysuckle three ounces and three cents

361
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,640
Sorry sir

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
Angelica and honeysuckle have been sold out

363
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,280
Please go to another store to check it out.

364
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,720
See if you can look for it again

365
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,600
My family member has a relapse of an old disease

366
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,640
Caught here before

367
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,520
I don’t know what illness your family member has.

368
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,440
Not sure exactly

369
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,120
Just know to want

370
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,600
Treat winter diseases in summer

371
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,560
Invite the house

372
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
What is the name of this comrade?

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,280
Li Shaotang Li at dawn

374
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,960
You are the informant

375
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,720
right

376
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,920
Hodamine

377
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Hello

378
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,960
four years ago

379
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,880
I thought the organization

380
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
Already forgotten about me

381
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,120
The organization only recently found your contact information

382
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,120
please understand

383
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,960
clear

384
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
Since you have lost contact with the organization for a long time

385
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
need you to explain the situation

386
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,800
Give me a complete report

387
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,200
hope you can cooperate

388
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,160
good

389
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
sit

390
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,480
why are you here today

391
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
At that time, Lou Mingyuan

392
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
You gave me a way to decode the connector code.

393
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,840
He warned me

394
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
If you lose contact with him

395
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,240
Just pay attention to the daily Ta Kung Pao

396
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
If you see a person named Zhang Jingmao

397
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,360
Looking for his cousin

398
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
It means the organization is calling me.

399
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,360
How did you and Lou Mingyuan meet?

400
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,520
At the Oz Ballroom

401
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,080
When I was in Japan

402
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,720
Studying at

403
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,440
Biochemistry major at Tokyo Imperial University

404
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,200
Later, after graduating and returning to China,

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,360
My teacher introduced me to

406
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,800
A biochemical research institute in Shanghai

407
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,800
Be an experimenter

408
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,360
I didn't know until later

409
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,840
That institute

410
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
It's Ohashi Kazuno

411
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,240
A place used to study biological weapons

412
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,800
Biochemical weapons are too cruel

413
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,280
I can't accept it

414
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,040
But by that time Shanghai had already fallen

415
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
i have nowhere to go

416
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
Japanese military police are everywhere

417
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,640
and the agent on Shigaota Road.

418
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,120
I can only drink at the Oz Ballroom every day

419
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,040
I met Lou Mingyuan at that time

420
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,760
When did Lou Mingyuan develop you?

421
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,480
Thirty years of the Republic of China, maybe

422
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,120
I can't remember exactly.

423
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,120
But the time when I joined the party

424
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,680
I always remember very clearly

425
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,000
where and when

426
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,880
April 11, 30th year of the Republic of China

427
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
The oath taking place is upstairs at the Oz Ballroom

428
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,520
Lou Mingyuan's office

429
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,080
Are there any other party introducers present?

430
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,280
No

431
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,800
Comrade Mingyuan explained to me

432
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
There is a one-way connection between us

433
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,400
That was the day he issued the order

434
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,240
The task of getting the information of the Falling Sakura Project

435
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,000
code name sundial

436
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I didn't know until later

437
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Use the same code name as the military commander

438
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
Just to take advantage of the military commander's actions

439
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,560
to complete our party's mission

440
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,080
Stop the Sakura Plan

441
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,080
It was also that time

442
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
I know Lou Mingyuan’s identity

443
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
Does anyone in the military know your identity?

444
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,120
No

445
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,400
So sure

446
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,560
right

447
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,720
Comrade Mingyuan’s protection for me

448
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
than his own life

449
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,720
He is very cautious about this

450
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
Do you know Ou Xiaoan?

451
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,280
know

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,920
I only found out later

453
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
He is also Comrade Mingyuan

454
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,280
Another line of development

455
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,520
It was Shanghai where he arranged for me to evacuate.

456
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,480
Lou Mingyuan introduced you to

457
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,880
no

458
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,760
Ou Xiaoan didn't know my identity at first

459
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,400
It was after Lou Mingyuan was arrested

460
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
We just got in touch

461
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,080
He wanted to personally escort me out of Shanghai

462
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,360
But then I don’t know why

463
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,320
He stayed in Shanghai

464
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
It's a few other people from the army

465
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,480
Escort me to evacuate to Chongqing

466
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,120
Comrade

467
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,080
Comrade Mingyuan clearly told me

468
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,640
These information and circumstances of mine

469
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
Already reported to the organization

470
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,720
Doesn’t the organization have records?

471
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,960
Don't be anxious first

472
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,280
I will check with the organization

473
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm at Chongqing Station now

474
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,600
Section Chief of the Stunt Room

475
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,200
You can also come into contact with a lot of

476
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,680
Internal information and information

477
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
If the organization needs

478
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,160
I can transcribe it and escort it over.

479
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,360
Don't act rashly

480
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,560
your situation

481
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,720
I still need to make another report

482
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,720
As soon as there is news

483
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,840
I will take the initiative to contact you

484
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,040
so

485
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Keep this book

486
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,640
It's a new codebook

487
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,760
The decoding method is also in it

488
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,800
Remember to burn it after reading it

489
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
from now on

490
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,200
Your mission codename is

491
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
oriole

492
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,120
yes

493
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
gentlemen

494
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,800
All over the streets and alleys of Chongqing

495
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,240
Where are you going?

496
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,760
I am indeed tired

497
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,360
so

498
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm really sorry

499
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,640
There is no other car here

500
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,480
you pull me

501
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,400
Let's go around again

502
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,400
good

503
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,680
Look at the car Look at the car

504
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,120
watch cars

505
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,840
Look at the car Look at the car

506
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,640
Shizuka

507
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,480
How did you come

508
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,960
I

509
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,040
Just passing by

510
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,800
come and see you

511
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,680
Didn’t you lose your memory?

512
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,320
You remembered it all

513
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
No

514
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
I have forgotten many things

515
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
a large part of memory

516
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,120
Can't even remember

517
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,640
I heard that people above are investigating you.

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Did you accuse Li Shaotang of being a spy?

519
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,800
right

520
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,160
Can you please stop causing trouble for him?

521
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,120
I've been waiting for you for several years

522
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,520
I also looked for you when you went to Shanghai

523
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
But I don't even know where you went

524
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Why don't you show up?

525
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,920
I went to see you before I went on a mission

526
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,720
but

527
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,560
didn't see you

528
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,360
you came to me

529
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,520
Then why don't you say hello to me?

530
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,000
why don't you talk to me

531
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,800
nature of my job

532
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,160
I couldn't talk to you then

533
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,680
Can't say hello to you

534
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm afraid of bringing you trouble

535
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
Your job

536
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,240
Your job is to be a spy

537
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,440
Your job is to be a traitor, right?

538
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,520
I was

539
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,840
It was Shangfeng who sent me a secret mission

540
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm not a traitor

541
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
I'm not going to vote for the sun either.

542
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
Don't lie to me again

543
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,760
They all told me

544
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,080
You killed one of your own

545
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
That's why you absconded to Shanghai

546
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,840
Later I said you were dead

547
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,520
I've seen that photo too

548
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm convinced too

549
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,400
The person in that photo is indeed you

550
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,280
Then just think of me as dead

551
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,080
Xiaoan

552
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
I admit

553
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,120
i did love you before

554
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,120
I also believe that we must have loved each other

555
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
But I'm engaged now

556
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,520
I hope you can wish me happiness

557
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,000
I wish you happiness

558
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,360
but i hope

559
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,480
before you make any decision

560
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
Observe Li Shaotang more

561
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't hurt yourself in the end

562
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,000
I will

563
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,760
I don’t have to trouble you to take care of me anymore

564
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
Ou Xiaoan

565
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,880
you said before

566
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,199
let me wait for you to come back

567
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,760
Waiting for you to come back and marry me

568
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,560
But I can't wait for you anymore

569
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,360
Miss

570
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,679
Miss

571
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,160
Mr. Li is here

572
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
Miss

573
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,720
Are you OK

574
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
I'm fine

575
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,160
You tell Mr. Li to wait a moment

576
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,400
I'll go down right away

577
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,280
Shaotang

578
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
What's wrong

579
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,400
nothing

580
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,360
I just suddenly thought of it

581
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,400
If I could take you home

582
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,120
That must be my blessing, Li Shaotang

583
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,120
sit down

584
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,320
Shaotang

585
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,160
What have you been busy with lately?

586
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,040
We haven't seen each other for a long time

587
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,920
I don’t usually look at you

588
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,480
Have you cared about my work?

589
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,520
Why do you suddenly ask me today?

590
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
Ou Xiaoan came to see me today

591
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
What is he looking for you for?

592
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,680
He didn't hurt you, did he?

593
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,400
No

594
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,240
What does he want from you?

595
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,160
He told me

596
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,520
let me be careful

597
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Did he tell you?

598
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,360
Do you suspect that I am a Japanese spy?

599
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,120
Shizuka

600
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Ou Xiaoan's purpose of escaping this time

601
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,720
we don't know yet

602
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
All we know is that he is now a

603
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,000
extremely mentally disturbed person

604
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,880
No one will believe what he says

605
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,200
Shizuka

606
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,000
Is it about me?

607
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,440
The matter of Japanese spies

608
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,440
The station will definitely investigate clearly.

609
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,240
Give me an explanation and clear my name

610
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,520
Shizuka

611
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,640
I promise you that

612
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,040
I am Li Shaotang

613
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,240
Must be a person loyal to the party and state

614
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,600
these years

615
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
you know too

616
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,200
Ou Xiaoan and I are different

617
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm definitely one

618
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,600
The person you can trust for your whole life

619
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,880
Mr. Zhang, have you been waiting for a long time?

620
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,160
If your wife is not satisfied when you go back

621
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,560
Can be modified at any time

622
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,120
Change it until she is satisfied

623
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,080
OK

624
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,320
You walk slowly

625
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,000
The shopkeeper's

626
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,480
I don’t know who sent me a theater ticket

627
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,520
Transfer building

628
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,400
placed under the satin fabric

629
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,160
The time is this afternoon

630
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,120
Lao Lin

631
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
I'll go out while you check the store in the afternoon.

632
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,000
good

633
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,720
good

634
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,280
Lai Shaotang

635
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,240
How could it be him?

636
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,880
I didn't expect it at all

637
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,480
But the details he reported

638
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,680
They are all the same as Lou Mingyuan back then

639
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,400
The actions in Shanghai are exactly the same

640
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,360
and

641
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,320
He can find the contact point with perfect accuracy

642
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,560
And match the password

643
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,680
Basically can explain

644
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,160
He is the secret party member

645
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,520
However, the specific situation still needs to be investigated

646
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Sister, before confirming his identity

647
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,520
I can't go to your store anymore

648
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
So as not to expose you

649
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,480
Yunjie

650
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
You've really made progress

651
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,600
According to organizational regulations

652
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,120
I have to take the next step

653
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,240
Although his statement is perfect

654
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
But for us

655
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,000
He is still a blank piece of paper

656
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,240
I still have doubts

657
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,640
You'd better be more vigilant

658
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
His situation and identity background

659
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
I will report it to the organization as soon as possible

660
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,880
Let the comrades in the Northeast check it out

661
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,720
But it took too long to go back and forth.

662
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
That will have to wait until the organization has verified it.

663
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,360
Make another decision

664
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
Don't meet him frequently

665
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,840
knew

666
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
What about Ou Xiaoan?

667
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,760
How are you going to deal with it?

668
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,320
I'll let the weeds continue to stare at him

669
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,040
good

670
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,400
Then I'll leave first

671
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Wait a moment

672
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
I'll give you an address later

673
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,880
If there is an emergency

674
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,320
we meet there

675
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,960
good

676
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,760
You and I will catch up and go forward

677
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,960
Slow down, come on, come on

678
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,240
Be careful, be careful, be careful

679
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,480
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

680
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,760
Miss

681
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,600
You haven't eaten all day

682
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,200
I made some soup

683
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,120
Drink as much as possible

684
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,280
Wu Ma

685
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,600
Why is this invitation still here?

686
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,680
Shouldn't it have been sent out long ago?

687
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,120
Blame me

688
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Getting older

689
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,920
My brain is useless

690
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,520
Such an important thing

691
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,120
I even forgot

692
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,760
Is it because dad won’t let you send it out?
