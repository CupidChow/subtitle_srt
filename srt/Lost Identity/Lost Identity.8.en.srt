1
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,120
take things out

2
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,360
take things out

3
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,400
anything else

4
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
take it out

5
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
Three Kingdoms

6
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
Why don't you put it in a dark place?

7
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
Open the document bag

8
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,240
This is the task assigned to me by Shangfeng

9
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Open the document bag

10
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,920
what is this

11
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,600
Feel sorry

12
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,000
No comment

13
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,880
all over the country

14
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Air raid shelter plan

15
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
This is a big secret

16
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
You are a biochemistry specialist

17
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
What do you want this for?

18
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
Ou Xiaoan

19
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,600
You do this for work

20
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
Still Jingxian

21
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,320
I don't do anything

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
Just simply

23
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,920
against you

24
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Turn around

25
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
Turn around

26
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,080
Been following me for a day

27
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,080
What's up

28
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,040
Nothing

29
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,800
After all, we are from the same school.

30
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,760
No need to hold a gun

31
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,240
So tit-for-tat, right?

32
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,680
Nothing

33
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,880
Just curious

34
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,200
Curious about your identity

35
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,320
Does it matter to you who I am?

36
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
It's important, of course it's important

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
After all, there are so many doubts about your identity now

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,680
What if you are really a Japanese spy?

39
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,440
Maybe you are my spiritual sword

40
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
But I still want to believe you

41
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,120
Even if it is to avoid involving Teacher Wen

42
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
Teacher Wen

43
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,720
So it was Teacher Wen who asked you to stay at my place

44
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,159
leave a newspaper

45
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
It's probably because your brain is injured and you're overthinking it.

46
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,880
Reading and reading newspapers has always been my daily routine

47
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
Not as complicated as you think

48
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
Stop following me

49
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,600
Not good for you

50
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,320
Master Lin

51
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Your boss’s wife

52
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you want to do business?

53
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Yes Yes Yes

54
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,360
What time is it now?

55
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,600
The store is so busy

56
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,960
No one cares

57
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
The landlady is sick

58
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
They are all regular customers.

59
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,920
Help, help, help

60
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,520
Master Lin

61
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
Is the cheongsam I ordered ready?

62
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,600
Immediately, immediately

63
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,159
good good good good

64
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,840
Sweet and delicious ice powder

65
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
Sir, would you like a bowl of ice powder?

66
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,600
A bowl of ice powder

67
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,360
okay

68
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,120
Come

69
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,720
Here comes the ice powder. Here comes a bowl of ice powder.

70
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,880
boss

71
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
How much does a bowl cost?

72
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
one dollar one dollar

73
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Sir, please walk slowly

74
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
give me a bowl

75
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Yunjie

76
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
last Friday

77
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,280
Our guerrillas in Yunnan and Burma

78
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
Encountered a Japanese convoy

79
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,799
A firefight broke out between the two sides

80
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Not big in scale

81
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
But our casualties were heavy

82
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
Almost the entire army was annihilated

83
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
It's because the enemy is in the crossfire

84
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Poison gas was used

85
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
This is the first time in the Yunnan-Myanmar region

86
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
These biological and chemical weapons

87
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
Must be from 810

88
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
as far as I know

89
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,840
Juntong intercepted the Japanese military's secret message

90
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,120
They started from 810

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,200
Eight thousand four hundred gas bombs were shipped out

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
And invested in five destinations

93
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,280
But we don’t have a specific address now

94
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
This important information

95
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,560
The weeds told me

96
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
I have already reported it to my superiors

97
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
Eight thousand four hundred pieces

98
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
Even one of these five coordinates explodes

99
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
The consequences will be disastrous

100
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
our team

101
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,600
Resistance to biological and chemical weapons is almost zero

102
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240
This Li Shaotang is a biochemistry expert

103
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
He is also a participant in the Cherry Blossom Project

104
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,360
He is so important to us

105
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,960
If Li Shaotang is not one of ours

106
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,760
Have you thought about the consequences?

107
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,240
Things about Li Shaotang

108
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,520
I've already reported it to my superiors

109
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
The superior means

110
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
Since he matched the code

111
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,640
In principle we should give trust

112
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Given the complexity of the situation

113
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Our superiors hope that we can handle it as appropriate

114
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
Once his identity is confirmed

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Enable him now

116
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,120
Yunjie

117
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,440
If by any chance he has a problem

118
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
I mean just in case

119
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
You have to protect yourself

120
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,080
Sister, don’t worry

121
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,840
I know the importance of the task

122
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,720
I will definitely be careful

123
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,840
Deputy Webmaster Feng

124
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
The gun is here

125
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,680
Ou Xiaoan

126
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
You are quite powerful

127
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
in full view

128
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,880
You actually ran out

129
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
I come out

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
In fact, it is also for

131
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
find some evidence

132
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
There are clues

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,240
Everything is here

134
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,840
Please take a look

135
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Chongqing’s geography and hydrology

136
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,280
Major facilities in the Kuomintang-controlled area

137
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
and distribution map of air raid shelters

138
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,680
There are also several secret underground military facilities

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,760
this

140
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Where did you get these files?

141
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,320
these confidential documents

142
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
They are all from Li Shaotang's family

143
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
Found it in the dark room

144
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
Li Shaotang's family

145
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
Including this Romance of the Three Kingdoms

146
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
normal family

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,920
I won’t read Romance of the Three Kingdoms

148
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,160
Put it in a dark room

149
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,360
I've been thinking about it recently

150
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,000
The bridge diverted so many gas bombs

151
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
He needs a place to store

152
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,360
And store poison gas bombs

153
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,800
for the environment

154
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,080
Temperature requirements are very high in all aspects

155
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
i see these

156
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
Chongqing underground hydrological air raid shelter

157
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,920
I was just thinking

158
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,640
Do you need to find a bridge from here?

159
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,240
Where gas bombs are stored

160
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
did you mean

161
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,840
Li Shaotang is helping Daqiao work

162
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,280
Then I don't know

163
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,480
But as far as I know

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,760
Based on Lai Shaotang’s scope of work

165
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,520
He has no access to these confidential documents

166
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,600
Okay, please walk slowly

167
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,280
Ronaldinho

168
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,080
boss

169
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
A batch of herbs just arrived at the warehouse today

170
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Do you want to take a look?

171
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,680
herbal medicine

172
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,360
right

173
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,640
knew

174
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,240
Go put up a sign saying "winter diseases are treated in summer"

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,960
good

176
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,560
What's wrong

177
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
Didn’t you say you’d wait for me to find you?

178
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,680
There is an emergency

179
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,400
Ou Xiaoan suddenly broke into my house last night

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,800
I took away the Romance of the Three Kingdoms

181
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,240
And I am from the Military Tong Database

182
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,200
stolen secret documents

183
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Also searched by him

184
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
He knows that's our contact information

185
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,240
He must know that Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a code book

186
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,240
But don't worry

187
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
I burned it after reading the decoding method.

188
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
what is that document

189
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
Urban air raid shelter layout information

190
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,320
I am participating in the renovation plan of the air raid shelter

191
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
The military commander specially approved my transfer

192
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Said it was for reference

193
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,280
Is there any backup?

194
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,520
No

195
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,320
I originally thought about asking you for instructions

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
I'll make a copy of it and send it to you right away.

197
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,320
I didn't expect it to be taken away by him

198
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,560
You are a biochemistry expert

199
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
Why did the military commander let you

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Go study air raid shelters

201
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,680
In response to Japanese biological and chemical weapons

202
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,880
The military commander ordered me to take over the air-raid shelter dedicated to high-level officials.

203
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,160
Make anti-toxic modifications

204
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,400
its not right

205
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Then why did Ou Xiaoan take it away?

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,960
What about Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

207
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm aware of your identity

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,920
probably not

209
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,000
Ou Xiaoan has always accused me of being a Japanese spy

210
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,400
Working for Ohashi Kazuno

211
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
japanese spy

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
At that time, Lou Mingyuan

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,720
After many agents of Hejuntong were arrested

214
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,080
He insisted

215
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
It was I who betrayed the military commander to the Japanese

216
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
he said so

217
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,000
Is there any basis for this?

218
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
I don't know that

219
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,400
I think

220
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,120
Maybe it has something to do with his confused memory.

221
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,040
But Ou Xiaoan is targeting you like this

222
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
You will have a lot of trouble in the army, right?

223
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,120
Everything seems to be working fine so far

224
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
After all, it involves a top-secret mission to the summit.

225
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,680
Chongqing Station will not suspend my work

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,520
But there is indeed trouble

227
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,600
The stunt room is already testing me.

228
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Is there any risk of exposure?

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm worried they'll take a lie detector test

230
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Lie detection techniques and methods in the stunt room

231
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
All given by Americans

232
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,800
Although it seems like a lot of trivial problems

233
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,880
But it is actually targeted

234
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
Conduct lie detection around a core doubt

235
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,800
Lie detector question

236
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,760
It should be Ou Xiaoan

237
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,480
Regarding the fact that I am a Japanese spy

238
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm not worried about that

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,960
What I'm worried about is

240
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
They found out that I was working for the Chinese Communist Party

241
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,280
so

242
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
You first go buy a book written in the 30th year of the Republic of China.

243
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,680
Full script of Dang Kou Zhi

244
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,800
as new codebook

245
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,360
Over there with the polygraph

246
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
Let me help you find a way

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,040
Okay, then I'll go first

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Deputy Webmaster Feng

249
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,120
Before you make any decision for Jingxian

250
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,120
At least find out the details about Li Shaotang first

251
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,400
Just these few drawings

252
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,880
One-sided words with you

253
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,840
How can I believe you

254
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
I don't need you to believe me

255
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll cut a hole for you

256
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
leftover

257
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,600
We have to rely on Chongqing Station to check it ourselves.

258
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
What do you want

259
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
Clues found

260
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,440
my task is completed

261
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,000
Take me back to the station

262
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,000
You want to go back to Chongqing Station

263
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,720
right

264
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
At least

265
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
I have to prove my innocence

266
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,200
good

267
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Pick up Webmaster Wei

268
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,880
Lao Wei

269
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,880
Ou Xiaoan is at my house

270
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,400
Send some people to escort him back to the station

271
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
No

272
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
He asked to go back on his own initiative

273
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,440
good

274
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,440
Li Shaotang told me

275
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Ou Xiaoan under interrogation

276
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,440
He accused Li Shaotang of being a traitor

277
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,000
Do things for the Japanese

278
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
and went to his house after escaping from prison

279
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
The information and code books of the air raid shelter were confiscated.

280
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
do you feel

281
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
he is lying

282
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,840
He is a very strict person in speaking

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,680
As soon as you hear it, you can tell that you have received professional training.

284
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
did he lie

285
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
I have no way of knowing

286
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,800
Does he know?

287
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,400
We are also testing Ou Xiaoan

288
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,040
Don't worry, he doesn't know

289
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,320
By the way, sister, there is one more thing

290
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,120
Li Shaotang is about to face a polygraph test by the military commander

291
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,960
Although he has received professional training

292
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
But I'm worried something might still go wrong

293
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,480
Is it possible for Comrade Yecao to

294
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,960
Make some cooperation

295
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
Comrade Wang

296
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
you in front of him

297
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Didn't you mention weeds?

298
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,480
Of course I didn't say that

299
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,360
Now I am also an old revolutionary

300
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Don't look down on me

301
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,080
After all, Li Shaotang, a biochemical expert,

302
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
It's so important to us

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,040
The webmaster has arrived

304
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,160
The big hero is back

305
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,240
Is there something you want to tell me?

306
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
Don’t you see the drawings?

307
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,960
Revealed by Li Shaotang's family

308
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,320
It is clearly marked above

309
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,120
Temperature and humidity in each air raid shelter

310
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,360
concealed ventilation

311
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,960
What are these?

312
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,240
These are all important conditions for storing poison gas bombs

313
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,960
Been making trouble for a long time

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,280
You committed suicide and escaped from prison

315
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,680
Just go find this for me.

316
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,560
Li Shaotang is a biochemistry expert

317
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,880
It’s normal to have these drawings.

318
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Lao Feng

319
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
This handwriting belongs to Shaotang, right?

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,040
have no idea

321
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
Then let's leave it to the stunt department.

322
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,800
Screen it carefully

323
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,040
Don't accuse people casually

324
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,280
I tell you

325
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,200
These drawings

326
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,960
It was Li Shaotang who helped Daqiao and Ye

327
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,680
The best evidence of transporting gas bombs

328
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,560
Do you understand?

329
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,160
You say evidence is evidence

330
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,560
How can I trust you?

331
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
Three Kingdoms

332
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Searched by Li Shaotang's house

333
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
I worked at the bridge for two years

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Who is Da Qiao?

335
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,920
Self-proclaimed China expert

336
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
I just like China

337
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,760
Culture, masterpieces

338
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,520
So Ohashi uses Romance of the Three Kingdoms as a code book

339
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,360
It's just his way of doing things.

340
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,040
Let me tell you about Li Shaotang

341
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Pull it out and conduct a comprehensive investigation

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,440
That's for sure

343
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
It's Daqiao who tells you

344
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,080
He took this code book made from Romance of the Three Kingdoms

345
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,760
No

346
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,240
That's your guess

347
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,480
Which Chinese family

348
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,080
There is no Romance of the Three Kingdoms

349
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,200
besides

350
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
You asked me to investigate Li Shaotang

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,680
I will investigate Li Shaotang

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,320
Are you teaching me how to do things?

353
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
joke

354
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,200
Bring back

355
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,440
Lao Wei

356
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,360
this

357
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,680
Take it back to where?

358
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,000
he is a prisoner

359
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
Where did you take it?

360
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Xiaoan Xiaoan

361
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,920
Xiaoan

362
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
Webmaster Wei

363
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Not only did Ou Xiaoan come back on his own,

364
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,960
We also found suspicious clues about Li Shaotang

365
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,200
You can no longer try him as a prisoner.

366
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
He is not a prisoner, what is he?

367
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,040
Moreover

368
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Did I ask him to investigate Li Shaotang?

369
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
OK

370
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,960
OK

371
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
you are the webmaster

372
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
You decide

373
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Xiaoan

374
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,560
Listen to the teacher

375
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,840
Come with me

376
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
Xiaoan

377
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
You listen to me

378
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
Xiaoan

379
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,120
you can't get better

380
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,440
Xiaoan goes

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,760
Lao Feng

382
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
Do you believe

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,800
Would Shaotang do such a thing?

384
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Stop talking

385
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
I understand what you mean

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll bring the young master here now

387
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,640
Ou Xiaoan is a traitor

388
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,040
Is the source accurate?

389
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,040
What about your judgment?

390
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
After returning from Chongqing

391
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,040
He has been under quarantine and review

392
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,080
so

393
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,600
My judgment on him is not that comprehensive either.

394
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Where are you standing?

395
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
There is a biochemistry specialist

396
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,840
Lai Shaotang

397
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,200
right

398
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,120
He's from the stunt room

399
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,120
But his job and my job

400
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,680
We don’t usually interact much

401
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,960
He is usually quite withdrawn by nature

402
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,640
At that time, the military commander came from Shanghai

403
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,160
The sundial he brought back was him

404
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,600
Is he related to Ou Xiaoan's identity?

405
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,880
Originally we were

406
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
How single line contact works

407
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,800
I shouldn't have told you this

408
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,120
But now we can see from the side

409
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Got the news

410
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,680
only you

411
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,320
clear

412
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,000
Comrade Lou Mingyuan before his sacrifice

413
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,160
Within the military

414
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
Developed a secret party member

415
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
And this person

416
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
It's probably Li Shaotang

417
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,800
The person who accused Ou Xiaoan of being a traitor

418
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,200
It's him too

419
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,800
Comrade Lou Mingyuan

420
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Have I ever mentioned Li Shaotang to you?

421
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,880
No

422
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
But according to our summons

423
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,920
Find the person to meet up with

424
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,760
It's Li Shaotang

425
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
The comrades sent by the organization also confirmed

426
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
The connector code is no problem

427
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,920
Could it be that Comrade Lou Mingyuan died before he died?

428
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
Discovered Ou Xiaoan’s identity was different

429
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
Temporarily changed the development target

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,760
it's just us

431
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
a possibility of self-reason

432
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,560
During the interrogation process, Ou Xiaoan

433
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
Accused Li Shaotang of being a Japanese spy

434
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,640
Now the military commander is going to use a lie detector test

435
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
Screening Li Shaotang

436
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
Are you worried about the military commander's lie detector test?

437
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,000
Will the identity of this secret party member be revealed?

438
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Secret party members are too important to us

439
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
Before the identity of the two people is determined,

440
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't dare to take risks

441
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,480
According to our working principles

442
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,240
Unidentified before

443
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,240
We can only observe and judge

444
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,400
clear

445
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,760
Miss Qin will let you know when it's ready

446
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,600
Then I'll leave first

447
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
You walk slowly

448
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Lao Wei

449
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,160
Shaotang brought it

450
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Good job

451
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,360
Sit, sit, sit

452
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,960
Webmaster Wei

453
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,120
Sitting in the young hall

454
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
These are your things

455
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,040
yes

456
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,760
Don't want to explain to me

457
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,920
Ou Xiaoan came to my house last night

458
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,200
Force me with a knife

459
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,680
Searched through my things

460
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,360
This should be what he gave to you, right?

461
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,160
right

462
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,840
The origin of this gun is clear

463
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,440
Then this drawing is related to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms

464
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,720
What's going on?

465
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,880
Webmaster Wei, this is for me

466
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
Has a formal investigation been conducted?

467
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,280
Not an investigation

468
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,760
I just know some things privately

469
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,440
Don't have any emotions

470
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,360
Webmaster Wei

471
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,680
Based on Ou Xiaoan’s current position and situation

472
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Based on his accusation

473
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,840
can rise to

474
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,000
The entire site conducted a joint investigation on me

475
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,680
I told you it's not an investigation.

476
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
Three Kingdoms

477
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,320
Four Great Classics

478
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
You should have one at home

479
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,000
have

480
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
These drawings

481
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,360
This is the task assigned to me by Shangfeng

482
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,920
Webmaster Wei, you should know

483
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
Director Shen came to see me last time

484
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,280
It was ordered by Boss Dai

485
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,240
I was on a secret mission

486
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,520
never said

487
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,000
Now Ou Xiaoan

488
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,520
Get it out of my house

489
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,600
Can you accuse me of being a traitor?

490
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,920
Where are the Ou Xiaoan people?

491
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
I want to confront him face to face

492
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,280
don't worry

493
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,400
I will definitely let you two confront each other.

494
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,600
Then you can tell me now

495
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,120
What kind of secret mission is this?

496
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,120
Shaotang

497
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
sit down

498
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
Just say what you need to say

499
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,240
I always think of Chongqing as a companion capital

500
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
Lack of important city defenses

501
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,160
All the dignitaries of the party and state are in Chongqing

502
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,920
If once the enemy throws some bombs

503
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
Throw some poison gas

504
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,920
The consequences would be disastrous

505
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,400
As a biochemistry expert

506
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Studying poison gas bombs and studying city defenses

507
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,200
are two inseparable things

508
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,040
so

509
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,160
I'm looking into this

510
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,360
This task is indeed important

511
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
Director Shen explained

512
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,960
Keep this matter confidential

513
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,160
understand

514
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
should be kept secret

515
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,560
But the young master

516
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
Now this Ou Xiaoan has accused you

517
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,960
You also have to go through a process at this site.

518
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,800
Let me test your lie first

519
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
hope you understand

520
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,280
do not worry

521
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,640
I will definitely seek justice for you

522
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
Lao Feng, what do you think?

523
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
Haven't you made all the plans?

524
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,960
Shaotang

525
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
If you haven't done anything wrong

526
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,560
Just let them test it

527
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,320
Webmaster Wei will definitely deal with it impartially.

528
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,520
Right, Lao Wei?

529
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Yes, I will certainly uphold justice for you.

530
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,800
Chief Li, I'm sorry.

531
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,840
Before the polygraph begins

532
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,400
Just feel aggrieved here for the time being.

533
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,880
Sir, this is Chongqing Station

534
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,040
The secret message just sent

535
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,360
Elk sent news from Juntong

536
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Ou Xiaoan has returned to Chongqing for trial

537
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,760
But he has lost

538
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
Memories of four years

539
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
According to Elk Report

540
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,320
Ando Motoyoshi was indeed arrested

541
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,760
He will be taken to Chongqing Station for interrogation tomorrow.

542
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,560
Now the military commander is investigating us

543
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,640
Insider at Chongqing Station

544
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
Ando Motoki is the one you are responsible for protecting.

545
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,560
yes

546
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Now he has been arrested by the military commander

547
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,520
What kind of face do you have to live with?

548
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,520
Sir, please give me another chance.

549
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,680
sir sir sir

550
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,880
sir

551
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,480
please give me another chance

552
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,400
sir

553
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,760
From now on, you will be responsible for contacting Chongqing Station.

554
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,640
yes

555
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Send a message to Tanaka to let the elk

556
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,600
Kill Ando immediately

557
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,480
yes

558
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,960
well

559
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
You walk slowly

560
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Please come inside

561
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
come out

562
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,480
i warned you

563
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't follow me anymore

564
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,200
If someone sees it

565
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
you know the consequences

566
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Mr. Miao

567
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,040
No one will doubt it

568
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,400
What do you want me to do again?

569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,240
kill

570
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,800
Motokichi Ando

571
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,680
leave me alone

572
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Feel sorry

573
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,560
He knows too many things about 810

574
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,040
You have to be there before he speaks.

575
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
kill him

576
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,040
Koji Tanaka

577
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,480
Ou Xiaoan already knows

578
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,080
There is a spy from Daqiao at the station.

579
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,000
Now you ask me to kill Ando

580
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,320
Do you want me to die?

581
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,600
so

582
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,880
kill him

583
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,360
Also to protect you

584
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,280
Ando knows my identity

585
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
You have no other choice

586
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,120
can only say

587
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,120
To do it or not to do it

588
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Give it to you

589
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,000
put it on

590
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,000
you must be beautiful

591
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,480
this is what you want

592
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,120
Pull me down too

593
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,280
You said the opposite

594
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
I pulled you out of the water

595
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Section Chief Li will put on a device for you.

596
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,040
Report

597
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Enter

598
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,760
Wei stationmaster Ando Motoki arrived.

599
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,719
Already entered the second room

600
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,239
Ou Xiaoan was interrogated in one room

601
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,320
Li Shaotang's polygraph test was arranged in the third room

602
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,280
Everything is ready to start

603
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,400
Xiaomiao

604
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,679
Secretary Miao has already gone over to prepare

605
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,320
Section Chief Qin

606
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,560
Section Chief Qin

607
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,640
How are you preparing?

608
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,000
Final debugging

609
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
You can start now

610
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,640
good

611
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,680
Then I'll go first

612
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,360
Section Chief Qin

613
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,960
The Operations Office is also participating today

614
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
Chief Li’s lie detector test?

615
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
Deputy Webmaster Wen is not at ease

616
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,560
let me come over and take a look

617
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
Deputy Webmaster Wen, please rest assured

618
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,400
Everything is ready here

619
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,400
It's about to start

620
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
Okay, let’s start

621
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,280
Section Chief Qin Section Chief Qin

622
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,640
Section Chief Qin

623
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Section Chief Qin Section Chief Qin

624
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,960
sit down

625
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
Thanks let's get started

626
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,520
Section Chief Qin

627
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm afraid I have to ask you

628
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,280
I'm right here, I won't delay you

629
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,920
Chief Qin, it’s just that we received an order

630
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
Today’s lie detection test on Section Chief Li

631
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,880
It's up to the guys from our stunt room.

632
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
There are also two brothers from the inspection room

633
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,200
Responsible for supervision

634
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
This is indeed not taken into action

635
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
you mean

636
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
Just your stunt room

637
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,440
Only people from the inspection office can participate

638
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,240
Our operations

639
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,760
You can't even listen, can you?

640
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,920
This is definitely not what I meant

641
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,880
We are also ordered to do things

642
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,200
I've said it all

643
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
I am following the orders of Deputy Webmaster Wen

644
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,040
Deputy Webmaster Feng

645
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,120
It hasn't started yet

646
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,680
Wen Yishan just called me

647
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,680
Said they would also send people to observe

648
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,640
yes

649
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Section Chief Qin has arrived

650
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,560
It's good that she's here

651
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,360
Save us the results

652
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,680
He doesn't admit it

653
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,080
Just let her sit in on the whole thing.

654
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,040
clear

655
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,520
Section Chief Qin

656
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Xiaoan, long time no see

657
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,880
stop looking

658
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,880
Today, I will judge you

659
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
You judge me

660
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,800
Where is Webmaster Wei?

661
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,120
What does it mean?

662
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,480
You think I'm not qualified enough to judge you?

663
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,360
Let me tell you

664
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,600
I will judge you today

665
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
This is the beginning of your nightmare

666
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,960
Before, Webmaster Wei

667
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,560
So kind to you

668
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,000
If you want to die

669
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,040
Answer well

670
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,200
no

671
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,320
All the officers went to interrogate Li Shaotang

672
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
I sent you Mao Renxing here.

673
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I said you guys don't pay enough attention to me.

674
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,440
Can’t you tell the difference between the big and the small kings?

675
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,440
You still think I’m not qualified enough to judge you?

676
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,120
I, Mao Renxing, will tell you today

677
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,600
If I find a way

678
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,920
Ten or even fifteen times more ruthless than them

679
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,040
Today I am

680
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm here to interrogate you on behalf of Station Commander Wei.

681
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
every next sentence

682
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Give me a good answer

683
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,480
you say

684
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,680
go out

685
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,880
But Webmaster Wei and the others are going out

686
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,880
I'm just a doctor

687
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
It has nothing to do with the war

688
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,640
As long as you let me go

689
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,040
I can tell you everything I know

690
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
all

691
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,440
kill

692
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,000
Motokichi Ando

693
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,520
I'm OK

694
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,960
Tell us everything you know

695
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
I'll let you go right away

696
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,520
What do you want to know you ask

697
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
You speak first

698
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,080
Every word he said next

699
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,600
Give me everything carefully

700
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,560
Remember clearly

701
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,320
yes

702
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,560
I asked you and you kept saying

703
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,400
Li Shaotang's rebellion

704
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,400
betrayed Lou Mingyuan

705
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,000
That

706
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
you want to ask me

707
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,320
Is there any evidence?

708
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,240
Section Chief Li

709
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,040
Then we start the lie detector test

710
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Can you

711
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,800
evidence

712
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,120
I really haven't figured it out yet

713
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,680
So I need to take a look

714
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,240
Information about Li Shaotang in the military system

715
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Now I'm looking for evidence from you

716
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,880
You ask me for evidence

717
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Is your name Li Shaotang?

718
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,680
yes

719
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Your current position is

720
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
Section Chief of the Stunt Room of the Military Command Chongqing Station

721
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,080
Yes or no

722
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,640
yes

723
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,200
Are you a Japanese spy?

724
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,280
no

725
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,120
You and Ou Xiaoan together

726
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,640
How long have you been working for the Japanese?

727
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,640
I have never done anything for the Japanese

728
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,680
From beginning to end, I have devoted myself to the party and the country

729
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
1939

730
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,000
Did you get acquainted with Lou Mingyuan?

731
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,120
Become a revolutionary comrade of the Communist Party

732
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,880
Four years ago, Li Shaotang was just a small role

733
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,480
He doesn’t know Shanghai at all

734
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,840
Other lurking personnel

735
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,240
If you want to leak the list

736
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,560
He's not qualified enough

737
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,800
Lou Mingyuan and I

738
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,600
Never a revolutionary comrade

739
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
from beginning to end

740
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I have never joined the Communist Party

741
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,720
Everyone who handled the list back then

742
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,880
They could all be Daqiao's spies.

743
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,160
It was he who instigated rebellion against you

744
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,600
Or did you voluntarily join the CCP?

745
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,440
What he said to me at that time

746
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,840
i didn't realize

747
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,640
He is instigating rebellion against me for the CCP

748
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,320
When you are unconscious

749
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,080
Those who were instigated to join the CCP

750
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,880
Yes or no

751
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,560
I didn't say that

752
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,880
I have never joined the Communist Party

753
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,280
In other words, Chief Li

754
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,640
Were you incited to rebel unconsciously?

755
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,480
Doing things for the CCP without knowing it

756
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,840
no

757
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,760
I said I never have

758
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,960
Joined the Communist Party

759
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,000
not unconscious

760
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,560
Then you are conscious

761
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,840
Let you continue talking like this

762
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,000
Then our entire Chongqing station

763
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,680
Those are all people from the bridge.

764
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,640
Shanghai Station Headquarters

765
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,240
There are people from the bridge there

766
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,640
Let me give you a suggestion

767
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,200
You authorize me to access the files

768
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,400
Let me help you review the whole thing again.

769
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,040
Now the military commander is investigating you

770
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
It's not you who checks the military command

771
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,480
I have no problem

772
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,560
you have no problem

773
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,320
The bridge will send you back

774
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,320
It's such a good show of coming back from the dead.

775
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,360
What's the conspiracy here?

776
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,320
Where is 810?

777
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Those gas bombs

778
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,840
Where is it hidden?

779
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm telling you this

780
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,400
You have to pry open Li Shaotang's mouth

781
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,400
do you know

782
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,560
interrogate him
