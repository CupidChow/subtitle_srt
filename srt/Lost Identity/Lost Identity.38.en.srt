[Episode 38]

4
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,560
We must expose Ohashi's identity.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
We can't let him live any longer.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Do you know what you're saying, Ou Xiao'an?

7
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,700
Do you know the consequences?

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,310
I've thought it through.

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,310
You're asking for death, you know?

10
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,500
No.

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,009
We still have bargaining chips.

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
I have antibodies in my body.

13
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,860
As long as Shen Congwu and Li Shaotang

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,820
can't develop the antibodies,

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,920
they can't carry out their plan.

16
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,660
So they absolutely won’t kill me.

17
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,400
Moreover, they’ll likely

18
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,660
lock me up with Chen Ke.

19
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,730
By then,

20
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,390
we can work together

21
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,140
to rescue Chen Ke and the others.

22
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
How can you be sure

23
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,350
Li Shaotang will lock you up

24
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,800
with Chen Ke?

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,980
Even if you are locked together,

26
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,640
there are too many variables.

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,270
It's too risky, you know?

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
I don’t agree.

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,500
I can’t be sure.

30
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,030
But this is the only chance

31
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,310
to get close to Chen Ke.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,950
We have no other choice.

33
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,470
There must be other ways.

34
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,470
Give me some time.

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,750
There's no time for you, you know?

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,900
There’s no time left.

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,300
There’s no time for Chen Ke either.

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,700
I can't delay any longer.

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,240
What’s the situation now?

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,330
Chen Ke may be executed at any moment.

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,860
We can't wait any longer.

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,420
Even if it’s a one-in-a-million chance,

43
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,020
even if I have to risk my life,

44
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,940
I must rescue Chen Ke.

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,570
Otherwise, it's over.

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,110
Ou Xiao'an.

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,320
The more critical the moment,

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,710
the more we need to stay calm, not act impulsively.

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,870
You have to trust me

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,280
and the organization.

51
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,230
I trust you.

52
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,470
I always trust you.

53
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,829
I'll inform Nakamura.

54
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,930
There must be other ways.

55
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,530
There must be other ways.

56
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,930
Do you remember the code?

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,070
I'll repeat it again.

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,180
Go to No. 3, Zhicheng Lane, the sesame oil shop.

59
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,020
Find the person there.

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,550
As long as the code matches,

61
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,830
you can trust him.

62
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,070
He’ll get you out of Chongqing.

63
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,650
Out of Chongqing?

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,140
Yes.

65
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,020
Right now?

66
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,900
Yes.

67
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
I can't leave.

68
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,660
Especially not now.

69
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,860
Mr. Ou.

70
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,740
You can take me with you to the court.

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,590
I can personally testify against Ohashi Kazuya.

72
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,230
Mr. Ou.

73
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,320
We can definitely expose his crimes

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,110
to the public.

75
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,700
Nakamura.

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,300
Mr. Ou.

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,220
Nakamura, the situation

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,750
has changed.

79
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,780
It’s no longer about evidence.

80
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,830
The entire public trial is a conspiracy.

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,260
It’s useless for anyone to testify.

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,940
I can't let you

83
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,260
expose yourself to the enemy’s sight again.

84
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,320
Do you understand?

85
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,790
Ou...

86
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,300
Mr. Ou.

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,630
I don't care about that, Mr. Ou.

88
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,610
On the day of the trial,

89
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,430
even if

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,550
one...

91
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,150
Just one conscientious journalist

92
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,380
reports the matter,

93
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,180
it will cause

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,460
-A massive international uproar.
-Nakamura.

95
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
-Mr. Ou.
-Nakamura.

96
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,900
-Nakamura.
-Mr. Ou.

97
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,140
-Nakamura.
-We will...

98
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,150
Listen to me.

99
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,200
We can’t afford any more needless sacrifices.

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,180
I can't let you get captured again.

101
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,409
Do you understand?

102
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,230
-Trust me.
-I...

103
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Chongqing

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,580
is too dangerous for you now.

105
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,910
And

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
you won’t be able to testify against anyone.

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
There's no chance.

108
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,430
Mr. Ou.

109
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,340
These

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,080
are your new identity and money.

111
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,500
Take them.

112
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,300
Leave Chongqing as soon as possible.

113
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,870
Trust me.

114
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,180
Leave quickly.

115
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,500
Don't worry.

116
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,430
Ou Xiao'an

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,430
won't reveal your identity again.

118
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,780
Otherwise, whether he is or not,

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
it would be equivalent to admitting he’s a Communist.

120
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,630
What's going on with Ohashi Kazuya?

121
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,620
Ohashi is very determined.

122
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,980
If he’s sent to the public trial,

123
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,580
he’ll expose all his dealings

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,150
with NBIS.

125
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,630
And right now, we only have biochemical data.

126
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,020
Unless he safely returns to Japan,

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
he won't tell us

128
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,580
the locations of those biochemical weapons.

129
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,590
After the trial,

130
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,430
we must find a way

131
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,510
to get all the information out of him.

132
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,100
As for the biochemical data,

133
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,460
the Americans want a share now too.

134
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,450
You need to sort it out quickly.

135
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,710
Mellors will send experts to collect it.

136
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,830
The Director actually agreed?

137
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,380
Why do Americans

138
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,350
help us in the public trial?

139
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,620
At the Americans' level,

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,900
if they get hold of the biochemical data,

141
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,190
their research on KW30

142
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,020
will soon surpass ours.

143
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,790

144
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,860
Director and I

145
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,240
have great confidence in you.

146
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,500
After all, we still have the live materials from Chen Ke

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,740
and the others of the 810 project.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200

Come back after 6 a.m. tomorrow.

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,330
I'm not here to buy sesame oil.

Please come in.

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,960
if we want to climb up the ranks,

162
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,420
we have to wait for the right moment.

163
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,980
Aren't you anxious?

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,740
Li Shaotang, Ohashi Kazuya,

165
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,470
and the NBIS members

166
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,590
are all your enemies.

167
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,460
Friends or enemies

168
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,430
sometimes

169
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,030
are just a matter of perspective.

170
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,540
The person who killed Feng Yunian

171
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,710
is Li Shaotang.

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,910
I thought it was you.

173
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,500
When Li Shaotang came out of the dressing room,

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,160
Feng Yunian was already dead.

175
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,140
So?

176
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,700
So

177
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,510
Li Shaotang is likely the pawn Ohashi planted

178
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,620
in NBIS,

179
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,290

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,910
Ohashi

181
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,140
will be on trial tomorrow.

182
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,010
For now, don’t do anything.

183
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
I don’t want you to risk exposure.

184
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,230
What if

185
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,640
NBIS protects Ohashi?

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
To be honest,

187
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
I don't want to see that outcome.

188
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,780
Chie Hoko.

189
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,890
You don't want to save Ohashi

190
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,600
because you don't want to live in his shadow.

191
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,130
Right?

192
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,820
I agree.

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,370
But as a member of the Empire of Japan,

194
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,080
even if I need such a chance,

195
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,970
I can't betray His Imperial Majesty.

196
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,620
So all I can do

197
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
is wait.

198
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,230
If Ohashi fails

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,460
and is sentenced to death,

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
then it'll be my time

201
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,640
to step onto the stage.

202
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,380
Now both of you

203
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,230
are willing to risk exposure

204
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,750
to save Secretary Chen.

205
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,780
Comrade He.

206
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,270
I have carefully

207
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,390
studied this mission.

208
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,620
I have stayed at 810.

209
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,360
I have been captured by NBIS.

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,510
I know their methods

211
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,550
and ways.

212
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,340
So no one is more experienced

213
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,270
to carry out this mission than I am.

214
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,190
I've reported everything you said.

215
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,710
Follow the organization’s arrangements.

216
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,980
I understand

217
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,110
your feelings.

218
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,990
But we are intelligence workers.

219
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,110
The most taboo thing is impulsiveness

220
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,440
and acting on emotions.

221
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,890
No matter what, personal feelings

222
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,350
must never affect our overall situation.

223
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,420
Vice Captain Li.

224
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,230
What's up?

225
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
Vice Captain Wen.

226
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,900
Today

227
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,060
is the trial of Ohashi.

228
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,700
There are some things

229
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,930
I dare not decide on my own.

230
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,180
I need to hear your opinion.

231
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,420
Just say it.

232
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,390
The Inspection Office has confirmed

233
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,900
that there are Communist moles

234
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,350
within your Operations Department.

235
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,400
If there is evidence,

236
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,770
let the Inspection Office arrest them.

237
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,820
What do you mean by telling me this?

238
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,920
Because the Communist mole

239
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,230
is likely Ou Xiaoan

240
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,790
or Qin Moqing,

241
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,400
or even both.

242
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,440
Li Shaotang.

243
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,720
Are you starting to target me?

244
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,900
Both of them are my disciples.

245
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,780
As far as I know,

246
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,180
the Communists already have evidence

247
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,830
that can prove the true identity of Ohashi Kazuya

248
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,780
and the biochemical experiments

249
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,660
conducted at 810.

250
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,990
This information

251
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,160
is with Ou Xiao'an.

252
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,510
The Communists have asked him

253
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,280
to publicly expose Ohashi during the trial

254
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,990
to disrupt our plans.

255
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,880
Ou Xiao'an

256
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,740
is your disciple after all.

257
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,020
I dare not act on my own.

258
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,940
I have to

259
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,140
hear your opinion

260
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,460
on how to get the information back.

261
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,860
No matter who it is,

262
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,000
if they dare to betray Kuomintang, and NBIS,

263
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,180
I will not tolerate it.

264
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,230

265
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,260

[Severe punishment for war criminals. Justice for us.]

267
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,100
Why is Ohashi Kazuya, who have already been executed,

268
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,960
appearing in a POW camp?

269
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,700
Is the National Government deliberately concealing this?

270
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,300
How can the National Government protect them?

271
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,230

381
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,270
Correct.

382
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,110
Then please tell the court,

383
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,390
is the person in the defendant’s seat

384
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,250
the Japanese intelligence officer Ohashi Kazuya?

385
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,920
Your Honor, this person is not Ohashi Kazuya.

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,030

No.

At this point,

400
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,380
you still suspect me of being a Communist?

401
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,850

402
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,850
to Shen Congwu and Li Shaotang.

403
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,830
It's not about whether I listen to them or not.

404
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,050
It's about you answering

405
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,670
yes or no.

406
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,590

Looking for me, Director Shen?

439
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,910
exposing yourself?

Sort of.

442
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,450

your situation.

444

The organization's decision is

445
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,260
that if Comrade Wild Grass continues

446
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,940
to remain undercover at the Chongqing Station,

447
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,740
the risk of exposure will be high.

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,960
So this time,

449
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,600

to gain more trust.

454
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,060
You will continue to stay undercover at the NBIS Chongqing Station

455
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,870
and provide information to the organization.

456
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,470
The organization needs you.

457
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,060
As for Comrade Wild Grass,

458
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,940
after the mission is successful,

459
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,500

about 810

546
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,900
to pass it to the Communists.

547
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,650
Now that she has got all the information,

548
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,520
she has used me up

549
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,780
and frames me as a Communist.

00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,780

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,810
Director Shen.

571
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,940
Director Shen.

572
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,350
Are these the prisoners

573
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,010
Vice Captain Li wants?

574
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Yes.

575
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,070
Open the door.

576
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,700
Director Shen, this...

577
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,810
Open the door!

578
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,920
What are you doing?

579
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,820
Where are you taking us?

580
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,540
Don't worry. We'll take you to treatment.

581
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,750
Wei.

582
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,719
Finally, you're here to take charge.

583
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
It's a mess.

584
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,710
I didn't want to come.

585
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,780
You guys handled

586
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,139
the Ohashi issue well,

587
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,980
so how did it

588
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,420
end up like this?

589
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,130
Who would have thought

590
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,030
Qin Moqing was hiding so deeply?

591
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,650
It's all my fault. This...

592
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,210
I was not careful in selecting people.

593
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,330
This isn't just about selecting people carefully.

594
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,060
If this alarms the higher-ups,

595
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,020
and if we don't handle it well,

596
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,080
it won't be just

597
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,480
about capturing Qin Moqing.

598
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,199
Captain Wei.

599
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,090
What do you think

600
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,190
we should do?

601
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,810
It's not up to me.

602
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,440
We have to wait for orders from the higher-ups.

603
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,159
Alright.

604
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,780
Let's wait then.

605
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,450
Here it comes.

606
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
This is Wei Qingming.

607
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,970
Director.

608
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,380
Yes.

609
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,790
Understood.

610
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,410
Yes.

611
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,820
You messed up

612
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,240
the whole act.

613
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,140
After the court's deliberation,

614
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,210
it is declared

615
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,180
that the defendant Ohashi Kazuya's identity has been confirmed

616
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,530
as a former Japanese Intelligence Department officer.

617
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,650
He established secret prison 810,

618
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,740
conducting human

619
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,150
and biochemical experiments.

620
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,500
This led to the inhumane treatment and deaths

621
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,290
of captured soldiers and innocent civilians from China, Burma, the United States,

622
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,380
and other Pacific War zones.

623
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,270
[Judgment]

624
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,180
The evidence is conclusive.

625
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,030
The court finds him

626
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,390
guilty of war crimes

627
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,250
and crimes against humanity.

628
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,810
He is sentenced to hanging.

629
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,470
The trial is over.

630
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,390
Good! Good!

631
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,460
Well judged.

632
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,980
Well judged.

633
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
Wei.

634
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,020
I really caused you trouble.

635
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,570
How did Qin Moqing...

636
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,360
Enough.

637
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,430
Think about how to explain to the boss.

638
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,260
Captain Wei. Vice Captain Wen.

639
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,610
Captain.

640
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,670
Have you caught Qin Moqing?

641
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,230
Ou Xiao'an.

642
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,520
Do you still have the nerve to ask?

643
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,430
Didn’t you know last night

644
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,530
that Qin Moqing tricked you?

645
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,950
Why didn’t you tell me before the trial?

646
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,690
Why did you wait until she released the photos

647
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,340
to say she’s a Communist?

648
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
I truly didn’t know before, Sir.

649
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,930
It was only last night,

650
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,150
after thinking about her recent actions,

651
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,940
that I suspected

652
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,420
she might be a Communist

653
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,630
Qin’s house is already surrounded.

654
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,890
Based on your understanding of Qin Moqing,

655
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,850
do you think

656
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,840
she will contact her brother?

657
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,900
Sir, do I

658
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,720
dare say I understand her now?

659
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,280
Captain Wei.

660
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,280
Someone saw Qin Moqing

661
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,880
leaving with Director Shen.

662
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,750
And the prison phone line is dead.

663
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,150
I suspect something is wrong.

664
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,550
Ou Xiao'an.

665
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,150
Here.

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,580
I’m giving you one last chance

667
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,390
to prove your

668
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,760
and your teacher’s innocence.

669

Take my people

670
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,650

What do you think?

673
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,520
Did you hear what Captain Wei said?

674
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,590
This is the last chance

675
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,780
for both of us.

676
