00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,000
do you really think Lai Junsheng is Wild Grass?

I don't want it to be him either.

73
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,230

But what happened in the end?

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,940
The spy is in the headquarters.

78
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,170
I don't think so.

79
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,170
Although his transmitter was assembled

80
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,020
with the parts stolen from the headquarters,

81
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,360
the electricity meter in his house was modified.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,120
The location of the suspicious radio wave was from his house.

83
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
He can easily have access to the core information

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,220
with his position in the Telecom Section.

85
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,170
Also,

86
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,420
he suddenly disappeared when we were besieging Huo Daming.

87
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,810
It's obvious that he escaped to avoid punishment.

88
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,780
But

89
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,390
just because everything seems reasonable,

90
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,230
I think something is wrong.

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,670
Your instinct?

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,740
What if this is a trap

93
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,300
set by the Communist Party?

94
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,430
A communist died.

95
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,860
Communists are not like ordinary people,

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,210
who are afraid of death.

97
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,750
They have faith.

98
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,120
Then tell me what your opinion is.

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,090
I think

100
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,500
they want us

101
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,960
to pay attention to Lai Junsheng.

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,220
They evacuated Lai Junsheng in advance.

103
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,790
But their purpose

104
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,470
was to protect the real Wild Grass.

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,200
Based on your instinct,

106
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
tell me who the real Wild Grass is.

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,030
Qin Moqing or Ou Xiao'an.

108
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,610
Everyone else was in the station that day.

109
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,180
Only the two of them went out.

110
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,400
I sent someone to keep an eye on them.

111
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,230
They didn't leave

112
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,770

113
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,720
Also, Secretary Sun

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,330
went to verify it later.

115
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,790
Ou Xiao'an had been receiving treatment.

116
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,740
Qin Moqing

117
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,070
fainted due to hypoglycemia.

118
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,450
She fainted?

119
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,820
Didn't she go to accompany Ou Xiao'an?

120
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,810
Why did she faint?

121
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,780
Her hypoglycemia was too coincidental.

122
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,180
So you think Qin Moqing is more suspicious?

123
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,200
I've verified it repeatedly.

124
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,010
Qin Moqing was indeed in a coma

125
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,820
when she was in the hospital.

126
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
And she was always in sight

127
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,380
of the medical workers from beginning to end.

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,240
Director Shen,

129
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,130
I don't know Qin Moqing's specific details.

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,540
But I know

131
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,210
her relationship with Dr. Rus is unusual.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
Let me put it this way.

133
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
I've reported

134
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,140
Qin Moqing's situation.

135
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,890
The boss said

136
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,310
we should be cautious.

137
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,850
We can't act rashly

138
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,210
without solid evidence.

139
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,940
Because her brother is Qin Jiru, right?

140
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,200
Don't ask too much about the higher-ups.

141
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,260
How about this?

142
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,350
If there is

143
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,620
no new evidence,

144
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,350
this matter ends here.

145
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,450
You've been working hard lately, right?

146
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,880
Go back and sleep early.

147
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,850
Why are you still standing here?

148
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,260
Got it.

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
What's the name

150
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,970
of the person in the pharmacy?

151
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,809
What's wrong?

152
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,140
He deserves respect.

153
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,610
I'll burn incense for him after going back.

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,080
I heard his name is Huo Daming.

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,070
But I don't know

156
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,350
if it's his real name or not.

157
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,910
I really admire them.

158
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,400
They can do anything

159
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,860
for comrades and information.

160
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,900
Look at

161
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,020
our men in the NBIS.

162
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,000
You were also following me today, right?

163
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,710
Don't tell me you were just passing by.

164
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,620
But...

165
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,140
I still should thank you.

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,330
For what?

167
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,450
You also saved me before, right?

168
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,600
Although I

169
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,770
can't figure you out,

170
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,610
I think

171
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,980
you are a lot like a friend of mine.

172
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Who?

173
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,110
Lou Mingyuan.

174
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,110
I always thought

175
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,970
he only worked for the NBIS.

176
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,040
Later, I found out

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,000
he hid so many things from me.

178
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,340
Then why did you help him save Ye Xuanmin?

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,230
So...

180
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,100
Ou Xiao'an,

181
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,460
who on earth are you?

182
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,530
I can't remember.

183
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,920
I'll go back and treat my brain.

184
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,580
I'll tell you when I remember.

185
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,970
I'm going back first.

186
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,050
Enjoy yourself.

187
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,880
He's just a surveillance guy.

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,180
How dare he fight with you!

189
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,530
Even though he works for Shen Congwu,

190
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
he went too far!

191
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,050
He kept an eye on you yesterday.

192
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,200
Wen, he could keep an eye on you today.

193
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,950
Feng, it'll be your turn tomorrow.

194
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,740
Wei, calm down.

195
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,500
Actually, what I'm most worried

196
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
is that they would do something to you.

197
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,560
That's why I asked Section Chief Qin to come here

198
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,790
to report to you personally.

199
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,840
Wen, Feng,

200
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,940
we should stand united now

201
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
to fight against them.

202
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,590
Understand?

203
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,980
Director Shen has caught Wild Grass,

204
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,830
but he still won't leave.

205
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,430
He has started to keep an eye on our men.

206
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,140
If he makes up another

207
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,160
code name someday, well...

208
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,510
I think he's going to destroy our station.

209
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,130
Yeah.

210
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,140
Calm down.

211
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,910
He asked us to have a meeting, right?

212
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,970
Let's hear what he wants to say first.

213
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,250
Let's have a meeting now.

Sit.

215
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,770
I guess you already know

216
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,500
about the operation this time.

217
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,010
I've sent someone

218
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,460
from the headquarters to investigate Lai Junsheng.

219
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,430
But

220
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,070
there might still be other communists in the Chongqing Station.

221
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,950
Director Shen,

222
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,700
do you have any new clue?

223
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,530
Wen,

224
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,450
even if there is a new clue,

225
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
we shouldn't know.

226
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,350
Take this time's operation of catching Wild Grass as an example.

227
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,460
If we knew in advance,

228
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,850
there would be more things

229
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,210
that we can't explain.

230
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,430
Yes.

231
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,060
Captain Wei, I understand what you mean.

232
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,000
It's indeed my responsibility

233
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,430
that I failed to catch the communists.

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,350
I will report it to the boss.

235
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm writing the report.

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,760
Why don't...

237
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,490
the three of you take a look?

238
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,330
We dare not.

239
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,050
Director Shen, I just want to ask

240
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,250
if you have thoroughly investigated the case

241
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,840
of the Chongqing Station's collusion with communists.

242
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,450
If the case can be closed,

243
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,630
we can...

244
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,290

245

But

246
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,390
if Director Shen and the boss want to continue to investigate it,

247
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,640
we should show our attitude.

248
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,260
We

249
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,260

250

from top to bottom.

Starting with us, the three captains.

If you find out

253
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,300
we're suspected of colluding with the Communist Party,

254
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,540
we will

255
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,490

to Section Chief Qin.

263
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,720
As the captain of the Chongqing Station,

264
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,370
I want...

265
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,090
you

266
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,580
to give me an explanation.

267
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,640
Today,

268
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm going to be frank with you.

269
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,920
The information that the Expeditionary Force has found 810

270
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
is fake.

271
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,600
The purpose is to find

272
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,590
Wild Grass, a special commissioner

273
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,350
planted by the Communist Party in the NBIS.

274
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,420
This is also the main task the boss gave me.

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,520
Now that Wild Grass has been caught,

276
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,990
I've completed my task.

277
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,710
I can go back to the headquarters to report to the boss.

In terms of this operation,

279
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,940
I think

280
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,460
the task was completed perfectly.

281

This is also what the boss

286

Wild Grass

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,130
is a transmitter-receiver operator in the headquarters?

Section Chief Qin?

400
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,030
Something happened to her

401
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,510
a few days ago, right?

402
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,100
She must have told you, right?

403
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,060
What do you mean?

404
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,420
She went out for something urgent, right?

405
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,180
What? You don't remember?

406
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,330
Mr. Rus, don't worry.

407
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,020
Your answer won't affect

408
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,170
Section Chief Qin's work at all.

409
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,500
I was ordered to investigate this matter.

410
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,610
You can tell me.

411
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,900
She fainted due to hypoglycemia that day.

412
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,470
She was in the hospital the whole time.

413
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,760
According to her medical examination report,

414
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,560
she doesn't have hypoglycemia.

415
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,590
Hypoglycemia is common.

416
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,380
It could happen

417
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,590
if someone doesn't eat in the morning

418
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,840
or overworks.

419
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,270
People with hypoglycemia can recover by having an IV drip of glucose.

420
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,310
But if it's serious,

421
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,810
it would take more time to recover.

422
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960

I hoped she could become

435
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,720
an outstanding doctor.

436
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,900
Unfortunately, she didn't choose

437
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,330
to be a doctor.

No need. I'm going to talk to him.

567
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,710
Leave now.

568
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,330
Shaotang.

569
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Have a seat.

570
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,090
We don't need to be so polite, right?

571
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,900
You've been investigating me all day.

572
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,590
This is on me, okay?

573
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,500
Thank you.

574
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,430
It's been a month since you came back to Chongqing, right?

575
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,800
Since you came back,

576
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,120
you've been accusing me of being a Japanese spy.

577
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,660
We were interrogated.

578
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,620
Now we have to cooperate with each other.

579
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,390
I think

580
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,460
the misunderstanding between us is getting deeper.

581
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,430
We need to clear it up.

582
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,080
It's not a misunderstanding between us, right?

583
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,360
You were around Director Shen every day.

584
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,420
Director Shen sent people to keep an eye on me every day.

585
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,680
How could you not know?

586
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,400
Now Wild Grass has been caught

587
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,620
and you realized I'm not a communist.

588
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,940
Bro, it's too late

589
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,480
to treat me to a meal.

590
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,150
But you've been accusing me

591
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,610
of being a Japanese spy, right?

592
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,430
Aren't you a Japanese spy?

593
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,510
Do you think I am?

594
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,910
Then you are.

595
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,920
Why...

596
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,730
are you making the atmosphere so tense? Let's drink.

597
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,540
Come on.

598
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,180
Fine. I'm going to get to the point.

599
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,770
Before besieging the communist,

600
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,890
you and Qin Moqing

601
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,850
went to Dr. Rus for treatment.

602
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,070
Qin Moqing fainted.

603
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,170
She didn't wake up until your treatment was over.

604
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,520
I don't understand

605
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,890
why she fainted.

606
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,240
About this,

607
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,710
you have to treat Qin Moqing to a meal and ask her.

608
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,760
I really don't know.

609
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,470
By the way,

610
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,100
I also asked Mr. Rus.

611
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,250
But as you know, doctors

612
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,600
can only provide diagnoses based on symptoms.

613
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,400
He...

614
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,460
can't help me rule out

615
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,420
human factors.

616
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,980
There were also human factors?

617
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,740
Yeah.

618
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,310
Tell me.

619
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,490
Is it possible

620
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
that she pretended to faint?

621
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,870
There's another possibility.

622
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,930
She was knocked out.

623
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,930
That's very likely.

624
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,330
Right?

625
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,690
I've always thought so.

626
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,600
I verified it.

627
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,800
After Qin Moqing fainted,

628
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,110
indeed, she was under surveillance the whole time.

629
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,550
As for you,

630
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,230
although you were

631
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,550
in the treatment room of Dr. Rus,

632
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,870
the problem is

633
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,570
no one saw you.

634
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,960
It's been a long time since the window

635
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,040
of the treatment room was cleaned.

636
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,950
It's covered with thick dust.

637
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,290
But today I found

638
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,860
only the ledge of that window

639
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,340
was cleaned by someone.

640
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,560
Tell me.

641
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,400
Is it because someone

642
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,830
wanted to erase the traces of you going out?

643
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,190
Well, Shaotang,

644
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,490
is this how you investigate a case?

645
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,570
You assume I left first

646
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,750
and then start finding the evidence of me leaving.

647
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,480
Everyone has his own way of investigating a case.

648
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,130
It's okay even if you won't tell me.

649
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,770
I can make Dr. Rus tell me the truth.

650
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,290
You want to touch him?

651
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,340
Don't you know his background?

652
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,480
I know.

653
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,280
The family of a member of the American Red Cross Committee.

654
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,510
His wife oversees

655
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,110
medical aid supplies for China.

656
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,220
However,

657
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,830
if he really helped communists

658
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,910
deliver information,

659
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,230
I'm afraid Director

660
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,790
won't ignore it.

661
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,170
Director Shen

662
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,710
just left.

663
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,240
He left you here

664
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,570
to keep an eye on me every day.

665
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,830
You insist that I'm a communist.

666
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,920
Why?

667
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,390
You're right.

668
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,040
I invited you here today

669
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,860
because I want you to tell me

670
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,750
why you left the hospital.

671
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,100
Do you really want me to tell you?

672
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,970
Of course.

673
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,840
Bro.

674
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,310
You like investigating, right?

675
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,880
Investigate it yourself.

676
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,260
I'll investigate it myself.

677
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,930
He is really a promising young man.

678
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,040
Exactly.

679
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,490
And he's handsome.

680
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm flattered.

681
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,810
Come on.

682
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,960
Moqing is back.

683
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,040
Moqing, come here.

684
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,180
[Zhou Ruofei, Colonel and Section Chief of the Attendant Section of the Military Commission]

685
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,750
Colonel Zhou,

686
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,260
come. Let me introduce you to each other.

687
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,680
Moqing,

688
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,200
this is Colonel Zhou Ruofei.

689
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,040
This is my biological sister,

690
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,990
Qin Moqing.

691
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,050
Hello, Miss Qin.

692
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,590
Sorry.

693
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,530
My hands are covered with grease.

694
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,660
Go ahead.

695
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,700
You must be starving after a busy day.

696
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,340
Sister,

697
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,190
Colonel Zhou is a promising young man.

698
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,330
He's now the section chief

699
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,830
of the Secretariat of the Military Commission.

700
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,950
Impressive.

701
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,639
Colonel what?

702
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,620
Colonel Zhou Ruofei.

703
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,750
Yes, Colonel Zhou.

704
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,139
Well, Brother,

705
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,210
you spend some time with Colonel Zhou.

706
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,670
I'm going upstairs first.

707
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,750
Moqing.

708
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,989
Moqing.

709
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,980
Talk to her properly.

710
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,460
How can you leave?

711
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,679
You know Colonel Zhou

712
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,130
came here to meet you.

713
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,440
Where do you want to go?

714
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Moqing,

715
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,540
we asked about Zhou Ruofei

716
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,580
for you long ago.

717
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,639
Although his family is not very rich,

718
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,590
he's greatly appreciated at such a young age.

719
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,850
He has a bright future.

720
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,880
Also, a few people of the Central Committee

721
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,489
want to be his father-in-law.

722
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,940
It wasn't easy for me to find such a man for you when we played cards.

723
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,850
Don't let him go.

724
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay. I won't let him go.

725
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,850
You go and catch him for me.

726
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,730
Well...

727
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,239
Well, Colonel Zhou.

728
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,040
Excuse me.

729
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,230
You guys talk first.

730
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,950
Moqing.

731
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,840
-Moqing is...
-She is...

732
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,630
Moqing is really...

733
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,200
Sorry, Colonel Zhou.

734
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,110
My sister

735
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,990
has been spoiled by me.

736
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,760
In fact, she's cold on the outside but warm inside.

737
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,830
Yes.

738
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,510
It's okay.

739
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,710
I've heard about Miss Qin's personality.

740
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,790
She's as outstanding as men.

741
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,050
I admire her very much.

742
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,900
By the way,

743
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,570
does Miss Qin

744
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,570
have any hobbies

745
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,930
or what does she like?

746
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,140
Such as flowers or jewelry?

747
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,190
My sister

748
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,690
is not interested

749
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,070
in anything that girls like.

750
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,870
Who said that?

751
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,740
Moqing likes to wear cheongsam.

752
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,770
Yes.

753
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,310
She would often

754
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,840
go to the cheongsam shop alone

755
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,190
to customize new cheongsam.

756
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,240
She knows how to dress well

757
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,200
when she doesn't wear her uniform.

758
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
Cheongsam?

759
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,670
You've asked me so many questions.

760
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,160
Let me ask you some questions.

761
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,000
Sure.

762
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,340
Go ahead.

763
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,730
Back then, Lou Mingyuan

764
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,320
did make you join the Communist Party, right?

765
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,800
I just don't know

766
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,950
whether you are a spy of the NBIS

767
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
or a traitor of the Communist Party.

768
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,550
Or you are a Japanese spy.

769
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,000
Ou Xiao'an, I know

770
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,740
no matter what I say now,

771
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,910
you won't believe me.

772
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,200
Well, tell me.

773
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
How about this?

774
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,800
From now on,

775
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,910
let's find evidence together

776
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,310
to prove my identity.

777
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,180
How?

778
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,070
You can install a bug in my house.

779
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,100
You can even live in my house.

780
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,730
No matter what you want to do,

781
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,660
I'll try my best to cooperate.

782
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,180
That's not enough.

783
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,560
You have to let me know

784
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,730
whatever I want to know.

785
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,430
Okay.

786
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,990
We can cooperate.

787
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,140
Now can you tell me

788
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,570
why you left the hospital?

789
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,970
No one is following me now, right?

790
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,160
No one.

791
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,500
Go ahead.

792
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,460
That day, I did...

793
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,670
I did leave the hospital.

794
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,840
I went to meet someone.

795
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,470
Who?

796
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,000
This person.

797
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,530
9548?

798
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,640
Every person imprisoned in 810

799
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,650
has a number.

800
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,920
Me too.

801
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,320
9548

802
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,680
is the person

803
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,870
who escaped from 810 with me.

804
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,080
You mean

805
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,960
someone escaped from 810 with you?

806
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,680
Yes.

807
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,590
You're curious

808
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,800
why I didn't report

809
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,860
such an important thing, right?

810
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,180
There's no one I can trust in the station.

811
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,490
Besides, I only managed to

812
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,710
remember this person gradually

813
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,510
thanks to the recent treatment.

814
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,470
But I completely don't know

815
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,200
who he is

816
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,270
or what he looks like.

817
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,930
If he hadn't sent me a letter

818
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,280
and asked me out before,

819
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,900
I wouldn't even know what 9548 means.

820
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,110
He asked you out?

821
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,110
When I went home from work one day,

822
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,560
I found a note

823
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,130
in my pocket.

824
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,510
It was Morse Code written by 9548.

825
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
He asked me to meet him

826
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,020
at 3 p.m. at Chaotianmen Wharf.

827
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,000
How can you be sure

828
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,070
this cloth was given to you by 9548?

829
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,320
This cloth was folded inside the note.

830
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,870
When I saw the cloth,

831
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,970
I remembered we had a deal.

832
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,830
We talked about

833
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,800
how to contact each other when we escaped.

834
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,040
9548 told me

835
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,620
he would use the cloth with his number

836
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,360
to prove his identity

837
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,700
and contact me.

838
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,310
Does Section Chief Qin know?

839
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,150
No.

840
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,570
So in order to meet 9548,

841
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,940
you knocked Section Chief Qin out.

842
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,990
Director Shen said

843
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,260
there's a mole among us.

844
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,070
So only 9548 and I

845
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,300
know this.

846
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,750
I can't tell anyone.

847
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,560
Did you meet him?

848
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,000
No.

849
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,890
He didn't show up that day.

850
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,810
I don't know

851
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,190
what went wrong.

852
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,270
What else does 9548 know?

853
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,980
Can we find 810

854
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,210
if we find him?

855
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,190
Yes.

856
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,670
He is not like me.

857
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,290
9548 didn't lose his memory.

858
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,850
So he knows more

859
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,150
about 810.

860
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,010
He can also prove what I did

861
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,290
in the past four years.

862
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,250
Most importantly,

863
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,970
9548

864
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,680
knows Ohashi's every conspiracy,

865
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,530
including the mole

866
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,160
Ohashi planted

867
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,610
in the NBIS.

868
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,970
Do you have other clues?

869
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,190
No.

870
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,190
If this person is really that important,

871
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,440
we must try our best to find him.

872
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:57,930
Yes.

873
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,540
I'm going to report it to Captain now.

874
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,870
You can't report it now.

875
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,470
Although

876
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,160
we already caught Wild Grass,

877
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,300
the Japanese spy

878
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,260
who killed Ando hasn't been found.

879
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,410
If this information is leaked,

880
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,000
9548 will be in danger.

881
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,080
I believe as long as he is alive,

882
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,550
he will contact me.

883
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,750
But before that,

884
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,450
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

885
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,190
Haven't you always wanted

886
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,710
to prove your identity?

887
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,780
This is a good opportunity.

888
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,040
Let's start from here.

889
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,590
[The camp of the Expeditionary Force in Burma]

890
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,030
I'm Guo Juncheng,

891
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,660
Major of the 38th Division

892
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,790
and Captain of the 810 Search Team.

893
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,710
Major Guo.

894
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,710
Hello, Major Guo.

895
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,350
Right, my name is Mao Renxing.

896
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,190
I'm from

897
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,730
the Inspection Office of the Chongqing Station.

898
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,540
[Name: Mao Renxing]

899
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,550
But I'm not the chief.

900
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,120
This one is.

901
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,360
How's the 810 search progress?

902
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,570
Chief,

903
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,080
according to the coordinates provided by the Chongqing Station,

904
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,810
we have searched for a few days,

905
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,800
but we found nothing.

906
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,440
Then why are you still here?

907
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,170
Everyone, set out now

908
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,240
to look for 810.

909
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,710
Chief,

910
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,400
they've been searching for it for days.

911
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,790
They are not machines.

912
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,510
It's late today.

913
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,800
Let's rest tonight and set out tomorrow.
