[Episode 15]

4
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,500
We found 810,

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,640
and many survivors were found there.

6
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
According to the statistics of the 38th Division in Burma,

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,730
among them, there are 22

8
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,910
of our comrades.

9
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,639
The Expeditionary Force has already started making arrangements.

10
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,770
They will send them back immediately.

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
That's great.

12
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
According to the Declaration of Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party,

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,920
as long as we make the request,

14
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
the CNP must release them.

15
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,500
Do you think Dai Li will be that cooperative?

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,550
This information

17
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,540
is only known to the 810 team.

18
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,940
It is completely sealed within the NBIS.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
They have already planned it out.

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,079
As soon as they are taken over at the border of Ruili,

21
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,079
they will be sent to Chongqing and secretly detained.

22
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,570
So, to the outside world,

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
these 22 people

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,920
don't exist at all.

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,150
Then we must report it to the higher-ups as soon as possible

26
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,410
and organize a rescue.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
We have guerrilla areas in Yunnan.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,440
It will be more certain to take action there than in the interior.

29
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,450
Transmitter-receiver?

30
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,280
The transmission location for this transmitter-receiver

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,610
and the telegrapher have been targeted.

32
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,340
So, my line has been in silence.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
I have a solution.

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
Luo, my colleague who came with me,

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
is professionally trained.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
He can send telegrams in the suburbs.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
But sending telegrams in the suburbs

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
requires two dry batteries.

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,680
I can arrange for the batteries.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,510
Also,

41
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,890
Also, Comrade Wild Grass said that

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,780
a large amount of biochemical data was found in 810.

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,570
The NBIS has already transmitted all the data

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,880
to the Chongqing Station

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,540
to be analyzed by Li Shaotang.

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,140
However, Wild Grass can't access it.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,880
I'll go find Li Shaotang as soon as possible

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,079
to learn about the biochemical data,

49
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,680
as well as the timing and route of the Expeditionary Force's escort.

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,340
Please proceed with urgency.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Hello, sir.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
The Chinese ginseng you requested has arrived.

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,800
Let me take you to pick it up.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,329
Okay.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Luo, come here.

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,880
Let's go.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I urgently called you over

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,200
because there is a situation I need to ask you about.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,020
Is it about the discovery in 810?

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,920
That's right.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,010
What are the details?

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,810
There are two.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,580
First, the list of biochemical data

64
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,520
has been sent back via telegram.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
I've reviewed it.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,680
Some of the documents are very valuable

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
for future countering of Japan's biochemical weapons.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm in charge of this.

69
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,399
Once the files are returned,

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,959
they will be sent to me first.

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,680
I'll find a way

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
to quickly make a copy and send it out.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,360
Great.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,600
What's the second detail?

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
The NBIS found 22

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,430

77
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,870
in 810.

78
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,120
They are preparing to transport them back

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,159
for secret interrogation.

80
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,220
Can you find out the timing and route?

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
The Expeditionary Force is already on its way to escort them.

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
They will hand them over

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,760
to the Yunnan Station of the NBIS at the border of Ruili.

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,090
I am not sure where they will be taken next.

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,210
But I have copied the escort route.

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,900

The appearance of Ou Xiao'an

111
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,770
has made me even more uncertain.

the information sent back by Wild Grass

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,480
is consistent with what Li Shaotang said.

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,350
This critical information

116
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,040
must be reported to the higher-ups.

117
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
I will advise them to proceed cautiously

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
and to retreat immediately if anything goes wrong,

119
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,850

It was cut off.

141
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,700

about the 810 intelligence.

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,520

is indeed at the Chongqing Station

148

153
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,940
it took me to uncover this Wild Grass?

To dig him out,

156
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,210
you have to be more important than him.

You and Wild Grass are both on the 810 team.

161
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,210
Why did he specifically ask you for the information?

162
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
It's because you have access

is clearly the border of Ruili.

00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
A few days ago,

190
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,800
you said that some of us

191
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,550
are working for the Japanese.

192
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,810
Are you now suggesting

193
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,860
that there are also people among us

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,240
working for the Communist Party?

195
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,040
Is that what you mean?

196
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,480
Captain Wei,

197
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,040
calm down.

198
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,340
Let me finish.

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,200
According to our investigation and analysis,

200
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
at our Chongqing Station,

201
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,130
there is a communist spy

202
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,790
whose code name we have mostly identified.

203
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,470
However, every member of our 810 team

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,770
was personally

205
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,110
selected by me.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,840
So, I have ample reason to believe

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,760
that everyone here is loyal to the Kuomintang.

208
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
Today's meeting

209
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,580
is to advise you

210
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,140
to keep your mouth shut.

211
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
The enemy is right beside us.

212
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Stay vigilant at all times.

213
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,680
However, this time,

214
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
the higher-ups have decided

215
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,890
that since

216
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,130
the Communist Party has taken action,

217
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,660
we'll catch them in our trap.

218
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,010
As soon as the Communist troops enter our defensive zone,

219
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
we will annihilate them on the spot.

220
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
And we can also

221
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,580
shift the blame for stirring up conflict

222
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,640
onto the Communist Party in passing.

223
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
Alright.

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,330
The meeting is over.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
Dismiss.

226
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Everyone.

227
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,950
Captains,

228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
how about we go to my office and talk?

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,190
Okay.

230
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,960
Wei.

231
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,680
You're Captain.

232
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Say something first.

233
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,170
Fine.

234
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,810
Since none of you want to say anything, I will.

235
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,030
Director Shen,

236
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,100
I don't oppose

237
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,450
catching the Communists.

238
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,810
Since there's a mole at the station,

239
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,810
of course we should expose this guy.

240
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
But do we have to do it now?

241
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,980
We haven't won the war against Japan yet.

242
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,010
We haven't figured out where the Japanese

243
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,690
will drop those over 8,000 poison gas bombs.

244
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,680
Do you think we really have to go against

245
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
the shabby Eighth Route Army with their shabby rifles?

246
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,400
Is it necessary?

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Besides,

248
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
even if the Communist Party knows about this information,

249
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,090
if they can help us figure out

250
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,440
the situation with the poison gas bombs,

251
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,270
wouldn't that be a good thing?

252
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,870
Vice Captain Wen,

253
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,120
you mustn't say this to anyone else.

254
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,330
Don't let it reach the boss's ears.

255
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,120
Otherwise,

256
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,060
you may lose your uniform.

257
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
Then let's find the mole.

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Director Shen,

259
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,720
since you've already

260
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
brought it to this point,

261
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,160
could you tell us the truth?

262
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,320
There's a document on this table.

263
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,500
Please take a look.

264
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,950
[List of people suspected to be Wild Grass, the underground Communist who infiltrated the NBIS]

265
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,840
Over the past three years,

266
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,480
we've had several intelligence leaks

267
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,890
in the NBIS.

268
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,220
[List of people suspected to be Wild Grass, the underground Communist who infiltrated the NBIS]

269
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,770
Everyone who could have had access

270
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,080
to this intelligence

271
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,170
is on this list.

272
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,880
Captain Wei,

273
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,810
you want to know

274
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,720
this person's code name, don't you?

275
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,680
He's called

276
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,080
Wild Grass.

277
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,880
And he's on this list.

278
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,630
This Wild Grass

279
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,480
has been undercover for about three years.

280
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,120
This is a very mature intelligence line.

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,200
It's a group of five to eight people at least,

282
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
including several liaisons,

283
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,120
a transmitter-receiver,

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,080
[Telecom Office]

285
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,960
and a telegrapher.

286
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,200
Lai, go and open the warehouse door.

287
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,000
The higher-ups want to check

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,040
all the mechanical and electrical components.

289
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Okay, no problem.

290
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,720
Okay.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,770
Of course,

292
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,890
the only one among them

293
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,440
who can directly contact Wild Grass

294
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,520
is his contact.

295
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,460
His contact should be

296
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,410
a high-level

297
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,610
Communist Party underground member.

298
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,760
When I came here,

299
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,490
I told you

300
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,090
that I came to find the moles within the Party,

301
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,720
not just Japanese moles,

302
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,090
but also the moles from Yan'an.

303
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,530
I might as well tell you the truth:

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,460
this operation of ambushing the Communists

305
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,870
is just a cover.

306
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,440
The real goal

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,650
is to expose this Wild Grass.

308
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Section Chief Li.

309
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,600
What's wrong?

310
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,720
Hello, This is Luo Chang Cheongsam Shop.

311
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
Hello, Ms. Wang.

312
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,720
Go ahead.

313
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,040
Last time,

314
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,640
I left a piece of fabric in your shop.

315
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,880
Please return both the fabric

316
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,960
and the money to me.

317
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,280
Didn't you say you wanted to make an outfit

318
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,160
for your mother to celebrate her 80th birthday?

319
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
Why do you suddenly ask for a refund?

320
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm afraid I can't make it anymore.

321
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,640
My mother is critically ill.

322
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,280
There's a possibility that I might even have to rush back for her funeral.

323
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,140
Okay, I see.

324
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,680
What's wrong?

325
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,320
Where are the dry batteries we use for sending the telegram?

326
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
Luo took them to Jishi Clinic

327
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,800
along with the transmitter-receiver.

328
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,860
What's the matter?

329
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,340
What he meant was that we need to return them quickly.

330
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,020
Otherwise,

331
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,660
he might be exposed.

332
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,200
No wonder

333
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,050
the Communist Party

334
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,080
found out about 810 so quickly.

335
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,810
Since we've released the information

336
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,610
about ambushing the guerrilla,

337
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
Wild Grass is bound to use

338
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
any means necessary

339
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,760
to send out this information.

340
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,640
So, I hope that you can cooperate with me

341
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,450
in the upcoming work,

342
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,320
implementing a control that appears loose

343
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,880
over all members of the 810 team.

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,680
Outwardly, we won't interfere with their action,

345
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,670
but secretly,

346
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,960
we'll send people with clean backgrounds to follow them.

347
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,880
Only by getting them to take action

348
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,240
can we have a chance to follow the clues

349
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,960
to expose Wild Grass

350
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,840
and the entire intelligence group behind him.

351
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
Come in.

352
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,810
Alright.

353
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,680
Take this list back

354
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,320
and have a discussion over it.

355
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,360
There might be some new discoveries.

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,520
Thank you.

357
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,290
Who do you think is a Communist?

358
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,960
What's wrong with you?

359
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,609
Why are you nervous?

360
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,819
I think you look like a Communist.

361
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
The lie detector test results for Li Shaotang showed that

362
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,730
he is highly suspicious of colluding with the Communist Party.

363
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,390
But Director Shen didn't bring this up at all today.

364
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,850
What did it mean?

365
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,050
What did it mean?

366
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,890
It meant that even if Li Shaotang was a Communist,

367
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,380
we've already turned him.

368
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,770
Understand?

369
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,310
Don't you have anything else to do

370
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,280
besides chatting with me?

371
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,180
Aren't you busy with work?

372
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,150
Fine, just believe I have nothing else to do.

373
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,650
As soon as Director Shen

374
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
came here,

375
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,550
he immediately took the Sundial's files

376
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,520
and Li Shaotang's

377
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
lie detector records.

378
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
And he has talked

379
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,660
to Li Shaotang privately several times.

380
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,870
Feng,

381
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,440
your future son-in-law

382
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,240
has been hiding so well.

383
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,690
You...

384
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,530
Feng.

385
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Don't you think

386
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,940
your future son-in-law

387
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,010
is more than just a tech expert?

388
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,870
Wait. What do you two mean by this?

389
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,280
What are you talking about?

390
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,000
Let me tell you, ever since the lie detector test problem

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
with Li Shaotang,

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,540
I've been feeling uneasy.

393
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,450
I planted a bug in his house.

394
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,950
So, what did you hear?

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,330
I didn’t hear anything.

396
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,720
Even if you did hear something,

397
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
you wouldn't tell us.

398
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
We understand.

399
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,800
What are you talking about?

400
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,560
He found it in a few days.

401
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,920
I was so embarrassed

402
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
that I had to remove it.

403
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,040
Don't be nervous.

404
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,560
Why would I be nervous? I'm not nervous.

405
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,640
Why did you say I'm nervous?

406
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,100
Fine. You are not nervous.

407
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,890
I didn't expect Wild Grass to appear.

408
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,290
If I had known, I wouldn't have bugged him.

409
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,840
Liu has the records.

410
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,830
Everything has been recorded. If you don't believe me, ask her.

411
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,840
She can testify.

412
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,160
Who? Liu?

413
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
Yes. Liu.

414
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,500
Feng, Liu's name...

415
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,840
[Li Shaotang, Qin Moqing, Liu Yufeng, Miao Jiang]

416
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,840
[List of people suspected to be Wild Grass, the underground Communist who infiltrated the NBIS]

417
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,300
is also on the suspect list.

418
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,440
How can she testify for you?

419
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,550
Come on. Wen,

420
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,810
your disciple is on the list too.

421
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,070
How could you say that?

422
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,060
I didn't say she's a Communist.

423
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,720
Feng!

424
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,260
You are kicking me when I'm down.

425
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,300
Let me make it clear. My disciple...

426
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,580
One of my disciples is on the list, right?

427
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,160
It's Ou Xiao'an. These are suspects from the past three years.

428
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,320
But he has been in 810 all these three years.

429
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,640
It has nothing to do with him.

430
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't be so sure.

431
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,910
Do you know who Wild Grass is?

432
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,490
Do you know?

433
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,610
No one knows who Wild Grass is.

434
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,510
Wen,

435
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,370
have you forgotten?

436
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,460
You had a disciple named Lou Mingyuan back then.

437
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,460
Who is he?

438
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,060
He's a Communist!

439
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,380
Feng, what do you mean?

440
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,940
Fine.

441
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,140
Then write down Wen Yishan

442
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,330
on the

443
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,210
suspect list! Okay?

444
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,360
Come on, Wen!

445
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll get you a pen.

446
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,000
Wen,

447
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,960
it hasn't been concluded yet.

448
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,210
Let's not start internal strife, okay?

449
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,120
Come on, it was he who...

450
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Alright.

451
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,400
What I meant just now was that

452
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,440
Li Shaotang definitely isn't a Communist.

453
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
Why?

454
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,840
Back then,

455
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,210
after Li Shaotang underwent screening at headquarters,

456
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,280
Director Shen was the one who brought back his file.

457
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
Moreover, the boss personally ordered

458
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,250
that no one below the rank of Captain could access it.

459
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,320
But there's a missing page

460
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
in his file.

461
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
A missing page?

462
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
You've actually kept such a big thing from us?

463
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,920
I only found out about the missing page

464
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,980
a couple of days ago

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
because of Ou Xiao'an's matter.

466
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,920
As for what exactly it is,

467
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,880
none of us knows.

468
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,820
But what we can confirm is that

469
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
the boss personally ordered

470
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,130
that this page be removed

471
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,800
and entrusted to Shen Congwu for safekeeping.

472
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Think about

473
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
what that means.

474
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,730
It means that

475
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,680
there must be something

476
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
we don't know about Li Shaotang

477
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,190
which the boss is well aware of

478
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,520
and has made special arrangements for.

479
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,270
The boss is very experienced.

480
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,990
He has been planning this plot for so many years.

481
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,600
Today, we've finally known its target.

482
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,250
We have to admire him.

483
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,870
But let me tell you,

484
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,680
I need to criticize you for today.

485
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,360
You shouldn't have rubbed salt into Wen's wound.

486
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,280
It shouldn't be brought up.

487
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's think about

488
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,400
who this Wild Grass really is.

489
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,560
Liu.

490
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,770
Come here.

491
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,520
This document needs to be filed quickly,

492
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,130
and it still needs Section Chief Li's signature.

493
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,160
Go to Director Shen's office and find him.

494
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,850
Hurry up.

495
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,710
Liu.

496
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,810
Come here.

497
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,580
Let me see what document it is.

498
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,000
It's not an emergency document.

499
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
You can wait until tonight

500
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,920
for the signature and filing when we come back,

501
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,760
right?

502
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,650
Besides, Director Shen is currently talking to someone.

503
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,710
He's unavailable.

504
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,040
This...

505
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,010
can wait for a while.

506
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,810
Ou Xiao'an,

507
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,920
didn't you say you wanted to see Captain Wen for something urgent?

508
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,240
He just finished the meeting.

509
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,450
Okay, I see.

510
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
Hold off on delivering this document for now.

511
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,480
Wait until I come back and review it before delivering it.

512
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,740
You can go back for now.

513
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,480
Okay.

514
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,450
Ou Xiao'an?

515
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,570
Hold on!

516
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,530
Hold on!

517
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,370
Mr. Wen.

518
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,860
You can't get in there!

519
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
Vice Captain Wen.

520
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,280
Leave us. Close the door.

521
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,680
Yes.

522
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
Hurry up.

523
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,970
You've done well with 810.

524
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,040
Do you want me to give you a compliment?

525
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
No, Mr. Wen.

526
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Have you also decided to ambush the guerrilla now?

527
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,940
It’s none of your business.

528
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,920
The higher-ups have their arrangements.

529
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,380
You shouldn't interfere.

530
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,160
Sir,

531
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,270
since I reported

532
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,090
the specific longitude of 810 last time,

533
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
it's only been a few days until now.

534
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Director Shen said they've found it.

535
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,460
How is that possible? How could they find it so quickly?

536
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,060
What are you trying to say?

537
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Although my memory is not good now,

538
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,450
I am very sure

539
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,080
this definitely isn't Ohashi Kazuya's style.

540
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,990
He couldn't possibly

541
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,080
leave 810 intact

542
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,680
for the Expeditionary Force to find.

543
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,380
What's inside 810?

544
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,530
It's all classified information.

545
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,440
How could they possibly find it so easily?

546
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
And they said there were so many survivors.

547
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Right?

548
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,610
This is all your speculation.

549
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
Li Shaotang has been actively

550
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,590
searching and locating 810.

551
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,700
Does it unsettle you?

552
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,560
Fine.

553
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,770
Continue with your work. I'm leaving.

554
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Have you heard of Wild Grass?

555
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,160
Who?

556
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Wild Grass?

557
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,010
Didn't Lou Mingyuan mention it to you?

558
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,560
No.

559
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,880
Go.

560
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,690
Mind your own business and don't worry about others.

561
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,800
Okay.

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,480

568
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,680

569
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,340
At this moment, Wild Grass

570
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,160
must be feeling anxious.

571
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,700
I just deliberately pretended to make a phone call

572
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,590
in front of the whole team.

573
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,360
When Wild Grass saw it, he must have been harboring hope.

574
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,190
He would think that

575
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,040
even if he's in danger, there's me who can keep sending messages

576
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,170
to the Communist Party for him.

577
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,210
Not only did he trust you more,

578
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,900
he might even worry about you.

579
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,620
When he saw me

580

call you in for questioning,

581
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,690
he would be at a loss.

582
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,020
Now, he'll definitely go out on his own to send the messages.

They said they went for treatment of Ou Xiao'an.

602

Got it. Send someone to keep an eye on them.

603
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,340
Yes, Director.

someone is watching him,

609
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
he would still take the risk.
