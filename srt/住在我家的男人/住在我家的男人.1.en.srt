00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,600
(Episode 1)

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,140
When I walk in this outfit,

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,170
men, women and even children stare at me.

6
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,270
Have a pleasant flight.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,300
Let me help you with that. You may take your seat.

8
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,340
Give me a hand.

9
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,140
How annoying!

10
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,840
Excuse me. Do something about your baby.

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,540
Excuse me. May I have some water please?

12
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Hey! How could you forget that?

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,070
Can you do anything right?

14
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,800
Why didn't you pack your own bag then?

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,970
I asked for water!

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,870
I meet people who are the most irritable...

17
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,200
either at the start or end of a trip.

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,370
Here you go.

19
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,600
That is my job.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,470
Ms. Do Yeo Joo.

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm Jung Hyun's fiancee.

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,140
We're preparing for take-off. Please take your seat.

23
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,140
So why did you ignore my calls?

24
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,240
Why did you make me get on a plane?

25
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,800
Ma'am, please return to your seat.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,570
Let's keep this short. Give him his car back...

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,740
before we report you for being a thief.

28
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,840
That car was a gift.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,270
A gift? Don't give me that.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,440
Hey. Who do you think you are? Do you want to die?

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,570
Hey! Let go!

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,800
- Let go! - I refuse.

33
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,240
- Let go! - Ma'am?

34
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,100
It is a criminal offense to threaten...

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,840
or physically assault a flight attendant.

36
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,470
Please return to your seat.

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,970
Why are you bringing up the law?

38
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,240
I don't understand any of that.

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,270
Life is a trip.

40
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,240
You never know what kind of situation...

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,540
will happen to you.

42
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,770
- Have a great day. - Have a great day.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,440
My gosh.

44
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,800
How could that brat not even say goodbye?

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,270
She has no energy when she's going to be disciplined.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,800
You're right.

47
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,500
That woman with sunglasses bugged her the entire time.

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,500
It's been nine years and you seem to still love him.

49
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,070
He still gets me excited.

50
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
He said he has a surprise for me...

51
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,370
and sent a picture of a cafe business card.

52
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,540
"Romantic Island."

53
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,370
A cafe specializing in proposals?

54
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,740
Oh my gosh. You dense but charming woman.

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,940
A cafe specializing in proposals? Oh my gosh.

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,040
Do I let on that I know or no?

57
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,500
Na Ri,

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,840
will you marry me?

59
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,200
That's right.

60
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,800
- It was here. - What's wrong?

61
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,870
Hold on. It was right here. Where did it go?

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,170
- Isn't this it? - No, I had it here.

63
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,600
Nothing in life is predictable.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,740
That's where it went.

65
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,870
Like a long-term boyfriend's clumsy proposal.

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,740
Whenever you want to cry

67
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,770
Or you are hurting

68
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,000
Excuse me.

69
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,840
- Hi, Uncle. - Na Ri.

70
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,540
Na Ri.

71
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,000
What is it? Is something wrong?

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,770
Your mom was in a car accident.

73
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,270
Is she badly hurt?

74
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,670
She passed away.

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,770
Nothing in life is predictable.

76
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,570
Like hearing that my mom, who I thought...

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,570
would be with me forever, passed away.

78
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,440
My gosh.

79
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,770
I'm so sorry.

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,170
Come this way.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
Please have a seat.

82
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,370
You haven't had dinner yet, right? You must be hungry.

83
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,840
Give me a minute. I'll bring out some food.

84
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,870
It's nice to meet you.

85
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,300
Hello.

86
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,870
- Give me a minute. - Thank you.

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,140
Did you see him?

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Nothing in life is predictable.

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,500
Like the fact that the death was not the end,

90
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,100
but the beginning of many big incidents.

91
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,040
Nothing in life is predictable.

92
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,070
(10 months later)

93
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,800
- Great work today. - You too.

94
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,840
(I'm back.)

95
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,770
Look at that witch.

96
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,670
What rich guy did she bleed dry and dump this time?

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,170
She hasn't dumped him yet.

98
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,700
She likes this one.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,500
- Why? - She looks satisfied.

100
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,040
"You're dying because of me. You love me to death."

101
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,840
Then why isn't she responding?

102
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,140
- Because she likes him. - What nonsense is that?

103
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,300
You don't reply when you don't like him or like him.

104
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,940
Then when do you reply?

105
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,070
You read my message but didn't reply. I'm back.

106
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,670
Work hard.

107
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,040
Na Ri. Your boyfriend is here.

108
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,570
- Hi. - Hello.

109
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,100
Hello.

110
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,870
I hear you're busy lately.

111
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,700
What's wrong with you? Where are your manners?

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,040
Give them some privacy.

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,470
- Have a nice day. - You too.

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,240
You should've told me you were coming.

115
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,270
I suddenly have to go away for business.

116
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,740
You do?

117
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,540
Yes, to China.

118
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,900
When? Today?

119
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,370
Right now? Which flight?

120
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,470
No.

121
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,840
Chinese investors are coming today.

122
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,870
We have to have meetings at a hotel for a few days.

123
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,100
Sorry.

124
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
Why?

125
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,670
Why are you sorry?

126
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,170
Ever since my mom died, all I did was work.

127
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,870
How many times did I circle the Earth?

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,070
I'll be promoted super quickly at this rate.

129
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,340
I'll cut back on work and be good to you.

130
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,870
I won't let you down.

131
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,000
You must be tired.

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,240
You must be hungry.

133
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,140
Do you want some coffee and a sandwich?

134
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm still on duty.

135
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,940
I can't carry things like that while on duty.

136
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
Good luck with your meeting today,

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,310
and good luck with the investors.

138
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll see you later.

139
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,170
That's right. His gift.

140
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,570
- Hi. - Where are you?

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
What?

142
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,640
Is he out of his mind?

143
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,100
Don't move. I'm almost there.

144
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,470
I lost so much weight too,

145
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,570
but look at you.

146
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,100
You're making Yeo Joo sad.

147
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,870
Hello, Ms. Hong.

148
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,370
I wanted to confirm the text of the invitation.

149
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,900
"We will look at the same map..."

150
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,200
"and walk along the same path of life together."

151
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,540
"Please join us as we begin our journey."

152
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,640
Is that correct?

153
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
No.

154
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,100
I think we have different maps.

155
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,140
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,000
Na... Na Ri.

157
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,240
You did it intentionally, didn't you?

158
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,370
You didn't take his calls to drive him crazy, right?

159
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,140
You did it for me to see, didn't you?

160
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,100
Do you think you've won?

161
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,800
Fine. You keep the trash...

162
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,170
that I threw out.

163
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
It's a misunderstanding.

164
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,640
Na Ri. It's a misunderstanding.

165
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Na Ri.

166
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,770
I thought you were...

167
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,040
- a superficial, ignorant... - Wait.

168
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,700
- and lazy bum. - Give me a moment.

169
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,670
- But now, you lie too? - I'm sorry.

170
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,070
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,200
Did your love leave you?

172
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,770
You did nothing wrong.

173
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,840
Don't let your self-esteem dwindle.

174
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,770
You are still an amazing person.

175
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,600
Do you want revenge?

176
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,840
Do you think you'll be happy once you get your revenge?

177
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,770
Do you think your self-esteem will improve?

178
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,900
Do you want to break up with him...

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,640
or give him another chance?

180
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,940
Do you want to forgive him?

181
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,770
You said you wanted to get tea one last time.

182
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,340
- Where are you going? - You wanted to see the sea.

183
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,240
Are you still stalking me on social media?

184
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
You're so persistent.

185
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,800
I couldn't reach you and...

186
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,270
How could I live without at least doing that?

187
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Okay.

188
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,370
Let's go to the beach.

189
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,570
It's the last time.

190
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,840
I can do that much.

191
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,770
(Shin Jung Im)

192
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,970
Mom.

193
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,270
It's nice seeing the ocean.

194
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,540
Right, Dong Jin?

195
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,500
Dong Jin.

196
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,400
Yes. It is nice seeing the ocean, isn't it?

197
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,400
(Na Ri)

198
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,670
(Na Ri)

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
Give me my phone.

200
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,470
Stop that. Don't play.

201
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,170
- It's dangerous. - Hello.

202
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,200
Na Ri.

203
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,470
I can't really talk right now.

204
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,670
Just listen.

205
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,100
I came to see my mom.

206
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Your mother?

207
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,570
Seulgi-ri?

208
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,170
I see.

209
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,240
- I'll call you later... - There is no later.

210
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,100
I came all the way here to say this in front of my mom.

211
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,870
Shut it and listen, you big fat lying jerk.

212
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,140
We're through.

213
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,740
Dong Jin!

214
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,300
Why did it have to be Yeo Joo?

215
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,840
Did our relationship mean that little to you?

216
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,270
I won't say that because my mom would be sad.

217
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,540
We're through.

218
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,510
- Na Ri, I'll call you back... - And you, Yeo Joo.

219
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,470
Listen to me.

220
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,510
Don't let me see your face again.

221
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,670
If you see me, walk the other way.

222
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,470
If we have to be in the same room, don't look at me.

223
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,540
Don't talk to me.

224
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,400
Don't smile in front of me. Don't eat in front of me.

225
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,570
Don't do anything!

226
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,070
Hey. Na Ri, what are you talking about?

227
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,400
Yeo Joo. I saw you two together...

228
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,640
and I just heard your voice. Answer me.

229
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,670
Na Ri.

230
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,510
Dong Jin kept coming to the airport...

231
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,540
and calling. What could I do?

232
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,270
I wanted to just talk to him.

233
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,240
And you and I work together.

234
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,800
How could I avoid not to be around you?

235
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Really?

236
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,600
Then try me.

237
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,370
Try talking to me.

238
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,340
Try looking at me, smiling in front of me...

239
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,900
and eating in front of me.

240
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,170
If you want to know what will happen, just try it.

241
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,100
When everyone else called you a wicked wench,

242
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I never once chimed in...

243
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,940
Hello?

244
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,400
Hello?

245
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,140
(Shim Jung Im)

246
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,370
Mom. I'll live a better life from now on.

247
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
I promise.

248
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,540
(Dong Jin)

249
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,510
That was a good nap.

250
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,800
That must have been entertaining.

251
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,740
Are you the groundskeeper?

252
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,010
- Me? - Put up some signs.

253
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,400
I always get lost.

254
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,970
- I am not. - What?

255
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,340
I'm not the groundskeeper.

256
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,200
You're not? Sorry.

257
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,840
Excuse me!

258
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,840
Snake. Snake! Over there!

259
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,010
Where? Where?

260
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,440
Be careful of snakes.

261
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,340
What?

262
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,640
Did he just trick me?

263
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,440
See you around.

264
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Why would I?

265
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,840
Wait.

266
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,470
There's a wild boar! There's a wild boar!

267
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,540
A wild boar!

268
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,600
(Seulgi Supermarket)

269
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,010
Hello!

270
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,600
It's been a while.

271
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,440
- It has. - You don't make deliveries.

272
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,070
No.

273
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,300
I hate waiting in line to eat.

274
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,900
Then just leave.

275
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,700
Boss. Boss.

276
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,600
The bike is bad enough. Do something about the clothes.

277
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,940
That hat...

278
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,040
Darn it.

279
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,900
- It's so good. - Isn't it?

280
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,740
- Yes. - Hello.

281
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
Freeze.

282
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,540
Why bother making dumpling skins...

283
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,340
when the filling stinks?

284
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,040
Who seasoned it?

285
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,600
Don't sigh. It'll make me sigh more.

286
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,670
Just redo it.

287
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,340
She came all the way here,

288
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,540
but isn't coming home again.

289
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,700
Why must I avoid you?

290
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,770
Fine. Try me.

291
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,270
I'm pathetic and lost my boyfriend to a junior,

292
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,470
and you're an evil wench.

293
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,540
Should I post in on the intranet?

294
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,740
- Hi. - Hi.

295
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,140
- Here. Eat with us. - Thanks.

296
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,370
I'll go.

297
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,940
I'll go.

298
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,170
Oh my gosh. She's scaring me.

299
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,270
People don't change that drastically.

300
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,000
Why is the spoiled brat working so hard lately?

301
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
People don't change. Don't worry.

302
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,140
We're still waiting for her to choose.

303
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,670
- She doesn't seem interested in anything. - Look!

304
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,140
But what's going on? Her mom took out money.

305
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,900
You can't do that.

306
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,700
Is she always this aggressive?

307
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,370
Fine. Is she interested...

308
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,740
in money? Wait. A friend brought an airplane toy.

309
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,200
Na Ri. I don't like airplanes.

310
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't like it.

311
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,140
Okay.

312
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,200
Eat.

313
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,540
You've lost so much weight.

314
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,370
I was too busy and was inattentive to my friend...

315
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,040
who is going through a huge crisis.

316
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,040
- I... - Hey.

317
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,870
You're the one who suffered.

318
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,800
You did well. Good girl.

319
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,670
I'll study in your place.

320
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,740
Yes, I worked hard. I did good.

321
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,700
I couldn't rest, running the store after having a baby.

322
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,870
Don't you feel bad for me?

323
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,200
- Then forgive me this one time. - For what?

324
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,640
Dong Jin is coming.

325
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I need gold. You know he's generous.

326
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm sure he won't bring just a small ring.

327
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,970
You dated for almost 10 years.

328
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,240
Why did you break up with him over the phone?

329
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,840
I don't like him either, but there's such a thing...

330
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,000
- as etiquette in breaking up... - Etiquette?

331
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,770
- Did you just say, "etiquette"? - Me?

332
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,870
Did I say "etiquette" to you?

333
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,770
I've lost my mind.

334
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,170
What am I saying?

335
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,940
Ran Sook. Congratulations.

336
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,800
You made it.

337
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
Thank you.

338
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,900
- I'm sorry. - No.

339
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,970
Don't be sorry.

340
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,970
We messed up. We dated for too long.

341
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,200
I wanted to end it. I mean it.

342
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,700
And yet, you came all the way to the airport.

343
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,540
You lost your mind for love. How could you?

344
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,900
Seeing you with Yeo Joo at the airport...

345
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,400
was enough for me to lose my mind.

346
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,170
But instead, I thought...

347
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,970
about the loan we got for the apartment,

348
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,340
about splitting our savings, and that you'd better...

349
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,770
pay the cancellation fee for the wedding.

350
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,240
I hated myself for it.

351
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,370
- We are just over. - Don't say that.

352
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,670
I didn't tell my family.

353
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,940
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

354
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,540
- But... - That's enough.

355
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,870
I hate hearing people apologize.

356
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,240
Sure, call it trauma.

357
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,370
When I was little,

358
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,100
my dad left my mom and me for another woman.

359
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,570
I can't be with a man like that.

360
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,370
We're just over. That's all.

361
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,740
Your uncle...

362
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,000
After your mom's funeral,

363
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,700
he came to my office three times.

364
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,670
Every time he came,

365
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,100
he borrowed 10,000 dollars.

366
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,870
What?

367
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,740
He said he needed it to settle your mom's affairs,

368
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,070
but he couldn't bear to ask you...

369
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,440
and borrowed it from me.

370
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,070
Don't call him.

371
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,500
You'll make me look like a demanding lender.

372
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,040
I'll pay it back once I sell my mom's house.

373
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,570
That's not what I mean.

374
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,670
We're family already.

375
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,700
That's how my parents consider you too.

376
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,270
Your uncle felt the same way. That's why he came to me.

377
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,700
Whom else do you have but me right now?

378
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,400
Right?

379
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,040
I see. I have no one else.

380
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,440
We were family.

381
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,270
We're family. That's why you lied to me.

382
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,870
But why are we family?

383
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,400
Do you have legal documents?

384
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,070
Do you become family...

385
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,270
if you lend someone 30,000 dollars?

386
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,300
We're nothing to each other! Nothing.

387
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,140
Excuse me. How much is it?

388
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,270
Forget it. I'll pay.

389
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
How much?

390
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,240
- How much? - 15 dollars.

391
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,640
- You don't take credit cards, do you? - No.

392
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,070
Did you say 30,000 dollars?

393
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,770
Get it from my uncle whom you consider family.

394
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,740
I'm sure he used it up while gambling already.

395
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,070
My mom's house?

396
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,500
I won't sell it.

397
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,570
I'll leave it as is forever!

398
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,840
Fine. Okay. Don't sell it.

399
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,770
Let's go home now.

400
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,800
Let go. Let go. Let go.

401
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,240
I don't like Yeo Joo.

402
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,140
I don't like her because she's pretty.

403
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,370
I hate her because she dresses well,

404
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,740
puts on make-up well...

405
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,400
and is a girly girl!

406
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,640
Was Yeo Joo your type?

407
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,340
You must have thought I was so ugly.

408
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,800
I hate her!

409
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,100
Why won't you let me break up with you nicely?

410
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,470
I hate it because it was Yeo Joo, you jerk!

411
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,740
(Uncle)

412
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,440
The person you have reached is currently unavailable.

413
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
Na Ri.

414
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,370
Na Ri.

415
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,870
I'm sorry.

416
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,540
Thank you.

417
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,740
Uncle.

418
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,900
Uncle!

419
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Uncle...

420
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,700
It's open.

421
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,270
I knew it.

422
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,200
Where are you, Uncle?

423
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,640
How could you stab your only niece in the back?

424
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,470
(Hong Dumplings)

425
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm home.

426
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,340
I love this sound.

427
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,370
Mommy! Mommy!

428
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,140
Snake! Snake!

429
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,070
What's this?

430
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,070
I thought you were a snake.

431
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,700
Why are you coiled up like this?

432
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,570
What are you trying to do?

433
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,100
Goodness.

434
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Who are you?

435
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,340
Who are you?

436
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,670
- Who are you? - Darn it.

437
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,410
Who are you?

438
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,100
Darn it.

439
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,570
What did you hit me with?

440
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,140
Is that a shovel? Did you hit me with a shovel?

441
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,270
Don't come any closer.

442
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,300
What are you doing in my house?

443
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,970
I avoided it only because I have good reflexes!

444
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,800
What would you have done if you had hit me dead-on?

445
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,540
That would've been murder. Murder.

446
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,500
This... This is my house.

447
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,140
It was shelf difference.

448
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,470
"Shelf difference"?

449
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,470
No.

450
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,770
Self-difference. No. Self-defense?

451
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,340
Me? I live here.

452
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,570
So it's also self-defense for me too.

453
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,940
What?

454
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Oh my gosh.

455
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,870
I'm sorry.

456
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,770
I haven't been home for so long.

457
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,700
I must've come to the wrong place.

458
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

459
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
That's mine.

460
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,340
That's mine.

461
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,300
Give it back.

462
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,700
What's wrong with you?

463
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,300
Give it back.

464
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,370
You're pathetic.

465
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,300
How do you not recognize your own home?

466
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,740
My own home?

467
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,270
This is my home.

468
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,440
It really is my home.

469
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,500
Who are you?

470
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,270
I told you before. I live here!

471
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,200
Why is this punk yelling at me?

472
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,840
Tenant. Are you a tenant?

473
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,840
- Did you drink? - Yes.

474
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,270
You're killing my buzz. Got it?

475
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,100
So this may get complicated,

476
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,770
but I own this house.

477
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,870
- You signed a lease with my uncle. - I did not.

478
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,040
I'm not a tenant.

479
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,840
I own this house.

480
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,370
- You bought this house? - That's right.

481
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,440
Uncle.

482
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,410
Have we...

483
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,410
- met before? - Now, she remembers.

484
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,200
You treated me like a groundskeeper then,

485
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,670
and today, you treat me like a tenant.

486
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,040
Snake. Snake! Over there!

487
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Where?

488
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,340
You recognized me, but you played dumb.

489
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,570
- I said I'd see you around. - Do you know me?

490
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,800
Did you know who I was?

491
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,370
I don't like talking to drunk people.

492
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,410
Let's talk tomorrow.

493
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm sober now. I want to talk now.

494
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,870
How do you know me? How long have you owned this house?

495
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,000
If you own this house,

496
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,340
why is everything still here? I need to know.

497
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,170
Na Ri.

498
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,870
You know my name too?

499
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,370
Can you handle it?

500
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,170
You won't be able to accept in your current state,

501
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
so let's talk tomorrow.

502
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's talk when you're lucid...

503
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,570
and the sun is out.

504
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,200
Wait. Why is he leaving if this is his house?

505
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,470
Sure. It isn't yet.

506
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,870
It couldn't be.

507
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,070
What dialect was that?

508
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,540
What a nice scent.

509
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,410
What's this?

510
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,570
Why does everything seem so new?

511
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,370
Na Ri. Can you handle it?

512
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,570
It's already too much for me to handle 30,000 dollars.

513
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,970
He'll probably ask for this house.

514
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,970
How much more must I handle?

515
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,770
My mom is still just as pretty as ever.

516
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,570
Mom, I'm here.

517
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,410
Show me your pretty smile.

518
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,340
Just once. Please?

519
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,870
(Hong Dumplings)

520
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,370
(Hong Dumplings Menu)

521
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
- Good morning! - Good morning.

522
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,240
- Hello. - Hi.

523
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,140
I'm sorry for making you do this.

524
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,170
The owner of that restaurant...

525
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,970
is such a jerk, so I didn't want to get in line.

526
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,140
It tastes better the more I chew.

527
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,700
How annoying.

528
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,970
What about the permit?

529
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,770
It won't be granted unless you get the building,

530
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,140
but they still refuse to sell.

531
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,570
That's why I told you...

532
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,100
That's why I asked you to convince her...

533
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,240
since you've lived here for a while...

534
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,200
and are similar in age to Ms. Shin Jung Im.

535
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,270
Give her a modernized hanbok or something as a gift.

536
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,200
There's a new owner.

537
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,040
- What? - Take a look.

538
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,640
(Owner: Ko Nan Gil)

539
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,300
Ko Nan Gil?

540
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,000
The owner of Hong Dumplings?

541
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,870
Why?

542
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,200
Why him?

543
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,300
Wait a second.

544
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,040
Does this make sense?

545
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,870
He's a con artist.

546
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,770
Na Ri.

547
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,300
Why do I sound so sleazy?

548
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,770
Hey, Na Ri.

549
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,740
That isn't right either.

550
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,900
Look, Na Ri.

551
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,270
Let me explain who I am.

552
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,270
The truth is... I am your... I can't do this.

553
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,070
What's going on?

554
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,540
What's going on? Why can't I see?

555
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,800
It's Product 37 which costs 67 dollars.

556
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,470
My memory is the best.

557
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,900
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

558
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,070
Who's that?

559
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,100
That would've been murder. Murder.

560
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
My gosh!

561
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,700
I thought I heard a scream.

562
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,070
- Are you okay? - It's nothing!

563
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,370
It's nothing.

564
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,040
Why is he such a busybody?

565
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,570
What's wrong with me?

566
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,640
What? What's wrong?

567
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,070
I'm coming in!

568
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,840
Let me in!

569
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,370
Open the door.

570
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,470
What? What's wrong?

571
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,200
- I can't see. - What?

572
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,770
I can't see! I can't see anything.

573
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,370
Try opening your eyes. You have your eyes closed.

574
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,470
I can't see.

575
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,740
- What? - Is there something in my eyes?

576
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,200
My gosh! Darn it.

577
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,640
That punk.

578
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,300
Boss!

579
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,900
What's going on?

580
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,500
- What is it? - Get me a taxi.

581
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,800
A taxi? Okay.

582
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,570
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

583
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,640
Taxi!

584
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,000
Wait.

585
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,440
Over here! Here!

586
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,640
That's the Robot.

587
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,740
Mr. Kwon, we have a patient as you can see.

588
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,170
Okay. Get in.

589
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,200
Boss. Get in.

590
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,240
You seem to be in a rush. Get in.

591
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
We're getting in a car.

592
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,800
Gosh.

593
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,270
I'll take care of the restaurant, so don't worry.

594
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,870
Call me, okay?

595
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,100
Go!

596
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,470
What medicine did you take?

597
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,240
- Medicine? - I saw the container.

598
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,870
The doctor might need to know.

599
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,970
What did you take and how much?

600
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,340
- It wasn't much. - Just tell me what it was!

601
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,440
It was a sleeping pill. An all-natural sleeping pill.

602
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,940
I took just one.

603
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,540
Did I take another one later?

604
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,970
There's no such thing as an all-natural sleeping pill.

605
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,870
Are you dizzy and having problems speaking?

606
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,070
- Who is he? - I'm...

607
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,170
Nobody.

608
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,970
You were drinking.

609
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,500
It's common sense...

610
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,470
not to take sleeping pills after drinking.

611
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,870
- But you took two. - That's not the problem.

612
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,840
Why can't I see?

613
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,900
Am I a doctor? Why are you asking me?

614
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,540
Did you hear that? I was talking to myself.

615
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,800
You have good hearing.

616
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,940
(Emergency Care Unit)

617
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,870
We're here.

618
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,870
What's wrong with me?

619
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,170
Well, thanks.

620
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,100
We're here.

621
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,670
Hold on.

622
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,270
Is he shooting a movie or something?

623
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Let me down.

624
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,040
Let me down. I can see now.

625
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
You're barefoot.

626
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,570
Excuse me.

627
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,000
Excuse me.

628
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,770
She took sleeping pills after drinking alcohol.

629
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,900
She took sleeping pills after drinking alcohol.

630
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,540
- Come this way. - Okay.

631
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,040
Where does it hurt?

632
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,200
She took sleeping pills after drinking alcohol...

633
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,170
Why can't he just announce it to the world?

634
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,070
That was briefly.

635
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,640
- I'm fine now. - Do you have any other symptoms?

636
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,540
- I'm slightly dizzy... - Please fill out the forms.

637
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,900
My back hurts too.

638
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,970
- And he isn't my guardian. - I'll go fill it out.

639
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,640
Gosh.

640
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,470
I'm Kwon Duk Bong, the one who drove you here.

641
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,140
Thank you.

642
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,440
I'm Kwon Duk Bong.

643
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
Yes?

644
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,500
I'm Kwon Duk Bong.

645
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,940
I'm Hong Na Ri.

646
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,040
I see, Hong Na Ri. Was that...

647
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,740
- a suicide attempt? - It was not.

648
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,040
It might become a habit.

649
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,000
Here's another busybody.

650
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,800
I know the owner of Hong Dumplings.

651
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,570
Who would you be?

652
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,840
What's your relationship with him?

653
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,170
The owner of Hong Dumplings?

654
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,970
Who is?

655
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,970
The one who held you and ran in here, looking all cool.

656
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,200
Ko Nan Gil is the owner of Hong Dumplings.

657
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,100
He is? That man...

658
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,500
Ko Nam Gil?

659
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,540
Not Ko Nam Gil. It's Ko Nan Gil. You know...

660
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,370
Anyway.

661
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,770
Then did you shoot a movie without sharing...

662
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,040
information on each other?

663
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,770
Why does Ko Nan Gil run Hong Dumplings,

664
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,370
instead of Ko Dumplings?

665
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,200
Why does that matter? It's the owner's call.

666
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,500
Stop calling him the owner.

667
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,000
Hong Dumplings isn't Ko Nan Gil's. It's Hong Na Ri's.

668
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,440
Who's the patient? Look how pale you are.

669
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,370
No, this way.

670
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
Me.

671
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:17,670
Left?

672
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Right.

673
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,070
Love.

674
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,640
You must love your body when you're young.

675
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,470
When you suddenly can't see,

676
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,770
it is a temporary loss of vision.

677
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,670
It is often caused by extreme stress.

678
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,500
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

679
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:53,870
No. I've been busy at work lately...

680
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,770
and haven't been sleeping...

681
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,440
That's right.

682
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,570
Anxiety, insomnia and malnutrition...

683
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,100
hold hands and appear at once.

684
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,370
One of them may appear later than the others.

685
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,800
Anyway, you should get tested.

686
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,070
- I will next time. - He said to get tested now!

687
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,470
How could you let your body get like this?

688
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,840
How have you been living?

689
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,540
That's right.

690
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,840
Your guardian paid for everything already,

691
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,400
so get tested.

692
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,870
He isn't my guardian.

693
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,640
I'll give you the money.

694
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,640
Ms. Hong, please come with me.

695
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,000
The guardian may wait outside.

696
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,700
Who's my guardian?

697
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,940
I know this is the ER,

698
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,800
but do you trust anyone who claims to be a guardian?

699
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,570
- He said you're family. - Who did?

700
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,070
He did.

701
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,500
Family? Who is whose family?

702
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,340
- How long will the test take? - Stop right there!

703
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,740
I'm not a tenant.

704
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,300
I own this house.

705
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,970
Ko Nan Gil is the owner of Hong Dumplings.

706
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,070
He said you're family.

707
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,800
Hello?

708
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,300
Na Ri is the daughter?

709
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,370
Okay.

710
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Come with me.

711
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,970
- Please wait right here. - Yes, Ma'am.

712
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,640
Why did you pay my hospital bills?

713
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,040
Why is it your business?

714
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,700
Whether I'm stressed, have insomnia or am malnourished,

715
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,900
it has nothing to do with you.

716
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,440
We're not family.

717
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,540
She was quivering in fear because she couldn't see.

718
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,140
Now that I saved her...

719
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,570
I didn't quiver in fear.

720
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,770
Did you hear that? I was talking to myself.

721
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:35,840
You have good hearing.

722
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,500
Why did you say we were family?

723
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Let's get straight to it.

724
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,770
- Move out of my house right now. - Why should I?

725
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,400
Don't speak so rudely. I'm obviously older than you.

726
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,670
Forget it.

727
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,270
We're not family.

728
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,500
Families live together. Families have memories.

729
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,540
Father.

730
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,340
...

731
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,840
No, did Hong Sung Kyu send you?

732
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,140
To claim the restaurant now that Mom passed away?

733
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,440
How did he find out? He didn't call for over 10 years.

734
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,970
- Your father? - That's right.

735
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,940
It's Hong Sung Kyu.

736
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,470
What's your real name?

737
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,670
- It isn't Ko Nam Gil. - No, it isn't.

738
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,570
- See? - Ko Nan Gil.

739
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,000
Not Nam Gil, but Nan Gil.

740
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,470
What's your relationship with my father?

741
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,100
Did he say he owns Hong Dumplings?

742
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,440
You were screaming...

743
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,040
that Hong Dumplings was yours.

744
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,200
You must actually think it's Hong Sung Kyu's.

745
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,040
Your mother would be disappointed.

746
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,070
She told me...

747
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,640
it was named after you.

748
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,500
Who are you to talk about my mom?

749
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,500
Forget it. Get out of my mom's and my house.

750
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,670
I told you it's my house. I can't leave.

751
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,570
Who are you?

752
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,800
Who are you to say my house is yours?

753
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,900
Who are you really?

754
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,570
Your father.

755
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,400
See? I was right. My father did send you.

756
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,570
I'm not saying your father Hong Sung Kyu, but me.

757
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,340
I'm your father.

758
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,040
- What? - I am...

759
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,900
Hong Na Ri's...

760
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,370
stepfather.

761
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,340
(Sweet Stranger and Me)

762
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,700
So you met my mom by chance and married her.

763
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,170
No. It wasn't by chance. It was destiny.

764
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,370
It was meant to be.

765
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,940
There's nothing particularly wrong.

766
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,670
- Are you married? - Yes, I am.

767
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,770
How did you register your marriage?

768
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,700
Do you need a witness to testify?

769
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,940
Shin Jung Im is your mother, right?

770
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,100
Isn't it strange? She got married without telling you.

771
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,470
The owner got changed suddenly.

772
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,670
And she got into a sudden car accident.

773
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,170
Nan Gil. It's been a while.

774
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,770
Why are you traveling in packs?

775
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,070
They wanted to meet the legendary Ko Nan Gil.

776
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,100
- Hello! - Hello!

777
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,570
Let's trust each other.

778
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,200
- Who was that? - What?

779
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,700
You seemed like friends.

780
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,900
Nan Gil looked annoyed.

781
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,570
He'll show his true colors soon.

782
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,570
- Let's drop in without warning. - Behave well.

783
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,400
Let's see how the con artist reacts.

784
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,840
Your guests are running late.

785
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,670
Would you like a drink while waiting?

786
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,100
- What's wrong with her? - Did you think I couldn't?
