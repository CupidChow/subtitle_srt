00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,050
(Episode 2)

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,700
Who are you? Who are you to say my house is yours?

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,840
Who are you really?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,640
Your father.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,200
See? I was right. My father did send you.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,370
I'm not saying your father Hong Sung Kyu, but me.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,400
- What? - I am...

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,700
Hong Na Ri's stepfather.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,170
So I won't watch you lose your sight,

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,540
become malnourished or lack sleep from stress.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,870
So I will keep caring.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,870
I'll let you know once the results are out.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,540
What is he talking about? I'm speechless.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,640
I wanted to tell you little by little.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,970
How old are you, kid?

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,270
I just told you I'm your stepdad.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,970
Isn't that a bit disrespectful?

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,640
You should've done your research. My mom passed away.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,270
How could I have a stepdad when I don't have a mom?

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,900
- Who are you? - I told you. Your dad.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,800
You shouldn't be calling me as kid. Don't you think?

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,300
Jung Im and I registered our marriage last year.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,040
What? Jung Im?

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,900
Hey! You con artist gigolo!

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,870
Calling me those names...

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,270
is an insult to your mother.

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,440
The day I met you by the tree...

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,470
was our one-year anniversary.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,470
You could've registered the marriage by yourself.

32
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,870
I'm sure my innocent mom didn't know anything.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,400
Of course, she did. She went with me.

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Are you saying my mom went with a kid like you,

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,870
- I mean, with you to the... - Borough hall.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,300
That's right.

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,870
Whatever. Why didn't you say anything by the tree then?

38
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,970
Look how you're reacting even now.

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,070
I couldn't just say I was your dad back then.

40
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,270
I said I'd see you again.

41
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,000
Why didn't you tell me last night then?

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,910
You were drunk and out of your mind.

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,140
- How could I say I'm your dad? - Stop saying that.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,040
You're a stress ball. You have rage within you.

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,670
You can't control your emotions.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
You get stressed out and can't sleep.

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,200
Then you get wrinkles and age.

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,300
Look here. I don't have many...

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,140
winkles I think.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,300
Are you asking me?

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,910
- You're stressed out and can't sleep... - A photo.

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,970
You must have a photo as proof.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,140
Stepdad, you should show me proof.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,870
Like a photograph.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,170
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,900
I think it was temporary loss of sight due to stress.

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,000
You get stressed very easily.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,240
When there is nothing noticeably wrong,

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,770
many question the diagnosis, but...

60
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,600
- Are you married? - Yes, I am.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,070
How did you register your marriage?

62
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,870
Did you go to a borough hall?

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,340
Do both people go?

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Don't you need witnesses?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
A person really needs to help others.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I helped a neighbor, and blessings came my way.

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,570
Let's enter into a contract.

68
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,870
What's the contract for?

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,540
Sell your land for half the price we had offered.

70
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,070
I'll buy it right now.

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,340
Here. Sign it.

72
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,170
You should've sold it sooner.

73
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,870
If Hong Na Ri goes to court, you can't rest assured.

74
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
So be satisfied with this price...

75
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,170
- and sell. - Goes to court for what?

76
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,570
To cancel the marriage and reclaim her inheritance...

77
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,440
Fraud... Shall I go on?

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,070
You want to sign with someone you think is a fraud?

79
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,270
It's not like you scammed me.

80
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,970
But legally, that land belongs to you.

81
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,140
Even if you give me 10 times your first offer,

82
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,740
I won't sell.

83
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,670
You must be obsessed with money.

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,970
Snap out of it. We'll get it eventually.

85
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,640
I don't know how you conned an old lady 30 years older.

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,900
- Watch your mouth! - Watch your mouth!

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,340
That was disrespectful toward my late mom.

88
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Apologize right this instant.

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,140
I didn't know you were listening.

90
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,870
- I'm sorry. - Is it my fault for hearing?

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,570
What kind of insincere and fake apology is that?

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm sorry. Sorry.

93
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,340
What were the test results?

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,140
There's nothing wrong.

95
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,170
Isn't that great?

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,900
Why is she angry at me instead of the con artist?

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,370
Let her lose the house, land and everything.

98
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,170
- Ms. Hong Na Ri. - Yes.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,940
Father? You should make your cons more believable.

100
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,470
Don't live like that.

101
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,500
You insulted my mom and me, you con artist!

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,400
I won't let you take my house. I'll protect it!

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,770
You don't belong in my house, but behind bars.

104
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,470
Let's go to the police. Let's go to the police!

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,040
Why you...

106
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,400
My mom said she had something to tell me.

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,300
Was that something about her getting married?

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,140
Do you really expect me to believe you?

109
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,740
Do you expect me to treat you like my stepdad?

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,670
No! I know my mom.

111
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,840
I'd never lose the house. We're strangers!

112
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,140
Get out of my house!

113
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,140
- Let's go. - What?

114
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,600
(Mother)

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
Hello, Mother.

116
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,070
Na Ri?

117
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,940
Are the invitations printed?

118
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,200
Dong Jin must be busy. He won't pick up.

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
You should've called us.

120
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,200
I'll tell Dong Jin to give you a call.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
- I can't talk right now. - You must be mid-flight.

122
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,070
- I'll talk to you later. - Okay.

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,470
Get in. You may look well, but you were just in the ER.

124
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,370
You saw correctly. I'm fine.

125
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,440
- Just leave. - Shin Jung Im...

126
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,240
is your mother, right?

127
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,470
- Do you know my mom? - Just get in.

128
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,040
How do you know my mom?

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,840
I wanted to buy her restaurant.

130
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,800
Do you sell dumplings?

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,700
Me? No.

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,300
I need that land.

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,040
- I'm sure she refused to sell. - She does.

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm sure she did.

135
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,700
If Mom refused to sell, so do I.

136
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,200
- I'm getting out. - Wake up.

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,340
It's not that you won't sell. You can't.

138
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,400
It's under Ko Nan Gil's name.

139
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,770
That punk really is a con artist and gigolo.

140
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,270
I didn't mean to insult you,

141
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,640
but you should assess the situation.

142
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,700
How could that be? That's absurd.

143
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,840
I've never seen him before. How could he...

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,140
She converted everything into joint ownership.

145
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,200
Isn't that odd?

146
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,040
She registered her marriage without telling her child.

147
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,870
She changed the deed. Then there was a car accident.

148
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,270
(Yangpyeong Pharmacy)

149
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,700
(Yangpyeong Pharmacy)

150
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,900
(Yangpyeong Pharmacy)

151
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,140
Think before you speak.

152
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,900
Let's be logical.

153
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,600
Do not get angry.

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,770
- Hello. - Where are you going?

155
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,900
- Hi. - Hello.

156
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,970
Let's eat!

157
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,370
- Welcome. - Hello.

158
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,940
Hello.

159
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,000
What are you doing? Come in.

160
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll put you in a quiet room with great scenery.

161
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,200
Scenery helps end a lovers' quarrel.

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,870
- No, we're father and... - Yes.

163
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,200
Thank you for the quiet room.

164
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,540
Okay. Come in.

165
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,670
Whether people think we're a couple or siblings,

166
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
don't correct them.

167
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,770
Don't ever say we're father and daughter again.

168
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,270
That's the source of stress.

169
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,240
You're worried about what others will think.

170
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,670
Why do you care what they think?

171
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,240
We're not a couple. We're not friends.

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,440
We're not siblings, either.

173
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,300
Lying because of other people...

174
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,500
How old are you?

175
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,370
You have a lot of rage. You must be stressed out.

176
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,640
How could you be so stressed that you can't see?

177
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,470
You're avoiding the question. Are you younger than me?

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,100
We don't need to discuss our age in our relationship.

179
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,300
Let's speak formally since the situations are unclear.

180
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,740
Please eat, take your medicine,

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,770
get stronger and go to Seoul.

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,840
Please go to a big hospital once you're there.

183
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,870
Eat well and sleep well.

184
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,100
Don't be stressed. Okay?

185
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,400
You want me to disappear from your sight because...

186
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,370
you feel guilty. Is that it? Not a chance.

187
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
I'll eat, take my medicine and get stronger.

188
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,140
And then we should talk.

189
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,500
Eat slowly. Chew it well.

190
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,770
If you keep acting like a dad, I'll get angry.

191
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,200
I can't say my daughter is my daughter.

192
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,670
She won't say her father is her father.

193
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,570
Do you think I'm joking?

194
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,940
Have you thought about how I'd feel?

195
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,300
What feelings?

196
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,540
Is it that you're upset about your mom's getting...

197
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,740
married without telling you?

198
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,440
- Did you have a ceremony? - Or...

199
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,900
is it that you're flustered because a stranger is...

200
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,100
living in the house you thought you'd inherit?

201
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,000
Dong Jin.

202
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,670
You look pretty.

203
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,270
I must look pretty because it's been a while.

204
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,540
- Were you surprised that I wanted to meet? - No.

205
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,340
I should've called first.

206
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,240
- I'm sorry. - Don't say things like that.

207
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,800
I asked to meet during lunch to keep it brief.

208
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,570
I don't think we ended it properly.

209
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,640
And I wondered what the status was...

210
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,470
with Na Ri.

211
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,140
That's right. Na Ri was in the ER.

212
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
I need to go.

213
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,500
What? Why?

214
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,200
Is she sick?

215
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,340
No. You should go.

216
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,800
- Go. - Okay.

217
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,300
Wait here. I'll drop you off on the way.

218
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,000
- No, it's okay. - It's okay.

219
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,070
Darn it. She's playing dirty.

220
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,440
How is it not shocking?

221
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,700
I can understand that my mom married a young man...

222
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,100
and she gave him everything she had.

223
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,170
If she were alive, I could understand it all,

224
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,500
but it's too strange.

225
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,770
I can't accept it.

226
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,600
If she were alive...

227
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,340
Sure.

228
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,970
I say that several times a day.

229
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,040
Every single day.

230
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,200
I know too well that there are cars...

231
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,900
that drive recklessly.

232
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,240
Why did she have to be there?

233
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,500
My mom said she wanted to tell me something in person.

234
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,470
I kept making excuses that I was busy...

235
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,400
and didn't go home.

236
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,300
Was this what my mom...

237
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,340
wanted to tell me?

238
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Probably.

239
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,000
Answer honestly to my questions.

240
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,570
No.

241
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,570
If I must lie, I won't answer.

242
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,940
Did my mom talk about me?

243
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,870
Not really.

244
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,240
How long have you worked at our dumpling place?

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,700
- It was before we registered our marriage... - So?

246
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,900
You happened to go to a dumpling place in the boonies,

247
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,570
happened to work there...

248
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,900
and happened to meet my mom and marry her.

249
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,170
- Is that it? - No.

250
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,970
I was predestined to meet her.

251
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,400
Then why did I never see you?

252
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,900
You came at night or when the restaurant was closed.

253
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,970
And when you came, all you did was sleep in your room.

254
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,070
- I avoided you sometimes. - Why did you avoid me?

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,370
Do you still go to my mom?

256
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,140
I go often during her favorite hours.

257
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,000
I like these hours the best.

258
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,870
It's awkward to start anything. You feel awkward.

259
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,870
You don't know if you're feeling hungry.

260
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,600
You feel like someone will come or not.

261
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,270
It's time for the tofu seller to come.

262
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,770
Na Ri, let's go down a little later.

263
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,840
Na Ri!

264
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,040
- Snake! - Where? Where?

265
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,870
Snake. Snake! Over there!

266
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,800
Where? Where?

267
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,170
Did you marry her because you were in love?

268
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,870
Time's up.

269
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,800
You're not answering instead of lying.

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,870
I married her because I was in love.

271
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,570
She didn't show it at work, but it must've been hard.

272
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,170
What's wrong with her?

273
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,970
I didn't hear from her directly, so...

274
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
Then who called you?

275
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,670
I don't know who, but I was told she left the ER...

276
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,240
and to just come home.

277
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm glad. I guess it wasn't that serious.

278
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,470
Dong Jin.

279
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,340
What?

280
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,010
If I ask you to stay with me for a little while longer,

281
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,510
can you do that for me?

282
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,740
With you?

283
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,070
You're swaying. Stupid.

284
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,070
I wanted to say that just once.

285
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Be good to Na Ri.

286
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,170
Don't cheat on her again.

287
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,300
All I need is to see your face from time to time.

288
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,940
Can't we do that, either?

289
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
We can just make sure we don't get caught.

290
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
What?

291
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,240
Well, that is... Sure.

292
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,570
We can be careful. Yes.

293
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,840
That's right, but...

294
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,240
I'd feel too bad.

295
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,010
Never mind.

296
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,400
I have no pride.

297
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,370
I don't want to hurt any more, either.

298
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,440
Thank you for everything.

299
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,870
Bye.

300
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Hey...

301
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,970
I... Yeo Joo...

302
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,510
Yeo Joo! Wait.

303
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,240
What did you do with Mom's things?

304
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,510
- I took care of them. - That's my job.

305
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,640
- The father comes first. - Stop saying that!

306
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,940
You won't admit your father is your father.

307
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,100
(Hong Dumplings)

308
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,100
Are these people lined up to buy dumplings?

309
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,540
Boss. Is everything okay?

310
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,100
Is everything okay?

311
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,540
You're okay.

312
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,200
Yes.

313
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,870
Right? The boss' daughter.

314
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,370
Gosh!

315
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,470
Boss said his daughter was coming and waited every day.

316
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,440
You came super late with a bang.

317
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,240
But thank you.

318
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,010
I heard you're a stewardess.

319
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,640
I knew I'd meet a stewardess someday.

320
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,840
- Then are you close to junior stewardesses? - No.

321
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,300
My junior stewardess is my enemy.

322
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,100
What are you doing? Prepare the boxes.

323
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,440
Do it.

324
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,010
My hands are sore.

325
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,200
Don't do it. Go in. Go in.

326
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,570
I said to go in.

327
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,970
What a daughter's daddy!

328
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,570
Boss said his daughter was coming and waited every day.

329
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,100
That punk really is a con artist and gigolo.

330
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,800
That's right. I'm sure you're hiding a lot of things.

331
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,540
The layout changed.

332
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,370
So this is a bedroom now. It's big.

333
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,640
Gosh, that hurts.

334
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,900
Get out.

335
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,740
What is that?

336
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,100
Is she kneading the dough because she's family?

337
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,240
Throw these out.

338
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,470
They're tainted, so throw them out!

339
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
- Throw them out. - Tainted?

340
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,070
He's overreacting.

341
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,840
Wow. There's so much tension between them.

342
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,000
Hey...

343
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,540
Don't go in there again.

344
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,800
Why isn't it coming off?

345
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,240
What were you looking for in my room?

346
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,340
- What will make you feel better? - Mom's phone.

347
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,700
I told you I put her things away.

348
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,640
You're not looking for her phone.

349
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,400
You probably want proof that I'm a con artist.

350
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,700
But you won't find any because I'm not.

351
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,740
Good people living average lives...

352
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,540
don't lock their desk drawers like you.

353
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,800
Why did you bring a shovel?

354
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,140
Your uncle can't be reached,

355
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,870
and you thought your house was abandoned.

356
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,370
You lived here, so you know how quickly the weeds grow.

357
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,570
That's why you bought a shovel.

358
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,470
You were drunk, so you bought a huge one.

359
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,970
But that wouldn't have sufficed.

360
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,600
A vacant house crumbles quickly.

361
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,770
It knows that it has been abandoned.

362
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,000
Are you saying I abandoned this house?

363
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,940
Uncle said he'd look after it and I needed time.

364
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,800
What did you do while seasons changed?

365
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,140
You must accept certain things even if it's hard.

366
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,840
Even if you find something on me, it won't change...

367
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,500
the fact that I'm your father and the house is mine.

368
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,440
Your last name is Ko and mine is Hong.

369
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,740
Stop saying you're my father. We're strangers.

370
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,940
You were quick just as I wanted.

371
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,670
- Then you can just leave. - Why would I leave?

372
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,670
Why would strangers live together?

373
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,740
- I'm Mom's only family. - No, I am.

374
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,340
Hong Dumplings was for Hong Na Ri.

375
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,140
Since I run it, I'm your father.

376
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,870
To be more exact, I'm your stepdad.

377
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,700
You seem strong now. Why don't you make dinner?

378
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,900
I'm going to bring a guest.

379
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,670
Were you talking to me?

380
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,370
I have everything you need in the refrigerator,

381
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,200
so I look forward to seeing...

382
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500
your cooking skills.

383
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,270
Our chairman is so good at evading taxes.

384
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
A robot museum.

385
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,670
Isn't that romantic?

386
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,270
We still haven't received the grant in certain areas.

387
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,940
It's too soon to start the resort business.

388
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,100
Just do it. We need to create waves so they'd give...

389
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,370
permission to prevent conglomerates...

390
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,800
from going bankrupt.

391
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,940
That's it. This was the look she gave me.

392
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,870
It was like I made her sick.

393
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,040
You know...

394
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,640
what kind of person I am, so I understand.

395
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,700
But it isn't easy to think that after just meeting me.

396
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,300
Especially women near that age.

397
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,400
She must know what you see isn't all.

398
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,270
I know I'm annoying and a scumbag.

399
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,470
That's why I hide it so well. I fool myself at times.

400
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,600
Look into that unique woman.

401
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,470
Her name is Hong Na Ri. She's Hong Dumplings' daughter.

402
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,940
"I look forward to seeing your cooking"?

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,070
Why that...

404
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,540
What am I doing?

405
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,970
Am I really going to do it?

406
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,670
Mom, please clean.

407
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,470
What a neat-freak. He's like a master in organizing.

408
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,170
- Mom! - Gosh!

409
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,540
You startled me. What?

410
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,170
What's wrong with the refrigerator?

411
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,140
Don't change so suddenly. It's scary!

412
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,800
I... I didn't do that.

413
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,570
People don't change that easily. Don't worry.

414
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,900
Mom,

415
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,840
is this situation for real?

416
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,770
Did he think I couldn't do it?

417
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,270
What's with the suit?

418
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,870
No.

419
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,000
He is my stepdad. He is my stepdad.

420
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,540
He is my stepdad.

421
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,770
Well... Father...

422
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,240
Dinner's ready.

423
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,840
The guest is being late. Would you like to wait longer?

424
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,640
- Aren't you hungry? - Excuse me?

425
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,500
No. Let's wait a while longer.

426
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,600
Would you like a drink while waiting?

427
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,200
What's with her?

428
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,270
- Is it an important guest? - Of course.

429
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,300
My mom could only grow weeds. You're not bad.

430
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,670
The garden is her style.

431
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,900
She liked baby's breath, too.

432
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
They're buckwheat flowers.

433
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,200
What? I see, buckwheat flowers.

434
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,570
Your tie got loosened.

435
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,340
I've decided to accept you.

436
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,540
I trust Mom's choice.

437
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,270
I felt like she had a secret.

438
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,800
If I had been a better daughter,

439
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,240
she probably would've told me first.

440
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,740
You were a good daughter. She said you were the best.

441
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,270
That's nice to hear.

442
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,100
Let's get along.

443
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,500
It's not like we'll see each other often, though.

444
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,940
Na Ri. What are you doing?

445
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,540
Here's my son-in-law!

446
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,970
I'm glad you came.

447
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,670
Son-in-law?

448
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,770
The funeral. The fixer.

449
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,240
The fixer?

450
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,740
I thought you worked at the funeral place.

451
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,140
You were family.

452
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,000
No wonder you worked so hard.

453
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,540
- Why are you here? - Are you okay?

454
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,470
- I heard you went to the ER. - How did you know?

455
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,140
I called him.

456
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,370
So you're the one who called.

457
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,700
But did you just talk down to Na Ri...

458
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,800
Who gave you his number? Did you go through my phone?

459
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
I got his business card at the funeral.

460
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,500
- Why do you keep talking down... - Regardless.

461
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,100
How could you do this without asking?

462
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,200
Watch what you say.

463
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,740
What's going on?

464
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,270
Is something wrong?

465
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,870
Why do you keep talking down...

466
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,270
He worked hard at the funeral like family.

467
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,770
Everyone considers him family.

468
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,140
He's the one person you can lean on.

469
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,900
He should know you went to the ER.

470
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,740
I have no desire to lean on anyone.

471
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,740
Why are you speaking formally...

472
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,000
Did you make a big mistake?

473
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,270
What?

474
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,440
- Why is he talking down to me? - Stay out of it.

475
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,870
- Just leave. - No. Take her with you.

476
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,270
"Take her with you"? Are you talking to me?

477
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,900
Take her to a big hospital in Seoul to get tested.

478
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,670
They say it's stress. Don't stress her out...

479
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,800
I said no. What kind of father does that?

480
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,370
- Why you... - Father?

481
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,700
I said no, so don't do this again.

482
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,340
It's none of your business.

483
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,800
Leave.

484
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,040
- Why that... - Hey, you!

485
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,200
What did you do?

486
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,170
I'm sorry about calling...

487
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,500
without asking.

488
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,270
I said I'd accept you out of my trust for my mom.

489
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,740
If you're my father, you should at least punch him.

490
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,040
Excuse me.

491
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,270
I don't understand what's going on.

492
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,770
Would you explain it to me?

493
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,370
You should leave for today.

494
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,410
Na Ri, are you stupid?

495
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,340
- You're just so stupid! - How dare you come in here?

496
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,840
Fine.

497
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,240
I know you're angry, but let me talk.

498
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
Stay out of my business and leave.

499
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,270
How could I not care?

500
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,000
Was she out of her mind?

501
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,340
Whom are you talking about?

502
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,770
He seduced your innocent mother.

503
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,600
He's obviously a con artist!

504
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,940
Are you stupid? Why are you being polite to him?

505
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,170
What does he want? Does he want money?

506
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,200
Does he plan to live here?

507
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,540
What? Why are you packing?

508
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,870
Did he say this is his house? Did he tell you to leave?

509
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,410
- Why that... - Stay out of it.

510
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,140
And don't insult my mom. I trust her.

511
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,240
You're pathetic.

512
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
You know.

513
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,870
You feel it too.

514
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,670
It's obvious to anyone.

515
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,770
Your mother fell for a young gigolo!

516
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,040
Did your mother really die in a car accident?

517
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,940
Do you know how the accident occurred?

518
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,200
What about your uncle?

519
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Since when did you lose touch with him?

520
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,600
(Are you in a meeting? I feel bad.)

521
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,340
Why is she texting in pieces?

522
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,370
(How's Na Ri? Is she okay? Call me after.)

523
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,070
It must be going well. You're texting while exercising.

524
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,140
No.

525
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,070
He lied that he had a meeting...

526
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,070
and went to see his old girlfriend.

527
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,470
- I played dumb. - But you look happy.

528
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,070
He's lying to me.

529
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,540
What do you mean?

530
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:15,370
He used to talk about his girlfriend openly.

531
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,270
That meant I couldn't call when he was with her.

532
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,240
But now, he's lying to me.

533
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm his first now.

534
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,370
Lucky you. You're his first.

535
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,500
Please leave.

536
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,540
Hold on. Do you know how much this house is worth?

537
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,910
Are you here to valuate our house?

538
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,570
This is a hot spot.

539
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,670
Resorts are lined up to develop this area.

540
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,940
He knew that and conned her.

541
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,410
He planned it from the start. Hey. Wait.

542
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,170
What about the 30,000 dollars?

543
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,640
- I'll pay you back. - Why would you pay for that?

544
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,240
This house is yours.

545
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,540
Even if you end it with me, protect this house.

546
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,670
Did you say you trust your mom's choice?

547
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
Don't be so naive.

548
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,170
Your mom and you were fooled because of that!

549
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,240
What is it?

550
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,970
Come and eat so you can take your medicine.

551
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,240
Okay.

552
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,440
Hey. You.

553
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,140
You overheard us, didn't you?

554
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,700
You feel guilty, don't you?

555
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,910
You chose the wrong target for your con.

556
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,910
Do you know how many lawyers and judges I know?

557
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,070
I don't care, so I won't ask.

558
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,670
Not at all.

559
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,070
I'm going to go knead.

560
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,040
Don't even try.

561
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,940
Pack your things and get out, you con artist gigolo!

562
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,670
Who is she?

563
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,910
It's my building. I told you not to lock your door.

564
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,570
I heard you're skipping school.

565
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,170
It's your life, so I don't really care.

566
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,800
But come to think of it, I need to take over this town.

567
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,270
I'm pretty famous.

568
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,470
So my sister can't be like this.

569
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,700
I'm confiscating this. Why?

570
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,970
Because you didn't buy anything in here.

571
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,270
Each time you miss class, I'll confiscate each item.

572
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,740
Let's negotiate.

573
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,670
- Okay. - I get one warning and you return it.

574
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,700
- Today is a warning. - Fine. Today is a warning.

575
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,340
But if you skip again, you and this room are gone.

576
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,800
This is what you call a negotiation. Or a threat.

577
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,300
I'm going to Seoul.

578
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,140
Don't try anything or you're dead.

579
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,570
Let's get along.

580
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,910
Oh my gosh.

581
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,170
- Give me your number. - Okay.

582
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,300
What do you do when you miss Mom?

583
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,300
I close my eyes...

584
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,500
and say, "I miss you." Then I see her.

585
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,500
She's always smiling.

586
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,600
I'm going to catch the last bus.

587
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,300
Good.

588
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,840
- You look happy that I'm leaving. - No, not at all.

589
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,240
- I'll pick up my things later. - Okay, okay.

590
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,040
No, I mean... You can leave them.

591
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,070
Go to a hospital in Seoul. Don't be stressed.

592
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,570
Eat and sleep well.

593
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,840
Look at you. You have dark circles, your skin is dry,

594
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,970
and you have wrinkles...

595
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,640
Stop talking about wrinkles! That's stressful.

596
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,940
Wait. Wait.

597
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,170
Wait. Wait right there.

598
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,870
- Get in. - No.

599
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,540
I was wrong.

600
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,270
But you broke up with me like you were waiting.

601
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,440
Isn't it embarrassing to say that?

602
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,570
Tell your mother it's over, and take her calls.

603
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,600
I regretted not calling the most.

604
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,000
You act like you're so smart.

605
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,640
You'll never earn this much money.

606
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,540
- Is this a joke to you? - Are you upset...

607
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,040
because it was almost yours?

608
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,070
Get your head on straight.

609
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,000
It was your mom's, so it's yours.

610
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,100
- Your mom would want you to have it. - Who cares?

611
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,970
- Stop being so materialistic! - What? Materialistic?

612
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,740
Pay back my 30,000 dollars then. Right now.

613
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,140
Pay it back first.

614
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,740
What are you doing?

615
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,370
- Na Ri? - Do you know him?

616
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,400
What is it this time?

617
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,140
Darn it.

618
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,200
What is it?

619
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,240
The entire neighborhood will be here soon.

620
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,740
- What is it? - Dumplings.

621
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,740
Wow, is that a parent's love?

622
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,670
You need to eat home cooking to fight insomnia,

623
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,240
stress, dark circles,

624
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,300
- and wrinkles. - Enough already.

625
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,770
Hold on. Home cooking should include...

626
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,340
rice, soup, side dishes, and all.

627
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,540
Dumplings from Hong Dumplings isn't home cooking.

628
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,440
It's Hong Na Ri's Hong Dumplings, so it's home cooking.

629
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,470
Hey. If you're headed to Seoul,

630
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,240
why don't you give her a ride?

631
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,370
Are you going to Seoul? Sure.

632
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:53,970
Get in.

633
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,000
What's going on?

634
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,500
Why is he taking my girlfriend?

635
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,700
That texting man worries me.

636
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,970
Your stepfather looked like he was going to kill him...

637
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,470
after sending the two of us away.

638
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,800
- Who is he? - Someone who can die.

639
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,000
Don't try to find out.

640
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,600
I was being creative, but you evaded it.

641
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,600
"Who was that man?"

642
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's boring to ask straightforward like that.

643
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,070
Drop me off there.

644
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,740
I can't do that. Your stepfather asked me to take you.

645
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,300
Fine then. I didn't really want to get out anyway.

646
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,900
I was tired.

647
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,970
I'll be quiet. You can drive.

648
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,100
I delivered you in my car twice in one day.

649
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,470
- Aren't you thankful? - Thank you.

650
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,200
I won't stop at a rest stop.

651
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,970
I hate places with people, food, and bathroom smells...

652
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,700
mixed in together.

653
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,940
30,000 dollars.

654
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,570
I'll pay it back.

655
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,170
So don't show your face in front of Na Ri again.

656
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,200
Got it?

657
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,370
I'll take the cup for you.

658
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,470
I'll take the cup for you.

659
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,000
Na Ri.

660
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,500
- Did you really break up? - Yes.

661
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,540
That witch is quick.

662
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,100
- What do you mean? - During the company dinner,

663
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,300
Yeo Joo said you broke up for certain.

664
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,800
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

665
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,570
- Here's our gift. - Lucky you.

666
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,400
This is 98 dollars, right?

667
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,840
I still have some, so I'm going to swap for the men's.

668
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,040
You're such a devoted girlfriend.

669
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,970
- Is it for your nine-year boyfriend? - No comment.

670
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,140
Yeo Joo. Did you say my boyfriend and I broke up?

671
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,940
How did I break up? You seem to know.

672
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,640
No, I never said that.

673
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,270
Yes, you did.

674
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,270
(Stress causes insomnia.)

675
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,800
(Things to avoid before going to bed)

676
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,600
He sends at least one a day.

677
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,970
He nags so much. He's worse than Mom.

678
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,070
(Uncle)

679
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,570
The phone has been turned off. Please leave...

680
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,800
(I know about the money, so come on Mom's anniversary.)

681
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,840
(Message sent)

682
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,100
Hello?

683
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,870
Hello?

684
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,370
- Na Ri. - Uncle.

685
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,700
I'm sorry.

686
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,540
I'm sorry to your mom, too.

687
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,900
Where are you? I pulled out all the weeds in your yard.

688
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,970
Let's talk in person.

689
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,140
I don't think I'll make it on her anniversary.

690
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,140
- I'm sorry, Na Ri. - Uncle! Uncle!

691
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,070
The person who just called...

692
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,700
What? What did you say?

693
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,800
I can't hear you!

694
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,200
Where are you?

695
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,400
Here? This is Seulgi Supermarket.

696
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,500
Seulgi Supermarket?

697
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,070
(Seulgi Supermarket)

698
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,600
Thank you.

699
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,140
- Hello. - Let's drink.

700
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,170
Is Uncle Jung Nam here?

701
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,140
What? He left.

702
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,470
- He left. - Thank you.

703
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,470
No one seems to be home.

704
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,900
Don't be scared. It's me.

705
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,440
Go home.

706
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,000
- Uncle is back. - I got it,

707
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,800
so go home.

708
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,570
Hey, Nan Gil. Long time no see.

709
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,440
Why are you traveling in a herd?

710
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,300
Do I still scare you that much?

711
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,000
The boys were curious about the legend.

712
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,000
Say, "Hi."

713
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,670
- Hello, Sir! - Hello, Sir!

714
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,270
What are you trying to do?

715
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,370
I heard Shin Jung Nam is back.

716
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,240
Who tells you things like that?

717
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,540
Do you have a mole here?

718
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,300
Let's trust each other, please.

719
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,040
(Hong Dumplings)

720
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,870
- Who was that? - What?

721
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,340
You didn't forget.

722
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,970
You know how precious food containers are.

723
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,170
Who were those men by my uncle's house?

724
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,900
Guys like that don't usually say who they are.

725
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,970
Why do they always wear suits?

726
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,170
He was your friend. "Hey. Nan Gil. Long time no see."

727
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,470
He seemed happy to see you.

728
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Those guys are like that once they know your name.

729
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,440
Hey, Nan Gil. Hey, Na Ri!

730
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,670
Hey. Long time no see.

731
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,200
- Was Uncle here? - No.

732
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,940
- He went to the supermarket and not here? - No.

733
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,600
You married my mom...

734
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,440
No.

735
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,070
Anyway, do you not know my uncle well?

736
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,200
My mom looked after him so much.

737
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,270
I want to look after him, but he isn't here.

738
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:00,440
KoreanDramaX.com

739
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,840
Is he on the run? How much does he owe?

740
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,800
I sent so many nice writings,

741
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,770
but you still can't control your rage.

742
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,140
- So tell me! - Yes, he's on the run!

743
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,400
- You said you weren't close. - I never said that.

744
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,740
- You're in touch with him, aren't you? - No.

745
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,540
- Do you lend him money and stuff? - No, no.

746
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,400
How much does he owe?

747
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,840
Tell him to just sell his house!

748
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,970
You're so extreme. Seriously.

749
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,070
Does he owe more than the value of the house?

750
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,070
They say those debts grow like snowballs.

751
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,840
What will we do about my uncle?

752
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,070
Discard him.

753
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,170
Just discard him.

754
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,740
He's your mom's brother, so I'll take care of him.

755
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,440
You discard him from that brain of yours.

756
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,440
Don't say your back hurts or you can't see again.

757
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,600
Go in and rest. I have to knead dough.

758
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,140
You're always kneading dough.

759
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,970
I sell dumplings. Kneading is my life!

760
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,100
I should go knead. Knead!

761
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,170
He isn't kneading.

762
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,670
I told you never to call.

763
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,600
Why did you come here?

764
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,270
I told you never to step foot here again.

765
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,440
It's my final warning.

766
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,640
If you do this again,

767
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,640
I can't say what will happen to you.

768
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,940
You know I always keep my word.

769
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,740
(Sweet Stranger and Me)

770
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,100
Na Ri, Nan Gil is a bad man.

771
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,340
You're so stiff. Why do you trust him?

772
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,240
You can't fake your expressions. I trust that.

773
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:26,370
No, this is all an act. Don't believe anything.

774
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,940
Did she say I'm a gold digger and a con artist?

775
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,840
No. There's a money matter remaining.

776
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,700
Did she borrow money from you? I'll go with you.

777
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,570
It may get dirty. It's all about money.

778
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,270
They may degrade your mother and family.

779
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,900
I came to see your daughter.

780
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,500
Duk Bong! Come inside. Come in.

781
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,870
May I go in my room then?

782
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,770
What does your father do?

783
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,000
Do you have siblings? Do you come from a happy family?

784
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,300
Look, Nan Gil.

785
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Father!

786
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,270
What? Do you want some water?
