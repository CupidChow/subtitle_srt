1
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,633
I told you never to call.

2
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:48,733
Why did you come here?

3
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,333
I told you never to step foot here again.

4
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:56,533
It's my final warning.

5
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,663
If you do this again,

6
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:02,703
I can't say...

7
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,733
what will happen to you.

8
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,933
You know I always keep my word.

9
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,903
You decided to accept him as your stepdad?

10
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,503
Na Ri, Nan Gil is a bad man.

11
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,832
Sure, let's say he married
your mother for love.

12
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,933
Then he should leave now.

13
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:51,032
Will that young man live
alone, missing your mom?

14
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:53,503
In that house? No, he won't.

15
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,503
Get your house back. I'll help you.

16
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,703
Let's give him money to leave.

17
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:59,733
He'll leave when he feels like it.

18
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,033
You are so frustrating.

19
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:05,662
He looks like a total
con artist in my eyes.

20
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,363
Why do you trust him?

21
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,663
You and your mom must have
the same taste in men.

22
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,733
Sorry. My bad.

23
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,363
I was out of line.

24
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,063
Not everyone on the plane is
happily going on vacation.

25
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,203
Some are forced to go away on business.

26
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,932
Some are sad to leave a loved one.

27
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,503
Some had an unhappy trip.
Everyone has a story.

28
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:36,203
Now, I can read their face expressions...

29
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,733
because you can't hide that.

30
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:44,163
I trust the photos my mom took with him.
Their smiles.

31
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:47,603
- Their expressions.
- You trust their expressions?

32
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,763
Wow. That's the best thing I've heard.

33
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:55,303
Do you know how easy it is
to act like a good person?

34
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:59,203
Bad people know they're
bad, so they must act good.

35
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,102
Act selfless, smile a
lot, and act innocent.

36
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,203
It's all an act.

37
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:06,333
Nan Gil's expression is
that of a con artist.

38
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,933
Why do you hate him so much?

39
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,703
Did something happen between you?

40
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,803
He'll show his true colors soon.

41
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,663
Come see me. I studied law.

42
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,033
Let's drop in on him...

43
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:24,833
and see his real face behind the mask.

44
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:50,433
It's me.

45
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,763
- What?
- I'm coming in.

46
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,003
No! No! Wait!

47
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,102
- No! Wait!
- Oh my gosh!

48
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,333
I said no!

49
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:02,363
Get dressed.

50
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:11,402
You have unique taste when you're alone.
That's weird.

51
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:14,132
It isn't weird at all.
This is how I knead dough.

52
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,463
What is it?

53
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,863
Someone gave me men's lotions,
but I don't need them.

54
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,863
Thank...

55
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,963
Thanks. Go now.

56
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,202
Aren't you going to open it?
I hope you like it.

57
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,203
- I like it for certain.
- What is it?

58
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,333
You said it's lotion.

59
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,063
Gifts are the best!

60
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,663
I like it, so go.

61
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,703
That's not right.

62
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:47,503
You should open a gift
in front of the giver.

63
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,033
Go on.

64
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,263
Are you throwing away my gift?

65
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,873
Well, if you don't like it...

66
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,403
No, no.

67
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,633
Why do you keep saying, "No"?

68
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:43,933
What is that look?

69
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:46,633
I like it, so...

70
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:51,373
It feels... You know.

71
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:55,903
So... Well...

72
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,633
So what?

73
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:02,633
It's like a parent getting
a gift from his child.

74
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,003
Why do you think Uncle used
Seulgi Supermarket's phone?

75
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,503
I would've come here instead.

76
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,873
There's something between you two, right?

77
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:26,663
Thanks for the gift, but
you should go rest.

78
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,133
- I have to knead dough.
- "I have to knead dough."

79
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,733
Is that all you say?

80
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,603
You didn't answer.

81
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:35,063
You said you don't answer
when you need to lie.

82
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:38,403
I'm right. I am. You won't...

83
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,063
Just go.

84
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:09,103
Let's be proper with one another. Bye!

85
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,703
I have the right to know
what happened to Uncle!

86
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,803
No, this is an act.

87
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,103
He left it there on purpose for me to see.

88
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,903
Don't believe anything any more.

89
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:22,803
You said you'd trust me.

90
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,633
What are you looking for?
What do you want to know?

91
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,463
I want to know what you're like.

92
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,733
You do? Then I'll tell you.

93
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,463
I'm Ko Nan Gil.

94
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:37,603
Ko Nan Gil.

95
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,263
Does that remind you of anything?

96
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,733
- Don't you remember at all?
- Ko Nan Gil.

97
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,133
Ko Nan Gil. Ko Nan Gil?

98
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,203
Who is Ko Nan Gil? Who are you?

99
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,533
I am your father.

100
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,063
Ko Nan Gil?

101
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,033
Ko Nan Gil.

102
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,433
Let's see.

103
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:01,503
Na Ri?

104
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,933
I need to hurry back.

105
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:08,563
You're right. Your style is humiliating.
Hurry back.

106
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,503
You said you studied law.

107
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:16,502
Do you have a license or anything?

108
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:17,733
A license?

109
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,632
I passed the bar exam with top scores.

110
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,303
- Then why are you here?
- It just wasn't my type.

111
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:27,103
I didn't like how prosecutors
always see bad people.

112
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:30,063
I didn't like how lawyers
deal with whining clients.

113
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:33,602
Why are you offering to help me?

114
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,973
Did I say I'd help? When?

115
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,433
I'm not the helping type.

116
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:41,763
I said to create a win-win situation. Come.

117
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,663
Come with me.

118
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,863
No way.

119
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,833
Look. Here's the Hong Dumplings.

120
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,063
It's the only access way.

121
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,863
Did you get how much I want this land?

122
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:23,623
I guess Uncle Jung Nam has
something to do with this.

123
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:25,333
Your uncle?

124
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,263
Why do you think he's on the
run when he has his home?

125
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,603
Money issue or a threat?

126
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:32,133
Gosh, you have no idea about this.

127
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,232
Think about it. Your uncle's house.
Hong Dumplings.

All of them were your mom's before,

00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,303
but now, they all belong to Nan Gil.

131
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,463
That's impossible.

132
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,803
My mom never told me this before.

133
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,933
Even my dad doesn't tell
me about his possessions.

134
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,162
We never hid anything from each other.

135
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,733
Don't feel bad.

136
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,032
Parents don't share their
secrets with their kids,

137
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,933

how he became your stepdad...

143

or whether he's good.

144
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,933
All that matters is money.

145
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,962
He may try to kick you out
without paying any money.

146
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:31,832
Then you may hold your ground against him,

147

asking for compensation.

you when you were born?"

182
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:16,903
"You and your dumplings are so perfect."

183
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,533
Goodness! He flirts around every girl.

184
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,433
My goodness.

185
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,163
Hi, how are you?

186
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,463
Can you give me... "Cli Royal"...

187
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,033
"Cli Royal Dimple"?

188
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:06,833
- I've never heard of this.
- It's for back pain.

189
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,033
Hello.

190
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,232
Please give me Cli Royal Dimple.

191
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,633
- "Cli Royal Dimple"?
- Yes.

192
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,403
- We don't have this kind of medicine.
- What?

193
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,503
Okay. Thanks.

194
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:22,303
(Pharmacy)

195
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:37,333
Excuse me, Sir?

196
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,563
Do you know what this medicine is?

197
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,233
"Cli Royal Dimple"?

198
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,903
- I've never heard it before.
- Sorry?

199
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,033
- Do you know this?
- No.

200
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,932
Why don't you call and check it once again?

201
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,263
(Caution! 3 times of
failed password attempts)

202
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,763
That's okay.

203
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,703
I don't think I need to. Thanks anyway.

204
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,003
Since when the warehouse was locked?

205
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,963
He has so many secrets.

206
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:41,063
(Best Employee of the Month)

207
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,603
You're not on my side. Why
are you showing it to me?

208
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,463
It looks like he's investigating on you.

209
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,203
You don't want to reveal your past, do you?

210
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,833
Just leave.

211
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,363
Are you worrying about me?
What's gotten into you?

212
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:01,083
Do you really want to live like this?

213
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,332
You're still young. Just
leave and live your life.

214
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,263
Don't put yourself into
someone else's life.

215
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,633
This is how I live my life.

216
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,832
I'm really doing great...

217
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,673
and I can't even waste a single second.

218
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,133
And this is not about
others, but my family.

219
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:20,173
Why that...

220
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,263
Duk Shim!

221
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,002
You'd better walk.

222
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:38,763
Get another bike if it's hard to walk.

223
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:42,333
Hey, I hear you were born rich.
Treat me sometimes.

224
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,333
You look pretty.

225
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,303
- Look at you.
- Where did you get this?

226
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,562
Duk Shim, where did you get your bag?

227
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,403
- Are you going to buy a bike?
- Hey, tell me.

228
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,233
- Hey, can I try your headset on?
- Duk Shim!

229
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:57,033
- I'm sure she can walk home.
- Let's go.

230
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,213
- Let's play a computer game.
- Shall we eat pizza?

231
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:08,333
Hey.

232
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:09,733
Excuse me.

233
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,673
I remember you riding a nice bike before.
Where is it?

234
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,033
Hey, you know it's a very high skill...

235
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,033
to go slowly on your bike, right?

236
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:24,563
Check this out.

237
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,063
Gosh.

238
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,563
I think I saw your bike somewhere.

239
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,533
The used bike store in the town has it.

240
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:41,853
You didn't sell it, did you?

241
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:47,833
You're so shy.

242
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,933
I'm a bad... No, I'm not a bad guy.

243
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:52,833
See?

244
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:54,503
You look great when smiling.

245
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,093
Once you start losing things from them,

246
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,633
there will be no end...

247
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:05,053
because those who take
don't have a conscience.

248
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:08,463
Come to me if you want your bike back.

249
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,073
You know Hong Dumplings, right?

250
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,203
Okay. Bye.

251
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,433
Once I start losing things,

252
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:30,333
there will be no end...

253
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:36,433
because those who take
don't have a conscience.

254
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,103
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

255
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:50,363
- You look good.
- Do I?

256
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,633
(Na Ri)

257
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,933
I'll get the coffee. Answer the call.

258
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,433
What if Na Ri is in the ER again?

259
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,063
Just a minute.

260
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,933
Hi, Na Ri.

261
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:14,833
- Can you talk now?
- What?

262
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,132
Yes, I'm good.

263
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,533
If you want your 30,000
dollars back, cooperate.

264
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,863
- Cooperate?
- Today is Mom's anniversary.

265
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,733
I'm sorry for not remembering.

266
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,133
You need me.

267
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:36,263
Don't even try. I know
you're still dating Yeo Joo.

268
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:40,663
I said to cooperate. You
can do that much for me.

269
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:43,333
Come and have some drinks.

270
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,363
- Drinks?
- Make him drink until he's about to die.

271
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,732
Make him pass out.

272
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,163
Pass out? Who?

273
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,633
That gold digger? The con artist?

274
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,033
Sure. Okay.

275
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,803
Okay.

276
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,033
Oh my gosh.

277
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,433
Did Na Ri call me a gold digger?

278
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,533
- Did she call me a con artist?
- No.

279
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,563
There's someone.

280
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,263
Today is the anniversary
of her mom's death,

281
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,733
but she has no one by her side.

282
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,303
I think she needs me.

283
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,933
I don't want to cry. This isn't right.

284
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:42,633
I think we should end it.

285
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:47,303
I trusted her when she said it was over.

286
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:51,563
That's why I put up with her picking on me,

287
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,633
but it wasn't over.

288
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:01,063
I understand.

289
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:06,533
I'm sure it isn't easy to end it with you.

290
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,363
I understand...

291
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,163
her, too.

292
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:15,733
No, there's a money...

293
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,203
Well,

294
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:20,603
it's about the money.

295
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,533
Na Ri borrowed money from you?

296
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:29,963
Let's go.

297
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,863
She has no one by her side. You should go.

298
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:34,733
I'll go with you.

299
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,533
No.

300
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:40,433
It's not right that you go there.

301
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:45,003
I'm not that bad. I'll wait in the car.

302
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:47,333
I'll be fine alone.

303
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:51,233
I can read a book and listen
to music for a few hours.

304
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:52,463
Yeo Joo.

305
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:54,603
I'll go alone.

306
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,733
I'm here!

307
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,003
Are you asleep?

308
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,333
Are you still very sick?

309
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,363
I'm coming in!

310
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,003
Are you back?

311
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:56,163
They have no such drug.
Maybe it's only in Seoul.

312
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:58,732
Should I go to Seoul and get some?

313
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:01,363
No. I feel better.

314
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,832
I should call an ambulance.

315
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,863
- I said I'm better!
- You can't even get up.

316
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:10,863
I get better if I lie down,
but it's taking long today.

317
00:26:15,663 --> 00:26:19,163
I thought you'd be hungry.
A proper meal is too much,

318
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:23,163
but maybe you can eat some dumplings.

319
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:25,433
Maybe a few.

320
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,903
Then try to have some.

321
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,903
But what about the bathroom?

322
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:34,133
I don't go to the bathroom
immediately after eating.

323
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:35,902
So you're constipated, too?

324
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,962
Stress, insomnia, malnutrition,

325
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,833
osteoporosis, a herniated
disk, and constipation.

326
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:45,502
What don't you have? That's
why you get wrinkles...

327
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,903
Stop it! Stop with the wrinkles!

328
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,303
Wow. Is she really the
woman I saw this morning?

329
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,133
Is this why men fantasize
about flight attendants?

330
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,603
(Personal Information, Hong Na Ri)

331
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,403
She's the kind who follows
the straight and narrow.

332
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,203
My stomach.

333
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:26,733
Gosh.

334
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,103
I came to see your daughter.

335
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,862
We became very close, thanks to you...

336
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:56,433
pairing us up to go to Seoul together.

337
00:27:56,963 --> 00:28:00,303
Na Ri hurt her back and can't move.

338
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,302
I don't know how close you are,

339
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:05,863
but it can't be enough to go to her room.

340
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,303
Then who is that standing there?

341
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:19,303
It hurt more to lie down.

342
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:23,003
Duk Bong! Come in.

343
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,633
Come in!

344
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,363
As you can see, I am in pain,

345
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,003
so I don't think I can go out.

346
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,163
Sure. It won't take long.

347
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:39,533
Then come to my room.

348
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:41,963
Is that okay?

349
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,262
You're not teenagers or anything.

350
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:46,903
Why are you asking for permission?

351
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,833
What? Should I bring some milk?

352
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,333
- Did you find anything?
- Everything is locked.

353
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:05,402
Did you think he'd leave it open?
It's about timing.

354
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:08,463
We must report him before he catches on.

355
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:09,933
That's the fastest way.

356
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,863
Report him for what? He
hasn't done anything yet.

357
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,633
Are you sure about that?

358
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:21,903
He claims to be your stepdad
and to own this house.

359
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:24,802
What could we report him for?

360
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:26,003
His marriage.

361
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:29,733
We'll say his marriage
to your mom was a con.

362
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,133
Do you know why I came all the way here?

363
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,463
To tell you to be strong.

364
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,333
You must suspect thoroughly.

365
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:42,733
I plan to investigate your
mother's accident as well.

366
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,102
I should at least offer our guest a drink.

367
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:58,303
He's about to go now.

368
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,903
No. I should drink what he gave me.

369
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,703
What does your father do, son?

370
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,203
- "Son"?
- That's right. Son.

371
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,063
Do you have siblings?

372
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,803
Does your family get along?

373
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:20,133
Do you always dress so grungy?

374
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,203
Look, Nan Gil.

375
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:28,863
You should know who the elders are.

376
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:35,603
You must see me as a guy
interested in your daughter,

377
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,662
but the thing is...

378
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:41,033
- As of today, I'll be defending...
- Dad!

379
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:52,433
I want some, too. Don't be so cheap.

380
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,163
What? Dad?

381
00:30:56,703 --> 00:31:00,333
You must have been very thirsty.

382
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:06,833
"Dad"? How could you call him that?

383
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:08,702
That's dangerous.

384
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:10,562
That means you accept him as your father.

385
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:12,603
So why did you try to expose your client?

386
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:15,963
Have you ever defended someone?

387
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,363
Even I know a client has
a right to privacy.

388
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:29,202
You should say goodbye to the elder...

389
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:32,033
when you leave a friend's home.

390
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,102
- Why that...
- Wait.

391
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:37,163
Just a minute. Come on.

392
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,703
Just leave.

393
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,233
How can you tolerate that rude punk?

394
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:50,463
I'm holding it because I need the land.

395
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:53,233
Don't forget we're on the same side.

396
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:56,063
- Let's do this.
- Please leave.

397
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:58,533
We can do it.

398
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,363
You must suspect thoroughly.

399
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:09,903
I plan to investigate your
mother's accident as well.

400
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,433
Where does he keep the key?

401
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:28,263
What? What are you looking at?

402
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:30,733
I wasn't looking.

403
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,303
No sesame seeds on food for services.

404
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:41,503
You're wrong.

405
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,363
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

406
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:46,003
Grounded sesame seeds are fine.

407
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:50,032
That's why I grounded up a
bunch of sesame seeds...

408
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:53,533
in order to make it taste good.

409
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,603
- Is that intentional?
- What?

410
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,102
Are you playing Dad? "What
do your parents do?"

411
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:03,462
"Does your family get
along?" What was that?

412
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:05,163
Do you want everyone to know?

413
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:08,363
You're the one who called me "Dad".

414
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:11,933
It's so annoying. How stressful.

415
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,663
I tried calling Mom's phone,

416
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:23,263
and it goes through.

417
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:25,963
But she never answers.

418
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,032
If someone else took that number,

419
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,463
they'd answer at least once.

420
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:33,963
You have her phone, don't you?

421
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,833
Is there a reason why
people can't find out?

422
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:42,333
What are you hiding?

423
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:44,333
Why is the warehouse locked?

424
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:46,933
That's the place of memories with Mom.

425
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,963
This was always our home.

426
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,153
Why are you pushing me away?

427
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,263
Who are you to put a wall between...

428
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,563
my mom and me?

429
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,103
It's her anniversary. Be reverent.

430
00:34:01,703 --> 00:34:03,783
It's her anniversary, so you
must have a conscience.

431
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,463
Tell me the truth.

432
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:09,033
You knew this house, Uncle's house,

433
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:11,883
and the land around the lake
were Mom's, didn't you?

434
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,063
Is that why you approached her? For money?

435
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:18,633
One thing is for certain. I
didn't want to tell you,

436
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:23,733
but your mom approached me first.

437
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:29,363
Give me Mom's phone.

438
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,633
You have no right. It's mine.

439
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:34,303
I have no right?

440
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,913
Then why are you living in the restaurant?

441
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:39,203
You say this is your house.
Is it your conscience?

442
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:42,332
Why don't you kick me out
and use the master bedroom?

443
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,403
I need to knead.

444
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,163
That is your line.

445
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,962
My kneading methods are unique.

446
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:49,503
I have to flip it all night
and set the temperature.

447
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,543
I need to be close to the
restaurant work room.

448
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,133
Did you...

449
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,163
not share the bedroom with my mom?

450
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:11,233
What are you trying to say?

451
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,163
Did we share a bedroom?

452
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,573
What kind of question is that?

453
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:17,963
What exactly do you want to know?

454
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:19,673
What our relationship was like?

455
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:22,573
I told you. Do you not like
that this is my house?

456
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:24,543
Is it because of money? Do you need money?

457
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,403
You're scary when you're angry,

458
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,303
the legendary Ko Nan Gil.

459
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:36,603
What and how much do you need to do...

460
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,803
to become a legend in that field?

461
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:48,163
A legend never talks about
their legendary story.

462
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:52,402
I'll live here forever.

463
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,262
I'll make dumplings. I will live here...

464
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,103
until a tree I planted
by the lake grows tall.

465
00:35:57,933 --> 00:35:59,633
So that's enough for today.

466
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,003
We'll have plenty of time later.

467
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:06,103
Go change. I'll set the table.

468
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,703
When I was young,

469
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:03,433
I hardly had any friends.

470
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:06,363
I know.

471
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:09,363
Did Mom tell you that, too?

472
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:18,033
I heard my friends laughing, saying how...

473
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:21,463
my dad ran away and our
dumplings tasted bad.

474
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:23,963
After that, I always...

475
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,863
felt like they were mocking
me and avoided them.

476
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:31,403
Ever since then,

477
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:34,573
Mom was my friend, mom, and dad.

478
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,073
She was my everything.

479
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:42,103
I'm sure I was the same to her.

480
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:46,033
So...

481
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,863
I plan to find out what happened to her.

482
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,833
Isn't there anything...

483
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:56,103
you want to confess before I do?

484
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:57,963
Confess?

485
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,333
Sure.

486
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:04,303
The truth is...

487
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,362
the dumplings were terrible
before I got here.

488
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:12,733
Your friends must have been exaggerating,

489
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:14,363
but they were right.

490
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,603
- How have you been?
- Whatever.

491
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:34,363
Will this be enough?

492
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:36,433
I brought big bottles.

493
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,803
We would've waited if you
had said you were coming.

494
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:43,003
Come in.

495
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:51,403
- You should bow first.
- There's no need.

496
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,602
Let's forgo the bow.

497
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:56,233
What? That isn't right.

498
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,803
I'm sorry, Mother.

499
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,903
Have you eaten?

500
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:28,933
- No.
- He ate.

501
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:30,933
Whatever.

502
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,033
- You should drink.
- No way.

503
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,403
- Take her to Seoul before...
- That's a formality.

504
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,303
Is it how things are done?

505
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:47,803
Have a seat.

506
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:56,633
So...

507
00:39:57,203 --> 00:39:59,303
Na Ri really knows nothing.

508
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:18,933
I thought bank checks would be easier.

509
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:21,833
Why are you paying this back?

510
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:24,163
Because Na Ri would feel awkward.

511
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,903
I don't like how you talk about her.

512
00:40:28,703 --> 00:40:30,133
How old are you?

513
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:33,262
It's uncomfortable for me, too.

514
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,163
But I don't know how else to address her.

515
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,662
I don't understand why you're paying me.

516
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,103
How much is that house worth?

517
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:47,803
I'm sorry for calling you
a gold digger con artist.

518
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:52,203
I usually can't say this
because I have a weak heart,

519
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,933
but I can't refrain myself with you.

520
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,033
Even if you repay me on her behalf,

521
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,332
that house is still Na Ri's home.

522
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,463
I'm not repaying you because of the house.

523
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,733
Isn't this about the house? Then what?

524
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,303
Is it because of Na Ri and my relationship?

525
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:09,603
- Why are you sticking your nose...
- I'm not...

526
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,133
sticking my nose anywhere.

527
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:13,633
You handle your own problem.

528
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:18,303
I thought there shouldn't be
a money issue between you.

529
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:19,963
That's why.

530
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:25,333
Tell Na Ri that her uncle paid you.

531
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,833
I have to get to the restaurant.

532
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:48,403
I'll take care it with her
uncle, so take this...

533
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:36,163
I'm curious. Are you sick?

534
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,033
You're still young.

535
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,603
- But that day, you looked weak...
- Na Ri!

536
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:58,902
Isn't that too modest?

537
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:01,902
A son-in-law is an important guest.
I shall go...

538
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,033
Sit down.

539
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:20,533
You need to drink with someone
to see if they're legit.

540
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,303
Goodness.

541
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:28,262
Do you even know how to drink?

542
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:30,603
Do you even know what it tastes like?

543
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:32,133
I'm worried.

544
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:36,533
Cheers.

545
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,903
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

546
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,633
Hey, you two. You're slow.

547
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:40,363
(Dong Jin. Dong Jin? Dong Jin!)

548
00:44:41,163 --> 00:44:43,803
I'll call you later.

549
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:50,963
(Yong Chul)

550
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:55,033
- Hey.
- Hi, Sweetie.

551
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:57,163
I can't go to the gym today.

552
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,503
I'm on my way to drive someone home.

553
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,203
I think Dong Jin is drunk.

554
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:06,432
You have no pride.

555
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,633
Pride? Why are you bringing that up?

556
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:15,432
Do you know what men want?

557
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,362
A woman who is like a
friend, a lover, a mom,

558
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:19,303
a daughter, an angel, and a witch.

559
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,663
Do you think such a woman exists?

560
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:23,963
She does and that's me.

561
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,903
Fooling guys is a piece of cake.

562
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:31,033
Pride? Feed it to the dogs.

563
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:37,263
It's not right for me to go there?

564
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:50,903
Are you drunk?

565
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,103
No. Drink.

566
00:45:55,263 --> 00:45:56,303
Here.

567
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:04,363
- Shall we try a lover's shot?
- Sure.

568
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,063
- There you go.
- Here.

569
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:23,903
I'm here so often that this
feels like my room now.

570
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:47,003
Born in... Born in 1990?

571
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,563
My gosh, seriously.

572
00:46:49,503 --> 00:46:50,903
What's wrong with this photo?

573
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:54,063
Ko Nan Gil. That was his real name.

574
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:57,103
But that's kind of unreliable.

575
00:47:13,403 --> 00:47:15,303
I will live here...

576
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:18,733
until a tree I planted
by the lake grows tall.

577
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,303
That's it.

578
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:56,263
Na Ri!

579
00:47:56,533 --> 00:48:00,003
- Na Ri!
- Na Ri!

580
00:48:00,163 --> 00:48:03,202
- Na Ri!
- Na Ri!

581
00:48:03,203 --> 00:48:04,802
Na Ri.

582
00:48:04,803 --> 00:48:08,863
Come here. I'll pour you a drink.

583
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,363
I'm sorry.

584
00:48:13,203 --> 00:48:15,303
Thank you.

585
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,803
But you know how I feel, right?

586
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,303
That's right. You're supposed to fight...

587
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:28,033
about these silly things
before getting married.

588
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:30,233
You're right.

589
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:34,063
That's right. I like you.

590
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,133
What?

591
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:40,333
Why did you do it? You jerk!

592
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,602
You don't know anything.

593
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:45,003
What do you know about it?

594
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,533
How old are you?

595
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,103
Silly things?

596
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:13,463
Excuse me.

597
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:17,963
Excuse me.

598
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:20,603
Hey, little girl!

599
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,863
Do you know where Hong Dumplings is?

600
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:30,203
The address is 35 Seulgi-ri.
It's around here, right?

601
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:46,533
Do I go through that alley?

602
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:49,263
Thank you.

603
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:07,063
Silly things?

604
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:13,033
Mom passed away. It was the
toughest days in my life,

605
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,233
but he cheated on me.

606
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,702
Is it a silly affair?

607
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:21,863
I'm sorry for calling it silly thing.
I take it back.

608
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:26,403
But he was cheating on me
with my junior at work.

609
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,263
She's annoying and young.

610
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:32,232
Was it a silly age difference?

611
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,803
That isn't right.

612
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:38,603
He said silly lies, too!

613
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:42,133
There are things a person
must not do to others.

614
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:47,733
Telling someone in mourning to stop crying.

615
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,503
But that man...

616
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:54,633
got sick of my being sad for losing my mom.

617
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:58,903
He fake-consoled me, made fake promises,

618
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,203
and betrayed me.

619
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:15,263
But...

620
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:21,203
why did he come today?

621
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:26,003
I thought I saw you two laugh together.

622
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,233
I don't like him,

623
00:51:29,563 --> 00:51:32,633
but what could I do about it?

624
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:36,003
Why did he come then?

625
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,263
It's really over.

626
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:43,303
Okay.

627
00:51:53,603 --> 00:51:54,863
I'll take care of him.

628
00:51:55,163 --> 00:51:58,133
Okay? Leave it to me.

629
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:01,703
Leave it to me. I can take care of it.

630
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:03,833
Hey.

631
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,103
What are you doing?

632
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:20,833
I'm going to throw him out anywhere.

633
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:23,633
He can't even be recycled.

634
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:36,833
Oh my gosh.

635
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:39,903
Dong Jin!

636
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:41,733
Dong Jin?

637
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:44,933
What's wrong with my boyfriend? Dong Jin!

638
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,403
How dare you come here!

639
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:51,202
- Na Ri.
- What?

640
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:52,533
Why that...

641
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:55,263
Did you just call me casually?

642
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:57,323
How dare you call me by my first name?

643
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:00,303
Ms. Hong Na Ri.

644
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:02,333
You are impossibly shameless.

645
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:04,103
How dare you come here?

646
00:53:05,163 --> 00:53:07,532
He said he was drunk and asked me to come!

647
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:08,862
Throw that trash away in the car.

648
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:10,203
He has a driver to take him.

649
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,063
Na Ri. Watch what you say.

650
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,033
I'm holding back right now.

651
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,933
Try raising your voice again.

652
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:23,903
Throw that trash out!

653
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:33,863
My gosh.

654
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:38,433
Be careful. Are you Na
Ri's younger brother?

655
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:41,133
Who are you?

656
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:47,332
Please be careful.

657
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,833
You seem drunk, too.

658
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:53,532
Don't drag him like that.

659
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:55,203
How dare she flirt at him?

660
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:04,233
Gosh.

661
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:09,233
Hey, Na Ri's younger brother! Be careful!

662
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:12,633
I'm not. I'm not.

663
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:14,733
Na Ri, help!

664
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:18,133
- You're not what?
- I'm not her little brother.

665
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:22,333
Do it right. What about her little brother?

666
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:26,333
- You're not...
- I'm not her little brother!

667
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:34,962
Please leave a message...

668
00:54:34,963 --> 00:54:36,903
- after the tone.
- She isn't picking up.

669
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:42,463
She hasn't been skipping school lately.

670
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:46,403
Her room is like a war zone.

671
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:50,403
She really needs therapy.

672
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:56,303
Please tell her I went for therapy.

673
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,003
Na Ri, let's talk.

674
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:15,633
I thought you were annoying but cool.

675
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:18,633
You thought I was just annoying. Don't lie.

676
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,802
This isn't why I came.

677
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:22,732
I thought hard about
whether to come or not.

678
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:25,263
You always do whatever you want.

679
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,803
You shouldn't have come here
if you had any respect.

680
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:38,103
You act like you're good
at cutting things...

681
00:55:38,733 --> 00:55:41,732
and keeping your word,
so don't call him again.

682
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:44,003
Don't ask him to come to you. Don't whine.

683
00:55:44,403 --> 00:55:46,563
I'm the victim in this.

684
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,663
I'm hurt and humiliated enough...

685
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:02,733
You shouldn't have come here today.

686
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,603
You're too stupid and too shameless.

687
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,533
Today is my mom's anniversary.

688
00:56:12,563 --> 00:56:15,063
You care only about yourself,
so you don't care.

689
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:19,033
I'll pay you back with what you fear most.

690
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:21,733
I'll tell everyone at work what you did...

691
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,933
and I'll tell Dong Jin
about your sordid past!

692
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,933
Na Ri, I'm sorry. I
didn't know it was today.

693
00:56:31,403 --> 00:56:32,703
You didn't know?

694
00:56:33,163 --> 00:56:34,733
You really didn't know? Answer me.

695
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:39,203
Should I check? All you do is lie!

696
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:43,733
I knew. I'm sorry.

697
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:47,033
I was wrong. I was wrong.

698
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:55,933
I was wrong.

699
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,733
Please don't tell Dong Jin.

700
00:56:59,033 --> 00:57:02,233
I will tell everyone
whenever I feel like it,

701
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,403
so be anxious and live in fear.

702
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,563
My gosh!

703
00:57:35,803 --> 00:57:37,033
Thank you.

704
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:43,203
I fixed it.

705
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,233
So don't get into an accident.

706
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:49,363
Don't...

707
00:57:50,263 --> 00:57:51,563
get into an accident.

708
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:54,863
If you get into an accident,

709
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:59,033
Na Ri will say it's because of this...

710
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:02,863
and will blame herself.

711
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:07,903
Because Na Ri is too nice,

712
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,033
she'll get stressed again!

713
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:17,733
Drive carefully...

714
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,863
and be a good person.

715
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:22,063
Bye.

716
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:26,263
A junior? Really? I don't think so.

717
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:39,903
This is not my day.

718
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,963
How annoying.

719
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:07,903
Hey. Na Ri.

720
00:59:10,303 --> 00:59:11,603
It's Na Ri.

721
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,333
Come inside.

722
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,133
Okay.

723
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:46,433
(Sweet Stranger and Me)

724
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,463
I hope I didn't do anything wrong.

725
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,663
Who locked me up and why?

726
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:52,833
Hey! Nan Gil!

727
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:54,032
No.

728
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:57,432
Those jerks sent Na Ri the documents.

729
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:58,862
This is Nan Gil.

730
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:01,802
You won't come and see
me unless I drag her in.

731
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:04,402
Na Ri doesn't remember
you at all, does she?

732
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:05,662
Sell the land right now.

733
01:00:05,663 --> 01:00:08,532
You should take the money and run.

734
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:10,202
Does Na Ri know?

735
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:12,362
Stepdad? Why that psycho...

736
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:13,933
- Of course.
- What did she say?

737
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:15,333
He isn't a con man.

738
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,133
I think I know who he is.
