00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,705
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,496
<i>Oh, Hong Na Ri!</i>

3
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:58,785
<i>It's Hong Na Ri.</i>

4
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,736
<i>Let's go in.</i>

5
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:23,176
Hong Na Ri. Believe only me.

6
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:26,746
Just me.

7
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,036
What does he want me to believe him about?

8
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,526
Are you okay?

9
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:48,246
What the heck?

10
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:52,325
Are you okay?

11
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:55,875
Why are you driving like
that in an alley...

12
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:59,385
Someone almost got hurt. Be careful!

13
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,786
I'm sorry. It was dark,
so I didn't see him.

14
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:07,545
Hong Na Ri, are you okay?

15
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,485
Yes, well, I'm okay.

16
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:12,745
Well, that's a relief that
neither of you is hurt.

17
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:17,066
What are you doing in the middle of the night on the
street? Are cars the only ones that need to be careful?

18
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,436
Oh... I'm drunk.

19
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,306
Did you drink?

20
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,535
Because it's the anniversary
of her death, so a little...

21
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,106
A little?

22
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:38,685
Doesn't seem like just a little?

23
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:42,156
Why are you blocking the street and
displaying your dysfunctional family?

24
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:49,335
I guess we were blocking the road.
So, now you can pass through.

25
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,936
Please drive safely.

26
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:58,085
Is she cute because she's drunk?
What's wrong with me?

27
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,095
Hong Na Ri!

28
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,626
Yes?

29
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,175
I'm going to Seoul as your lawyer.

30
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,795
I'm going to submit the lawsuit
to the court tomorrow.

31
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:16,556
The fight starts now.

32
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:27,686
Lately, she just speaks her mind
but doesn't even answer me.

33
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,975
What is this crazy two-timer?

34
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:42,706
No, it's more like octopus legs!

35
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:58,576
You over there. I need
you to stop right there.

36
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:05,325
I really hate drinking.

37
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:10,415
Getting drunk makes me a fool.
My aching head makes me mad.

38
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,206
I really hate drinking!

39
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:20,936
No matter how much I think
about it, I don't understand.

40
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:25,265
Did you try to get me drunk?

41
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,945
Me?

42
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,766
What do you plan to do by getting me drunk?

43
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:36,706
Should I give you some
advice as your stepfather?

44
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:42,085
Stop pretending like nothing is wrong.

45
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:48,625
It's not like you were together for just 1 or 2 years. Just
think about all the things you've been through together!

46
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,985
You went to the funeral together.

47
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:56,966
I'm sure your heart must be hurting...
and all that time you spent together!

48
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:58,716
So what?

49
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:02,285
Don't get mad.

50
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:08,785
Comfort yourself. And take
a good look in your heart.

51
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:12,046
Meditate. Be at peace.

52
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,535
Don't get mad.

53
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:20,005
Meditate... be at peace. Fine.

54
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:22,825
And after that? Forgiveness?

55
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:26,605
What do you mean forgive! That guy!
I won't allow it anymore either!

56
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,966
Even when my eyes are filled with dirt
(meaning when I die), I still won't allow it.

57
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:34,285
What about when you were all
neighborly and friendly with him?

58
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:36,645
At that time, I wanted things
to go well with you two.

59
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:40,505
Starting from today, I totally hate him!

60
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,105
What do you mean you totally hate him?

61
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:44,825
He lied, came here to drink,

62
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,365
he can't drink or control
himself at his age!

63
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,406
What can he do?

64
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:53,325
Why? What? Does that upset you?

65
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,255
I can say even more.

66
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,926
He even laughs funny and
makes sounds when he eats!

67
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,065
Just keep acting like that...
I still won't trust you.

68
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:13,715
Unlike a man, he said bottoms up, but
left some of the drink in the glass.

69
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,365
His shoulders are uneven...

70
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:20,775
And your hoobae, she met the wrong guy and ended
up coming all the way here to pick him up.

71
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,656
He's the type to burden his woman.

72
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:30,395
Stop right there!

73
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:32,465
Hoobae?

74
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:38,275
I thought you were
totally, completely drunk.

75
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:42,106
But you still remembered
that you saw my hoobae?

76
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,855
No... I don't know who
you're talking about.

77
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:50,726
So, watching my hoobae come here to
pick him up, made you feel bad for her?

78
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,016
Ah, jeez.

79
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,366
My head hurts.

80
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,075
Oppa, we're here.

81
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,966
Oppa.

82
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:52,715
<i>Na Ri isn't answering her phone.</i>

83
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:53,775
<i>She's busy lately.</i>

84
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,565
<i>Are the wedding plans going well?</i>

85
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:56,675
<i>I'm taking care of it.</i>

86
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,025
<i>Is Na Ri dealing with a problem?</i>

87
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,065
<i>It's the anniversary of her mom's
death, so she's a bit depressed.</i>

88
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,985
<i>I think I should go see Na Ri.</i>

89
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:03,866
<i>Later.</i>

90
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,626
<i>[The photos will now be deleted]</i>

91
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:29,415
Who's there?

92
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,696
Is someone out there?

93
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,485
Someone's in here!

94
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:39,625
- <i>I said I'm here!</i>
- The war has started, Octopus Leg Lady.

95
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,425
<i>There's someone in here.</i>

96
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:47,326
<i>Go Nan Gil... Go Nan Gil... Hey!</i>

97
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,076
What time is it?

98
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:32,846
<i>[Warning... 2 attempts made

<i>Even if dirt goes into my eyes—</i>

103
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:49,406
Should I wake her? No...

104
00:14:56,356 --> 00:15:00,095
Let's wake her... No, no.

105
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:01,446
Aish.

106
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:24,945
Uh... You should wake up now!
How's your stomach?

107
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:27,126
Do you want some water?

108
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:45,486
She left, she left. I didn't
make a mistake, right?

109
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:55,266
Hey, Go Nan Gil!

110
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:04,915
<i>Hey, Go Nan Gil! Open the door!</i>

111
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,965
Go Nan Gil, can't you hear me?
I know you're there!

112
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:13,505
What are you doing in there? What happened?

113
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,595
The door is locked.

114
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:19,356
First open the door!

115
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:32,825
- Why did you sleep in there?
- Why are you doing this to me?

116
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:37,605
This is indirect murder. What if something had happened to
me while I was locked up? What if I had a cardiac arrest?!

117
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:41,935
What if there was a house fire? I would've
died locked up in the storage room!

118
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:47,625
- I don't know what you are talki—
- "I forgot." "I don't remember a thing."

119
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:52,005
- Don't say things like that.
- So you're saying I locked you in there? Why would I?

120
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:56,425
I guess your true feelings burst out of you when you were drunk!
Or maybe you pretended to be drunk and did it on purpose!

121
00:16:56,426 --> 00:17:02,536
I said I really didn't do it! I dragged you there
and locked you up? The key is right here...

122
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,445
What's wrong with this key?

123
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:12,675
Oh, I'm cold... I'm cold.

124
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:15,265
I'm cold. I'm cold.

125
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:21,325
So, the reason you got me drunk was for this key. I can tell you
heated it with a lighter, and used tape and things like that.

126
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:24,745
Are you in your second year of junior high? Why would you
look this kind of thing up on the internet and do this?

127
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:28,386
- What kind of person do you think I am?
- Then who would it be, at that time?

128
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:39,225
Last night, you didn't come to my room?

129
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,955
I was locked in.

130
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:44,756
But someone definitely came to my room.

131
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:59,715
This is a man's footprint.
And this is me...

132
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:05,116
Here, closer to the garage,
this is my footprint, and this,

133
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:10,265
you're caught red-handed.
This footprint is yours.

134
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:13,245
This was just made.

135
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:19,545
Look here. This is me. This
is that person. And this...

136
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:24,055
- That's me.
- It matches. But this one is small.

137
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,926
You're right.

138
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,895
- It is a woman?
- Is it a man with small feet?

139
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:32,946
- I'm telling you it's a woman.
- What?

140
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:45,426
Oh, I'm cold... I'm cold... I'm cold.

141
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:54,745
♪ <i>Tell me, why. Tell me, why. I'm
curious what kind of man you are.</i> ♪

142
00:18:54,746 --> 00:19:02,466
♪ <i>I want you, why. I want you, why.
I keep on closing my eyes</i> ♪

143
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,545
You, if you are going
to my mom, wait for me.

144
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:12,515
Well, that turned out well. We
can go up to Seoul from there.

145
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:17,545
I like Seoul the most.

146
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:22,006
She can't control her feelings.

147
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:35,916
What is this? Where am I?

148
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:41,996
Oh, my neck hurts.

149
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:49,526
Oh, my head.

150
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:52,835
Oh, you scared me.

151
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,875
What?

152
00:19:54,876 --> 00:20:00,446
Yeo Joo, why... Why are you here?

153
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,226
So you don't remember anything?

154
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,456
Last night, you...

155
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,886
drove us here?

156
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:18,415
I couldn't carry you up here by myself.

157
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,875
It was late, so I couldn't
ask anyone for help.

158
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:25,185
So, I came up alone...

159
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:29,986
I made you some soup, so
get over your hangover.

160
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,115
I mean, I...

161
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,996
I really don't remember anything.

162
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,136
- There's nothing to remember.
- What?

163
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:57,955
Oppa, if it wasn't for me, Sunbae Na Ri
younger brother may have killed you.

164
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,485
- Younger brother?
- Oh, you have to fix your car.

165
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:06,276
- My car?
- Is Sunbae Na Ri's younger brother a gangster?

166
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:08,735
No...

167
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:14,465
Oppa, if they hit us, we need to get hit. If
they they get upset, we have to bear with it.

168
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:16,485
Because of the sin we have committed.

169
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,765
Exactly what happened?

170
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:25,405
Oppa, I'm not someone who is loose with
her lips. I don't want to tell you.

171
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:28,285
Then you shouldn't have said
anything in the first place.

172
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,645
Hey Yeo Joo... Yeo Joo!

173
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:33,895
- Hey, Yeo Joo!
- Ow!

174
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,645
Does it hurt?

175
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:41,086
What is this? How did this happen?
Who did this? Huh?

176
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,145
It's so cold, why did you go in there?

177
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,825
Because I've lived my life
peacefully without secrets,

178
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:21,555
but there appears to be too many secrets
in our house that I am not aware of.

179
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:23,926
What secrets...?

180
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:38,505
There seemed to have been a
lot of issues here and there,

181
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:41,955
but thanks for staying by my mom.

182
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:45,335
It's okay to have just done it for a year.

183
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:47,265
You can stop now.

184
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,055
What do you want me to stop?

185
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:52,705
You're young! Are you planning
on living here forever?

186
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:57,305
I told you already, I'm going to stay here
until the trees near the lake grow lavishly.

187
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,635
Why?

188
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:02,675
What do the trees have to
do with you living here?

189
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:06,455
Listen carefully... I'm going to
tell you something sincerely.

190
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,745
If a farmer buys a shovel,
what do you think will happen?

191
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:13,845
He'll probably plow and plant
seeds with the shovel, right?

192
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:20,036
No one would ever imagine that the farmer would
use that shovel to stab someone in the back.

193
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:24,605
Me becoming your father is just like that.

194
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:25,695
What are you talking about?

195
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,925
And... Stop searching my room!

196
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:30,475
What?

197
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:34,966
And don't search anywhere else.
You won't find anything anyway.

198
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:43,035
Are you confident that
nothing will be found?

199
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:47,565
I could find something
substantial in the garage.

200
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,926
Have you ever thought of that?

201
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:54,185
You were drunk and shaking with fright.
Look at you, telling lies.

202
00:23:54,186 --> 00:24:00,415
So, while I was shaking all night trying to
figure out who would lock me up and why,

203
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:04,446
I had a lot of time and found
a lot of things to search.

204
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:12,405
Before, when I said I wouldn't come
back to the house... I take it back.

205
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:15,735
Because it's my house. So, at any time

206
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:20,706
I may stop by, so I hope you
stay anxious and live well.

207
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:44,416
He's not in a frenzied youth, why
is he aggressive these days?

208
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:58,576
<i>Mr. President, what are you doing?</i>

209
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:04,745
We have a lot of filling for the dumpling,
but don't have a lot of the skin.

210
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:07,552
Darn!

211
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:10,665
<i>Our dumplings are all handmade.</i>

212
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:15,716
<i>Our special Hong Dumplings
begin with the dough...</i>

213
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:19,325
<i>We are now delivering our
dumplings nationwide.</i>

214
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:22,225
<i>If you buy one, you will get one free...</i>

215
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:25,795
<i>It's too precious to eat alone—</i>

216
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,626
Why isn't he showing up in the videos?

217
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,246
Just what am I thinking now?

218
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:59,676
By chance, are you interested in men?

219
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:04,496
Is this what the Chairman is asking?

220
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:13,005
Yes, for the past few months,
I've been investigating someone.

221
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:16,525
Man, it's not like the team is
unskilled, but it's taking them so long.

222
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:19,776
Ah, this mysterious guy.

223
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:26,052
I want to know...

224
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:31,176
About him... Everything about him.

225
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:36,676
But...

226
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,506
it appears he has a daughter.

227
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:45,195
That man has a daughter?

228
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,816
Yes.

229
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:52,225
<i>Then, you may go now.</i>

230
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,896
<i>Please drive carefully.</i>

231
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:04,015
Wow, time flies! Well...

232
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:05,585
Jeez!

233
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:09,466
<i>Lee Seok Joo</i>

234
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:14,616
You're not telling this to anyone, right?

235
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,136
I'm not.

236
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,335
Hello?

237
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,755
Are you feeling less drunk?

238
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:34,105
I wouldn't even call that drinking.

239
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:36,425
Are you eating something
while talking to me?

240
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:40,065
Yes, sorry, I have to eat something
before I go on a flight.

241
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:43,365
- Why are you calling?
- I told you I would file a complaint.

242
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:46,195
Bring your stamp.

243
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:48,886
- I've got to take a flight, so—
- Yes.

244
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:52,496
Hello? Hello!?

245
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:58,106
What's with him?

246
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:07,226
<i>1-3 Go Nan Gil</i>

247
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:17,746
<i>Aigoo... Aigoo.</i>

248
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:23,075
<i>Why does it keep going crooked?</i>

249
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,095
<i>Gosh! It looks like I have
to start all over again.</i>

250
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:29,356
<i>It might be easier for
you to sew it by hand.</i>

251
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:34,586
<i>1-3 Go Nan Gil</i>

252
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,396
<i>Hong Na Ri</i>

253
00:28:58,926 --> 00:29:01,906
Why is this here?

254
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,736
Nan Gil!

255
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:26,095
I told you you can't come here!

256
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:32,786
Those guys found out my
sister has passed away.

257
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:39,056
But those guys said they
sent the files to Na Ri.

258
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:46,766
Yes, thank you.

259
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,206
Did you bring your stamp?

260
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,965
I didn't realize you were
going to meet me here.

261
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,815
You are a lawyer who like
to shock his clients?

262
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:00,515
These are the documents for the
complaint, read them first.

263
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:04,905
I've investigated and there doesn't appear to
be foul play with your mother's car accident.

264
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:08,296
I'll think about filing
a lawsuit against him.

265
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,845
Then, please just sign over
power of attorney to me.

266
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,526
Sunbae!

267
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:17,675
Hong Na Ri! You're here early.

268
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:21,896
Oh, please go on ahead.
I will follow shortly.

269
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:24,656
Oh really?

270
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:28,735
That's the newest limited
edition suit, right?

271
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:32,035
Hey, his shoes are amazing!

272
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:33,865
They're Gucci.

273
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:39,165
How could you all be so caught up in
outward appearances? I'm so proud!

274
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,465
Oh, but why didn't she introduce us to him?

275
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:45,066
It's probably because he's not
someone she needs to introduce.

276
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:50,255
They all knew how cool I am and wanted
to meet me. Why did you ignore it?

277
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,045
They'll avoid you if you do that.

278
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,575
How should I introduce you?

279
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:57,245
Should I start a rumor that my home life
is so complicated I had to hire a lawyer?

280
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,716
Neighborhood friend.

281
00:31:00,346 --> 00:31:02,666
We were going to be neighborhood friends.

282
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,175
By the way...

283
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:07,786
What is it?

284
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,905
The red lips? Do you fancy her?

285
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:14,885
No. Just that they are
staring at me so brazenly.

286
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,566
Is this the first time a
man has come to see you?

287
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,416
Or is it me? Do I look weird?

288
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:24,325
Did they split because of him?

289
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:27,025
Lots of couples split after
they set the date these days.

290
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:29,395
What's the big deal?

291
00:31:29,396 --> 00:31:31,896
I'm going first.

292
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,805
You have a great style.

293
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:38,225
Why don't you leave before
they stare at you some more?

294
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,755
Just give me one signature and I'll be off.

295
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:41,875
<i>[The man living in our house]</i>

296
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:44,936
Later. Get going. I'm off now.

297
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,865
- Hello?
- Uhm...

298
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:49,205
I am at home.

299
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,755
Why, what's up?

300
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:55,485
Ah, just wondering if something's going on.

301
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:57,925
Like what?

302
00:31:57,926 --> 00:32:02,435
A strange document arrived or a
strange person came by or something.

303
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:05,715
No, nothing like that.

304
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,165
I have get on the flight.

305
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:12,045
Okay, if nothing happened, that's great.

306
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:16,015
Ah, now I see why you called.

307
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,335
Why? What?

308
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,296
Are you in the warehouse?

309
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,335
That's it, isn't it?

310
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:25,245
It's very dusty in there, and
it smells and there are mice.

311
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,885
No mice here. And I clean it all
the time so it doesn't smell.

312
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:31,445
If you clean it every day, you
must know if anything is missing.

313
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:33,976
I don't know what you are talking about.

314
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,905
I used to talk to my mom
before each flight.

315
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:41,756
Her voice was an accident
prevention talisman.

316
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:45,206
Well then...

317
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:52,075
Uh... do a great job.

318
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:56,596
I have never been on a plane so I don't
know what that would mean exactly,

319
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:00,576
but fighting!

320
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,095
It's quite something for a
national flight attendant.

321
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:13,976
Perhaps you've become a family with someone
with whom you had the most misunderstanding.

322
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:17,555
It will be quicker for me to buy the
land from Go Nan Gil, won't it?

323
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:18,546
He won't sell.

324
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:20,105
He will sell, 100%. Why?

325
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:23,395
Swindlers know when it's
the right time to sell.

326
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:28,666
I hereby declare I've done
everything I can with Hong Na Ri.

327
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:08,605
Is Na Ri doing alright?

328
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,675
I will take care of everything
so please do not ask anything.

329
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,266
Or try to know anything.

330
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,545
Ah, that Na Ri.

331
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:21,635
Her engagement didn't break
up over the $30,000, did it?

332
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:26,275
You are not the type to worry about
anyone, truly. Do you need money?

333
00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:31,126
How can you say that about my niece?
Is that what you think of me?

334
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:40,056
Finish your drinks and be on your way.

335
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:46,266
Na Ri doesn't remember
you at all, does she?

336
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:13,586
<i>My mom's voice was an
accident prevention talisman.</i>

337
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:27,646
Director, this is Go Nan Gil.

338
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:34,506
It's my land. It won't do you any
good to drag Hong Na Ri into this.

339
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:44,725
I have to drag her in, in order
to have you come see me.

340
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,506
Hong Na Ri is your
Achilles' heel, after all.

341
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:50,946
Furthermore,

342
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:54,345
don't call me 'director.'

343
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:57,596
I was your father once.

344
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:27,995
I will not tell anyone.

345
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:31,215
About you appearing at
the airport with a man.

346
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:33,135
I will not tell Dong Jin.

347
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:37,395
No need for you to put on such an act.

348
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:42,195
Omo, you didn't know. Dong Jin and
Duk Bong have met each other before.

349
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,835
They ran into each other
right in front of our house.

350
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:49,485
Duk Bong saw Dong Jin pestering me so they
don't have a good impression of each other.

351
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:53,716
It's better if you don't tell.
Nothing good could come out of that.

352
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:58,155
Your younger brother didn't
look so well because of

353
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,365
so many people are running into
each other outside of your house.

354
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:06,225
He looks too good to be
rotting in the country.

355
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:10,166
Younger brother? Never mind him.

356
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,096
He is your Achilles' heel.

357
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,365
Student!

358
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:28,526
Let's go get your bicycle.

359
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,296
Over there.

360
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:39,426
Student, this is yours, right?

361
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,125
She's not saying anything.

362
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,425
Why are you interfering with this?

363
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:48,455
I'm only guilty of buying it off
someone who's selling it second hand.

364
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:51,635
President, is a bicycle like this
common in this neighborhood?

365
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,425
She is in grade 12.

366
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:58,116
She's been walking since she lost her
bike and she's too tired to study.

367
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,135
If we report this stolen
and call the police,

368
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:05,916
they will inspect everything
in the warehouse, won't they?

369
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:43,686
Student, take good care of the bike! Bye!

370
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:47,005
You look after high school delinquents too?

371
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:49,955
How does she look like a delinquent?

372
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:53,586
You are the one who looks
like an adult delinquent.

373
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:59,336
The price you gave last time, let's
sign a contract on that basis.

374
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:08,485
I went somewhere expensive and
they even gave me a photo.

375
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:11,905
In these situations, get it
stamped, take the money and run.

376
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,706
That's the right way.

377
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:16,265
Does Hong Na Ri know about this?

378
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,255
No. Then the value of the
secrecy would plummet.

379
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,155
I will not tell her until
the contract is signed.

380
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:25,745
That's not what I mean. Does she know you
and I are about to enter into a contract?

381
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:29,335
From one point of view, she's
losing what's hers overnight.

382
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:31,145
She will have to know.

383
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:34,005
I am that cruel.

384
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,696
What did she say?

385
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,326
Is that what you are curious about?

386
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:48,396
"He won't sell," is what she said.

387
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:59,245
By my father's orders, we all
go through this process.

388
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:04,306
Our family is messed up. We need to have
evidence for our actions if questioned.

389
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:11,075
You might not know what a family is since
you grew up in an orphanage, Go Nan Gil.

390
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:15,136
A family is a societal relationship.
It's certainly not beautiful.

391
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:21,165
Don't fret about being a family when you really
are a swindler. Just take the money and run.

392
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,316
Before your past is all revealed.

393
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:26,385
I won't sell.

394
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:29,185
Should I not respond to my
daughter's faith in kind?

395
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,455
That's a family.

396
00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:36,526
A family is not a relationship,
it's just a family.

397
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,576
It's a beautiful father-daughter time.

398
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:48,475
Still I must buy this land.

399
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,556
Why don't the three of us go at it?

400
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:56,766
There's a slang word that
I'm using these days.

401
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,546
I have to knead.

402
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:06,205
"This father is helping his
family's mental health."

403
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:08,326
Just think of it that way.

404
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:27,856
<i>Body characteristics: Height-105cm. Weight-16kg. Skinny frame, tall. Other
Characteristics: Was abandoned as soon as he was born. Reserved personality.</i>

405
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:51,255
<i>Since you said that you've never ridden a
plane before, please enjoy these pictures.</i>

406
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:55,386
<i>I always sent messages to Mom when I
arrived. It was my good luck charm.</i>

407
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:00,596
<i>I have to knead.</i>

408
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:20,666
Kwon Duk Shim. Do you
follow Go Nan Gil around?

409
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,215
I thought it was weird ever since a girl that usually wants
to do nothing but rest suddenly asked for a bicycle.

410
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:28,675
Do you know anything?

411
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,266
What?

412
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:37,366
What kind of bicycle I got, if I
lost it, do you know anything?

413
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:41,695
This girl is exploding with emotions.

414
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:44,095
It's not like we were <i>that</i> close.

415
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:46,616
Should I know those things?

416
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:53,865
Are you getting psychological
treatment or not?

417
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:58,366
Get out! I said leave my room!!

418
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:04,406
I think you really need help.

419
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:11,336
You've worked hard.

420
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:21,005
These days, you're the
harshest to Do Yeo Joo.

421
00:43:21,006 --> 00:43:25,525
When we were bullying here you always told us to stop being
immature, and that being young and pretty wasn't a sin.

422
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,805
You acted all righteous then.

423
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:30,535
Why are you like this all of a sudden?
Something happened, right?

424
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:33,336
- I found out that being young and pretty is a sin.
- Huh?

425
00:43:34,216 --> 00:43:39,476
By the way, something from the court
was delivered to your office.

426
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,595
- Already?
- Huh?

427
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:46,266
Sunbae, I'll be leaving first.

428
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:55,545
Since our Team Leader Kwon has lived
in that neighborhood for some time,

429
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:58,376
you must know about the orphanage?

430
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:04,925
Well, I think I remember
something like that.

431
00:44:04,926 --> 00:44:08,066
Look at that. You do know.

432
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:12,196
Go Nan Gil came from that orphanage.

433
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:30,185
- Client Hong Na Ri, do you know how long I waited for your phone ca—
- Did you file it with the court?

434
00:44:30,186 --> 00:44:31,855
What? How did you know that?

435
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,915
Someone said there was something at court.

436
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:38,605
That place doesn't do things that quickly. It's
probably some type of penalty or something.

437
00:44:38,606 --> 00:44:40,225
I understand.

438
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:42,266
Well, that's that, but...

439
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:47,005
Hello? Hello?

440
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:48,536
Hello?

441
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:55,586
This girl only says what she needs to say.

442
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:59,276
Anyway, Team Leader you...

443
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:08,215
- Ran Sook!
- I thought I'd miss you!

444
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:10,995
Omo! Did I say I would
treat you to something?

445
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:14,345
I must be getting old. I
keep forgetting things.

446
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:17,726
That's right, Dong Jin did say
that you were a bit absent-minded.

447
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,775
Lead the way! We're going to your house.

448
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:23,405
I will kill that con man myself!

449
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:27,016
What, stepfather?

450
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:31,526
This is the airport. I'm still at work.

451
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:34,756
Ah...

452
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:38,275
Let's go and murder that con man.

453
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:42,135
Why does he use a gigolo
method to trick you?

454
00:45:42,136 --> 00:45:45,225
You should ride the plane
comfortably at this time.

455
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:47,895
What if he sells the land and leaves?

456
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,215
He's not that kind of person.

457
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:51,685
Do you want to say things
to make me explode?

458
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,376
That rasc...

459
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:58,525
I've sold my soul, hoping
to catch that rascal.

460
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:00,046
Let's go.

461
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:04,946
He's not a con man. I
think I know who he is.

462
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:07,966
Shut up.

463
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:20,426

00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:13,326
I can't do this wearing my
uniform, it'll hurt our image.

508
00:49:16,716 --> 00:49:18,816
I don't have any clothes but this.

509
00:49:20,636 --> 00:49:22,836
Do you want to wear this at least?

510
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,616
It smells like formula and vomit.

511
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:32,685
<i>Dada Group</i>

512
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:34,846
We've arrived.

513
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,615
- What did he say?
- He said he's coming out.

514
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:44,515
There's a police station
and a hospital nearby.

515
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:48,155
If anything, there's always 911. It'll all be okay
since you can just dial that if you get scared.

<i>Man Living in Our House</i>

519
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:16,756
Take a seat while waiting.

520
00:50:47,806 --> 00:50:50,266
Go Nan Gil is on his way.

521
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:57,035
<i>I'm on my way so don't say anything.</i>

522

<i>Don't sign anything, whatever it may be.</i>

524
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:04,866
<i>Just wait a little bit more.
If you're scared, count.</i>

525
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:22,815
I'm Lawyer Kim Do Seok.

526
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:24,415
Yes.

527
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:28,236
<i>Don't show them any interest. Don't meet
their eyes. Just look somewhere else.</i>

528
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:35,226
You must be very curious.
You can ask us anything.

529
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:40,356
<i>I'm on my way, so don't say anything.</i>

530
00:51:42,806 --> 00:51:46,406
<i>Don't read any documents that they
give you. Don't sign anything.</i>

531
00:51:47,446 --> 00:51:49,746
Please check these documents.

532
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:57,475
Even if she reads it, it would
just be a difficult step.

533
00:51:57,476 --> 00:52:01,075
To put it simply, Hong Na Ri, your father

534
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:05,085
made a deal with us a very long time ago.

535
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:07,466
- My father?
- Yes.

536
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:13,396
Then please talk with Go Nan Gil.
He's on his way now.

537
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:19,486
No. We have to speak with you, Hong Na Ri.

538
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:27,655
Excuse me, you said it was a long time ago.
When did he borrow the money?

539
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:31,825
You would know if you looked at the documents,
but the first deal was made in 2001.

540
00:52:31,826 --> 00:52:33,345
So 15 years ago...

541
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:36,425
Fifteen years ago?! Wait,
does that make any sense?

542
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:38,115
If it was 15 years ago,

543
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:42,066
th-then I was... What's it called?

544
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:47,555
Student? No, baby? No, that's not it...

545
00:52:47,556 --> 00:52:53,545
Underage! I was a minor! How could I make
a deal back then? Do you have proof?

546
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:58,095
I don't understand what you're saying,
but I'm talking about Mr. Hong Sung Kyu.

547
00:52:58,096 --> 00:53:01,876
Isn't Hong Sung Kyu your father?

548
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:08,115
Hong Sung Kyu made a deal with us using your
mother's land as collateral a long time ago.

549
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:11,785
Then your father went missing and your mother
was supposed to take responsibility for it,

550
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:15,535
but then we found out that
she passed away recently.

551
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:18,495
The daughter has to take responsibility.

552
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:23,066
If you give up the land in your
mother's name, it will be over.

553
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:39,746
Hello!

554
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:49,625
The representative told me
that I must escort you in.

555
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,676
Just give this to him. Tell him to
not even think about seeing me.

556

<i>Camera 01</i>

557
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:21,055
I told you not to read the documents.
Why don't you listen to me?

558
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,155
Did you not hear what I said?

559
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:29,146
Hey, Go Nan Gil. What
do you mean, "father"?

560
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:39,935
These are fake.

561
00:54:39,936 --> 00:54:42,246
That's just what you think.

562
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:52,166
Come here.

563
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:07,056
I'm telling you, all we did
was have a conversation!

564
00:55:27,176 --> 00:55:29,446
Stay here for a minute.

565
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:37,926
Count to three.

566
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:55,486
You know that I'm not good
at asking for things, right?

567
00:55:56,786 --> 00:56:01,875
When I ask for something,
then I'm seriously begging.

568
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:06,576
I'm begging you. Don't
mess with Hong Na Ri.

569
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:10,076
And also...

570
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:15,346
This is a threat.

571
00:56:17,946 --> 00:56:20,496
Use your head well.

572
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:24,236
When you mess with me,

573
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:28,596
what happened that day can happen again.

574
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,476
Let's go.

575
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:06,755
Are you fearless or just stupid? Where do
you think this is that you would come here?

576
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,635
I've never heard that I'm
stupid, and I'm really fearful.

577
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:15,076
So explain everything to me.

578
00:57:17,526 --> 00:57:20,295
What's wrong with your clothes?
They kind of smell.

579
00:57:20,296 --> 00:57:22,925
Don't change the subject. It won't work.

580
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:24,705
Are we in a relationship where we
can talk informally right now?

581
00:57:24,706 --> 00:57:27,206
I spoke informally with
my father, you know!

582
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:45,195
Don't think of coming here ever again. All
you have to do is ignore them. I'm leaving.

583
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:49,265
I asked you to explain what
this situation is right now!

584
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:50,565
There's nothing to explain.

585
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:54,945
There's over $1,000,000 worth of debt.
They said that I'm responsible for it.

586
00:57:54,946 --> 00:57:56,415
Why is that your responsibility?

587
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:57,745
That's the debt that my dad had.

588
00:57:57,746 --> 00:58:02,725
I'm your father! Right now, I

589
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:05,335
am your father.

590
00:58:05,336 --> 00:58:08,306
So there's nothing that
those bastards can do.

591
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:32,066
Was it because of this? Is this why you
became my father? You knew about this?

592
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:38,136
Did Mom know about it too?
Answer me, Go Nan Gil!

593
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:50,045
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

594
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:52,186
Look at that sweat!

595
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:57,226
Hey, you con man! You stay right there!

596
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:07,486
You con man! Oh my!

597
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:19,205
