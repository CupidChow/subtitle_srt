00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,670
Did my mom know about this too?

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,910
Answer me, Go Nan Gil.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,210
Oh... What's wrong?

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,690
<i>Are you not feeling well?</i>

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,550
You're sweating.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,900
Hey, con man! Don't move!

8
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,270
You con man!!! Omo!

9
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,720
Go Nan Gil... What's wrong?

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,510
Go Nan Gil, come to your senses.

11

<i>I was a child that was abandoned without a given name, birthday, or family register.</i>

<i>- Hi.<br>- Hello.</i>

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,510
<i>Hi.</i>

14
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,990
<i>So you sat like that because other kids were making fun of you.</i>

15
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,500
<i>If they make fun of you next time, just say, "I've got a mom too!"</i>

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,170
<i>But you're Hong Na Ri's mom.</i>

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,420
<i>I can be Nan Gil's mom too.</i>

18
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,520
<i>I was jealous of Hong Na Ri who took possession of mom.</i>

19
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,970
<i>Wow! I got her!</i>

20
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,310
<i>Let's go!</i>

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,060
<i>But I didn't like other people harassing her.</i>

22
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,360
<i>In order to be with my mom, I decided to marry Hong Na Ri.</i>

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,410
I'm going to marry Hong Na Ri.<br>[<i>Hong Na Ri - Me - Mom - Family</i>]

<i>I'm going to miss you, my daughter.</i>

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,470

Go Nan Gil. Please get yourself together.

I'm fine. Don't call 9-1-1. Don't call them no matter what.

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,420
Are you okay? Are you okay for real? Can you hear me?

88
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,420
It's really noisy.

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,280
Uh...okay.

91
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,930
Let's go to the hospital.

92
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,700
- Why would I go to the hospital? <br> - You're acting weird right now.

93
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,790
- I'm allergic to the sun. <br> - Yeah, right.

94
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,410
I don't think we're close enough to speak to each other bluntly like that. I have to go knead the dough. I'm busy.

95
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,200
Don't be hurt.

96
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,770
I'm worried about myself, so I'm saying it to be selfish.

97
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,570
Just in case...don't get hurt (informal speech).

98
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:01,210
I don't have anyone... I don't know what's going on right now...just don't ever get hurt.

99
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,750
I won't get hurt.

100
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,500
I didn't want to say this because it sounds bragging myself, but I'm almost too healthy...super healthy.

101
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,280
I don't even remember when I last had a cold.

102
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,570
And... You don't need to know what matter it is.

103
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,490
Don't worry too much.

104
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,670
Be well. Live well.

105
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,250
So, ultimately, you're telling me not to think coming back home. And you want me to eat well and live well?

106
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,200
So, why does "eat well and live well" sound like "don't think coming back home" to you?

107
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,540
It's because your heart is all twisted, even your hearing is twisted.

108
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,470
- That's why you can't sleep and are so stressed out! <br> - And getting wrinkles!

109
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,380
Then, please go knead the dough you need to do so desperately. And don't fall again.

110
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,000
Bye.

111
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,730
He must feel uneasy because this super-persistent Hong Na Ri stepped back too easily.

112

Hong Na Ri.

113
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,350

Go Nan Gil...knows about the borrowed-name bank account list and

117
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,310
how much and where all the money is flowing. Even recent ones

118
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,360
If that information gets out, we are done for.

119
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,480
That's something that only all of us here know.

120
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,820
So, who is the one helping Go Nan Gil?

121
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,500
- Hong Na Ri! <br> - Yes?

122
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,250
What was that just now?

123
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,310
What do you mean?

124
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,390
A little while ago, you were acting like a couple in love.

125
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,710
That moment where you couldn't take your eyes off of him? That's what I'm asking about!

126
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,900
Who was acting like a couple in love? The two of us?

127
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,630
The two of us?! Do you need a man desperately after getting dumped?

128
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,760
But that isn't the guy!

129
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,650
You have to grab him and take him to the police!

130
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,100
Don't get upset. If you get upset, you'll get stressed, won't be able to sleep, and get wrinkles.

131
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,080
Hey!

134
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,530
I'm going to hold onto him so he can't run away and badger him with questions.

135
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,240
I acknowledge. He was a bit cool at that time.

136
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,320

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,070
What? Oh.

165
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,580
Yeah, well.

166
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,350
I heard Na Ri Sunbae took out a loan from a loan shark.

167
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,560
What? Who said that?

168
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,900
It seems like a a lot of debt payment reminders being sent to the administration office.

169
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,600
There are rumors about it everywhere.

170
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,440
Oppa, you must be upset right? I'm upset too.

171
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:39,030
If you are really upset, then you can't say those kinds of things in a place like this.

172
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,620
Well... I wasn't going to tell you but I thought you needed to know.

173
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,690
It looks very pretty.

174
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,820
What are you going to do?

175
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,890
Nail treatment.

176
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,250
Do Yeo Joo.

177
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,590
Dong Jin?

178
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,060
Na Ri.

179
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,380
Let's get it next time.

180
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,420
- Why? <br> - Well...

181
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,190
What is with that expression? Did you already know?

182
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,520
Why, that little...

183
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,430
Sunbae. Let's just go.

184
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,580
Hey. Why should we go?

185
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:36,550
Dong Jin. This is a place we come to regularly with a group discount.

186
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,830
It really is just a coincidence.

187
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,480
A coincidence?

188
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,350
Stop. Don't do it.

189
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,070
Wow. You are so strong and cool.

190
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,750
If it were me, I would have thrown her off the plane.

191
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,850
Let's talk.

192
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,460
With me? I don't have anything to say.

193
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,320
Let go!

194
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,900
Why are you being so confident?

195
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,660
You saw right? That's why a 9-year relationship is so scary.

196
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,910
Can you please stop talking about those "9 years"? Is time a weapon to attack?

197
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,260
If you take away the time where they knew each other in college and the time he spent in the army,

198
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,590
It's not a lot of time.

199
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,750
Hey, she's crazy.

200
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>Even if dirt goes into my eyes (I die), I still won't accept that jerk!</i>

201
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,920
Let go and talk.

202
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,390
I didn't know you came here often. I'm sorry.

203
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,320
No need to be sorry. You two are free to go wherever you want.

204
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,220
But, since the both of you lack judgement and courtesy, I'm a bit embarrassed.

205
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,260
- I'm sorry. <br> - I said it was fine.

206
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,030
But do you really have money problems?

207
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,880
Did your uncle possibly borrow money from loan sharks too?

208
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,060
Did Do Yeo Joo say that? You two talk about me?

209
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,740
Where's the financial group? How much do you owe?

210
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,710
Are you asking out of curiosity or to pay it back?

211
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,710
- I can't stand either option.<br>- You can't handle loan sharks!

212
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,760
- Get your house back from that con man and sell it.<br>- Who are you calling a con man?

213
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,670
What do you know about so that you would call him that? If it weren't for him, I'd...

214
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,800
Never mind. I don't want to talk about him with you.

215
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,960
Sunbae, I won't come here again.

216
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,030
Can you still talk in that tone in this type of situation? That's admirable.

217
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,260
Since your taste is so consistent.

218
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,520
But it seems like you gave her a different color.

219
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,530
Ah!

220
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,570
It's time for my previous appointment, so (I'll get going).

221
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:29,760
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unexpected Lovers @ Viki</i>

222
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,230
Ouch! Baggage, baggage! Aigoo.

223
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,700
What's going on?

224
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,450
- Ow, my back. My back, my back.<br>- Hello, Daughter!

225
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,010
Hello! Hello, hello!

226
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,700
I asked what's going on?

227
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,990
Rumors I was involved with loan sharks spread around the company, so I was fired under reason of indecent conduct as a flight attendant.

228
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,810
- Lead the way! Let's go to your company together. <br>- You seem like a student's parent.

229
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,200
All you have to do is to submit a document that you've got no liability or responsibility of debt!

230
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,800
So let's go. I'll work it out for you.

231
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,500
It would be best for me to unpack my things in my room, right?

232
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,450
Why would you unpack anything? Let's go to Seoul, right now!

233
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,330
I'm lying.

234
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,620
I got a long-term vacation. I'm hard-working and good at my job, so they can't fire me that easily.

235
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,430
Ow, my back! Ow.

236
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,750
Are you going to keep standing there like that?

237
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,500
- I run a dumpling shop.<br>- You're always kneading.

238
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,130
There are established rules at the shop.

239
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,790
But if someone suddenly says that they're taking a long-term vacation one day,

240
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,310
that employee would look really, really irresponsible.

241
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:45,000
You're a boss from hell then. You should worry about what situation arose that would cause the employee to do that.

242
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,080
Bad things usually happen all in one morning.

243
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,910
Just like debt of 1 billion won came to my doorstep suddenly one morning.

244
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,670
It's my debt!

245
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,350
That's why I'm most curious about that.

246
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,810
Why are you going so far as to act as someone else's stepfather to take care of their debt?

247
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,340
With my personality, I want to ask you that right this instant.

248
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,380
I have a lot of time.

249
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,550
When did you get here?

250
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,950
This is the building plan for the resort you want to build, right?

251
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,040
Yes. It's cool, isn't it?

252
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,290
The lake will disappear?

253
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,910
There's no need to make a lake on an architectural model.

254
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,870
Looking at how much interest you have in the resort, it seems you'll sell the land right after you win the lawsuit.

255
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,980
- Please withdraw the marriage annulment lawsuit.<br>- I told you I've already submitted it. What is it this time?

256
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,760
- Do you know what Dada Finance is?<br>- Why are you suddenly talking about Dada Finance?

257
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,910
They said that my dad is in debt to them for a deal he made using the land as collateral.

258
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,370
They said I have to take responsibility for that debt.

259
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,980
Your father? You're calling him that so well!

260
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,130
Wow, that Dumpling Boss is doing all sorts of things at his age.

261
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,330
But why are you trying to drop the lawsuit? Make him pay for it!

262
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,820
Not that father. It's my biological father's debt.

263
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,890
I'm talking about my biological father that abandoned me and my mom twenty years ago. It's his debt.

264
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,390
The situation's a bit much, isn't it?

265
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,380
So that... Wait a second. So you're saying...

266
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,130
Wow! How does this woman have no luck with fathers?

267
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,760
Dada Finance is a legal organization, but the way that they operate is all illegal!

268
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,100
If you get caught up with them once, you can't ever get out of it!

269
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,680
Wait. You have a stepfather, Hong Na Ri.

270
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,930
For now, keep your father's debt a secret from Go Nan Gil.

271
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,820
Since what happened with Dada Finance is in the past and you've got a stepfather now, then all you have to do is say you have no responsibility.

272
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,250
Go Nan Gil also knows about the debt with Dada Finance.

273
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,770
He said that he became my stepfather because of it. The paper father.

274
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,360
What does that mean?

275
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,830
What I'm saying is

276
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,170
that the only person I trust right now is him.

277
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,350
Hong Na Ri!

278
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,110
I'll look into it a little more for you, so don't trust him for now.

279
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,380
It's too fast. It hasn't been that long since you called him a con man, so why do you believe him already?

280
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,400
You move way too fast! "When in doubt, doubt some more." Have you never heard of that before?

281
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,470
<i>Come to the playground for a minute!</i>

282
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,130
Do you know why I called you here?

283
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,990
- Just tell me why.<br>- "Come to the roof after school. Or Come to playground after school."

284
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,630
You know what that means, right?

285
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,350
Don't make me tired and just tell me.

286
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,150
I'm saying we should have a fight here.

287
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm too tired to even talk anymore, and we're not in the type of relationship to–

288
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,660
Don't speak to me informally from now on.

289
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,900
And I want you to answer all the questions that I ask you from now on honestly.

290
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,680
Why do I have to do that?

291
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,520
- Everything's been revealed!<br>- What's been revealed?

292
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,390
The fact that you were acting as my father!

293
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,540
- Ah...<br>- When I was throwing a fit calling you a con man and a gold digger, you could have told me that you were acting as my stepfather!

294
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:36,200
What's the point of saying it? It would just make your emotions tangled. I didn't tell you so that you'd feel at ease.

295
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,390
- Was there a reason why you just had to become my father?<br>- I thought that it would be better to protect you by becoming your family.

296
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,260
The mother that I knew would have never come up with that kind of lie.

297
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,970
She knew that this was the only way to solve the problem.

298
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:54,530
So you're saying that she trusted you more than her own daughter. What was your relationship with Mom? How long have you known her?

299
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,460
<i>What the heck? Why are his eyes boring into me?</i>

300
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,580
<i>Don't avoid it. If you do, you're losing to him, Hong Na Ri.</i>

301
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,200
Are you asking because you really don't know?

302
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,990
What? What don't I know?

303
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,780
So you really don't know. How disappointing.

304
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,150
Go Nan Gil from Freshman Year, Room 3.

305
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,250
<i>1-3. Go Nan Gil</i>

306
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,660
Exactly how long have you known my mom?

307
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,010
<i>What's with this gaze again?</i>

308
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,720
I grew up in an orphanage. Hope Orphanage.

309
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,050
An orphanage? Hope Orphanage?

310
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,580
- That orphanage that mom used to do volunteer work at?<br>- Yeah.

311
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,900
Your mom came almost every day and took care of me.

312
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,880
I owe a lot of debt to your mother.

313
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,390
So you met at the orphanage.

314
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,340
It's all water under the bridge. You don't have to pity me just because I grew up in an orphanage.

315
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,860
I got more than enough love from your mother.

316
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,080
Who's pitying you?

317
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,120
She said that our dumpling shop was also an orphanage a long time ago.

318
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,770
I heard from your mother. She said that she started doing volunteer work because it made her think of the past.

319
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,010
I remember that place.

320
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,330
- You never even came there.<br>- How do you know that? Do you remember me from when I was younger?

321
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,120
Because she always came alone!

322
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,550
I got mad sometimes because she was always doing volunteer work.

323
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,090
I'm a bad person, aren't I?

324
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,130
I got mad when she went home and wasn't at the orphanage with me.

325
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,200
Mom must have been tired on both fronts.

326
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:07,890
You went to Seulgi Elementary School, didn't you? Where'd you go to middle school? I'm a much older senior than you, right?

327
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,980
Let's not focus too much on the past. I'm your stepfather right now.

328
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,870
You never know when someone from Dada Finance will come here, so I'm saying we should stick to our roles.

329
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,220
I can't act like that.

330
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,710
You were that close to Mom, so why didn't I know about you?

331
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,610
Why don't I remember you at all?

332
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,630
You can't act, and you're curious about so many things.

333
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,190
Being curious about a lot of things means that you're interested in me.

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,030

336
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,160
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

337
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
- You know that you can't be interested in me as a man, rig—<br>- Hey!<br>

338
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,540
Uhuh. We're not in a relationship where you can just talk like bluntly that.

339
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,950
I'm going to knead the dough.

342
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,900
In this situation, I'm not supposed to ask questions, but

343
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,840
just need to be thankful, right?

344
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,110
No, I'm just doing what I have to do. So you don't need to thank me.

345
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,130
If it's too hard for you to act, then you don't have to. But I hope you won't speak rudely to me.

352
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,430
I told you not to just suddenly barge into my room! It's annoying!

353
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,810
This is an invasion of privacy! I'm going to report you to the police!

354
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,250
It's really a waste to watch it alone.

355
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
I want to ask you something. Why did you come here?

356
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm asking why did you leave that big house in Seoul City with mom and dad and come here to stay with me.

357
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,680
You're not even interested in me the slightest bit. Why are you suddenly curious about something like that?

358
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,770
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

359
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,790
"The only person that you can trust in the world is me."

360
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,830
Would you do it because of that?

361
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,080
Jeez.

362
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,040
Am I right?

363
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,780
- What's up with that kind of thinking, seriously?<br>- Why are you acting like this?

364
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,070
Are you sick somewhere? Acting like we've got such a loving brother-sister relationship.

365
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,860
Then what about Hong Mandoo?

366
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,040
Do you trust Hong Mandoo?

367
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,640
Yeah.

368
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,020
Look at that. Your expression changes just from hearing about Hong Mandoo.

369
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,330
What about that slacker? What about him makes you trust him so much?

370
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,970
Heol. Who are you calling a slacker? You're the ultimate slacker.

371
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:47,180
Me? Ultimate slacker? Who's the one who gives you your allowance?

372
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,830
Where did you put your bike? Did you lose it again?

373
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,800
You don't carry around anything but Hong Mandoo in that brain of yours.

374
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,290
Why did you bring that into your room? Did Hong Mandoo find it for you?

375
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,480
Don't make a scene and LEAVE!!!

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,880
Hello.

387
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,430
You answered the phone.

388
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,610
Because we've still got some things left to take care of.

389
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,530
That's right.

390
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,420
I took care of our installment savings that we invested.

391
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,110
I sent the savings and interest.

392
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,150
Wait, why would you send all of it to me? Divide it in half and take out $30,000.

393
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,650
That $30,000...

394
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,360
Go Nan Gil already paid it back.

395
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,740
Go Nan Gil did? Why would he? When did he pay it back?

396
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,990
No. I'm hanging up.

397
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,260
So, that's why— Hello? Na Ri?

398
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,820
No, why? Why would he pay that back?

399
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,150
What are you doing here?

400
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,890
W-well... Th-that's...

401
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,020
Are you okay?

402
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,810
Man, I got all wet!

403
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,480
You should get up.

404
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,120
The thing you're sitting on, it's natural fertilizer that I made.

405
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,480
What?!

406
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,780
I wonder what I made it out of?

407
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,940
This is the first time I'm seeing you smiling.

408
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,000
It looks good.

409
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,430
You should at least put some effort into your acting. We're not in the type of relationship to say something like that, right?

410
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,310
"It's nice to see you smile." What kind of relationship do you have to be in to say that?

411
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,650
You can say that even to someone you've just met. "Omo, it's nice to see you smile!"

412
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,130
- What's wrong with it?<br>- That's true.

413
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,730
But I'm keeping my promise with your mom right now,

414
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,300
so it's like we're seeing each other for the first time. We don't have any relation to each other.

415
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,920
So we're not in a relationship where we see each other and talk in a place like this, either.

416
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,970
Are you feeling like you've suffered a loss now?

417
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,110
Then why did you pay back that $30,000 to Dong Jin when he has no relationship with Mom?

418
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:33,610
Your uncle borrowed it. Your mother would have wanted me to pay it back.

419
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,760
That's why I keep feeling like I owe a debt to you and that I have to be thankful to you.

420
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,950
Thank you. I mean it.

421
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,230
I'll pay you back.

422
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,750
Do you know about strawberry flowers?

423
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,060
These are strawberry flowers. Over there are pumpkin flowers.

424
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,320
Those are eggplant flowers. They're prettier than roses, right?

425
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,740
These pretty flowers become fruit. They become strawberries and pumpkins, get vines, and become heavy with fruit.

426
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,240
They get uglier and uglier, but they're much more beneficial than flowers are. That's what growth is.

427
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,230
Are you telling me to grow up?

428
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,200
Did it come out that way? That's not what I meant.

429
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,990
- If not, then what did you mean?<br>- There's no need for you not to be able to sleep, get wrinkles,

430
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,590
and get stressed out because you're getting older. Because that means that you're developing into a person beneficial to the world.

431
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,690
Do you think that will comfort me?

432
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,680
If you're going to pay the money back, you've got to be useful.

433
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,050
No matter how I think about it, taking a short-term vacation and coming to your hometown just to get older by the day

434
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,120
isn't beneficial to your existence. If you pay back the money,

435
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,480
I'll sign you up for a marriage matchmaking service.

436
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,040
You sound like putting dots on the strawberry and drawing lines in the pumpkins.

437
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,590
What? Marriage matchmaking service?

438
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,790
Are you telling me to go get married to just anyone right now?!

From now on?

463
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,870
Hello.

464
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,850
I heard the story from Miss Hong Na Ri. Oh...

465
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,550
You know I have rights as her lawyer, right?

466
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,410
So?

467
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,970
I heard that you knew all about her father's debt.

468
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,070
Hong Na Ri seems to think that this land is the collateral,

469
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,230
but looking at how clean your circumstances are, I don't think that's it.

470
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,240
How much is the debt?

471
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,110
Why don't you stop caring about other people's debts?

472
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,210
I've thought about it carefully.

473
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,900
Why would Go Nan Gil become her stepfather?

474
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,690
Wow, he did something great.

475
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,120
Otherwise, every day would be a living hell for Na Ri.

476
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm totally touched.

477
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,490
But then, I thought again.

478
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,340
Your opponent is Dada Finance. Masters of illegal actions.

479
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,210
You could have just sold me this land and taken care of the debt. Oh...

480
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,440
Could he be trying to show Na Ri that he is strong?

481
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,580
Well, it looks like you've already shown her you're strong.

482
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,800
So, why don't you just sell it now?

483
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,050
I said I'm not selling. Isn't it illegal to keep asking me to sell it?

484
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,310
What is your reason for not selling it?

485
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,200
Is it because if you sell the land, you will have to separate from Na Ri?

486
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,950
Or because your old memories will disappear?

487
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,170
Na Ri seems to believe that you became her stepfather to help with the debt.

488
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,520
She was really touched by it.

489
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,830
I mean if it was for the debt, did you have to become her stepfather?

490
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:23,090
Or, is there another secret that I'm not aware of?

491
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,050
We're not close enough to share secrets.

492
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,850
First love? One-sided love?

493
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,560
Or someone you've cared for your whole life?

494
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,490
They say love can conquer all,

495
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,190
but it can't beat Dada Finance.

496
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,120
What's with the atmosphere here?

497
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,550
- What atmosphere? <br> - What atmosphere?

498
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,620
It looks very unfriendly.

499
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,360
Right? It looks unfriendly.

500
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,930
I think the Hong Dumplings President needs to be friendlier to me.

501
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,860
- Why?<br>- Do you know how many people come visit our museum?

502
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,170
Most of them come here to Hong Mandoo.

503
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,950
Really?

504
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,020
I'm going out.

505
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,590
Now, you are speaking informally and taking breaks.

506
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,110
Stop by the office before you go back to Seoul.

507
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,880
I have something to tell you.

508
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,920
It's very important.

509
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,350
Really?

510
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,210
This isn't anything to brag about. When did you tell him?

511
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,380
He was a lawyer, so I had a consultation.

512
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,990
When you come back, why don't you bring back some Korean beef tail to cook?

513
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,420
What? Tail?

514
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,460
Before it gets cold, my employees and I need to improve our immunity.

515
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,460
You can boil it for a whole day. Do we have a big pot to cook?

516
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,420
You have to boil it in a cauldron the old-fashioned way.

517
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,660
The tails aren't enough for everyone to eat.

518
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,640
I'll add the beef leg bones and boil them long enough. So until your faces covers with beef oils,

519
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,990
let's eat it all throughout the fall and winter. All together!

520
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,420
All throughout winter?

521
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,700
Just until when are you going to do this?!

522
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,310
Oppa. What are you doing?

523
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,990
I'm exercising.

524
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,890
I need to exercise too.

525
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,960
But I'm only doing breathing exercises.

526
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,800
I should be taking care of my body too.

527
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,860
What would you like for dinner?

528
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,630
Yeo Joo.

529
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,120
After the encounter with Na Ri,

530
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,630
I don't feel very good.

531
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,860
I can't seem to concentrate on work.

532
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,370
And I'm starting to feel guilty.

533
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,590
I understand.

534
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,640
Oppa, you are a warm-hearted and good person.

535
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,230
Looks like you want to go find an all-boys club.

536
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,790
And not meet with Yeo Joo anymore.

537
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,830
It's not that I don't want to see you...

538
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,030
Yeah.

539
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,800
I need some time to think by myself.

540
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,070
Alright.

541
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm going to be busy for a while, so it works out well.

542
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,340
Go to the all-boys club and come back being all cool, Oppa!

543
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,200
Alright.

544
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,060
Thanks.

545
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:44,430
Omo. Honey, don't push too hard. I thought you had a date tonight.

546
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,420
He said he feels too much guilt and can't see me!

547
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,960
I mean, he didn't feel it when he was cheating on her. Why is he feeling it now?

548
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,660
You said he was a nice and perfect Oppa.

549
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,260
There is no one like that on earth.

550
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,250
Seeing how he's feeling guilty proves he's a nice Oppa. You're being weird.

551
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,160
No, that's not guilt.

552
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,280
It's because the woman he was cheating with has become the real girlfriend.

553
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,230
So, now he doesn't want to keep her or throw her away. She's unappealing now.

554
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,380
Appeal is supposed to go down with time.

555
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,930
Win with your body!

556
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,830
Run...just run, Honey.

557
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,030
Alright.

558
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,100
Let's do this! Raise the speed!

559
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,170
Hey! No, this isn't it!

560
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,160
Run! Run! Run!

561
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,500
Run!

562
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,360
Peel it carefully. Each one contains a year.

563
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,760
You're a poet, Grandmother.

564
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,790
Grandmother, you know Hong Dumplings, right?

565
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,730
Of course! Jung Im's place.

566
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,460
Yes, I'm her daughter.

567
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,200
I know, Wedge moth larvae.

568
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,450
Excuse me?

569
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,070
There is a insect called Wedge moth larvae.

570
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,070
It stays still and then

571
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,000
stings you with poison before it leaves.

572
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,910
But...

573
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,800
Jung Im used to say,

574
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,730
her daughter is like that bug.

575
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,170
She shoots out poison like that.

576
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:10,730
Omo. No, I'm not like that. I only speak sweet words.

577
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,470
But granny, what kind of a woman was my mom?

578
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,740
<i>Nan Gil? Nan Gil from Hope Orphanage?</i>

579
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,770

00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,760
<i>- The one who currently owns Hong Dumplings. <br> - Oh. </i>

581
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,030
<i> Oh, Nan Gil. Yes. He's a dapper young man.</i>

582
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,810
<i> He used to live in Hope Orphanage.</i>

583
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,130
It's beef soup again.

584
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,100
Wow. We are going to get really healthy.

585
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,610
Oh, thank you so much.

You told me to grow up.

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,540
Did you know that the pumpkin and eggplant flowers have meanings to them?

590
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,780
Guess what the eggplant flower means?

591
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,080
The truth. The meaning is great.

592
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,880
Let's be honest with each other.

593
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,650
Before it gets cold, the garage need a full cleaning.

Before it gets cold, why don't you just remodel the entire house!

I'm here to meet you.

Me? What is it about?

602
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,210
Whenever you are done, if you could spare a few minutes...

603
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,460
Sorry, I don't have time or anything to say.

I told you I don't have time or anything to say.

606
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,000
Why did you hate my mom so much?

607
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,350
Why? Can't I hate her? Does the entire neighborhood have to like her?

608
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,590
No. You could hate her. It just looked like there was a reason.

609
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,260
I just hate her. And I hate her in the most hateful way possible.

610
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,010
This is my place of work. Will you just leave?

611
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,840
Team Leader, you don't like me either.

612
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,180
It's understandable for you to not like President Kwon, but my mom is seriously an angel.

613
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,850
Why me? Why is it understandable for her to dislike me?

614
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,180
It's a bit mean to explain it in words...

615
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,750
It's okay. Tell me truthfully.

616
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,390
You're kind of sarcastic and unlikable.

617
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,470
You're pretty old, Na Ri.

618
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,850
Sarcastic? Unlikable? How old are those words?

619
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,690
These days, it's called chic and tsundere.

620
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,720
And I'm exploding with that kind of charm.

621
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,930
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

622
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,020
What are you so busy with that you can't answer your phone?

623
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,210
I was meeting up with some people. Why?

624
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:09,230
I withdrew the marriage annulment lawsuit with Hong Mandoo's President.

625
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,950
Okay.

626
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,940
Marriage? Cancellation?

627
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,260
Withdrew...a lawsuit?

628
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,710
I think I know why Hong Mandoo's President became your stepfather.

629
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,430
What is it?

630
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:28,980
Do I really have to tell you?

631
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,400
Hm?

632
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,220
Alright. You and Go Nan Gil grew up here

633
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,870
and were right next to each other ever since elementary school.

634
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,190
I know.

635
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,610
- You know?<br>- Yeah.

636
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,970
But then... Don't you get some kind of feeling?

637
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,790
No, I don't.

638
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:01,050
Alright. It's said that elementary school class reunions are a worldwide trend right now.

639
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,010
Why do you think that is?

640
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,310
It's because you don't forget the things you saw and felt when you were younger.

641
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:22,400
If someone does something that's so shocking that no one in the entire world can understand it,

642
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,170
then what do you think the reason would be?

643
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,190
Is the reason that Go Nan Gil became my stepfather that shocking?

644
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,540
You said that he got married when he was still young and in his prime. He's not cancelling that either.

645
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,270
- He's not cancelling it?<br>- Of course not.

646
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,770
He's also insisting that he'll take responsibility for everything while just making dumplings and living like a Buddhist monk.

647
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,020
He also definitely has to fight with Dada Finance.

648
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,000
A person gets sucked dry if they don't pay that back there.

649
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,810
What's the reason that he's doing all this?

650
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,920
Don't you get a hunch?

651
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,410
<i>Come to the lake!</i>

652
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,690
Boss. I really love it that there's a person that ties you into knots like this.

653
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,430
I love it! Makes living worthwhile.

654
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,390
<i>People tell a lot of lies as they live their lives.</i>

655
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,390
<i>They fool other people, and they fool themselves.</i>

656
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:39,670
<i>That's why you need at least one place</i>

657
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,800
<i>where you can face the truth.</i>

658
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,000
<i>You can't ever lie here.</i>

659
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,090
<i>That's why this place will become the most comfortable, free,</i>

660
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,580
<i>and beautiful place in the world.</i>

661
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,740
You know this place too, I see.

662
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,330
Then you'd also know that you can't tell a lie here.

663
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,270
That's why I have something to give you.

664
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,110
Your mother's cellphone. I still haven't gotten rid of it yet.

665
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,880
Back then, Dada Finance knew that your mother was alive,

666
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,350
and kept contacting her.

667
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,960
I couldn't give it to you because I was worried that they'd get in contact with you.

668
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,100
I didn't think I had the right to get rid of it, since Mother was your parent.

669
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,490
That's right.

670
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,200
I'll take care of it.

671
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,880
I heard that Dada Finance is dangerous.

672
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,220
I don't know what promise you made with Mom or when you made it,

673
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,600
but Mom isn't here. You've paid it back.

674
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,230
I made a promise to your mom at her funeral.

675
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,210
What promise?

676
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,820
That's I'd protect this place.

677
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,310
What does this place mean to Mom?

678
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,260
Weren't you going around trying to find that out?

679
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,450
Were you hard on me for not going to Seoul because you knew that?

680
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:18,770
What do you mean, I was hard on you...? Right, I was.

681
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,880
Since I can't lie here.

682
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,260
Find out for yourself what this place meant to your mother. Have you found anything?

683
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,960
- My nickname.<br>- Nickname?

684
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,240
Mom always called me Puppy and Pretty Puppy to my face.

685
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,780
My mom told others that I shoot venom out of my mouth.

686
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,580
All she did was talk about me behind my back.

687
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,850
She always called you Pig's Toenail around me.

688
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,830
She said that you were sharp and scary even though you were her daughter.

689
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,000
So she talked about me behind my back and made fun of me.

690
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,830
I'm going to have to act like her, seriously.

691
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,240
Then...promise me, as well.

692
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,770
If you come out of Dada Finance scared, then you'll quit.

693
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,760
Okay.

694
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,310
I have another one, too.

695
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:22,260
If you suddenly want to quit living like a Buddhist monk making dumplings and want to leave one day, you can.

696
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,590
Buddhist monk?

697
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,840
Someone said that you're living like a Buddhist monk at such a young age.

698
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,330
Do you have a girlfriend? Have you ever dated someone?

699
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,260
Have you ever gone on a date?

700
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,670

I asked you not ever to meet up with Hong Na Ri.

752
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,890
You overreact as soon as that woman is even brought up.

753
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:15,670
Do you think I would also tell you that I stopped by the prison as well?
