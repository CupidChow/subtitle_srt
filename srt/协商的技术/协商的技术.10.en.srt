What happened?

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,679
There was a withdrawal of
100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,990
But they weren't accounted for.

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,320
- In cash? - Yes.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,630
Withdrawals must be approved
by CEO Lee Hyeong Taek, right?

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes. And there is one more
person who can approve of it.

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,670
There could be a reason behind that.

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,480
Or it could be a mistake.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,450
We don't even know who
made the withdrawal yet.

18
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,010
Bon Joo!

19
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,180
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,110
You took a day off. You
didn't go away or something?

21
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,820
No. Did you come out for lunch?

22
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,020
Yes. I'm sick of eating in the cafeteria.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,890
Okay. See you tomorrow.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,460
Okay.

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,560
Bye. Watch out for the car.

26
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,680
I'll meet with Bon Joo first.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Hello.

28
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,599
Hello.

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,240
- I'm sorry to bother you. - Hello.

30
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,370
Is Ms. Jeong Bon Joo here?

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,940
Bon Joo?

32
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,040
She took a day off today.

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,410
But I ran into her at the bank.

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,420
At the bank? Which bank?

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,990
Sir.

36
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,570
Hello. What's this about?

37
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,300
You must be on your way out.

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,070
Yes. Why do you ask?

39
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,670
I need to talk to you.

40
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,910
Could you spare me a moment of your time?

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,610
I need to get going now.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,450
What's this about?

43
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,119
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,180
- How much? - All of it.

45
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,420
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo?

46
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,890
Yes.

47
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,190
You want to withdraw everything in cash?

48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,330
Yes.

49
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,660
Why? Is it not possible?

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,100
No. Hold on.

51
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
What?

52
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,080
Mr. Yoon. Don't you think
you're being unreasonable now?

53
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,150
How could you after
conducting due diligence?

54
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,320
You know how hard I worked
for GREEN VIEW Country Club.

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,590
Are you suspecting me?

56
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,060
I understand your frustration.

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,090
But you're authorized to make withdrawals.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,530
So how much are we missing?

59
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,770
We're missing 100,000 dollars.

60
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,070
What?

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,940
Did you say 100,000 dollars?

64
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,240
If...

65
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,279
embezzlement is confirmed,

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,010
we must notify the Audit Team first.

67
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,780
After the Audit Team
investigates this matter,

68
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,880
they will decide whether or
not they will file criminal charges.

69
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,250
Let's find Ms. Jeong Bon Joo first.

70
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,790
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

71
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,889

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,030
Selling GREEN VIEW
Country Club is our top priority.

73
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
To do that, it's more important to
find the missing 100,000 dollars.

74
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,500
What if we find her and get the money back?

75
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
Can it go away as if it never happened?

76
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,810
It can't go away...

77
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,910
that easily.

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
I see.

79
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,450
Then I'll come back after I
meet up with some friends.

80
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,630
You know, don't you?

81
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,530
That's what everyone is talking about.

82
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,630
Everyone is utterly shocked.

83
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,639
We must find Bon Joo quickly,
so she can return the money.

84
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,410
Or this could be really bad for her.

85
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,210
Will she go to prison?

86
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,279
The punishment for
embezzlement is getting harsher.

87
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,380
So that's a possibility.

88
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,890
But we really don't know anything.

89
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,819
You know what she is like.

90
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,490
Bon Joo isn't the type
to discuss this openly.

91
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,130
Jung Hwa.

92
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,930
You don't know anything?

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No.

94
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,150
If we find her quickly, I can help her.

95
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,950
Give me a call.

96
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,950
I'll call you the moment I
get any news about her.

97
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,020
Okay.

98
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,490
Bye.

99
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,360
- Don't skip your meal. - Okay.

100
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,320
Hey, Jung Hwa.

101
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,090
Are you on your way to Seoul now?

102
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,230
No, I'm at the terminal now.

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
I just wanted to wish you a safe trip.

104
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,100
By the way,

105
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,640
would you be interested in seeing Moon Jin?

106
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,340
Moon Jin? Why?

107
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,640
You know,

108
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,310
Moon Jin is Bon Joo's closest friend.

109
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,650
She's taking a break now, right?

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes.

111
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,190
Is she staying at home?

112
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,020
She's probably in the hospital now.

113
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,720
Moon Jin.

114
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Soon Young?

115
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,770
I hope your arm is recovering well.

116
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,200
Yes.

117
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,410
I'll be fine once I have
one more surgery tomorrow.

118
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,440
How did you get injured?

119
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,040
At work.

120
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
Bon Joo told me that you
were working as a caddie.

121
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,050
Bon Joo? Did you see Bon Joo?

122
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,320
Yes.

123
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,850
We grabbed drinks
together. It had been a while.

124
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,660
Gosh, it brought back old memories.

125
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,460
I bet it did for you.

126
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,760
- You've been away for some time. - Right.

127
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,430
- Oh, yes. When did you see Bon Joo?
- Yesterday.

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,129
- Yesterday? - Yes.

129
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,770
- I see. - She visits me often.

130
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,470
It might be because she feels bad.

131
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,170
It's not like I got injured because of her.

132
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,380
My arm was injured
because the cart tipped over.

133
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,850
- The golf cart? - Yes.

134
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,920
But our customers were also
in the cart when it tipped over.

135
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,690
Other customers were badly injured too.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
How bad were the injuries?

137
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,830
Well,

138
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,430
they didn't have bone fractures like I did.

139
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,700
But there was a severe injury to the face.

140
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,840
They even filed a lawsuit against me.

141
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Really?

142
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,210
Were you able to settle?

143
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,410
Yes. They said they would be lenient.

144
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,050
I see.

145
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,680
Bon Joo took care of it.

146
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,720
She's the best.

147
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,420
Isn't she so cool?

148
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,590
Yes.

149
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:44,990
She was the one who
suggested this position.

150
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,100
She said I could make good
money if I was a good caddie.

151
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,729
I see.

152
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,070
- That's how you started it. - Yes.

153
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,100
At first, I turned it down...

154
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,339
because I'd get the job
based on her recommendation.

155
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,610
But if I didn't do a good job,
it would affect her reputation.

156
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,340
But she said she had already paid.

157
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,080
Pay for what?

158
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,849
To become a caddie, you
need to go through training.

159
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,920
But before that, you must put
down 300 dollars as a deposit.

160
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,450
She also paid for that.

161
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,120
But she still felt
responsible for the accident.

162
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,929
By the way, Bon Joo went to
the injured customer and begged.

163
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,640
The customer who demanded
100,000 dollars initially...

164
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,970
decided to just settle.

165
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,840
- Is that what she said? - Yes.

166
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,980
But I know that's a lie.

167
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,410
I doubt she begged them to settle.

168
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,910
She probably made a scene.

169
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,580
You know what Bon Joo is like.

170
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,750
I do.

171
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,209
It might seem Bon Joo
is always confident...

172
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,780
and doesn't care about what people think.

173
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,909
But she's so sensitive...

174
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,880
when it comes to inconveniencing others.

175
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,620
She's generous about other people's flaws.

176
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,890
But she's so strict about her flaws.

177
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Hello.

178
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm Jeong Bon Joo from
GREEN VIEW Country Club.

179
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,130
How can I get a meeting with
the manager of M and A Team?

180
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,500
- What was your name again?
- It's Jeong Bon Joo.

181
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,040
Yes.

182
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,210
Yes, thank you.

183
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,680
Ms. Jeong is in the lobby now.

184
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Hello.

185
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,530
You should go.

186
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,770
Well, the thing is...

187
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,670
- Moon Jin. - Yes?

188
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
The truth is...

189
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,320
- Hold on. - Okay.

190
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,890
- Jin Soo. - Attorney Oh.

191
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,290
Ms. Jeong is in our office now.

192
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,220
With the return of 100,000 dollars,

193
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,619
the company is considering...

194
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,660
ending the matter with your dismissal.

195
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't have it. I spent it all.

196
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,910
You used that as
settlement money, didn't you?

197
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,810
Yes.

198
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,780
Thanks to that, I was able to settle.

199
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,940
So...

200
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I'll just face the punishment.

201
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,490
Bon Joo.

202
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,090
Embezzling...

203
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,760
under 100,000 dollars can result
in 4 to 16 months of imprisonment.

204
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,660
Embezzling between 100,000
dollars to 500,000 dollars...

205
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,630
can result in 1 year to
3 years of imprisonment.

206
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
Then I'll probably serve a year in prison.

207
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,970
So I earned 100,000 dollars
in 1 year. That's not so bad.

208
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,510
Is this about Moon Jin?

209
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,180
Lawsuits are just unbearable.

210
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,350
I'd rather serve a year in prison.

211
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,560
("Golf Cart Tipped Over")
("Is Caddie Solely Responsible?")

212
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Then we'll handle it as embezzlement.

213
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
But I have a question.

214
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Sure.

215
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,680
If it's one million dollars,
how many years would it be?

216
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,690
What?

217
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,890
Are you asking what
your sentence would be...

218
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,130
if you embezzled one million dollars?

219
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,330
Yes.

220
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,960
Did you...

221
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,500
embezzle a million dollars?

222
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,570
No, not me.

223
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,460
What's going on?

224
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,260
Darn it.

225
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,110
(Passport)

226
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,860
What is this about?

227
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,660
Could you spare us a moment?

228
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,530
Well, I have to leave now...

229
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,060
for a business trip.
Let's talk another time.

230
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,530
Are you going to the US?

231
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Yes.

232
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,410
To take over the flower delivery company.

233
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Am I right?

234
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
My goodness.

235
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,990
Excuse us. May we ask you some questions?

236
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,770
Did you receive caddie training?

237
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Caddie training? Yes, we
all completed the training.

238
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,040
You have to complete
the training to work here.

239
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,270
We heard you had to pay
for the training. Is it true?

240
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,940
Yes, a 300-dollar deposit.

241
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,610
Pardon? A deposit?

242
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,709
But why? Unless it was needed...

243
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,579
to issue banknotes or...

244
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,350
Why would caddies be
required to pay a deposit?

245
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,150
We heard they had to pay a deposit.

246
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,660
The thing is,

247
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,560
do you know how often the caddies quit?

248
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,000
Ninety percent of them quit as
soon as they complete their training.

249
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,539
Then what about us? We fed them...

250
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,870
and even trained them.

251
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,270
If they run away because
they can't work as caddies...

252
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,840
The company has to take
care of all the expenses.

253
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,950
That's why they're all required
to pay a 300-dollar deposit.

254
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,580
They get it all back when
they leave the company.

255
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,050
So?

256
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,790
Did they get their money back?

257
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,990
They say we'd get it all back, but...

258
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,659
How would you get it back
when you're running away?

259
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
You'd sneak out in secret.

260
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,089
We at least received
training, and they feed us too,

261
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,130
so we can call it even.

262
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,659
Hey, they won't give us the
money back even if we ask for it.

263
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,370
I've never seen anyone
who got their deposit back.

264
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,200
I heard you never had to
pay such a deposit in the past.

265
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,910
Then when did it start?

266
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,040
It all began when that
cheapskate joined the company.

267
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,380
Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

268
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,180
Doesn't that make him a
bully, not a cheapskate?

269
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,150
A bully?

270
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,889
Then how did you pay the 300 dollars?

271
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,890
What do you mean, how?

272
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,190
Did you pay the company directly?
Or was it deducted from your pay?

273
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,029
Oh, they tell you...

274
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,960
to bring 300 dollars in cash
on the first day of your training.

275
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,000
That money is in our bank account.

276
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,300
I didn't see it in your asset list.
It must be a secret bank account.

277
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,770
Well, we have to return
the money to them anyway.

278
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,139
It'll only complicate
our financial statements.

279
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,340
So you've been managing it separately.

280
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,780
That's considered embezzlement.

281
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,510
No.

282
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,920
The money is all there.

283
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,379
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo said...

284
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,290
she wanted to use the money to
pay Ms. Park Moon Jin's settlement.

285
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,190
And she obtained the other
caddies' consent to do so.

286
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,829
Hey, weren't we donating that money?

287
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,830
I signed that form.

288
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,630
Me too. Wasn't that what it was for?

289
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,600
You signed a consent
form? Who asked you to do it?

290
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,800
Bon Joo suggested we use
that money to help Moon Jin.

291
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,169
I see. So, you all signed the consent form?

292
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,170
We did.

293
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,279
We all know Moon Jin suffered unfairly.

294
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
But why? Is that money gone?

295
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,180
The money should still all be there.

296
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,180
Bon Joo felt bad for what
Ms. Park had to go through.

297
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,890
She was injured herself,

298
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,660
but she had to pay the settlement money.

299
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,129
Bon Joo thought the company should
take care of the settlement money.

300
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,199
So she asked you
about it, but you declined.

301
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,599
The accident happened due to her
own mistakes while driving the cart.

302
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,070
Why should the company take care of it?

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,909
The cart that tipped over was an old one,

304
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,210
so the company is partially
responsible for the accident too.

305
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,640
Bon Joo had planned...

306
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,550
to take 100,000 dollars
out of the account...

307
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,150
to help pay Moon Jin's settlement money.

308
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
However, she found out that
the bank account was empty.

309
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,459
She confirmed that...

310
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,990
the entire balance was
transferred on October 11.

311
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,060
The total amount was
about one million dollars.

312
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,830
Isn't it the amount of the severance
pay he asked for, Mr. Yoon?

313
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,800
Yes.

314
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,570
We met at Seoul Station on October 11.

315
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,609
That day,

316
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,870
you asked for a million-dollar
severance package,

317
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,110
but I suppose you didn't
think you'd be able to get it.

318
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,150
Do you have evidence?

319
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,750
No, we do not.

320
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,520
All we have is circumstantial evidence.

321
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,150
The thing is,

322
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,420
for us to check the transaction
details of the account,

323
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,659
we'd either have to
take you to the police...

324
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,430
or hand the case over to
the prosecutors right away.

325
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,930
What would you like to do?

326
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,610
I was going to use it...

327
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,210
and deposit it back into the account.

328
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,920
That's also embezzlement.

329
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,830
Bon Joo.

331
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,060
I don't think you did anything wrong.

332
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,970
No, what I did was wrong.

333
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,130
That cheapskate is in the wrong.

334
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,880
(Tofu Village)

335
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,609
Mr. Lee probably thought of
the deposit when he found out...

336
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,220
that the country club would be sold, right?

337
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,879
He figured no one else
knew about the money,

338
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,390
so I bet he thought, "I should
take this money." Right?

339
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,759
Yes. Based on the date when
the money was withdrawn,

340
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,290
I believe he made the decision
during the due diligence process.

341
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,530
My gosh. I thought Mr. Lee...

342
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,700
worked really hard to
save the country club.

343
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,340
Who knew he'd do something like this?

344
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,610
He did work hard, but
in the wrong direction.

345
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,640
He just tried to cut costs, which
probably led to other problems.

346
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,250
He wouldn't even bother
to fix broken golf carts.

347
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,850
A typical bean counter, I'd say.

348
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,190
"Bean counter?"

349
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes. "Bean," as in a soybean.

350
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,130
A bean counter. A person who
counts beans, literally speaking.

351
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a mildly derogatory term for
an accountant or financial officer.

352
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,560
They don't care about the
quality of your product or service.

353
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,269
They're only concerned...

354
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,170
with improving your financial
statements through cost-cutting.

355
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,210
But why count beans?

356
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,280
Well, when you buy beans,

357
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,179
you should think about
using them to make tofu.

358
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,919
Good tofu. But instead, they just keep...

359
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,150
counting the beans. One by one.

360
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,290
Hence the term, "bean counter."

361
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,889
What's wrong with beans?

362
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,530
Nothing, Mom.

363
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,530
Goodness. Beans are so important.

364
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,999
We only use locally grown
soybeans to make our tofu.

365
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,069
I take out all the bad
ones by hand, one by one.

366
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,240
We handpick only the
good beans to make our tofu.

367
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,040
All right. Applause, please.

368
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,309
Thank you. This looks delicious.

369
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,680
All right, enjoy.

370
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
- Thank you. - All right.

371
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
- We can eat now, right? - Yes, let's eat.

372
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,790
Dig in!

373
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,820
You had each caddie pay 300
dollars for 4 and a half years.

374
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,830
That roughly amounts to...

375
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,560
one million dollars.

376
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,460
Goodness. That's a lot of money.

377
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,630
But...

378
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,100
you kept the money in a separate
account, not your corporate account?

379
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,269
It was only because I knew
we had to return the money...

380
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,510
You've said that several times already.

381
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,010
So, the total amount you
embezzled is one million. Am I right?

382
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,120
No, that is not true.

383
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
What is not true?

384
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,990
It wasn't one million dollars?

385
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,690
I didn't embezzle anything.

386
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,130
Keep this up, and we'll have
to hand this over to the police.

387
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,770
Will you still deny it?

388
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,340
Please contact my lawyer.

389
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,040
Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

390
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,180
This is Internal Affairs. You
aren't at a police station now.

391
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,380
Call your lawyer yourself.

392
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
(Director's Office)

393
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,710
Yes.

394
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,250
Mr. Yoon?

395
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,660
You're here. My gosh.

396
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,290
Take a seat. Let's sit down.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,670
I have a favour to ask.

398
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,470
See? I said you'd have questions
once you joined the board.

399
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,139
We're trying to sell GREEN
VIEW Country Club at the moment.

400
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,280
Yes, I know.

401
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,010
Chairman Song told you to sell it.

402
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,410
Yes.

403
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,180
But during the due diligence process,

404
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,390
we learned that some people in the
company committed embezzlement.

405
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,120
I see. And?

406
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,319
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek
embezzled one million dollars,

407
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,430
and Manager Jeong Bon Joo
embezzled 100,000 dollars.

408
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,130
What a hot mess.

409
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,300
They had...

410
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,330
a situation though.

411
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,370
You can call your lawyer
once you're at the police station.

412
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,339
Hand him over to the police.

413
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Yes, sir.

414
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,710
I told you. I never embezzled anything.

415
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,250
Sir, the attorney would like to see you.

416
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,650
- Attorney? - Yes, from the M and A Team.

417
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,730
(Interview Room 2)

418
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Here's a statement
regarding Ms. Jeong Bon Joo.

419
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
(Statement)

420
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:32,670
This was written by Mr. Yoon Joo
No and Attorney Oh Soon Young?

421
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,240
Yes. And it was approved...

422
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,710
by Mr. Cho Beom Soo, the HR director.

423
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,650
I see. But why would the
M and A Team do this?

424
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,750
It happened while pursuing an M and A deal.

425
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,150
Right, I see.

426
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,850
Then...

427
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,759
we're letting her go, right?

428
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Yes.

429
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,760
All right.

430
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,830
Oh, wait.

431
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,600
What about Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek?

432
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,000
He should be arrested.

433
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,099
And we'll make him cough
up the one million dollars.

434
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
We'll get that money back...

435
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,910
and use 100,000 dollars
from it as settlement money.

436
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,940
But he keeps denying it altogether.

437
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,350
How's Joo No? Is he doing a good job?

438
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,820
I'm sure he is doing a
good job. He'd better.

439
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,220
"He'd better?" Why? Are
you worried about something?

440
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,490
I think Director Ha got his feelings hurt.

441
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,260
Oh, come on. Director
Ha couldn't be happier.

442
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,370
Hey, play the song I like.

443
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Yes, sir.

444
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,910
You can do e-commerce...

445
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,250
while Director Ha does what he needs to do.

446
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,520
Then things will get even
better for Sanin, you know?

447
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
- Let's sit and enjoy the music. - Okay.

448
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Sit.

449
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,120
(Yoon Joo No)

450
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,190
Oh, my. I wasn't expecting
your call, Mr. Yoon.

451
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,630
What's this about?

452
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,000
Sure, let's do that.

453
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,060
Yoon Joo No, this fool.

454
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,560
He wants to buy me a drink.

455
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,459
I guess something happened
between you and Mr. Yoon.

456
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
Something happened?

457
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,830
Like what?

458
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,430
It's just that...

459
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,200
I was the CEO of Sanin Construction,

460
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,069
so I know his face.

461
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,710
He was the one who sold Sanin Construction.

462
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,610
Don't you hold a grudge against him?

463
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,450
I am not a fan of his.

464
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,150
Anyway,

465
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,520
what did you want to talk to me about?

466
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,790
Oh, well...

467
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,529
If you happen to know whether
or not the deal will go through,

468
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,560
I'd appreciate a heads-up.

469
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,699
For me, I don't have to
have this deal go through.

470
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,770
What matters more...

471
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,370
is building trust between us.

472
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,970
I see. In other words,

473
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,280
you're worried I might back
out after giving Yoon Joo No...

474
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
the runaround?

475
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,420
Director Choi.

476
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,650
How much did you get
as your retainer for this?

477
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,859
Pardon?

478
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,590
Do you think I'd spend that much
money just to discipline a mutt?

479
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,900
- Don't walk me out. Do your work.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,200
Get back safely, sir.

481
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,280
Will the price drop significantly if
the embezzlement is confirmed?

482
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
The total amount embezzled...

483
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,419
will be taken into consideration
when assessing the value,

484
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,290
but the company's ethics
will be put into question.

485
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,230
My gosh. Lee Hun Min will use it
to bring the price down like crazy.

486
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,900
He'll sue the employees
involved in the embezzlement.

487
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,800
That's why Mr. Yoon went
to meet with him, right?

488
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,680
Oh, my. Mr. Yoon, I'm
surprised you called me first.

489
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,450
I've been here. The food here is very good.

490
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,690
I thought I should come here when
and if someone offered to treat me.

491
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,630
This is on you, right?

492
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,390
Of course. Please enjoy.

493
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,300
I wanted to meet with you
to ask for your understanding.

494
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,970
While conducting due diligence,

495
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,310
we found out some GREEN VIEW
employees committed embezzlement.

496
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,150
How much?

497
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,079
The CEO embezzled a million dollars.

498
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,649
The financial manager, 100,000 dollars.

499
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,780
So, it's 1.1 million in total.

500
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,860
That's not a lot of money.

501
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,960
I trust you'll take care of it.

502
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,000
Yes, thank you for understanding.

503
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,299
We'll get the money back.

504
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,240
All involved employees will
face disciplinary dismissal.

505
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,880
You're good at your job...

506
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,450
but quite slow-witted.

507
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,680
Do you mind elaborating on that?

508
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,890
I can't possibly work with
those who have pocketed funds.

509
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,930
Everyone must be dismissed.

510
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,030
Are you implying a layoff?

511
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,540
Yes. Of every one of them.

512
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,990
Did something happen?

513
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,400
CEO Lee Hun Min wants
all golf club employees...

514
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,770
to be dismissed.

515
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,370
I did think this so-called
test was too easy.

516
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,280
(Chairman Song Jae Sik)

517
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,690
Yes?

518
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,460
Chairman Song. Director
Ha and Mr. Lee are here.

519
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,200
Right. Let them inside.

520
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,570
Gosh.

521
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,900
Take a seat.

522
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,180
What the chairman wants to know...

523
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,050
isn't whether the golf club can be sold.

524
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,350
It's your loyalty.

525
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,190
With laying off everyone?

526
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Correct.

527
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,120
He wants to see...

528
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,730
if you can dismiss the
employees for his sake.

529
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,530
So...

530
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,030
Do you think you can handle it?

531
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,340
Yes. Leave it to me,

532
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,240
and I'll develop it well for five years.

533
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,180
I love his straightforward answer.

534
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
Good.

535
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:27,849
He doesn't hesitate when it
comes to building apartments either.

536
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,850
I see.

537
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,550
And...

538
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,090
How was the land?

539
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,590
It was great, Chairman Song.

540
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,990
Since the intersection is close by,

541
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,060
it has good transportation.

542
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,760
And the new town is next to it.

543
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,400
As expected, you have a good eye.

544
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I was surprised myself
when I visited the place.

545
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Right?

546
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,610
Well, whatever.

547
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,810
Let's go hiking together.

548
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,650
We can talk on our way up.

549
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,020
How about it?

550
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,020
Sure, I'm in.

551
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,360
Even so, I think Chairman
Song has a hidden purpose...

552
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,630
in selecting Mr. Lee as the buyer.

553
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,460
What do you mean by that?

554
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,630
Chairman Song...

555
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,170
must want to build apartments again.

556
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,940
Mr. Lee is willing to
take over GREEN VIEW...

557
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,550
but demands the dismissal of all employees.

558
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,920
So apartments will go
up on the golf course land.

559
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Yes.

560
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,260
That must be why...

561
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,890
Chairman Song asked for Mr. Lee.

562
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,130
Chairman Song did regret...

563
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,040
selling Sanin Construction.

564
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,769
He must believe that...

565
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,110
the business will grow in
no time if he starts again.

566
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,750
What do you think?

567
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,250
Even if there's potential in construction,

568
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,450
Sanin can't jump into that business.

569
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,850
When selling Sanin Construction,

570
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,420
the promise was not to
run the same business.

571
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,390
The term may last for five years,

572
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,100
but the implicit rule is that
the promise lasts forever.

573
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,940
Despite it all, if Sanin starts
a construction business again,

574
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,070
Sanin will be breaking the law.

575
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,540
Even if it's done secretly, the
market will eventually find out.

576
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,090
- I'll be leaving, Director Ha.
- Okay. Great work.

577
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,070
In other words,

578
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,400
Director Ha's job...

579
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,040
is to keep it a low profile.

580
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,940
And Director Ha must be using Lee Hun Min.

581
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,910
Oh, my.

582
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,550
I'm making a comeback.

583
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,750
Warn those who were happy to
see me leave that they'll be sorry.

584
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,260
Say that you ask Chairman Song.

585
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,690
If he denies it,

586
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,430
you can't keep questioning him.

587
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,140
There's no way to stop it, is there?

588
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,040
We can't stop it.

589
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,980
This deal...

590
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,450
will decide whether you
become a director or not.

591
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,060
But isn't your future relationship
with the chairman more important?

592
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,900
So,

593
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,170
how about following the
chairman's plan this time?

594
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm saying this because
I get the feeling...

595
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,980
that becoming a director
isn't solely about the position.

596
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Mr. Yoon.

597
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,930
Good morning, Director Cho.

598
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,170
I approved what the M and A Team requested.

599
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,640
It must be about Ms. Jeong Bon Joo.

600
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,710
- Thank you. - No problem.

601
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,210
Ask away if you need help again.

602
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,180
Okay. Thank you for your trouble.

603
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,180
Is that all?

604
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,020
CEO Lee Hun Min
stopped by the headquarters.

605
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,860
Right.

606
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,960
He's the one buying
GREEN VIEW Country Club.

607
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,370
I see.

608
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,580
And so? Is he buying it?

609
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,980
Mr. Lee is demanding a full layoff...

610
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,310
as a condition of the acquisition.

611
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,560
Shall we talk in my office for a minute?

612
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,400
Unbelievable.

613
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,010
Laying off employees is not that tough.

614
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,140
What's more, corruption is involved.

615
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,810
Yes.

616
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,340
The two concerned employees
will soon be dismissed.

617
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,580
No. That's not everything.

618
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,080
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek...

619
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,990
has an accomplice in the Game Department.

620
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,220
- An accomplice? - Yes.

621
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,890
What does the Game Department do?

622
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,790
You made the inspection,
so you'll know well.

623
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,129
It oversees all support
to ensure clients have...

624
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,030
a smooth golfing round.

625
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,870
That same department manages the caddies.

626
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,210
And the claim is that the
deposit was embezzled there too.

627
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,510
Correct. That was what I heard.

628
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,850
It's not entirely unreasonable...

629
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,419
because if the company is being sold...

630
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,120
and the CEO pockets one million dollars,

631
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,690
the employees would feel anxious.

632
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,160
And they're the only ones
who know about the deposit.

633
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,700
Do you also believe there
might be an accomplice?

634
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,630
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

635
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,940
- There's a possibility. - Good.

636
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,470
Lay off some employees,

637
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,809
send the rest to training,

638
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,910
and give out packages. It won't take long.

639
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,810
Especially with the small
number of employees.

640
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,820
What? Do you want HR to do it?

641
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,690
No.

642
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,790
The M and A Team will do it.

643
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,870
Things are looking good for you.

644
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,470
- Good morning. - Good morning.

645
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,580
Good morning.

646
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,810
Let's have a short meeting.

647
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:13,850
All right.

648
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,820
CEO Lee Hun Min is demanding a full layoff.

649
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,090
Are you going to do it?

650
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,860
Isn't that breaking the promise?

651
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,089
As Mr. Lee didn't guarantee...

652
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,859
employee succession by contract,

653
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,200
he can make such demands.

654
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,130
What's more, he can use...

655
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,430
the employee fraud within
GREEN VIEW as the excuse.

656
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,700
Even so, laying off employees
unrelated to the embezzlement...

657
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,210
won't be easy.

658
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,379
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek claimed
that the Game Department...

659
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,750
had already embezzled
quite a large sum of money.

660
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,950
Could that be true?

661
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,690
We should confirm it.

662
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,220
Mr. Han Gil Su from the Game Department?

663
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
That's me.

664
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,360
Why did you want to see me?

665
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,760
You know that CEO Lee Hyeong
Taek embezzled money, yes?

666
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,630
I do.

667
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,870
But he argues that...

668
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,009
it wasn't his doing...

669
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,810
but the doing of someone
in the Game Department.

670
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,510
That's why you're here, Ms. Oh Jeong Min.

671
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,020
I swear...

672
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,080
it wasn't me.

673
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,290
You're saying I also pocketed the money?

674
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,289
He didn't pinpoint you.

675
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,990
He said it was a Game Department employee.

676
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,970
Ms. Oh Jeong Min is also
being interviewed next door.

677
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,930
Yes.

678
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,510
Either way, it wasn't me.

679
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,810
If it wasn't you, was it Mr. Han Gil Su?

680
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,880
I checked the bank statement.

681
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,350
Money has been gradually
withdrawn for a while now.

682
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,890
Oh, that? I returned it to the caddie.

683
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,190
I see.

684
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,129
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo contacted everyone,

685
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,660
including caddies and former employees.

686
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,760
You know Park Moon Jin, right?

687
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,430
It's to use for the settlement money.

688
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,570
So what?

689
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:53,169
If a 300 dollar refund was issued,

690
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,970
was there a signed agreement
for its use in the settlement?

691
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,410
The caddies could be lying,

692
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,680
saying they didn't
receive it when they did.

693
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,979
True.

694
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,420
But if the story doesn't
match with the next room's...

695
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,350
We didn't use much.

696
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,390
Three hundred dollars each.

697
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,360
It was used for team dinners and such.

698
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,100
But...

699
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,930
Mr. Han suggested we use it.

700
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,670
So you admit to using the money, yes?

701
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,140
Is Ms. Oh Jeong Min...

702
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,940
blaming me?

703
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,450
Well, you're her superior.

704
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,280
Darn it.

705
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,750
She knew about it all.

706
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,750
Didn't we use it together?

707
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,090
Seriously!

708
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,630
But it was the CEO who
embezzled one million dollars, yes?

709
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,930
Yes, correct.

710
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,070
Darn it.

711
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,450
Hey.

712
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,890
I heard you were swamped these days.

713
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:19,160
Now that I've experienced
it, HR is no joke either.

714
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,790
Of course not.

715
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,770
Layoffs are the most difficult task of HR.

716
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,370
Especially a full layoff.

717
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,179
Our director was on cloud nine...

718
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,580
when your team manager took that task.

719
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,350
Thanks to Mr. Yoon, he's at ease.

720
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,290
- I'm leaving. - What? Why...

721
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,130
Dismiss both of them.

722
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,870
Understood.

723
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,240
But this doesn't feel right at all.

724
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,140
What doesn't?

725
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,080
Laying off everyone because
of this is wrong, isn't it?

726
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,150
Who's laying off everyone?

727
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,490
Was that what you thought we were doing?

728
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,990
Weren't we laying off everyone?

729
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,960
We can't dismiss innocent employees.

730
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,260
But others must think it's a full layoff.

731
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,570
Especially the HR Team.

732
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,600
I see.

733
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,240
I've already taken action.

734
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,210
The M and A Team is
working overtime every day.

735
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,579
As you know, layoffs
are a challenging task.

736
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,650
(Cho Beom Soo)

737
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,320
Yoon Joo No will climb up high.

738
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,630
He won't stop at the director.

739
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,740
By the way,

740
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,339
CEO Lee Hun Min won't
be able to run the golf club...

741
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,109
if all employees are dismissed.

742
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,210
So why is he making such a tall order?

743
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,520
You see...

744
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,490
Chairman Song seems to want to
start a construction company again.

745
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:30,660
But that's impossible.

746
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,519
There's a five-year non-compete clause.

747
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,460
Exactly. That's why I
suspect the chairman...

748
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,860
is using Lee Hun Min to grow
the business and then acquire it.

749
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,840
CEO Lee Hun Min is
demanding layoffs because...

750
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,570
The plan might be to build
apartments on the golf course land.

751
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,180
What will you do?

752
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,219
Shouldn't we advise the
chairman against this idea?

753
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,219
He's not openly stepping
back into the field...

754
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,690
nor do we have definitive proof,

755
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,990
so who are we to go up to him
and advise him against anything?

756
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,290
What do we do, then?

757
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,300
We seem to be out of options...

758
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,270
which is why...

759
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,400
we need someone who
has power over the chairman.

760
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,810
Does such a person exist?

761
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,120
It's been a while, Mr. Yoon.

762
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,290
Right. It has been a while.

763
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,360
Are you still at Sanin?

764
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,060
My offer still stands.

765
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:46,970
For now,

766
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,400
I still have a job there, thanks to you.

767
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,770
I'm not saying that just to be polite.

768
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,679
Because you took over Sanin Construction...

769
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,110
at a decent price,

770
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,820
Sanin was able to avert a crisis.

771
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,480
Thank you.

772
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,319
Do you know how much grief I received...

773
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,860
for acquiring it at a price that high?

774
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,960
I should've demanded a discount.

775
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,530
I believe the price was reasonable.

776
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,770
However,

777
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,840
for selling it at that price,

778
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,639
Sanin added a clause...

779
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,840
stating that it wouldn't work
in the same line of business.

780
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,279
For that price? Absolutely.

781
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,650
It'd be wrong to show up as a competitor.

782
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,280
Exactly. Hence this meeting.

783
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,090
I see. Why is that?

784
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,860
Is the chairman planning
something in secret?

785
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,529
I can't be sure,

786
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,930
but I believe it to be a possibility.

787
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,700
But...

788
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,370
why are you telling me this?

789
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,310
Aren't you one of Sanin's people?

790
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,750
You bought Sanin
Construction at a generous price.

791
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,280
I believe it is also my job to
see that you remain satisfied.

792
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,320
The generous price
includes after-sales service?

793
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,960
For purchasing it at
its full price, of course.

794
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,070
So...

795
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,130
What can I do about it?

796
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,910
Do you like to go hiking?

797
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,440
- This is nice weather we have. - Right.

798
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,280
Goodness. Chairman Song!

799
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,290
Goodness me.

800
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,459
- Ms. Ji. - Hello.

801
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,890
Are you on your way down from a hike?

802
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,460
The company's building
a new apartment complex,

803
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,500
and I wanted to receive some good energy.

804
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:00,870
I see.

805
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,570
CEO Lee?

806
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,140
That's right.

807
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,440
I see. What's going on?

808
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,480
What do you mean?

809
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,579
It's odd that you're all here together.

810
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,049
Those of us who like to hike...

811
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,919
got together to...

812
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,349
Yes, of course. And here I thought...

813
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,290
you were planning something behind my back.

814
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,490
Allow me to introduce you to
my company's lawyer and advisor.

815
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,360
The name's Choi Yong Seok.

816
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,059
Chairman Song Jae Sik of
Sanin. I heard a lot about you.

817
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,930
- Goodness. - What a pleasure.

818
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,270
I'm Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo.

819
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,470
I'm Lee Hun Min.

820
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,840
May I ask what it is you do?

821
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,250
I'm between jobs at the moment.

822
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,520
You must be a lawyer.

823
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,620
I passed the 27th bar exam. What about you?

824
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,919
The 38th, sir.

825
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,260
I see you passed it before Soon Young did.

826
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,729
Ms. Ji, we'll get going, then.

827
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,300
Yes, of course.

828
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,100
- I'll see you around, sir. - Sure.

829
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,010
Was I wrong to say that?

830
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,820
If we meet again, it won't
be for something good.

831
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,120
Shall we?

832
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,170
Scrap it.

833
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,870
Sorry?

834
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,180
Call my driver. I'm leaving.

835
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,580
What...

836
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,420
- Did you run into the chairman? - Yes.

837
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,560
Mount Bukhan has quite the view.

838
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,730
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

839
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,410
By the way,

840
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,850
wouldn't the chairman know?

841
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,620
That Mr. Yoon sent her there?

842
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,390
Yes. That Mr. Yoon...

843
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,960
is a tattletale.

844
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,690
Come on.

845
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,960
No way.

846
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,569
He can't be sure that I told her,

847
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,700
so would he ask me?

848
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,210
I guess it could've been me.

849
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,939
Sir, the project is too good...

850
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,180
to scrap altogether.

851
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,320
Since you got the wheels moving,
maybe you should keep it rolling.

852
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,689
That woman is wealthy, isn't she?

853
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,720
Sorry?

854
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,630
Do you mean CEO Ji Yeon U?

855
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,799
Yes, the company has a lot of capital.

856
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,030
Exactly.

857
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,769
Even her lawyer seems to be...

858
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,270
on an expensive retainer.

859
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,610
What if...

860
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:33,280
she sues us for breach of contract
once we get into constructions...

861
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,680
and tries to rob me of my money? What then?

862
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,150
Come in.

863
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,420
- Sir, it's Mr. Yoon Joo No.
- Right. Let him in.

864
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,630
Sure.

865
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,800
I'm here to brief you on the sale
of GREEN VIEW Country Club.

866
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,870
Go ahead.

867
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,409
During the process,

868
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,010
my team discovered
instances of embezzlement.

869
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
All those involved had
their employment terminated.

870
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,250
However, the acquirer, CEO Lee Hun Min...

871
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,020
CEO Lee Hun Min is the acquirer, sir.

872
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,820
He recently began working at a fund...

873
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,930
and has been negotiating
this deal as the acquirer.

874
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,499
CEO Lee requested that all of
GREEN VIEW's employees...

875
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,900
be dismissed.

876
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,570
In order to proceed with this deal,

877
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,710
we must dismiss all the
remaining employees.

878
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,539
That should be handled by yourself.

879
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,080
There's no need to
brief the chairman on it.

880
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:45,520
I only did so since the chairman
cares dearly for his employees.

881
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,350
However, selling GREEN
VIEW CC is also just as important,

882
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,020
which is why I wanted his opinion.

883
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,000
Scrap it.

884
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,270
Yes, sir. I appreciate
the wise decision, sir.

885
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,700
I'll excuse myself, then.

886
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,210
By the way...

887
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,250
- Yes? - You...

888
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,290
You're not cut out to be a board member.

889
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,990
You're dismissed.

890
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:29,960
Yes, sir.

891
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,650
You know, I was taken aback...

892
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,020
when I heard Bon Joo had embezzled.

893
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,090
Embezzlement like we hear on
the news? That's what she did?

894
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,090
Well,

895
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,459
I was going to ask all the
caddies for permission...

896
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,429
and spend the money accordingly,

897
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,869
but Lee Hyeong Taek stole the money away.

898
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,899
Still. Didn't you think you'd get caught?

899
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,400
Of course she knew she'd get caught.

900
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,310
Why else would she have
wired it to her personal account?

901
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,540
She immediately turned herself in too.

902
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,809
You should've reported the boss, then.

903
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,880
How could you have
taken the money yourself?

904
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,419
Then we wouldn't have
been able to settle in time.

905
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,480
Unbelievable.

906
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,550
Lee Hyeong Taek, that piece of trash.

907
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,049
Do you know what he did...

908
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,820
to cut costs at the country club?

909
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,129
But now it turns out
he took it all for himself.

910
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,190
What a jerk.

911
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,530
He really is a piece of trash.

912
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,399
Did Lee Hyeong Taek
give back the million dollars?

913
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,130
Yes. The settlement was
handled with that money.

914
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,570
Thanks, Soon Young.

915
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,210
What? What are you thanking me for?

916
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,040
Well,

917
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,810
I'm just glad you're our friend.

918
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,980
It was nice to see you after all this time.

919
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,490
- Sure. - Here you go.

920
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,789
- Have your fill. - Thank you, ma'am.

- Thank you. - Applaud.

922
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,860
You're the best, ma'am.

923
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,270
By the way,

924
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,939
it feels weird to have tofu after
getting caught for embezzling.

925
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,170
Take that.

- Chew before you swallow. - It's good.

928
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,780
Cheers.

929
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,410
You didn't become a board member.

930
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,110
Yes, I'm afraid so.

931
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,210
Joo No.

932

We're running out of time.

933
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,450
Let's give up.

934

No. Begin as planned.

Sir.

939
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,740
You should take a look at this.

Anyway, we still have a little
over two billion dollars to go.

945
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,870
It's 2.5 billion dollars.

946
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,370
Right.

947
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,310
He'll sell this time,
right? Or will he acquire?

948
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,710
Can't Mr. Yoon get the
money from somewhere?

953
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,860
