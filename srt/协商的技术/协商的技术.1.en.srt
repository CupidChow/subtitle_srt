I hear Yoon Joo No is coming.

10
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,269
That's crazy. Says who?

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,699
He's not even in Korea.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,639
Exactly. He's on his way.

13
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,679
Then a storm is coming.

14
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,349
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,389
we will soon arrive at
Incheon International Airport.

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,270
The infamous Yoon Joo No is coming?

20
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,729
Exactly. Yoon Joo No, the
legendary M and A expert.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,539
A few subsidiaries could be liquidated.

22
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:34,469
Don't let it be ours.

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,169
I still have a mortgage to pay.

24
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,239
If I lose my job,

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,809
I won't be able to pay my credit card bill.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,679
No wonder a sudden board
meeting was called today.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,819
Tell me about it.

28
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,118
I've never seen the
higher-ups that flustered before.

29
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,819
- Sir. - Hey.

30
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,319
Did you hear the news?

31
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:53,690
Unbelievable.

32
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,088
Not all M and A transactions...

33
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,330

34
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,659
Yoon Joo No could be coming here...

35
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,600
to have us acquire another company.

36
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,339
Hey, don't you see the news?

37
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,969
Rumour has it that we're going under,

38
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,039
so why would we buy anything?

39
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,038
Yoon Joo No is coming to give us the axe.

40
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,109
Hence the mayhem.

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,779
Thank you for flying with us.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,309

00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,650

{\an8}Do you even know what M and A is?

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,359
Isn't it the act of buying,
selling, and merging companies?

50
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,000
What did I even expect from a mere intern?

51
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:14,970
Sure.

52

Those who don't know better...

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,410
could think like you.

54
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,880
Hey, let me school you on this.

55
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,079
M and A...

56
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,419
isn't just buying and selling.

57
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,120

58

Why you...

60
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,729
Hey.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,699
What's a corporate body?

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,900
A legal entity, right?

63
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,739
M and A...

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,909
either combines
corporations or eliminates one.

65
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,910
Now,

66
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,680
let's say an entity was eliminated.

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,280
Isn't that murder?

68
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,250
- How is that murder? - You brat.

69
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,680
What happens when a company is sold?

70
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,119
Its employees will lose their jobs.

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,359
And then what? They won't get paid.

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,690
Then what about their families?

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,190
They'll starve, right?

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,329
That actually leads to people dying.

75
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,000
Layoffs are the same as murder.

76
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,430
Don't you get that?

77
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,440
I guess, but...

78
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:18,840
On top of that,

79
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,269
that guy Yoon Joo No...

80
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Hey.

81
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,809
Do you know what people call him?

82
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,720
What?

83
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,919
The White Snake.

84
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,189
- The White Snake? - Yes, the White Snake.

85
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,320
- A snake that is white. - What?

86
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,359
While moving soundlessly,

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,600
he swallows companies
whole leaving no trace behind.

88
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,229
Why the White Snake though?

89
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,798
Mamushi or viper could've
been a better choice.

90
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,999
It's to describe his cold-blooded nature.

91
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,640
Hey.

92
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,809
Why does anyone go through with an M and A?

93
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,410
Money. That's why they do it.

94
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,349
M and A is about selling companies...

95
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,248
worth 10 million dollars at 100 million...

96
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,189
and acquiring those worth
10 million dollars at 100,000.

97
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,520
Would an expert in that field...

98
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,918
even bat an eye...

99
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,058
when hundreds or even
thousands of pencil pushers like us...

100
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,330
lose our jobs?

101
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,160
He wouldn't.

102
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,429
That's why...

103
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,030
M and A experts...

104
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:24,840
are psychopaths.

105
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,640
Hence the nickname the White Snake.

106
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,239
In summary,

107
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,109
Yoon Joo No coming to
the main office means...

108
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,749
that it's already begun.

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,580
What has?

110
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Sir.

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
There will be blood
once Yoon Joo No arrives.

112
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,429
Exactly.

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,429
We need a contingency plan.

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,330
As if.

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,830
He worked under me for ten years.

116
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,030
Why should I be worried about his presence?

117
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,970
I thought...

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,270
it could've been Director Lee's
idea to bring in Yoon Joo No.

119
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,678
Director Lee constantly
mentions retirement,

120
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,280
but who knows what he's thinking?

121
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,849
What if Director Lee is
bringing Yoon Joo No in...

122
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,789
to use as his sword?

123
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,989
(Vacant)

124
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,270
Sanin head office, please.

(Lee Dong Joon)

126
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,580
Director, I'm at the airport.

127
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,450
Come in.

128
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,020
- Director. - Hey.

129
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,988
You should've gone ahead
rather than coming all the way here.

130
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,559
- It was on our way anyway. - Oh, please.

131
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,169
Now you know.

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,470
Now you know what Yoon
Joo No being here means.

133
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,210
Hello, sir.

134
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,809
As the volatility of the global
financial market increases,

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,280
the stability of the
financial industry decreases.

136
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,719
To this, financial
authorities have decided...

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,350
to call for risk management...

138
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,849
and have recommended banks...

139
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,149
to maintain the BIS
capital adequacy ratio...

140
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,359
at 13 percent.

141
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,830
However, that of Hanbit Bank,
which is Sanin's main bank,

142
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,489
is currently at 12 percent.

143
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,700
For that reason,

144
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,460
the bank has given word
that it'll not be extending...

145
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,929
the maturity.

146
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,799
Darn banks. They beg us to take out a loan,

147
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,140
but now they want it back.

148
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,210
Moreover, the debt
ratio of our Sanin Group...

149
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,780
is at 428 percent which
is somewhat higher...

150
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,150
than the average debt ratio of
the ten top major companies...

151
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:23,679
which sits at 250 percent.

152
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,118
That was already reported via documents,

153
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,650
so cut to the chase.

154
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,890
Samoel Fund has openly required us...

155
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,090
to decrease our debt ratio...

156
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,059
which has led to many
financial newspapers...

157
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,928
reporting our critical situation.

158
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,999
Some are even...

159
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,358
mentioning the possibility of a bankruptcy.

160
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,629
He told you to cut to
the chase. Are you deaf?

161
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,440
We're to pay back the
loan which is how much?

162
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,310
Right.

163
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:50,879
It's 11 billion dollars.

164
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,420
And the deadline?

165
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,619
The loan will mature at the
end of next year's first quarter,

166
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,190
but we must wrap it up
by the end of this year.

167
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,550
Are you kidding me?

168
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,519
Eleven billion dollars isn't chump change.

169
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,959
The bank isn't the boss of us.

170
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,930
Every company operates on debt.

171
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,600
At the end of last quarter,

172
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,128
the chairman promised to lower...

173
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,570
Sanin's debt ratio to 200 percent,

174
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,540
which resulted in our
stock price to stabilize...

175
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,009
and increase 11 percent that day.

176
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,679
It has maintained an
upward trend since then...

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,749
and is at 40 percent
higher than its lowest price.

178
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,920
But the stock price will plummet...

179
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,080
if we can't keep that promise?

180
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:34,249
Yes.

181
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,450
That's why we must pay back the loan.

182
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,690
You must work at Sanin.

183
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,930
That's a fine company you work for.

184
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,269
The best apartment
complexes are built by Sanin.

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,470
Check that out.

186
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:53,810
Those were all built by Sanin.

187
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,819
(Report on Samoel Fund's convertible bonds)

188
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Other than the bank loan,

189
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,389
we also have convertible
bonds held by Samoel Fund.

190
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,149
That's right.

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,219
Samoel Fund bought convertible bonds...

192
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,960
at the amount of three billion dollars.

193
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,830
And when does that mature?

194
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,859
In the first half of next year.

195
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,229
They overlap.

196
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,570
- We can extend that. - Yes, sir.

197
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,239
What are the terms of the put option?

198
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,638
If the stock price falls below 100 dollars,

199
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,210
which is the conversion price,

200
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,509
Samoel has the right to refix the latter...

201
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,609
or request the repayment of the principal.

202
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,949
What you mean is that...

203
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,109
if our stock price falls below 100 dollars,

204
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,019
- Samoel can claim all our shares?
- Yes, sir.

205
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,248
Should Samoel convert the bonds,

206
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:43,320
it will become...

207
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,560
our largest shareholder.

208
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,690
Unbelievable.

209
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,799
The chairman will collapse at the news.

210
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
What a mess.

211
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:55,669
However, the stock
price is currently stable...

212
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,129
at 150 dollars.

213
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,899
Unless we're met with a crisis,

214
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,408
I doubt there will be any trouble.

215
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm glad to hear that.

216
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,180
- What? - He's glad?

217
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,580
Unbelievable.

218
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,108
What should we do, then?

219
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,479
We're to pay back 11 billion dollars...

220
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,350
and maintain our stock price.

221
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,950
Yes, sir.

222
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,320
- At all costs. - Yes.

223
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,118
He's saying it like he wasn't the one...

224
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,358
who put us in this mess.

225
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,489
As you know, that's his specialty.

226
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,028
Unbelievable.

227
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,960
How did we get to this state?

228
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,070
As if that's the issue right now.

229
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,999
Tell me about it.

230
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,279
The press will probably be all over us.

231
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,340
Most definitely.

232
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,710
Now that the administration
is entering its second half,

233
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,450
it'll need an excuse for
mismanagement of economy.

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,179
If we make ourselves visible,

235
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,690
any support will go out the window.

236
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,249
Not having any support is one thing.

237
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,920
To make an example out of us,

238
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,790
we'll be beaten to a pulp.

239
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,830
Then Sanin might even cease to exist.

240
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:01,830
That is why the chairman gave the order...

241
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,939
to do our best as if our company's fate...

242
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
depended on it.

243
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,040
Director Lee, don't you
have anything to say?

244
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,050
Right.

245
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,690
That is why...

246
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:23,090
Yoon Joo No will be here.

247
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,790
By the way, what do you do?

248
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,759
I was wondering what
your role was at Sanin.

249
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,129
You wouldn't take your
eyes off those documents.

250
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,239
I buy and sell things.

251
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,810
You must be in sales.

252
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,779
What?

253
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,619
From what I remember, he's one with issues.

254
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,849
What would our employees think...

255
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,420
if we brought in someone like that again?

256
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,690
Exactly.

257
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
He must be shameless to come back here...

258
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,889
when he caused trouble and took off.

259
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:02,989
Director Ha,

260
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,799
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
What am I wrong about?

262
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,129
Correct me if I don't know the whole story.

263
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:14,869
Still, since he agreed to come here,

264
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,238
we should hear him out and...

265
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,509
Did you invite him here?

266
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,680
No, the chairman did.

267
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,350
Each member of the board...

268
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:32,289
must have their own opinion.

269
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,060
Why don't we get some coffee?

270
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,430
My head's throbbing as is.

271
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:39,759
- Let's go get coffee. - Sure.

272
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,670
Hurry.

273
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,009
- We don't want to wait in line. - Right.

274
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:09,359
- By the way, - Yes?

275
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,830
The members of the board
seem to hate Yoon Joo No.

276
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,470
Would you be a fan of his?

277
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:16,869
Especially for Director Ha,

278
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,899
this hits close to home.

279
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,399
How so?

280
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,670
The other executives are
worried about losing their jobs,

281
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,909
but Director Ha?

282
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,649
Yoon Joo No used to work for him.

283
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,879
- Really? - Yes.

284
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,949
Before Director Ha became
CFO, he was on the M and A Team.

285
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,119
(CFO: Chief financial officer)

286
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,350
I see.

287
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,389
Director Ha has nowhere to go now.

288
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,830
He'll either make CEO or be gone.

289
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,459
However, the chairman
is bringing in someone...

290
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,799
who used to work under Director Ha...

291
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,359
to do the latter's work.

292
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,340
Director Ha's life is at
stake this time around.

293
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,109
Hold on.

294
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,310
Now, we can go.

295
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,719
Why is the chairman doing this?

296
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,779
Why else?

297
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,989
So that they'd give everything.

298
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,090
Pit one against the other.

299
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,389
The winner stays while
the loser gets the boot.

300
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,029
What do you think will happen?

301
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,930
They'll both do whatever it takes.

302
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,869
Neither will want to lose,
so they'll go the extra mile...

303
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,529
and then some.

304
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,440
- Here are your beverages. - Right.

305
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:26,970
Thank you.

306
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,139
Coming through.

307
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:34,909
Come on.

308
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,460
Still,

309
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,590
Director Ha and Yoon Joo No...

310
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,430
aren't in the same weight class.

311
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,528
Director Ha ranks second at this company.

312
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,100
That has me curious too.

313
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,469
Does the chairman see Yoon Joo No...

314
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,499
as the future?

315
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,340
Or is he giving Director Ha...

316
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,138
the opportunity to evade responsibility...

317
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,040
by using Yoon Joo No?

318
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,080
As if we'd know how the higher-ups think.

319
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,550
Director Lee is here.

320
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,149
Was it really the chairman
who brought Yoon Joo No in?

321
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,619
I don't know.

322
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,830
Director Lee must've whispered in his ear.

323
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,060
I guess.

324
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,600
Director Lee is directly
under the chairman.

325
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,830
Maybe there's no particular reason to it.

326
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,570
Director Ha should now be CEO,

327
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,469
so he could've brought Yoon Joo No in...

328
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,509
to do the grunt work.

329
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,739
- I see you're on the younger side.
- Sorry?

330
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,649
You don't seem to know
how scary labour can be.

331
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,050
You're still quite young.

332
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,859
Either way, a war has begun.

333
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,729
If Director Ha wins, he'll be made CEO.

334
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,259
If not, he'll be fired.

335
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,170
If Yoon Joo No wins... Could
he become an executive?

336
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,669
Didn't you say he was a psychopath...

337
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,999
who only chased money?

338
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,969
Would they have him as an executive?

339
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,970
Hey.

340
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,580
- That's more the reason. - What?

341
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,980
His kind is loved by company owners.

342
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,780
They protect your money.

343
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,090
All right.

344
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,830
Hey.

345
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,929
Wait in the conference room.

346
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,219
- Sir, here's some coffee. - Yes, thanks.

347
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,730
Either way, he can't solve this problem.

348
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,990
That's true.

349
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,929
I mean, the amount is...

350
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,030
Eleven billion dollars is unheard of.

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,469
In the midst of all this, we also
have to defend our stock price.

352
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,969
So, what will happen if this fails?

353
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,810
What do you think?

354
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,010
Yoon Joo No will have to take
responsibility for this mess...

355
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:24,179
and leave the company.

356
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,689
Oh, then naturally,

357
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,990
you'll become CEO.

358
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,000
Fine, Yoon Joo No can come.

359
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,010
Since the decision came from the chairman.

360
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,580
But who will manage him?

361
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,179
He used to work under you,

362
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,448
and since you're the CFO of the group...

363
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:58,480
Me?

364
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,619
Well, Mr. Yoon has his
own opinions about things.

365
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,689
Tell him to set up his own team.

366
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,958
Director Lee, you could help
him out if he needs support.

367
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,959
By that,

368
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:11,760
he means he wants...

369
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,730
to clearly identify who's a friend or foe.

370
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,929
- Is that what he's saying? - Yes.

371
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:17,799
I guess Director Ha is confident.

372
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,868
Then who will join his team?

373
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,810
We'll accept applications.

374
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,609
M and A is popular, you know.

375
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,179
Should we apply?

376
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:27,948
Do you want to join a
game you're bound to lose?

377
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,010
In any case,

378
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,580
what is Mr. Yoon going to
sell first when he joins us?

379
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,679
As for what his plans are,

380
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,989
let's have him tell us when he's here.

381
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,649
Do we have to hear it
directly from Mr. Yoon?

382
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,889
I am the CFO of Sanin Group.

383
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,060
Right.

384
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,629
Then let's listen to Mr. CFO first.

385
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:03,908
(Sanin Group)

386
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:06,378
(Yukchamgoldan)

387
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,219
"Yukchamgoldan."

388
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,158
"Yuk" as in "meat,"
"cham" as in "to sever,"

389
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,659
"gol" as in "bone,"
and "dan" as in "to cut."

390
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,459
"Sever my flesh and offer
it while cutting your bones."

391
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,499
The group is in jeopardy,

392
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,330
so we can't sit back and do nothing.

393
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,570
We should cut out what
is causing a problem.

394
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,639
Let's take a look...

395
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,840
and find out what's flesh
and where the bones lie.

396
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,409
Here are the financial
statements of Sanin's subsidiaries.

397
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,480
First, Construction.

398
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,448
The numbers kept growing consistently...

399
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,580
until the sales figures went up twofold.

400
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,688
That was right after...

401
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:43,119
I took over Yonga E and C.

402
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,590
So, Construction is doing so well.

403
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,830
Then why is the group struggling so much?

404
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,129
All right. Look at the other
subsidiaries' numbers.

405
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,500
As you can see, most
of them are in the black.

406
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,439
Our hotels, entertainment business,

407
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,010
travel agencies, food
business. They're all in the black.

408
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:06,178
Goodness. I sense a bloodbath coming.

409
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,310
Go back to the slide before this.

410
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,809
What's that? Yes, Wind. Bicycles.

411
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,580
That company couldn't
even go public. Darn it.

412
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,418
All right. So, what does this mean?

413
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,149
Construction has been
supporting everything else,

414
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,888
but it has hit its limit,

415
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,059
so it can't go on like this.

416
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,589
So what do you suggest we do?

417
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,699
This tells you...

418
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,199
where the flesh and the bones lie, right?

419
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:29,770
Then it's time to cut it out.

420
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,199
We'll calculate the sales
and the total business profits...

421
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,438
and start selling the worst performers.

422
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,810
- What? - Goodness. That's...

423
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,608
Is this a joke?

424
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:41,780
Is this an audition to select
members for an idol group?

425
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,010
Why? Why can't we do this?

426
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,948
Even kids have to survive in
such a competitive environment.

427
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:49,050
We should work even harder!

428
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,290
Director Ha.

429
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,189
Then how many companies will we sell?

430
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,888
Until we reach 11 billion dollars.

431
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,300
What? Eleven billion?

432
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,569
Are you saying we'll sell
everything except for Construction?

433
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,039
But who are you to
decide something like this?

434
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,310
This is my job as the CFO of the company.

435
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,469
Don't you see this?

436
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:13,009
It doesn't matter how much
money Construction brings in.

437
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,050
The company has an 11 billion-dollar debt.

438
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,479
If we don't cut off Sanin's
arms and legs now,

439
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,918
Sanin will lose its head, thanks to you!

440
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,550
They aren't the only
ones who bring in money.

441
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,659
We're profitable too.

442
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,060
Right, Sanin Fashion.

443
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:32,030
All right, Sanin Fashion.

444
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,269
Total sales, 4.2 billion dollars.

445
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,330
Total profit, 29.8 million dollars. Right?

446
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,769
Why bother running this business?

447
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,269
Isn't it better to keep the money
in the bank and collect interest?

448
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,469
Last winter wasn't cold.
What were we supposed to do?

449
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,208
You see, fashion is
significantly affected by weather...

450
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,279
You should've known those
things and prepared for it.

451
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,350
Don't you watch the news?

452
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,678
Despite all the talks about global warming,

453
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,419
you made so many puffer jackets.

454
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,349
You couldn't sell them
even at 50 percent off.

455
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,850
Aren't they all marked
as unsold inventory now?

456
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:00,419
Ms. Min.

457
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:04,090
It requires a skill to
predict consumer needs.

458
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,629
All right, next.

459
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,129
Sanin Hotel. Goodness.

460
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,869
You said you'd hit the
jackpot after the pandemic.

461
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,708
You call this "jackpot?"

462
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,510
Well, honestly...

463
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:22,480
We need China's help.

464
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,878
What can I do? I can't control
the current political situation.

465
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,919
Right, exactly.

466
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,119
If you can't find a way
to control the situation,

467
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,590
you should just give up.

468
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,730
Well...

469
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:37,958
Mr. Yoon may have his
own opinion about this, so...

470
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,100
Mr. Yoon?

471
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,070
Do I have to wait for Mr. Yoon?

472
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,750
I apologize for keeping you all waiting.

473
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,209
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No.

474
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,580
Thank you for coming.

475
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,020
Do you know about the situation?

476
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,219
I've checked all the reports you sent.

477
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,219
And?

478
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,060
What do you think?

479
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,029
I'll submit a report once I'm
done reviewing everything.

480
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,159
"Review?"

481
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Oh, right.

482
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,070
I understand that the situation
may require a big sacrifice.

483
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:19,169
However...

484
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,010
What is this? Why does
everyone look so tense?

485
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Hey, you're here.

486
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:32,949
Sit.

487
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,300
Are you confident?

488
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,240
Yes, sir.

489
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,469
All right. Then what can I do to help you?

490
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,539
I need to put together a team that I like.

491
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,209
All right. You can set up your own team.

492
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,850
Go for it.

493
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,719
Well, how about some of you here?

494
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,820
Any volunteers?

495
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,119
Goodness.

496
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,189
Why? You've all done some thinking,

497
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,459
and you don't think this team will do well?

498
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,040
- I'm off. - Yes, sir.

499
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,780
Then please excuse me. I have
to go and set up my team now.

500
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,820
Oh, the one who had his hand up earlier.

501
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:46,189
Yes.

502
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,929
Come to the office by
5pm for your interview.

503
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,030
We'll talk then.

504
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,990
(Sanin Group)

505
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:33,740
Have you lost your mind?

506
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,770
You're doomed now.

507
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,179
Well, he seemed nicer than I thought.

508
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,480
- Everyone said he was competent.
- Why, you...

509
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,820
You don't even understand the
basics of working in a company.

510
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,989
Hey, for people like us,

511
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,359
it's always best not to be noticed.

512
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:58,089
If this goes well, I could
get a permanent position.

513
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,330
That's... Hey, why would you...

514
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:02,299
Hey, you shouldn't say that.

515
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,129
You don't understand
a thing about politics.

516
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:08,100
Hey, can a mere team
manager win against the CFO?

517
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:10,810
Yoon Joo No is bound to fail.

518
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,439
They're just dumping it on him. It's over.

519
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
You fool.

520
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,949
But what if Mr. Yoon solves this problem?

521
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,780
You said yourself that
he was a competent guy.

522
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,419
Competent? That's not important.

523
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,689
Hey, do you think 11
billion dollars is a joke?

524
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,329
You'll never touch that kind of money...

525
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,830
even after working 100,000 years
if you make 100,000 dollars a year.

526
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,368
Let's say there's a monkey that
saves 100,000 dollars every year.

527
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,898
Even if that monkey evolves into a human,

528
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,369
it wouldn't have 11 billion dollars.

529
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,240
- Hey. - What?

530
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,510
You're so good at math.

531
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,750
You punk.

532
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,249
You could never read
the room back in school,

533
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,520
and you haven't changed at all.

534
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,760
And you were so good at pulling
sly petty tricks back in school.

535
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,060
- You haven't changed either.
- You little...

536
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,030
Hey, you...

537
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,330
You can smile now, but
you really are in trouble.

538
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,770
(Reserved)

539
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:40,359
(We welcome all visitors.)

540
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,830
This way, please.

541
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,740
Min Jeong, the uniform
looks so good on you.

542
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,340
Thank you.

543
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:51,909
Min Jeong.

544
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,208
Did you use to work at the head office too?

545
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,350
What do you mean?

546
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:59,119
I mean, were you always this cold
to everyone at the head office too?

547
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,090
Or do you look down on
us because you used to...

548
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,689
work at the head office?

549
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,659
Min Jeong.

550
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:08,889
Do you think you'll go
back to the head office?

551
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,330
You need my support here.

552
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,300
Only then can you have a
bright future ahead of you.

553
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,969
You know what I'm saying, right?

554
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,240
Min Jeong, they're here for a consultation.

555
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:23,939
Okay.

556
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,310
- Hello. - Hello.

557
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,750
Is this one popular?

558
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Well...

559
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:35,619
Honey. Of course, she'd
say they're all popular.

560
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:37,490
She works for this company.

561
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:42,329
If we tally up your points,
you have 42 points in total,

562
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,990
so you're right at the cut line.

563
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,530
As for the 84m² units,
there are 5 in total.

564
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:50,830
So far, 2,380 people have applied for it.

565
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,740
The competition ratio
is a little over 43 to 1.

566
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,968
I believe the number of
applicants is going to triple.

567
00:29:56,969 --> 00:30:00,340
Let's say it quadruples.
Then it'll be 173 to 1.

568
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,750
See? She's just saying what she memorized.

569
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,550
Right?

570
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,580
Do the math, and you'll know I'm right.

571
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,879
One moment.

572
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,889
Forty-three. She said
if it were to quadruple...

573
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,159
Honey.

574
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,790
You get 172 when you multiply 43 by 4.

575
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,100
But she said 173.

576
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,669
I said it was a little over 43 to 1.

577
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:26,239
The exact number is 43.272727...

578
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,368
It's a non-terminating
decimal that goes on forever.

579
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,809
That multiplied by 4 equals 173.090909...

580
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,779
Again, a non-terminating decimal.

581
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,649
So, 173 is the correct answer.

582
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,449
Your brain works like a computer.

583
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:40,520
Not really.

584
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,350
Anyway, the math is correct.

585
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:03,469
If you're pregnant now...

586
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,639
How did you know? I am pregnant.

587
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,149
What? Honey, you're pregnant?

588
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,119
Mr. Yoon?

589
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:15,790
Mr. Yoon, how did you get here?

590
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,990
- I cabbed here. - Pardon?

591
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,290
No, I mean...

592
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,290
Did you get demoted?

593
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,560
Not exactly, but something like that.

594
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,070
Can you work with me?

595
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,369
Your consultation.

596
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:41,980
- Yeon Su. - Yes?

597
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,648
If you're pregnant, you
have more than one child,

598
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:46,750
so go for something else.

599
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,379
I wouldn't go for this unit if I were you.

600
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,030
When did you get transferred here?

601
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,540
A little after you left.

602
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,280
It was Director Ha's decision, right?

603
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,949
But I enjoyed the work there.

604
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,019
Why didn't you get another job?

605
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,389
You must've received many offers.

606
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,389
Offers? No, none.

607
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,800
I'm relieved to hear that.

608
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Yes.

609
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,669
By the way, where in
Suwon are we headed now?

610
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:48,010
Haerang Law Office.

611
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,050
Attorney Oh Soon Young?

612
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,189
- Uncle. - Yes?

613
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,689
Can't we order sweet and sour pork?

614
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,689
No, we cannot.

615
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,719
We had no work this month.

616
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,230
That's your fault, not mine.

617
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:04,389
You little...

618
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,270
Thank you.

619
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,030
Oh, here.

620
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,609
Listen, Mr. Attorney.

621
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,780
About the thing I mentioned last time...

622
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,678
But we didn't order this.

623
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,849
Just try it.

624
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,979
It's the best-selling dish here.

625
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
Thank you.

626
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:30,589
You know, I told you that the realtor...

627
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,990
had been badmouthing me.

628
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,830
I'm just wondering if I
can sue him for defamation.

629
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,530
That was the realtor?

630
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:40,229
What did he say about you?

631
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,499
That jerk said I used some weird meat here.

632
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,129
He kept lying to people about it.

633
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,600
Do you know how hard
it is to catch pigeons?

634
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:50,070
Well, the thing is...

635
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,080
There's defamation by
publicly alleging facts.

636
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:55,249
Then there's defamation by
publicly alleging false facts.

637
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,679
- Which one is it? - What does that mean?

638
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,719
What kind of meat do you use?

639
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:04,919
Pigeon.

640
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:10,659
Just kidding.

641
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,530
I was joking!

642
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,629
We only use the top-grade pork.

643
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,839
Right.

644
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,210
Then it's true that he spread
false information about you.

645
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:26,838
You two should just reconcile.

646
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,610
The realtor told me...

647
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,779
that you made fun of him for being bald.

648
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,449
Well, he is bald. It's not like I lied.

649
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,290
I said he's bald because he is.

650
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,819
Even when he wears
his wig, it's so obvious.

651
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,758
How's that considered defamation?

652
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,389
Well, that is considered...

653
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,460
defamation by publicly alleging facts.

654
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,329
It can cause emotional distress,

655
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,730
so it tends to be punished
more harshly these days.

656
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,068
There used to be more
emphasis on physical harm,

657
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:57,269
but emotional wellbeing is
equally important these days.

658
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,739
Whatever, I don't care.
I'm just going to sue him.

659
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,310
Just settle things between you two.

660
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,548
The realtor said his adopted
son was an attorney...

661
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:08,119
and threatened me.

662
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,049
Do people still adopt children these days?

663
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,960
In any case, I'm going to sue him.

664
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,989
We charge 50 dollars
for a written complaint.

665
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,729
Just make peace. You'll
regret it later if you don't.

666
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,028
No. I've made up my mind.

667
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:25,838
I'm going to the police station today.

668
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,839
I will sue him.

669
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,839
Listen.

670
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:33,480
Attorneys are like hunting dogs. Okay?

671
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,349
That's why I'm telling you to
bite down on that real estate guy.

672
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,818
I'll give you the money, okay?

673
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:41,718
If I bite down on that real estate owner,

674
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,189
it won't end there.

675
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,548
He'll hire an attorney.

676
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:46,719
And what will happen
if we go into a lawsuit?

677
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,159
You will win for sure, won't you?

678
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,959
Have all of those scumbags come at me!

679
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,999
Of course, I will win.

680
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,630
But attorneys don't fight each other.

681
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,568
His hunting dog will bite you down,

682
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:01,599
while I bite the real estate owner down.

683
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,269
It's the two of you who
will have the hardest time.

684
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,508
The attorneys will simply
earn money behind their desk.

685
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,778
Gosh, so what?

686
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:09,948
Just make peace.

687
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,350
Good grief. Hence why...

688
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,449
you have no money for sweet and sour pork.

689
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,689
Really, what a huge
scaredy-cat for a guy...

690
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,059
as big as a thug.

691
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,790
It's not that I'm scared.

692
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,529
And what thug?

693
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,460
I'm the cute type, you know?

694
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,349
(Green Tree Real Estate)

695
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,350
Son!

696
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,480
Have a cup of coffee.

697
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,178
Stop calling me son.

698
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,020
We don't have that big of an age gap.

699
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,150
Must we be blood-related
for me to call you son?

700
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,960
I call you that because I adore you.

701
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,659
Others are scared by
your unfriendly impression,

702
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,589
but I find you absolutely cute.

703
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,130
Come in.

704
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,299
I'm going ahead.

705
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:11,269
The one talking behind your back...

706
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,939
is the Chinese restaurant owner, right?

707
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,109
Did that guy badmouth about me even to you?

708
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,679
No. An attorney just finds out everything.

709
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:21,350
What now? We'll sue him, yes?

710
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,489
Just make peace with each other.

711
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,789
Didn't you start rumours that he
used pigeon meat for the dumplings?

712
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,759
Me? No. I never did that.

713
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,060
But you said so to me.

714
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,159
Is that so?

715
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,900
So what?

716
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,729
That guy started it...

717
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,039
by insulting my looks first.

718
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,069
Here's the thing.

719
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,068
It's easy to prove that...

720
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,980
the Chinese restaurant sales
dropped due to that rumour.

721
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:49,409
All that is needed is the account book.

722
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:51,449
But...

723
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,349
your emotional damage...

724
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,049
is hard to prove.

725
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,819
It's not like we can see the
damage by opening your heart.

726
00:37:58,449 --> 00:37:59,790
That's exactly what I mean.

727
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:03,129
Do you have any idea how hurt I was by it?

728
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,159
I know.

729
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,329
So just call your broken heart...

730
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,130
and the Chinese restaurant's
drop in sales even.

731
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,699
What nonsense are you spouting?

732
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,799
You can't possibly say that if
you realize how distressed I am.

733
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:15,609
Ever since...

734
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,310
that jerk said I was bald,

735
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:20,839
wearing this wig makes me embarrassed.

736
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,080
But not wearing it does the same.

737
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,779
I feel naked even when I'm wearing it.

738
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,819
And when I'm not, I feel like it's on me.

739
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm more upset at you...

740
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,529
for not understanding how I feel.

741
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,159
Well, right...

742
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,330
Think about it...

743
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,139
and make peace.

744
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,369
You...

745
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,579
(Haerang Law Office)

746
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,039
You have a guest.

747
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,409
What? A guest?

748
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,679
Attorney Oh.

749
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,779
Let's work on a project together.

750
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,088
You see,

751
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,819
I had the most fun working with
you, Mr. Yoon, and Min Jeong.

752
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,629
Fighting isn't my forte.

753
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,130
M and A is perfect for me.

754
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,669
You look fit for the MMA.

755
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,330
But M and A must be your calling.

756
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:24,909
By the way,

757
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,810
haven't I become cute
since we last saw each other?

758
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,449
Many neighbours said I looked adorable.

759
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,920
At this rate, I can't work
with you on this team.

760
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,929
Does that mean it'll be
just the two of us, Mr. Yoon?

761
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,230
I guess.

762
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,900
Oh, there's one more person.

763
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:57,368
(M and A Team)

764
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,178
Are you okay with how it turned out?

765
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,739
Well, I'm just here for an interview.

766
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:04,480
It'll be fine. This is what
people usually want.

767
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:07,719
It's quite old-fashioned.

768
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:25,600
Are you waiting?

769
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,439
Why are you coming inside?

770
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,339
To get a cup of coffee.

771
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:33,278
You drink coffee like it's water.

772
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:34,279
Hey.

773
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,250
Coffee flows in a company
worker's blood vessel.

774
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,710
Haven't you heard that?

775
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,989
Good grief. The M and A Team?

776
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,350
I feel bad for you.

777
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,790
- Why? - Jin Soo.

778
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,929
Come with me. I'll teach you.

779
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,429
What a hotshot team looks like.

780
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,540
Why that floor?

781
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,810
Right.

782
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,440
I'm indeed taking a mere intern...

783
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,110
to a sacred place.

784
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:15,819
Jin Soo. This is the highest floor.

785
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,190
There's another floor above us, no?

786
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,119
That's the chairman's office.

787
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,360
To the civilians, this
is the highest floor.

788
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,630
Here.

789
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,069
On the left is Senior Managing Director Ha.

790
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,069
On the right is Junior
Managing Director Lee.

791
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:50,489
Hey. Jin Soo.

792
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,960
Just look at this.

793
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,020
We have class, don't we?

794
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,099
Really, Jin Soo. You see...

795
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,230
Work with me,

796
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,429
and you get to drink high-end coffee.

797
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:07,439
But if you work in that hopeless team...

798
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,339
in that corner,

799
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,110
you'll always drink instant coffee. Got it?

800
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:16,350
What do you think?

801
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:20,449
Will you join me?

802
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,219
Are you recruiting me?

803
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,960
Depends on how you do.

804
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:33,100
But I heard Mr. Yoon was the heir.

805
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,900
Really?

806
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,069
I thought I was the heir.

807
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:38,770
No, listen.

808
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:41,739
The chairman refused
second-generation management, right?

809
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,239
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

810
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:47,279
That only made office politics worse.

811
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:49,909
You see...

812
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,650
The chairman has a
daughter he's been hiding.

813
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:56,250
He's going to have her marry Mr. Yoon.

814
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,850
That's why he said no to
second-generation management.

815
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,159
Who told you that?

816
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,830
I just overheard it.

817
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:04,889
- Is that so? - Yes.

818
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,159
Team Manager Yoon Joo No...

819
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:10,869
Is the chairman fine with him?

820
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:13,969
He's already married.

821
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Sorry?

822
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,869
Mr. Yoon is taken, punk.

823
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:20,440
He's married.

824
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,250
By the way, did you come alone?

825
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,619
Yes.

826
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:34,020
You should've come together.

827
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,529
Are you returning to
Korea for good this time?

828
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:46,299
Who knows?

829
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:49,610
Is it up to this project?

830
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,979
Once this project is over,

831
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,380
I'll likely be fired.

832
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,310
Whether it succeeds...

833
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,449
or not.

834
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,049
Anyway, if Yoon Joo No...

835
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,060
fails this project, he'll go down with it.

836
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,159
If he succeeds,

837
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:11,489
he'll lose favour with
Number Two and go down.

838
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,799
- Do you mean Director Ha? - Yes.

839
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:17,170
Rather than getting on the
bad side of the future CEO,

840
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,699
it's better to fail.

841
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,869
The company is politics
and playing favourites.

842
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:25,880
It's a historically unchanging truth.

843
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Jin Soo.

844
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,409
Did Yi Sun Sin die because
he was bad at fighting?

845
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:35,179
No matter how talented you
are, if you can't do politics, you die.

846
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,750
The minute you work for him,

847
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,690
you'll end up like Yoon Joo No.

848
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:41,790
You...

849
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,960
better think about how
to fail that interview.

850
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,059
(M and A Team)

851
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,069
Come in.

852
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,339
Hi. I'm Intern Choi Jin Soo.

853
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:59,409
Is there a reason you
applied for the M and A Team?

854
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,879
Yes.

855
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,539
I believe it was my chance...

856
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,310
to learn from you, Mr. Yoon.

857
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,349
Right now, our team
must raise 11 billion dollars,

858
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,250
while maintaining the stock
price in the 100-dollar range.

859
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,619
You're aware of it, yes?

860
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,460
We were in the same meeting earlier.

861
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,860
Yes.

862
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:18,830
How was an intern in that meeting?

863
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,330
I was setting up the refreshments...

864
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
when the meeting suddenly
started. I missed my chance to leave.

865
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,600
How much is our company's
market capitalization?

866
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:28,839
It should be about 19 billion dollars.

867
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,540
And after we repay the 11
billion dollars we must secure?

868
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,509
- The market capitalization? - Yes.

869
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,250
It's hard to tell.

870
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,109
How come?

871
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,380
Shouldn't it go up once
we repay that money?

872
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,690
That's already reflected
in the current stock price.

873
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,889
Does that mean it'll continue
to be 19 billion dollars?

874
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,190
No. There will be a change.

875
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:53,560
But that'll depend on Mr. Yoon.

876
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,369
You were even the president
of the stock investment club.

877
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,540
I'm Manager Yang Hyun A from the HR Team.

878
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:01,298
I'm texting you as you were offline...

879
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:02,569
in the internal messenger.

880
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:03,868
Provide your team member list,

881
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,469
and I'll process the position transfers.

882
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,739
Thank you.

883
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,179
Did you earn?

884
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,080
- No. - Manager Kwak Min Jeong.

885
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,379
Did you lose?

886
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,920
- Attorney Oh Soon Young. - No.

887
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,150
Why is it a no to both?

888
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,520
I don't know as I haven't
realized my return yet.

889
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,020
What's your price-earnings ratio?

890
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:23,529
It's 700 percent.

891
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:25,060
Goodness.

892
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,259
I was simply lucky.

893
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:35,540
Which team do you have in
mind if you don't pass ours?

894
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,839
Sorry?

895
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:41,980
Well...

896
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,119
Actually, someone asked
me to join their team.

897
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,520
Already? Who was it?

898
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:51,420
It may not be smart of me to say it,

899
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:52,789
but he was from the HR Team.

900
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,889
The HR Team is a top-rated department.

901
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,389
They must've liked you, Jin Soo.

902
00:46:58,159 --> 00:46:59,189
No wonder.

903
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,360
They're the first to
recognize a person of talent.

904
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,429
No, but I still prefer the M and A Team.

905
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,100
Does the HR Team have a job opening?

906
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:08,969
Did you say the HR Team?

907
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,069
The department that made the offer.

908
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,210
Yes.

909
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:19,210
Our HR Team?

910
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:21,080
No, we don't.

911
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,529
Are the two mentioned above
the only M and A Team members?

912
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,330
Yes.

913
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:41,770
Last question. Will this project succeed?

914
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,080
No.

915
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:51,949
Then why did you apply to this team?

916
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:54,880
To be honest,

917
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:57,619
I heard rumours about you, Mr. Yoon.

918
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:00,759
In the process of this project failing,

919
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,830
I feel like you'll do everything you can.

920
00:48:04,529 --> 00:48:05,889
There will be plenty to learn from it.

921
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,810
The project may succeed.

922
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:20,080
Yes, of course.

923
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,810
Let's see how it'll go.

924
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:28,920
Did I pass?

925
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,119
I'm Kwak Min Jeong, in charge of finance.

926
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,420
I see.

927
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,060
I'm Oh Soon Young,
specializing in corporate law.

928
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:38,960
I do this and that.

929
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,400
Including Intern Choi Jin Soo,

930
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,639
it's three members.

931
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,210
May I ask a question, Mr. Yoon?

932
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,810
Yes, go ahead.

933
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:54,839
Are you...

934
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,710
married?

935
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,049
I am.

936
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,150
I see.

937
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,529
Good grief.

938
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,799
Your physical stamina is shocking.

939
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,429
To accomplish big things, you must
have good physical strength. No?

940
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,469
I haven't been able to work out lately.

941
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:25,210
But I'm naturally strong, Chairman Song.

942
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,080
It doesn't seem like it.

943
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,210
No, Chairman Song.

944
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,109
I'll become fit in no time.

945
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,350
Good. That's to be expected
to achieve great things.

946
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,350
When it comes to work,

947
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,089
it's all about physical strength.

948
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:43,560
Would you like a cup of tea?

949
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:45,029
Sure.

950
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,600
Gosh.

951
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,170
Is that from our company?

952
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,738
Yes.

953
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,710
It's a tumbler from Bareun Life.

954
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,178
Being eco-friendly is the trend.

955
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,778
Many youngsters buy it.

956
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:05,650
Making that will destroy
the environment more,

957
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:07,480
but youngsters prefer that?

958
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,319
You're right about that.

959
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,449
It won't sell for long.

960
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,290
Make ones that are cheap and pretty.

961
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,489
Understood.

962
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:26,770
I have a long way to go to
catch up with your insights.

963
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,210
Thanks for the tea.

964
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,350
- Director Ha. - Yes, Chairman Song?

965
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,650
If...

966
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:45,449
you plan to climb higher,

967
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,429
you must use your people well.

968
00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:52,889
There's no need for you to do it all.

969
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,100
Order people around. All right?

970
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,500
Yes. I'll bear that in mind, Chairman Song.

971
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,900
Hey.

972
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,669
What about lunch, Chairman Song?

973
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,969
I already made a reservation.

974
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,639
Let's have it next time. I'm not hungry.

975
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:10,310
Understood.

976
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,619
Saving...

977
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,949
the company is the top priority.

978
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:20,589
Sorry?

979
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,460
Oh, yes. I'll be sure to remember it.

980
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,630
Where's your car?

981
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,630
I parked it over there.

982
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,000
Go home. I'm leaving first.

983
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,670
Let's go.

984
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:33,969
Goodness.

985
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,779
Turn the side mirror.
I want to see the rear.

986
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:54,960
All right. Keep going.

987
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,730
Shall I drive you home?

988
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,730
I'm going to the Folk Flea Market today.

989
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,399
Are you free?

990
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,299
No, let's go to Cheonggye River.

991
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:13,440
Why does he suddenly want to see us?

992
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:16,710
Is he trying to pull rank again?

993
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:19,980
Here he comes.

994
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,349
- Director Ha. - Hi.

995
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,719
- Welcome. - Did you go hiking?

996
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,190
Yes, with the chairman.

997
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,360
What? Just the two of you?

998
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,460
Yes, we often hike together.

999
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:33,600
You must've had a little chat.

1000
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,969
He always repeats himself.

1001
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,040
"Take care of the
company. You must do well."

1002
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:43,469
But he was quite assertive today.

1003
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,170
It made me think...

1004
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:00,460
if I should come to terms with it.

1005
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,819
Given the chairman's age,

1006
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:05,190
I'm worried that it might
jeopardize the company.

1007
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,729
Gosh, yes. You're right. By
the way, did the chairman say...

1008
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,568
anything about Yoon Joo No?

1009
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:12,799
That was probably implied
when he told me that.

1010
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:16,338
That's all part of running the company.

1011
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:17,339
Right.

1012
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,639
Thank you.

1013
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:28,279
Sir.

1014
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,719
Please allow me to buy you a drink today.

1015
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:32,819
Let me make a reservation right away.

1016
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:36,588
This place serves excellent food.

1017
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,789
No, let's take a rain check.

1018
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,130
- I had some food with the chairman.
- I see.

1019
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:56,709
I wonder what's going
to happen to Director Lee.

1020
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,810
He'll have to leave soon, right?

1021
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,420
- Probably. - Yes.

1022
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:02,679
That sounds about right. Let's go.

1023
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,388
Sir, how much is this?

1024
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:07,259
- Would you like to buy that? - Yes.

1025
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,489
You seem to know a thing or
two about nacre. It's 500 dollars.

1026
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,860
That's expensive.

1027
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,130
That's a reasonable price for nacre.

1028
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,540
It does nothing for me as I
don't have that much money.

1029
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:24,469
How much do you have?

1030
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:27,179
Well, perhaps about 400 dollars.

1031
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:31,610
- Fine. - Thank you.

1032
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,279
Hey, stop that.

1033
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:36,889
Why do you want to waste
money on this useless thing?

1034
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,650
He told me this was made of nacre.

1035
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:40,758
Gosh, I don't care what it's made of.

1036
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:42,460
Why would you want to buy
a used table from a stranger?

1037
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:44,759
Let's go and have some noodles.

1038
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:46,529
- But that's... - Just go.

1039
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,960
Come on.

1040
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,968
Why do you want to buy that old thing?

1041
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:52,969
But it was...

1042
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,439
Darn it. That rotten jerk.

1043
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,509
He bombed my sale.

1044
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:04,179
- Here. - Thanks.

1045
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,849
Our childhood palate never seems to change.

1046
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,920
Never.

1047
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,219
That's why things like
this turn into memories.

1048
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,750
You're right.

1049
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,119
Why do you want to quit?

1050
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:19,290
That again?

1051
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,198
You and I have so many memories together.

1052
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,230
You're hurting my feelings.

1053
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,839
I just thought that it was
time to hang up my boots.

1054
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:32,110
I seem to become more ambitious with time.

1055
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,209
There's a saying that the older a bag gets,

1056
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,679
the more things it can hold.

1057
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:38,750
You have everything.
How could you want more?

1058
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,650
Well, I just want my people. That's all.

1059
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,190
Time takes them away from me one at a time.

1060
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,258
There's nothing I can do
when death takes them away.

1061
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:50,059
But having a living one
running away from me...

1062
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,130
doesn't feel good. Okay?

1063
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:55,500
You have so many followers.
Why would you say that?

1064
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:57,368
That's their attempt...

1065
00:55:57,369 --> 00:55:59,669
at taking over the company
because I said I wouldn't let my son...

1066
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,670
inherit the company.

1067
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:01,969
Naturally, how could
I trust their intention?

1068
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:04,009
That's why...

1069
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,110
I rely on you a lot.

1070
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:11,810
I'm sorry.

1071
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:18,119
But you're not interested in
letting Director Ha take over?

1072
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,089
Well,

1073
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,089
I need more time to observe.

1074
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,360
By the way,

1075
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:30,330
about Yoon Joo No...

1076
00:56:32,299 --> 00:56:35,400
I agreed to bringing him back
as it was your last request.

1077
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:37,440
But I don't trust him.

1078
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:43,980
You can't leave me until he finishes...

1079
00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:46,279
his job.

1080
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:50,149
I just want to take a break. That's all.

1081
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,790
What if he messes up again?

1082
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,659
If that happens,

1083
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,560
you'll have to take responsibility.

1084
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:58,130
Here's the thing.

1085
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,600
I trust you, not him. Did you get that?

1086
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,639
I got it.

1087
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:10,069
But...

1088
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:13,109
Yoon Joo No isn't what you think.

1089
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,110
Whatever. I've heard enough about him.

1090
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,508
My gosh, you poor thing.

1091
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,818
You're still naive at your old age.

1092
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:21,880
How will you survive without me?

1093
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,849
You were about to buy the
old nacre table from a stranger.

1094
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,759
Good grief. Unbelievable.

1095
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:29,389
Let's just enjoy our noodles. Okay?

1096
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,060
I have a question.

1097
00:58:07,299 --> 00:58:08,299
Yes, sir.

1098
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,799
Do you have another reason
for coming back to Korea?

1099
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:15,770
I know that you brought me back to Korea,

1100
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:19,839
so I could rescue Sanin
Group from the crisis.

1101
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,449
I simply asked if you had
another reason for coming back.

1102
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,350
Yes.

1103
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:31,719
If you are taking on this
project with that mindset,

1104
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:33,960
then don't.

1105
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:38,929
Joo No.

1106
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,659
If you handle this
project with that mindset,

1107
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:44,369
both the project and you will be ruined.

1108
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,759
(The late Yoon Joo Seok)

1109
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,029
I can't be...

1110
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,799
any more ruined than I already am.

1111
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:34,779
(Sanin)

1112
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,449
- You're here. - Everyone's here early.

1113
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,560
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

1114
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
I didn't. I got some sleep.

1115
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:44,989
Let's hear it.

1116
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,270
(Sanin Group's Total Sales)

1117
00:59:56,839 --> 00:59:58,738
It's true that the
construction subsidiary...

1118
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:00,679
is indeed supporting the
rest of the subsidiaries.

1119
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,310
But the problem is
that even Construction...

1120
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:06,649
is seeing declining profit margins
as the easing of regulations...

1121
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,849
for redevelopment
projects is being delayed.

1122
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,149
But if the laws change
regarding the construction sector,

1123
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,689
there could be momentum,

1124
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,360
so profit margins could go up again.

1125
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:16,658
So if we sell all the subsidiaries...

1126
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:18,028
excluding Construction,

1127
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:20,459
the market value would be
around seven billion dollars.

1128
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,500
If we can sell off the rest
and make seven billion dollars,

1129
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,529
is there a chance for us to
raise that to 11 billion dollars?

1130
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,270
It won't be easy,

1131
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,969
but it's not impossible.

1132
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,238
It's not impossible if we
get a good price on the sale?

1133
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:34,279
Right.

1134
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,778
But the problem is
that overall, their sales...

1135
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:40,719
aren't so high.

1136
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,920
Why is that?

1137
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:44,919
They failed to establish a
presence in the online market.

1138
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,290
That seems to be the main cause.

1139
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,258
Sanin's leading companies...

1140
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:50,759
make most of their profits from the stores.

1141
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:53,928
But our competitors began switching over...

1142
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:56,158
to the DTC model a decade ago.

1143
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:58,369
As of now, the online market
share is much larger for them.

1144
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:00,500
But in comparison, our presence...

1145
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,769
in the online market is minimal.

1146
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,770
Our fashion subsidiary is the only one.

1147
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,338
Well, to be honest, it's a relief...

1148
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,678
the company didn't go under
given the minimal online presence.

1149
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:09,310
Everyone shops on their phones these days.

1150
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,980
But...

1151
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,279
why won't they do it?

1152
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,718
We can now easily shop on our phones...

1153
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,049
and receive our packages by next morning.

1154
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,988
Honestly, I'm a bit shocked
that they still sell their products...

1155
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:23,420
only at the offline stores.

1156
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,290
And that Sanin still has no
presence in the online market.

1157
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:28,400
You must have been quite shocked.

1158
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,830
Sanin doesn't even do ads.

1159
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:32,730
- No ads? - That's right.

1160
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,439
As for Sanin Group,

1161
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,408
there's a series of subsidiaries
under the head office.

1162
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:38,468
With this kind of structure,

1163
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:40,380
the chairman's opinion
is extremely important.

1164
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,449
Even so, shouldn't someone tell
him this isn't good for the company?

1165
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,949
- Someone should. - Who?

1166
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:54,589
(Sanin Group)

1167
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,428
Hello.

1168
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:59,589
I'm Team Manager Yoon
Joo No of M and A Team.

1169
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,159
I will begin by presenting
my analysis of the company.

1170
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,039
Let me first tell you the name...

1171
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,940
of the project that aims
to raise 11 billion dollars.

1172
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,810
Let's come up with the name of the project.

1173
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:14,580
Gosh, this is the most important one.

1174
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,810
Naming is the hardest part.

1175
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,719
Since we have to take
on an impossible mission...

1176
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:22,279
This is a nice one.

1177
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,389
Project Mission Impossible.

1178
01:02:24,819 --> 01:02:26,020
- Too long. - Too long.

1179
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:28,060
Any ideas, Min Jeong?

1180
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,830
I believe this project will be
a huge momentum for Sanin.

1181
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:35,658
Project Momentum.

1182
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:37,630
Project Momentum.

1183
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:39,169
That doesn't roll off the tongue nicely.

1184
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,900
We're in the M and A Team.

1185
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,368
Jin Soo has a way...

1186
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:45,239
of presenting the obvious
as a new idea. Right?

1187
01:02:46,339 --> 01:02:49,779
M and A, Mission Impossible, and Momentum.

1188
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:52,810
It all begins with an M.

1189
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,150
The name of the project is...

1190
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,290
Project M.

1191
01:02:59,619 --> 01:03:02,020
I was able to thoroughly review
the company report you submitted.

1192
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:03,729
Thanks to your cooperation,

1193
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,330
my team and I were able to
complete our due diligence.

1194
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,159
Now, let us look at the presentation
we put together based on that.

1195
01:03:11,299 --> 01:03:12,428
As you can see, most
of the profit margins...

1196
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,600
aren't satisfactory,

1197
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:15,169
but since you also included
growth strategies for this year...

1198
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,339
along with the report,

1199
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,810
I have reviewed them together.

1200
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,669
Construction made up...

1201
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,110
for nearly half of last
quarter's revenues again.

1202
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,210
Yes. That's right.

1203
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,520
However, unfortunately,
the group is struggling overall,

1204
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:30,719
so the sale of some businesses
has become inevitable.

1205
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:34,719
Well, we're all aware of that.
Don't stall, and just announce it.

1206
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,059
All right then.

1207
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,159
I will now announce the
business we plan to sell off.

1208
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:41,699
If we sell off all the subsidiaries
excluding Sanin Construction,

1209
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,330
we might be able to come
up with 11 billion dollars?

1210
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,000
Right. But it won't be easy.

1211
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:48,838
Don't you think not
entering the online market...

1212
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:50,540
could give us a new possibility?

1213
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,880
There's an expression for that.

1214
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,210
The unscratched lottery ticket.

1215
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,008
Not entering the online
market could make it...

1216
01:03:58,009 --> 01:03:59,549
an unscratched lottery ticket.

1217
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:02,580
We could get 30 percent
more with that new possibility.

1218
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,750
No.

1219
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,388
As it will be a latecomer,

1220
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:07,920
marketing the company will cost a fortune.

1221
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:09,159
That won't do.

1222
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,259
So the construction
regulations can change, right?

1223
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,928
The government policies are favourable...

1224
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:14,360
to the construction sector.

1225
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,758
- The reason being?
- As the election is coming up,

1226
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:19,170
it's likely that they will try to
prevent an economic slowdown.

1227
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:21,568
If that happens, it will be good news...

1228
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:22,798
for companies like Sanin Construction...

1229
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,239
that have secured
businesses in prime areas.

1230
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:28,980
Sanin Construction is indeed
the core of the company.

1231
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:31,580
Right.

1232
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,179
Then it leaves me with no choice.

1233
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,850
We've gone over all the
subsidiaries in the group...

1234
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:40,819
and reached the following conclusion.

1235
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,329
(Sanin Construction)

1236
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,360
We will sell off...

1237
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,060
Sanin Construction.

1238
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:52,000
Have you gone mad?

1239
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,839
- With this strategy... - Hey.

1240
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,198
Sanin Construction is
supporting the entire group.

1241
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,710
If you sell that off,
we'll all go bankrupt.

1242
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:00,139
You won't go bankrupt even
if we sell Sanin Construction.

1243
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:01,739
(Sanin Construction)

1244
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,310
It will come close,

1245
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,609
but the group won't go bankrupt
even if we sell Sanin Construction.

1246
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,610
Yoon Joo No.

1247
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,350
Be quiet. You must have lost your mind.

1248
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:12,888
Why don't we hear him out?

1249
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:15,219
Hear him out? For what?
He's spewing nonsense.

1250
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:18,690
You...

1251
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,960
You're targeting me, aren't you?

1252
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,298
You're not here to save the company.
You're trying to bring me down.

1253
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:25,400
Am I right or not?

1254
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,269
Everyone here knows that
Sanin Group can't survive...

1255
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,500
without Sanin Construction.

1256
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:32,839
As you said,

1257
01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:35,809
the whole market knows that
Sanin Construction is carrying...

1258
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,179
Sanin Group.

1259
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,278
That's why the moment we announce...

1260
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:40,819
that we'll sell everything but
the core part of the company,

1261
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:42,750
Sanin Group...

1262
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,819
will go down.

1263
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:46,449
What?

1264
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:49,460
If we sell everything
but Sanin Construction,

1265
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:51,928
everyone will think that
we're selling companies...

1266
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:53,830
that aren't profitable and
keeping the ones that are.

1267
01:05:54,429 --> 01:05:57,900
In other words, we'll be
dumping them, not selling.

1268
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,100
If that happens, we
can't get a fair price...

1269
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,940
because no one pays a good
price for discarded products.

1270
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,409
With that direction, we can't
even get seven billion dollars.

1271
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,150
Then this project...

1272
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,650
will fail.

1273
01:06:15,819 --> 01:06:17,619
There will be a huge backlash.

1274
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,020
Right.

1275
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,488
Director Ha won't let anything
happen to Sanin Construction.

1276
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:23,520
That's true.

1277
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:26,730
But what is the right
decision for Sanin Group?

1278
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:28,859
Right.

1279
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,799
I will follow your lead too.

1280
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:32,500
Let's go with that then.

1281
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,100
What about you, Jin Soo?

1282
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:37,710
I do think you're right about this.

1283
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:39,969
But will the stock price hold up?

1284
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:43,279
Without Sanin Construction,
Sanin Group will be nothing.

1285
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,779
But Sanin Group won't get delisted.

1286
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,150
All right. We have to buy some time first.

1287
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,560
Even so,

1288
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:58,889
the value of Sanin Construction
is slightly over six billion dollars.

1289
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,360
There's news of easing
regulations in the construction sector.

1290
01:07:01,659 --> 01:07:03,230
We should be able to get
up to seven billion dollars.

1291
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:07,029
So listen. We need to come
up with 11 billion dollars.

1292
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:08,239
What about the rest?

1293
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,839
I don't have a solution that can
fix Sanin Group's problems at once.

1294
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:13,739
Once we sell Sanin Construction
and secure seven billion dollars,

1295
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:15,409
- we can look for... - You.

1296
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:18,310
Didn't you say you agreed with me?

1297
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,650
How could you stab me in the back?

1298
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:22,750
Yes.

1299
01:07:23,279 --> 01:07:25,420
I entirely agree with your opinion.

1300
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,060
"Yukchamgoldan."

1301
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:31,489
"Offer my flesh to secure my bones."

1302
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:33,889
I also believe in that direction.

1303
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:35,830
But...

1304
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:38,000
the flesh offered by Sanin Group...

1305
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,199
must be Sanin Construction.

1306
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,139
Hey, you jerk!

1307
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:52,350
My gosh, sir.

1308
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:55,949
Sit down.

1309
01:07:58,949 --> 01:07:59,949
Sit.

1310
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:07,699
So? How are things going?

1311
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,830
Well,

1312
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,569
we will sell Sanin Construction.

1313
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,310
At how much?

1314
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,678
At the current market price,

1315
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:24,210
we could get up to seven billion dollars.

1316
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,320
Nonsense. We should
at least get two digits.

1317
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:32,249
Sorry?

1318
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,719
Sanin Construction was my first project.

1319
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,060
That being said,

1320
01:08:39,389 --> 01:08:40,829
it should get its worth.

1321
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,370
Sir.

1322
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:51,168
Receiving three billion dollars
more than its market price...

1323
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,240
What's wrong?

1324
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,379
Can't you do it?

1325
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,020
Tell me.

1326
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:16,629
(The Art of Negotiation)

1327
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,629
{\an8}I believe we must sell...

1328
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,829
{\an8}the best bit for Sanin Group to survive.

1329
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:52,798
{\an8}The moment he said he'd
sell Sanin Construction,

1330
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,469
{\an8}it was over for him.

1331
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,270
{\an8}We can't pay you ten
billion dollars. Never.

1332
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,538
{\an8}Then I'm not selling.

1333
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,810
{\an8}He has no idea he's digging his own grave.

1334
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:01,939
{\an8}He's working so hard at
preparing his own burial spot.

1335
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,048
{\an8}I thought you were the negotiation expert.

1336
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:05,579
{\an8}Show us what you can do.

1337
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,110
{\an8}That lunatic.

1338
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,419
{\an8}M and A is a fight of contracts.

1339
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,589
{\an8}We will lose the war if we
let our emotions run wild.

1340
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:12,919
{\an8}What's the CEO like?

1341
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,490
{\an8}What are you guys? Thugs?

1342
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,690
{\an8}He's worse.

1343
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,089
{\an8}I'd like to buy it at a cheap price.

1344
01:10:19,329 --> 01:10:21,600
{\an8}We have to sell it at a high price.

1345
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,029
{\an8}(We will forever remember
our dazzling colleague, )

1346
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,370
{\an8}(the late Lee Yoon Hee.)
