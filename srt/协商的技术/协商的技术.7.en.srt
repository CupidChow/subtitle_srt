1
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,400
The suspect Yoon Joo Seok...

2
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,070
is your biological brother, right?

3
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,470
You're a piece of work.

4
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,540
Dozing off in front of a prosecutor?

5
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,220
Someone so young...

6
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,550
Young? You are young, right?

7
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,830
Come on. Aren't you on the younger side...

8
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,890
to be doing this?

9
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
You have some nerve.

10
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,430
What is it do you think I did?

11
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,469
With the information you obtained...

12
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,010
as an M and A advisor,

13
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,540
we think you purchased stocks
from the company you'd be acquiring.

14
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,710
Are we clear on that?

15
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,050
Yes.

16
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,580
Are you admitting the charges? Okay.

17
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,220
No.

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,790
No, I'm clear on what I'm being accused of.

19
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,519
That wasn't an admission of guilt.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Come on.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,190
So that's how it's going to be?

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,730
Mr. Yoon,

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,870
this is how much I was
able to find about you.

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,030
Do you see that?

25
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,100
All those files are related to you.

26
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,070
Insider trading,

27
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,240
illegal trading under a different name,

28
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,180
and professional negligence.

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,410
My gosh.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,980
Honestly, how much did you make?

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,980
I only ask out of curiosity.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,949
I say this again, but I...

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,090
Was it nice to earn a lot of money?

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Was it?

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,160
Over 1,000 people...

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,230
lost all their savings
regarding this matter.

37
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,140
They went bankrupt,

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,040
families were wrecked,

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,410
and some even took their own lives.

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,120
How does it feel...

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,550
to think about them?

42
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,260
I feel for them.

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,620
You feel bad?

44
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,890
Is that it?

45
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,330
I understand how I can be
suspected of insider trading.

46
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,330
- However... - I see.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,299
You're guilty of suspicious actions,

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,000
but, however, you're innocent.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,610
You're telling me to
present definitive evidence,

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
aren't you?

51
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,780
That's not what I meant.

52
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,950
Judging by your statement,

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,790
you seem to have circumstantial evidence...

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,760
but none that are definitive.

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,930
Am I right?

56
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,700
You punk. Now I definitely know
what you think of prosecutors.

57
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,850
Mr. Yoon Joo No.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,490
You're free to go.

59
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,890
October 11, 2021.

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,600
Current time, 5pm.

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,600
This concludes today's questioning...

62
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,070
regarding the charges of
Mr. Yoon's insider trading...

63
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,310
and illegal trading under a different name.

64
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,580
What ended it?

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,150
Our suspect died.

66
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,890
The investigation is
closed, so you're free to go.

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,110
(Episode 7: Classified)

68
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,730
Hey, Mom.

69
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,659
Are you just waking up?

70
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,770
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

71
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,840
I only have to be at the office by nine.

72
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Currently,

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,270
it's only 6am.

74
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,740
You have it lucky.

75
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,249
I have to be up at 4am, cook breakfast,

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,250
and be at the orchard before sunrise.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,519
Why did you call?

78
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,690
You have a car, right?

79
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,520
My car? Why do you ask?

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,560
You can lend it to Sang Hoon.

81
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,790
Why would Sang Hoon use my car?

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,259
Being a family means we share things.

83
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,600
It's for whoever needs it.

84
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,370
Exactly. But why does he need a car?

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,509
He looks good in everything being
the handsome young man he is,

86
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,780
and people approach him to
ask where he bought the items.

87
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,580
Telling them that will only do others good.

88
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,209
Besides, Sang Hoon can
sell the clothes himself.

89
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,749
You don't even need an
actual store these days...

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,950
but can make money selling things online.

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,149
To do so, he needs to meet various people,

92
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,460
so of course he needs a car.

93
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,530
Is he going to run an
online shopping platform?

94
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,290
Exactly.

95
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,459
Can you tell your coworkers
to buy some things?

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,670
Brag about your little brother too.

97
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,230
I don't have any friends at work.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,070
Also,

99
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,470
not everyone can run an
online shopping platform.

100
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,170
He's not just some nobody.

101
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,379
Your one and only brother is
trying hard to get something going.

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,550
Don't you feel bad for him?

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,509
Why should I?

104
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,119
(Parking)

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,220
Do you even know how much
money he borrowed from me?

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,650
If he needs a car, tell
him to buy one himself.

107
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,190
You think living alone in
the city makes you superior.

108
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,459
If only you knew how
troubled your brother is...

109
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,030
over the fact he can't find a job.

110
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,630
My gosh, this is heartbreaking.

111
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,840
I need my car for work, so I'll hang up.

112
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
My gosh.

113
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,480
- What's with the suitcase? - Oh, this?

114
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,950
I'm coming straight to
work from Gimpo Airport...

115
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,180
and might die of exhaustion.

116
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,350
- Were you on vacation?
- No, a business trip.

117
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,220
What business trip?

118
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,390
Just so you know,
secretaries can't answer that.

119
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,229
We must pretend not to
have heard, have seen,

120
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,630
or know anything.

121
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,370
Here you go.

122
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Thanks.

123
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,370
Anyway, why are you at the office so early?

124
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,940
You're probably aware that
my team has its secrets too.

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Of course.

126
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,450
How's the work as a secretary? Doable?

127
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
Well,

128
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,650
we're just a bunch of glorified servants.

129
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,950
I'll enjoy these.

130
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,620
- Have a good one. - Sure.

131
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,520
(Chairman Song Jae Sik)

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,710
Are you back from Jeju?

133
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,310
- Yes, sir. - What did she say?

134
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,810
Good work.

135
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,379
This confirms that Chairman
Song took out a loan...

136
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,280
of 50 million dollars with
Sanin's stocks as collateral.

137
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,720
Make sure this is kept between us.

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Of course.

139
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,620
I wonder why the chairman took
out a loan of 50 million dollars.

140
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,889
His own stocks were put up as collateral...

141
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,459
which means it was for something urgent.

142
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,060
Wouldn't the chairman have
that kind of money though?

143
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
What?

144
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,130
Oh, I mean,

145
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,029
fifty million dollars is a lot of money,

146
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,370
but he's the chairman of a major company.

147
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,969
Even a chairman of a major company...

148
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,870
would rarely have 50 million
dollars lying around in cash.

149
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,480
Besides, Chairman Song...

150
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,980
values the power of
control and ownership...

151
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,980
which is why his assets
are mostly in stocks.

152
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,119
Yet, he took out a loan
with the stocks as collateral.

153
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Something doesn't add up.

154
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,890
On what could he have spent that money?

155
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,749
- Mr. Chairman. - Morning.

156
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,150
- Good morning. - Good morning.

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,890
Nice. Talk about perfect timing.

167
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,950
I was actually craving some sugar.

168
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,320
Enjoy.

169
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,220
Anyway, the chairman...

170
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,230
must be in a tight spot.

171
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,530
He is. The interest rate is ten percent.

172
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,930
I'd gladly lend him that money.

173
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,540
Do you have 50 million dollars?

174
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,370
Of course not.

175
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,540
Then eat this.

176
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,110
It's tasty.

177
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,780
Thank you.

178
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,350
Forget the tea. I won't be in there long.

179
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,750
Sure.

180
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,390
I'm here to brief you, sir.

181
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,160
Sure. Come in.

Was there any word from Jeju?

183
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,220
It was rejected, sir.

184
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,920
- Is that all? - I apologize.

185
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,930
- You. - Yes, sir.

186
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,160
Call Director Ha in.

187
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,900
- Yes, sir. - And Director Lee.

188
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,560
Understood, sir.

189
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,810
He's summoning Director
Ha and Director Lee.

190
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Sure.

191
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

192
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,280
Of course. Understood.

193
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,290
What is it?

194
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,160
He called Mr. Yoon Joo No in as well.

195
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,230
I can't believe he's playing
with the big guns now.

196
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,829
- Yes? - Director Ha,

197
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,800
the chairman asked for you.

198
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,270
What? When?

199
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,600
He wants you in his office right away.

200
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,569
Sure. I got it.

201
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,840
(Director Ha Tae Soo)

202
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Wait. How is his mood today?

203
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,570
It's pleasant, sir.

204
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,380
Could this be about what I
was informed of yesterday?

205
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,150
That must be the case.

206
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,750
Have you reviewed the contract?

207
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,090
- Yes, I did. - Good.

208
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,030
I believe the chairman
took out a loan a while back,

209
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,400
using his shares as collateral.

210
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,130
He has to pay back the loan,

211
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,870
and he wishes to sell
his shares to pay it back.

212
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,700
You mean, he wants
to sell his Sanin shares?

213
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,740
Yes, he wants to do
it to pay back the loan.

214
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,780
He can't.

215
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,779
The market suspects...

216
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,050
that Sanin might not be capable
of paying its debt at the moment.

217
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,219
So, if the chairman sells
his Sanin shares now...

218
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,890
The stock price will drop.

219
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,420
Correct.

220
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,360
Then Samoel might go
ahead and exercise the option.

221
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,430
If that happens,

222
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,560
Sanin will end up in Samoel's hands.

223
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,150
By the way,

224
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,150
why do you think he needed
50 million dollars in cash?

225
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm not sure.

226
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,520
So, you don't know where he
spent the money either, right?

227
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,760
He's a man with strong pride.

228
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,030
I think he was stressed
out about it all by himself.

229
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,900
I'm the only one who knows about this.

230
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,330
Now, the two of us are
the only ones who know.

231
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,200
Right.

232
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,310
Come in.

233
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,070
Thanks.

234
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,080
Well...

235
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,450
There's nothing to worry about, sir.

236
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,020
It's not a huge amount.

237
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,250
Even so, there should be
many ways to pay it back.

238
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,260
Director Ha, what do
you think we should do?

239
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,760
We should choose a solution that
can benefit Mr. Chairman the most.

240
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,400
What might that solution be?

241
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,570
Well...

242
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,300
Sir, the current interest rate...

243
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,740
is ten percent, which is pretty high.

244
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,910
I suggest you switch to
a different loan product.

245
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,710
That will be difficult.

246
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Why?

247
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,620
The loan maturity date
is only a month away.

248
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
It's too tight.

249
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:39,360
That's exactly why we should
do it as quickly as possible.

250
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,289
If the loan application gets rejected,

251
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,090
or if we miss the maturity
date, we'll have a big problem.

252
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,429
A big problem? Why?

253
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,330
It's not like I borrowed
the money for free.

254
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,730
I've been told that you used
your shares as collateral.

255
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,870
That's right. So, they can take my shares.

256
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,300
You...

257
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,170
don't want that.

258
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,469
Why not?

259
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,140
Why can't he pay it back using his shares?

260
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,710
They're considered the
chairman's personal asset.

261
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,079
At the moment, the market
suspects that Sanin...

262
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,280
might not be able to pay
back the 11 billion dollars.

263
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,720
If Sanin fails to pay it
back, it'll go bankrupt.

264
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,519
So, what would the market think if
the company owner sold his shares...

265
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,720
in this situation?

266
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,589
"The chairman who knows the
company's situation the best..."

267
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,900
"is escaping first."
Everyone would think that.

268
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
I see.

269
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,500
You mean, people might think I'm
doing it to run away or something?

270
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes.

271
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,140
Goodness. Let them
think whatever they want.

272
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,640
If you sell your Sanin shares now,

273
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,750
other shareholders will also sell theirs.

274
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,480
Then Sanin's stock price could plummet.

275
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,950
Look.

276
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:42,550
It's not like a small drop in
our stock price will kill someone.

277
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,790
Even so,

278
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,190
you cannot sell your shares.

279
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,200
What?

280
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,269
When insiders or majority
shareholders are selling...

281
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,140
more than one percent of
the stock or five million dollars,

282
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,439
they have to publicly announce
it at least a month before.

283
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,309
However, we only have 29 days left now,

284
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,340
so he can't sell his
shares even if he wants to.

285
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,749
Don't you just have to
give a five-day notice?

286
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,320
No, the law has changed.

287
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,219
Insiders kept selling stocks
at their peak and exiting,

288
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,450
so to prevent that.

289
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,020
He missed the timing.

290
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,560
The 50 million dollars
must be paid back in cash.

291
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,630
It's 55 million, including the interest.

292
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,930
All of it must be paid back in cash.

293
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,830
I have no cash. My shares are all I have.

294
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,900
Well, sir.

295
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,000
Why would you need cash, sir?

296
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,969
If it's not paid back in cash now,

297
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,610
it'll cause a big problem down the road.

298
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,750
Are you sure about that?

299
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,610
Yes, sir.

300
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,780
The bank notified you to pay it
back when you still have 29 days left,

301
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,620
which means the bank
is probably aware of it too.

302
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,260
So, you should pay it back in cash now.

303
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,060
Right.

304
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,760
So, he should borrow money
and pay it back as soon as possible.

305
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,460
Will we sit idly by because
we don't have time?

306
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,630
Let's call everyone we can think
of, be it a bank or a fund company.

307
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,900
You said it must be paid back in cash.

308
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,600
What if rumours spread?

309
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,010
What?

310
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:12,610
"Sanin is running around
to borrow 50 million dollars."

311
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,550
What if such a rumour
spreads in the market?

312
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,609
"Sanin doesn't even
have 50 million dollars."

313
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,320
If rumours like that start going around...

314
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,250
It'd be better to just
sell the shares, then.

315
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,890
Hey, you heard that we couldn't do that.

316
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,360
Then what? What do we do?

317
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,200
May I ask you where you
spent the 50 million dollars?

318
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,740
Such arrogance!

319
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,870
Do you have to know that?

320
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,980
It's not like that.

321
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,150
I think he's just trying to
come up with some ideas, sir.

322
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,030
I bought a resort.

323
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,860
It looked nice.

324
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,370
I wanted to use it when I needed a break.

325
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,910
I see.

326
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,140
Of course, sir.

327
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,410
Every chairman owns a resort.

328
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,410
Of course, you should own one too.

329
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,010
You made a good purchase.

330
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,420
Are we good now?

331
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,050
Yes, sir.

332
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,390
Then may I see the purchase
contract for the resort?

333
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,070
Why do you need that?

334
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,740
What would you think
about selling that resort?

335
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Joo No.

336
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,419
You see, the companies
you're trying to sell now.

338
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,750
They're all like my children.

339
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,750
You know that, right?

340
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,120
- Yes, sir. - And you...

341
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,530
really can't stand my children that much?

342
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,900
Is that it?

343
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,599
It's okay for you to sell some of them,

344
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,770
but some are strictly off-limits.

345
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,780
Yes, sir.

346
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,990
Director Ha, do you suggest
I borrow more money?

347
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,760
Yes. That should take
care of the problem, sir.

348
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,929
Mr. Yoon isn't experienced enough yet,

349
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,100
so he doesn't really know
how the market works.

350
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,530
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

351
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,170
And you, Mr. Yoon?

352
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,340
I'll go through it again
and submit another report.

353
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
All right.

354
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,749
Whether you decide to borrow
more or sell it, you two figure it out.

355
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,780
Pardon me?

356
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,720
- You mean, Mr. Yoon and me? - Why?

357
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,390
You don't want to?

358
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,930
It's not that, sir.

359
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,460
I will work on it.

360
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,460
Yes. Understood, sir.

361
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,240
All right, then. You can go.

362
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,670
Get up and go.

363
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,350
- Director Ha. - Yes, sir.

364
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,520
Finish this before you go. It's expensive.

365
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes, sir.

366
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,070
It would've been better to tell
you about it in private later on.

367
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,540
I made a hasty judgment.

368
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,810
No, don't say that.

369
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,410
We have less than a
month left. We should hurry.

370
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,010
Anyway,

371
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,720
I guess he wants this to be a competition.

372
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,620
Will you be all right?

373
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,750
It doesn't matter.

374
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,030
This could be a good
opportunity for you, but...

375
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,470
Opportunities always bring crises.

376
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,870
Yes.

377
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,610
About the resort Chairman Song bought.

378
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,110
You don't know where it is, do you?

379
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,880
I don't know of any resort he frequents.

380
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,490
Director Ha didn't seem
to know about it either.

381
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,990
- Right? - Yes.

382
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,090
Hey.

383
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,060
- Did the meeting go well? - Yes.

384
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,600
Have you been to that resort?

385
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,000
Pardon? What do you mean?

386
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,070
Chairman Song said he bought a
resort because it was really nice.

387
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,340
Oh, did he?

388
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,210
I know nothing about it.

389
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,950
Thank you.

390
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,520
For what?

391
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Nothing.

392
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,420
The chief secretary must know about it.

393
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,590
Yes. But even if he
knows, he can't talk about it.

394
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,430
There's no way the secretary's
office handled the purchase.

395
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,000
They probably did it through a broker.

396
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,030
Probably, but I'm sure
they can't talk about it either.

397
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,600
They must've had to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

398
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,410
Right.

399
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,540
Anyway...

400
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,610
You're not actually planning
to sell the resort, are you?

401
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,650
Is there another way?

402
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,930
All right. I understand.

403
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,800
I'll meet with the chairman again.

404
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,530
Hey, Director Ha.

405
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,140
Yes, sir.

406
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,800
Do you think he's right?

407
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,570
He talked as though
we were in deep trouble.

408
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,940
Mr. Yoon?

409
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,380
I can't say he doesn't have a point,

410
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,480
but it's all an excuse.

411
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,420
Excuse?

412
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes.

413
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,090
He's practically an
outcast in the industry,

414
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,619
which means there's no way...

415
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,590
he can borrow that kind
of money in a month.

416
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,460
That's why he's saying that.

417
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,730
So?

418
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,270
Are you confident?

419
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,710
Yes, sir.

420
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,840
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

421
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,540
There isn't much Yoon Joo No can do.

422
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,410
Besides, he's too inexperienced
to handle something like this.

423
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,590
- Is that right? - Yes.

424
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,260
Oh, boy.

425
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,930
I really am getting old now.

426
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,830
I want to take it easy now.

427
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,030
Pardon?

428
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,640
Everyone says Jeju Island is nice.

429
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Should I move there?

430
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,180
My goodness. Please don't say that, sir.

431
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,050
Sanin can't operate without you.

432
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,050
You feel that way now because you're tired.

433
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,490
Let me handle the important matters.

434
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,390
Get some rest, and all will be fine.

435
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,260
Can I really do that?

436
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,000
Of course, sir.

437
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
Take a short break,
and I'll take care of this.

438
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
All right.

439
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,070
- Finish it. - Yes, sir.

440
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,210
Who do you think will
manage to sort it out?

441
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,610
Between Director Ha and Mr. Yoon?

442
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,350
Director Ha.

443
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,090
Really? Why?

444
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,459
Director Ha is very experienced...

445
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,920
and well-connected.

446
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,700
And you are rooting
for Mr. Yoon, aren't you?

447
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,770
Why do you think that?

448
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,270
Just because.

449
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,640
Hey.

450
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,880
It's not because he's good-looking.

451
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,580
Then why do you think it'll be him?

452
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,520
Mr. Yoon is kind of crazy.

453
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,560
- Isn't that a bad thing? - No.

454
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,690
I think you need to be a bit
crazy to get this sorted out.

455
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,329
I think he'll cause trouble
because he's like that.

456
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,460
Hey, watch what you say...

457
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,310
- Hey. - How did it go?

458
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,810
The chairman bought a resort...

459
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,120
with the 50 million dollars.

460
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,680
Oh, boy.

461
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,620
It won't be easy to turn
a profit with a resort.

462
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,160
Rich people don't buy
resorts to make money.

463
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,430
Really? How do you know?

464
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,800
That's what I heard.

465
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,670
Then why do they buy it?

466
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,830
It's like...

467
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,040
I guess you could call
it an expensive hobby.

468
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,969
It's like when ordinary people
like us buy an exotic car.

469
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,040
If an ordinary person buys an
exotic car, they'd go bankrupt.

470
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,810
Oh, right.

471
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,910
But there's no way Chairman
Song will go bankrupt.

472
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,050
I think he can just sell
the resort he bought.

473
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,749
He paid 50 million dollars for it,

474
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,420
so he can sell it for 50 million dollars.

475
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,920
Fifty-five million, with interest.

476
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,830
Right, 55 million dollars.

477
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,530
It'd be helpful to see if
it's still worth that much,

478
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,800
but I have no idea which resort it is.

479
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,430
Let's look it up, starting with the
ones in the 50 million-dollar range.

480
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,740
There will be many of them.

481
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,710
I know.

482
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,180
Oh, this is gone. It was good.

483
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,410
Do you want mine?

484
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,749
You gave me this earlier.

485
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,750
Right.

486
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,690
Mr. Yoon, you should try it. It's good.

487
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,060
Where did you get this?

488
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,560
It's from my friend.

489
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,430
Your friend?

490
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,660
Yes, from the secretary's office.

491
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,499
- Is this... - It's called gwajeul.

492
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,900
It's common on Jeju Island.

493
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,640
How do you know these things?

494
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I just...

495
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,510
I had it when I visited
Jeju Island a while back.

496
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,820
Thank you.

497
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,420
Really?

498
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,930
Hello, sir.

499
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,260
Hello, Mr. Yoon. How
may I help you this time?

500
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,930
I have a question for you.

501
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well...

502
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,210
About Chairman Song's
resort on Jeju Island.

503
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,210
Oh, yes. What was it called? DADO.

504
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,810
Yes.

505
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,450
DADO.

506
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,150
What about it?

507
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,689
How much would it go for?

508
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,950
If it were put on the market.

509
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,750
Are you selling it?

510
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe, if I'm happy with the price.

511
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,730
You didn't sell it last time,
even when I adjusted the price.

512
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,730
I feel very bad about that matter.

513
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,470
Director Kang. I'll call you again.

514
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,600
Got it.

515
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,570
Hold on.

516
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,140
What's this?

517
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,510
Something feels off.

518
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
How so?

519
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,689
It's like I'm the last to know...

520
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,560
I've been tricked into something.

521
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,090
What could it be?

522
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,130
This must be the place.

523
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,129
(DADO Hotel)

524
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,130
- Is it? - Yes.

525
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,170
That's the only accommodation
with the name DADO on Jeju Island.

526
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,870
I thought resort buildings would be tall.

527
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,810
It's famous for being
designed by Itami Joon.

528
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,540
And also for being very difficult to book.

529
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,350
Did you say Itami Joon?

530
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,250
- Yes. - "Itami?"

531
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,049
Is he Japanese?

532
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,319
He was a Korean Japanese
who had a love for Korea.

533
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,720
He kept his Korean nationality.

534
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,689
While travelling, he wrote many books...

535
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,929
and left architectures.

536
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,929
The architectures are
concentrated on Jeju Island.

537
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,100
Have you been there?

538
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
No.

539
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,830
I watched a documentary.

540
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,539
I get why Chairman Song would want it.

541
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,910
Will we...

542
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,270
inspect the place in person?

543
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,510
Should I make the reservations?

544
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,820
- Let's inspect it. - Jeju Island!

545
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,629
- Yes, Director Kang? - I have something...

546
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,630
to explain to you in person.

547
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,270
It feels like...

548
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,169
I made a mistake.

549
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,240
That's not true, Director Kang.

550
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,970
I understand where you're going.

551
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,670
But don't worry.

552
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,439
No. I still want to meet with you.

553
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,040
I want to inform you about the resort too.

554
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,610
I see. All right.

555
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,849
Head to Jeju Island first.

556
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,680
I'll go after meeting Director Kang.

557
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,020
Understood.

558
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,559
Standard, premium, and suite.

559
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,620
Shall I book the three?

560
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,230
That sounds good since
we must make comparisons.

561
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,059
The company won't know about it,

562
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,070
so pay with this card.

563
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,900
All right. I'll do that.

564
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,510
Standard is 700 dollars per night,

565
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,340
premium is 1,500,

566
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,850
and suite is 8,000.

567
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,480
Hold on.

568
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,050
How much was it again?

569
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Jin Soo.

570
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,190
Book the standard.

571
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,020
Oh, all right.

572
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,819
I'll book three standard rooms.

573
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,990
One standard.

574
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,030
Instead, make it 2
nights. It'll be 1,400 dollars.

575
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,630
Add breakfast to it.

576
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,560
After all, we're working on a weekend.

577
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,400
Book two rooms.

578
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,470
No. I'm all right.

579
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,270
Okay. I'll book two rooms.

580
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,939
(Samoel Director Teo)

581
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,649

(Samoel CEO David)

583
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,760
Mr. David.

584
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,960
Yes, Director Ha.

585
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,500
I'd like to talk to you.

586
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,240
How about a meal together?

587
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,670
A meal with you, Director Ha?

588
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,540
Yes.

589
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,379
Where should we dine?

590
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Well...

591
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,250
Okay.

592
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,390
All right. Sounds good.

593
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,490
I'll make the reservation.
Please come over right away.

594
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,890
Understood.

595
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,830
I thought you wouldn't want to go.

596
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,000
True.

597
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,970
There's no reason to have a meal with him.

598
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,770
But?

599
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,810
It's interesting.

600
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
What?

601
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,750
The things he does.

602
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,060
(Director Ha Tae Soo)

603
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,590
Darn it.

604
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,030
Goodness.

605
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
If only I could also manage
someone else's money...

606
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,840
and get a piece of the pie.

607
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,780
We, the secretary's office,

608
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,780
must work like Chairman Song's shadow,

609
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,220
not hide behind him.
Did I not tell you that?

610
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,520
You did.

611
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,559
Did you have to make him call over...

612
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,930
Director Ha, Director Lee, and Mr. Yoon?

613
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,430
But, you see,

614
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,470
it was a new task for us.

615
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,200
We simply followed Chairman Song's orders.

616
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,370
Exactly.

617
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,510
That's what hiding behind
Chairman Song means.

618
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,850
How is it working if you
only follow his orders?

619
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,880
Is that what a secretary does?

620
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,519
You are to read Chairman Song's mind...

621
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,120
and settle things without any trouble.

622
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,820
The secretary's office has
become a laughing stock.

623
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,900
Everyone is asking where
Chairman Song's resort is.

624
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,830
- My apologies. - My apologies.

625
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,140
From now on,

626
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,870
let's make sure Chairman Song...

627
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,670
doesn't have to revisit...

628
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,810
past discussions.

629
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,310
- Understood. - Understood.

630
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,750
Get back to work.

631
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,690
Excuse me.

632
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,430
The place may look shabby,

633
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,630
Enjoy.

634
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,000
But it's a must-eat place.

635
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,730
It looks good. I'll enjoy it.

636
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,400
By the way, Director Kang.

637
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,240
Regarding DADO Resort,

638
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,140
I got the information
from different routes.

639
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,180
Nobody will think it was
leaked from your end.

640
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,080
And I won't mention it either.

641
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,550
Well, you see...

642
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,220
The secretary's office was in charge of it.

643
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,389
I naturally thought
you were in charge of it.

644
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,660
But on second thought,

645
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,830
you couldn't have.

646
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,600
What do you mean by that?

647
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,630
Sorry?

648
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
I see.

649
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,170
So you had no idea.

650
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,210
Is there a reason I couldn't have done it?

651
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,680
Right.

652
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,750
I made a mistake, didn't I?

653
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,790
Feel free to look around.

654
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,659
Please try it on. I bet
you'll look good in it.

655
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,530
Oh, I'm good.

656
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,660
Hold it up to the mirror.

657
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,999
- This? - It's the last piece.

658
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The youngest worker
asked me to hold it for her.

659
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
But it won't fit her. It's too small.

660
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,770
I think it'll be perfect on you.

661
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,309
Please try it on.

662
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,640
It looks different when it's on you.

663
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,979
My gosh. Because you're cool-toned,

664
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,389
the bright colour looks great on you.

665
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,090
Look. Isn't it pretty?

666
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,020
I see.

667
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,089
This one is on sale, right?

668
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,059
Of course. The original
price is 320 dollars.

669
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,370
With a 50-percent
discount, it's 160 dollars.

670
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,130
Right.

671
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,410
Do you also offer employee discounts?

672
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,510
- Oh, are you a Sanin employee? - Yes.

673
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,549
As the discount rate is higher
than the employee discount,

674
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,480
it can't be applied.

675
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,020
But it's much cheaper
than the lowest price online.

676
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,420
- I see. - You look amazing in the dress.

677
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,530
Would you like to buy it?

678
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,360
Well...

679
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,700

680
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,910
Jin Soo.

681
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,080
- You got here before me. - Hi.

682
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,209
- Attorney Oh. - Yes?

683
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,179
You look different in casual clothes.

684
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,280
What? Do I look cool?

685
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,050
No, you just look different.

686
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,520
I'm last.

687
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,090
Hey.

688
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,520
We just came.

689
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,890
Is that so?

690
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,730
Why didn't you wear
comfortable clothes? It's a resort.

691
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,860
Should I have done that?

692
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,929
Will our inspection get busted?

693
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,060
That's not it.

694
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,300
You're always in work mode.

695
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,040
But we're heading over to work.

696
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,140
Maybe I should be driving the car.

697
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,880
No. I'll be in charge on Jeju Island.

698
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,920
But I feel at ease when I drive.

699
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,220
Relax. We're all the way in Jeju.

700
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,250
- Welcome. - Welcome.

701
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,119
- Please let me. - I'll do it.

00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,359
Here.

703
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,590
Thank you.

704
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,930
Great.

705
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,190
This is Room 117.

706
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,830
- Room 121 is over here. - Got it.

707
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,970
Thank you. Give me the key.

708
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,930
The key...

709
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,840
- Ms. Kwak. Get some rest. - Okay.

710
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,410
- Ms. Kwak. - Yes?

711
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,040
Here.

712
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,950
Get some rest.

713
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,950
Your room is this way.

714
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,870

715
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,940

724
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,240
Where are you from?

725
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,110
- Seoul. - I see.

726
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,480
How long will you be staying here?

727
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,550
Sorry?

728
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:10,690
The thing is, I'm here alone.

729
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:12,720
And I'm bored.

730
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,560
How about we become friends?

731
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,600
"Friends?"

732
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,809
Yes?

733
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,180
Ms. Kwak. If you've looked around
your room, how about a meal?

734
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,180
All right.

735
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,880
Attorney Oh and I will
wait at the restaurant.

736
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,950
Okay. I'll be right there.

737
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,059
See you again, Ms. Neighbour.

738
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,600
Right. Please excuse me.

739
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,110
- Do you need a receipt? - Yes.

740
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,739
Here you go.

741
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,910
- Thank you. - Thank you.

742
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,750
Over there.

743
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,950
Hi. Do you have a reservation?

744
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,420
Well...

745
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,260
Hey.

746
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,629
- Over there.
- Okay. Allow me to lead the way.

747
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,630
Okay.

748
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,000
- You made it. - Yes.

749
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,970
Thank you.

750
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,380
Here's the menu.

751
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,350
It's best to taste various dishes, right?

752
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,150
Yes, let's do that.

753
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,690
Should we order two a la carte...

754
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,259
and one course menu?

755
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,759
Listen. Since I eat quite a lot,

756
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,330
won't an a la carte be too little?

757
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,829
Do you want to order two a la carte?

758
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:01,970
No.

759
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,200
The course menu can be filling, you know?

760
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,670
Go ahead. You can have the course menu.

761
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,319
Two udon meal sets.

762
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,419
"A Jeju-style course meal
crafted with sincerity featuring..."

763
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,419
"rustic yet simple dishes
made with ingredients..."

764
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,589
"from pristine waters."

765
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,790
This one, please.

766
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,189
Okay. We'll prepare 2 udon meal
sets and 1 DADO course meal.

767
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,460
Great. Thank you.

768
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,560
Thank you.

769
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,930
Here.

770
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,530
Thank you.

771
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,270
How was your room, Ms. Kwak?

772
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,540
It was nice.

773
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,480
Yes, nice.

774
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,250
I found the indoor air to be quite dry.

775
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,450
Aren't hotels always a bit dry?

776
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,350
What?

777
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,320
We meet again, Ms. Neighbour.

778
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,190
Hi.

779
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,660
How do you two know each other?

780
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,260
We're neighbours.

781
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,430
I see.

782
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,429
I see. You guys live in
the same neighbourhood.

783
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,300
No, she didn't mean it like that.

784
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,670
She's staying in the next room.

785
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,040
- I see. - Okay.

786
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,150
If you don't mind, could I join you guys?

787
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:22,950
Sure. Please join us.

788
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,460
How long have you been staying here?

789
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Pardon?

790
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,170
Oh, I've been here for a
long time. About a year?

791
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,740
So you came to Jeju Island a year ago?

792
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,270
Yes, that too.

793
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,180
You've been staying
in this resort for a year?

794
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
Yes.

795
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,180
I love this place.

796
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,680
I see. Okay.

797
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,420
Sure.

798
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,820
Here are our noodles.

799
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,590
Oh, my.

800
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,989
- Thank you. - It's hot.

801
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,800
- Okay. - My goodness.

802
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,700
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

803
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,940
Did I upset you?

804
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,510
What?

805
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,939
No, I'm fine.

806
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,380
I'm just craving something spicy today.

807
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,050
Come on. Don't act like
you don't know what I mean.

808
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,590
I'm talking about the
purchase of my resort.

809
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,560
I understand, sir.

810
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,629
Seriously? Did you just sir me?

811
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,190
You're upsetting me when
you talk to me like that.

812
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,300
When it's just you and me,

813
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,800
we're friends.

814
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,140
Don't worry about it.

815
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,070
I'm sure you had your reasons.

816
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,450
Okay.

817
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,080
"The company is fighting an
uphill battle to pay off the debt."

818
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,189
"But the chairman who should
know better bought a resort..."

819
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,550
"and caused a mess."

820
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,690
Isn't that what people are thinking?

821
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,730
They will honestly think you
had your reasons to do so.

822
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,430
- Are you sure? - Yes.

823
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,470
Then why aren't you asking me
about my reason to buy the resort?

824
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,380
Why did you have to buy it?

825
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,250
So this resort...

826
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,750
It's Ji O's.

827
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,390
Are you saying the chairman
isn't the actual owner?

828
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,560
Right. That's it.

829
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,230
Then why did he keep it a secret?

830
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,160
That, I really don't know. I swear.

831
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,500
- I see. - Mr. Yoon.

832
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,900
You must keep everything
I told you today a secret.

833
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,010
Don't worry.

834
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,910
She said it was her dying wish.

835
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,150
So I bought it for her.

836
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,720
I see.

837
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,360
I couldn't tell other people about it,

838
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,530
so I couldn't tell you either.

839
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,530
You...

840
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,570
understand my decision, right?

841
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,170
Yes.

842
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,070
So...

843
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,540
is there...

844
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,410
any other way instead
of selling the resort?

845
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,810
She won't leave the resort.

846
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,630
Since you let me join you
today, it will be my treat.

847
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,500
No.

848
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,430
- Put it on my room. - No.

849
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,730
- Here. - It's already been paid.

850
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,870
Would you like to go for a swim?

851
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,570
Gosh. Well, that was...

852
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,939
Is there a swimming pool here?

853
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,310
No. But there's one in my room.

854
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,080
You must be staying in the suite.

855
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,150
Would you like to come? I can invite you.

856
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,219
- Really? - Yes.

857
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,860
I was curious about the suites here.

858
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,760
Well, if we're not imposing on you...

859
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,260
You're not.

860
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,770
I think she's filthy rich.

861
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,510
The lady?

862
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,439
She paid for our food.

863
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,110
And she's staying in the suite too.

864
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,650
She's been staying there for a year.

865
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,480
Her wealth must be on a different level.

866
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,280
I doubt it.

867
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,149
Rich people don't spend money like that.

868
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,560
Is that so? Then what's her deal?

869
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,960
Maybe, she has some kind of sad story.

870
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,359
- A sad story?
- You know, there are people...

871
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,970
who want to spend all of
their money before they die,

872
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,640
so they can leave without regret.

873
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Never mind.

874
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,680
She didn't look like that type.

875
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,300
- Yes, Director Lee. - Hey, Joo No.

876
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,000
It's about the resort.

877
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,270
Yes, I'm listening.

878
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,040
Are you seriously considering to sell it?

879
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,540
I believe we should.

880
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,540
I understand why you want to sell it.

881
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,850
But don't sell it.

882
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,220
The resort doesn't belong to the chairman.

883
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,649
So I said...

884
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,690
I'm aware.

885
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,419
- My gosh. - Hey.

886
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,620
How did you find out?

887
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,960
It turns out someone named
Song Ji O is the real owner.

888
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,830
Do you know who that is?

889
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,350
Have you tried this? It's really good.

890
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,890
Thank you.

891
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,500
My name is Kwak Min Jeong.

892
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,000
My name is Song Ji O.

893
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:54,910
I see.

894
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,240
Thank you for inviting us to your suite.

895
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,040
I should thank you.

896
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,410
You can just call me by my name.

897
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,720
Sure, Ji O.

898
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,490
Mr. Yoon?

899
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,330
Yes, he does look like Mr. Yoon.

900
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,760
Wait, it is him.

901
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,300
Mr. Yoon.

902
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,600
- Did you eat? - Yes.

903
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,170
I hope the meeting went well.

904
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,280
She's the chairman's daughter.

905
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,350
This is...

906
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,350
Hello, CEO Song Ji O.

907
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,820
CEO?

908
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,560
She's a CEO?

909
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,429
I guess she's a CEO of a company.

910
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,060
You are Ms. Song Ji O, the
CEO of DADO Resort, right?

911
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,840
Hello.

912
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,810
I'm the owner of DADO
Resort. My name is Song Ji O.

913
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,680
- I should've paid for the meal. - The CEO?

914
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,260
I've known her ever since she was a child.

915
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,430
She was the apple of his eye.

916
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,859
She was his only daughter.

917
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,960
So you can imagine how much he adored her.

918
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,469
But after her mother died,

919
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,570
Ji O must have gone astray for some time.

920
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,310
She lost her mother
when she was quite young.

921
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,710
So the chairman couldn't look
after her as much as he wanted.

922
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,020
In the end, he sent her abroad.

923
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,949
But she couldn't adjust
to the life there either.

924
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,590
She came back to Korea last year.

925
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,400
I thought she was
staying with the chairman.

926
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,600
But she was adamant
about living on Jeju Island.

927
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,370
So he bought the resort
as a present to her.

928
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,780
Trying to take that away from her...

929
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,980
wouldn't give you a chance to survive.

930
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,510
My goodness.

931
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,220
Oh, my.

932
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,720
- You should go home. - Yes, sir.

933
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,780
Yes, sir.

934
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,310
Understood.

935
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,760
Sir, it's me.

936
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,130
Come in.

937
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,810
Did it look like a good place?

938
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,680
Do you mean Jeju Island?

939
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,250
Yes.

940
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,520
Yes. She seemed comfortable.

941
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:31,520
- Go and get some rest. - Yes, sir.

942
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,530
You must hold an important
position in the company.

943
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,900
But how did you know that I was the CEO?

944
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,000
You must be from Sanin, correct?

945
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,510
Yes, Ms. Song.

946
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,510
I'm Yoon Joo No from M and A Team.

947
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,540
That's great.

948
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,950
I need to show off my resort then.

949
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,650
Isn't it a beauty? And
it's very private too.

950
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,790
Yes, indeed.

951
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,690
Once you walk this way, you'll
see the panoramic view again.

952
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:00,450
Stunning, isn't it?

953
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,410
Yes.

954
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,250
Seeing the resort in person
rather than a photo does it justice.

955
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,150
You bet.

956
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,490
Seeing it in person is much better.

957
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,830
Do you see the oreum over
there? Check it out at dawn.

958
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,600
Okay.

959
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,830
By the way, can you get up that early?

960
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,370
Probably.

961
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:25,840
You probably won't go then.

962
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,940
I go there every morning.

963
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,680
No. I'll make sure to visit it tomorrow.

964
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,380
Really?

965
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,880
Do you mean it?

966
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,610
Promise me then.

967
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,490
Sure.

968
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,830
They're working even on this trip.

969
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,070
You must be a mean boss, Mr. Yoon.

970
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:02,240
What was the name of your team again?

971
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,410
We're from M and A Team.

972
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,710
M and A Team?

973
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,910
So you buy and sell
companies. Is that right?

974
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,520
Yes.

975
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,949
We're conducting due diligence...

976
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,420
in case we have to sell DADO Resort.

977
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,190
Due diligence? What's that?

978
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,530
You can think of it as conducting
an appraisal on DADO Resort.

979
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,800
Really?

980
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,800
I'm curious.

981
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,380
So you guys are here to sell off my resort.

982
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,950
Oh, my. You guys were
really in a scary business.

983
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,720
I made sure no one from
Sanin would be allowed here.

984
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,490
This all looks Greek to me.

985
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,199
These are the financial
statements of DADO Resort.

986
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,700
Financial statements? What are those for?

987
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:06,339
You can think of them as an indicator...

988
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,510
that reflects the
company's financial health.

989
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,680
I see.

990
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,080
It's like the health checkup chart.

991
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,050
That was the perfect analogy.

992
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,880
It's the health checkup
chart of a company. Right?

993
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,450
Yes. Totally.

994
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,250
So is DADO Resort healthy?

995
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,600
The financial health of
DADO Resort isn't so good.

996
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,330
Then what should I do?

997
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,830
We're looking for a solution.

998
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,669
If you spare us a moment
of your time tomorrow,

999
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,100
we'll present it to you.

1000
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,670
Sure. I'll look forward to it.

1001
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,440
Then please do tell me about it tomorrow.

1002
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,180
A solution to save DADO Resort.

1003
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,620
Ms. Song.

1004
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,730
Selling DADO Resort is one
of the options we're considering.

1005
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,160
And?

1006
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:03,890
I was wondering if you were aware.

1007
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,060
Yes.

1008
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,970
But that doesn't matter...

1009
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,340
because...

1010
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:15,840
I won't...

1011
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:17,910
sell it.

1012
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,950
I see.

1013
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,090
(The Art of Negotiation)

1014
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,090
{\an8}This place isn't run to make a profit.

1015
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,060
{\an8}It stands to entertain
a chairman's daughter.

1016
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,200
{\an8}So the problem lies with
her operational skills?

1017
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:15,499
{\an8}He already borrowed three billion dollars.

1018
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,970
{\an8}He's asking for 55 million dollars?

1019
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,110
{\an8}Does the chairman also know
this isn't an easy thing to do?

1020
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,540
{\an8}Will anyone want to buy this resort?

1021
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,640
{\an8}Our minimum price is 60 million dollars.

1022
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,880
{\an8}Why did they go down there?

1023
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,979
{\an8}- Sir. - The chairman found out...

1024
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,780
{\an8}that you went down to Jeju.

1025
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,920
{\an8}- Did he sell it? - No.

1026
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,120
{\an8}Did you lose your job because of me?

1027
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,660
{\an8}We gave up on selling DADO Resort.
