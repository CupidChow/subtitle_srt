No, it's not that.

person, would suggest we meet.

Ms. Han,

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,660
I enjoyed the previous article you wrote.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,489
However, I thought an explanation
might be warranted for this one.

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,299
The rumours must be true, then. Right?

39
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
You see,

40
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,339
Sanin is preparing to dive into e-commerce.

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
- Is that so? - Yes.

42
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,640
Decisions still have to be made internally,

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,740
but once we get moving,

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,980
we'll promote the
business on a large scale.

45
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,150
When we do, we'll give you...

46
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,650
an exclusive interview.

47
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,620

48
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,460
I can promise you one with me for now.

49
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,229
One with the chairman will be discussed.

50
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,830
An exclusive interview
is always appreciated.

51
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,540
So what did you want to say today?

52
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,540
I wanted to explain...

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,580
that Sanin isn't in a position...

54
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,150
to waver or falter due
to WIND going public.

55
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,350

stock price of Sanin Group?

72
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,630
No.

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,230
How much is it at?

74
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
It's at 101 dollars.

75
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,740
If it goes under 100
dollars, Samoel Fund...

76
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,840
can execute a put option.

79

will take over.

80
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,150
Was there a related issue?

81
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:26,490
There was a news article.

82
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,020
I'll send it to you via messenger.

83

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,370

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,060

because of that article alone?

103
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,830

unstable at the moment.

104

take a plunge like this,

174

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Seriously?

185
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,869
Get out there and see
the situation at Han River.

186
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,710
There are bicycles everywhere!

187
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,780
Sir, please.

188
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,350
You're the CEO,

189
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,660
but here you are blaming others.

190
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Should CEOs...

191
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,230
blame others?

192
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,230
Really?

193
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,800
My apologies.

194
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,870
- Sir, I'm sorry but... - What is it?

195
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,980
What?

196
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,110
What?

197
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,650
What?

198
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,050
Is CEO Oh in charge of WIND?

199
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,120
Yes, I think he's at the head office.

200
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,759
To see the chairman?

201
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,920
Yes, it seems that way.

202
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,189
I figured he'd be asking for you too.

203
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,630
Right. Good thinking.

204
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,500
- Get ready to go. - Yes, sir.

205
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,270
The chairman...

206
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,270
couldn't contain his anger at that moment.

207
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,869
Don't let it bother you.

208
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,710
How is WIND my responsibility?

209
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,880
It wasn't even my idea to take it on.

210
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,879
Director Ha bought the company,

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,480
and a separate team runs it.

212
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,850
CEO Oh, we'll talk downstairs.

213
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,960
CEO Oh, it's rough, isn't it?

214
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,670
- You're here. - Hello.

215
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,110
Would you like some coffee?

216
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,209
Coffee? No, I'm good.

217
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,380
- Have a seat, then. - Sure.

218
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,190
Here.

219
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,160
WIND tried to go public,

220
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,330
but a negative report surfaced.

221
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,729
That's why it was put off.

222
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,170
Wasn't it doing well?

223
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,069
After WIND was bought in 2015,

224
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,539
it had its ups and downs.

225
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,379
But since 2021 up to last year,

226
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,080
it saw a 30-percent
increase in sales every year.

227
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,450
Hold on.

228
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,319
Manufacturing bicycles
isn't like the IT business.

229
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,190
So a 30-percent increase every year?

230
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,319
A lot of my friends are
members of cycling clubs.

231
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,759
Exactly. It was the craze.

232
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,959
Now that you think about it,
COVID-19 gave it a huge boost.

233
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,759
At the time, there were
great expectations...

234
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,300
about the sports and leisure industry.

235
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,960
It was my mistake.

236
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,129
Cycling is a sport...

237
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,500
that one can engage in alone
without the presence of others.

238
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
Unaware that restrictions during
the pandemic were the cause,

239
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,510
I believed it had more room to grow.

240
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,680
That's why I waited.

241
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,250
That's hardly your fault.

242
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,790
I should've reported it
to the chairman sooner...

243
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,690
but couldn't bring myself to do it.

244
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,600
This seems like an error
on Director Lee's part.

245
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,300
He should've dealt with it
while the market was still hot.

246
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,330
It seems a bit too late now.

247
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,240
Forget about Director Lee,

248
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,210
and tell me what you think.

249
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,310
I believe...

250
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,010
blocking the put option from
being exercised is most important.

251
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,710
So?

252
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,950
Maybe we can persuade Samoel.

253
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,220
Would you be willing?

254
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,620
Yes, I'll set up a meeting.

255
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,290
Get it in writing...

256
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,590
that Samoel won't exercise the put.

257
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,100
- Sorry?
- What if it goes back on its word?

258
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,360
Then I'll be the only
one getting kicked out.

259
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,730
No, that won't happen.

260
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,970
So about WIND, it's a
no for you too. Am I right?

261
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,040
Yes, sir.

262
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,950
Is he faint-hearted?

263
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Pardon?

264
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,989
Can't Director Ha just go to Samoel...

265
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,530
and convince them?

266
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,200
They're close.

267
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,070
If Samoel was going to help
us, it would've happened already.

268
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,639
"We and Sanin are partners."

269
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,940
If only they had said that,

270
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,010
our stock wouldn't have tanked like this.

271
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,710
They're just feigning ignorance now.

272
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,650
So, if Director Ha lost Construction...

273
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,680
as well as his connections at Samoel,

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,650
then he's got nothing now. Right?

275
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,060
Mr. Oh, the CEO, cried.

276
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
- Pardon? - Pardon?

277
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,969
He cried after the
chairman chewed him out...

278
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,600
for failing to get WIND to go public.

279
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,979
Director Ha, then you could...

280
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,309
visit Samoel and try to convince them...

281
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,180
I said I'd do that,

282
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,450
but the chairman said to just leave it.

283
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,419
Whether it goes public or not,

284
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,950
he wants to scrap it altogether.

285
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I see.

286
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,960
WIND?

287
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,090
Whether it's WIND or whoever else.

288
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,389
He's furious right now.

289
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,390
I see.

290
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,800
I guess you met with Chairman Song.

291
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,230
Yes, just now.

292
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,639
Why didn't WIND go public years ago?

293
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,900
Why bother trying now?

294
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,110
My point, exactly.

295
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,709
After the pandemic,

296
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,040
people who have money
are busy travelling overseas,

297
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,279
while people who don't have money
are struggling to make ends meet.

298
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,480
Who has time to ride a bike these days?

299
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,420
I understand Mr. Oh wanted to cry.

300
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,779
He didn't just want to cry.

301
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,590
He cried his eyes out.

302
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,590
- My goodness. - About Director Ha.

303
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,530
Isn't it partially his fault too?

304
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,129
He should've bought
something that could go public.

305
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,200
He knew it was hopeless,
but he dumped it on me.

306
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,100
Now, he's acting like
it's none of his business.

307
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,900
I really can't stand him.

308
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,440
I'll see what I can do,

309
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,610
so calm down.

310
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,940
You see, I...

311
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,880
This is my second year.

312
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,150
Because of the contract renewal,

313
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,950
I put a lot of effort into the Saipan deal.

314
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,320
But out of the blue,

315
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,850
he blindsided me with
this WIND thing. My gosh.

316
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,959
To list a company on the stock market,

317
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,830
it's important to consider
what's happening on the market.

318
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,990
If the market is doing well,

319
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,289
WIND will have no problem.

320
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,400
But the market is doing
so badly these days,

321
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,999
so you need to show that the
company's situation will improve.

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
However, WIND's sales have dropped sharply.

323
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,199
So, you had no choice but
to submit a negative report.

324
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,610
Right. If it fails after I vouch
for it knowing it won't work out,

325
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,039
we'll all be doomed.

326
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,110
You're right.

327
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,779
What are our options with Samoel?

328
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,919
According to the put with Samoel,

329
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,949
the closing price of Sanin's stock price...

330
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,320
has to be lower than 100 dollars
for 20 consecutive business days.

331
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,260
Oh, that's where it gets complicated.

332
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,590
Twenty business days? That's four weeks.

333
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,830
Then we can move the stock
price up within four weeks.

334
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,060
How?

335
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,200
By making WIND go public.

336
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,470
If that were possible, it
would've already happened.

337
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,439
We couldn't tell Chairman
Song that it wouldn't work out.

338
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,980
So, we kept putting it
off, and this happened.

339
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Yes.

340
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,050
Oh, boy.

341
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Even if you know it won't work,

342
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,090
it still is so hard to speak the truth.

343
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,820
Who would be willing to say that?

344
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,160
If you say it, you'll get chewed out.

345
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,400
It's like we're passing the bomb around.

346
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,770
I like that. Passing the bomb around.

347
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,070
Come on. Let's go.

348
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,970
Sir.

349
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,979
Chairman Song is heading out now.

350
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,380
- Should I get the car ready?
- No, let's go up there.

351
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
Pardon?

352
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,180
Joo No's office. What floor is it on?

353
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,720
- It's on the 13th floor. - Let's go.

354
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,120
But you see many bicycles
along the Han River.

355
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,850
Yes, so many.

356
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,060
So, how come WIND's
bicycles didn't sell well?

357
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,159
There are many bike
share programs these days.

358
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,189
I see.

359
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,030
They're practically free, aren't they?

360
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,830
All bicycle companies
will go bankrupt at this rate.

361
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,470
How could they win against
government-funded businesses?

362
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,840
We're not trying to win here.

363
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,870
- Sir. - Yes, hi.

364
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,140
You heard too, right?

365
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,350
If you're talking about WIND, yes.

366
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,420
- I read the article. - I see.

367
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,420
So, what do you think?

368
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,720
It wasn't an easy
undertaking to begin with.

369
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Right. Everyone thinks it's not possible.

370
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,560
But did every business go
bankrupt during the pandemic?

371
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,600
Some businesses are actually
doing better after the pandemic.

372
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,670
- Am I wrong? - No, you're right.

373
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,670
But even if the COVID-19
pandemic had never happened,

374
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,770
the bicycle industry would've struggled.

375
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,770
What do you mean?

376
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,769
With the bike share programs in place,

377
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,710
more people are riding bikes these days,

378
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,710
but most bicycle companies'
sales have dropped.

379
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,280
Right, of course.

380
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,549
The government is practically
offering free bike rides.

381
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,119
So, who would buy a bike?

382
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,750
They're running these
programs using tax money.

383
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,720
How could you beat that? You know?

384
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Right.

385
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,689
So, we need a strategy
to entice bike users...

386
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,960
to want better bikes.

387
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
With such a strategy,

388
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,499
I believe the company...

389
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,170
can actually thrive in the high-end market.

390
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,170
Then...

391
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,810
do you think you can do it?

392
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,310
Yes?

393
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,420
Yes, sir.

394
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
The CEO used to be a professional archer.

395
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,759
So, he started out in archery.

396
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,660
Then with his expertise in carbon
materials, he expanded into cycling.

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,329
They only handle carbon bikes,

398
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,070
so they started focusing
on the high-end market.

399
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,710
Any questions?

400
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,440
Why did you say you could do it?

401
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,480
We just had to keep our mouths shut.

402
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,580
Tell me. Why did you do that?

403
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,580
Because I think it can work.

404
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,550
I'm used to this.

405
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,220
(WIND)

406
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,610
Oh, hello. Welcome.

407
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,940
- Hello. - Hello.

408
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,639
- I'm Park Rae Gyeong. - Hello.

409
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,710
Thank you.

410
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,219
Here, you see our archery bows...

411
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,920
displayed in chronological order.

412
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,120
And they're pictures of some important...

413
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,260
or meaningful moments for the company.

414
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,929
During the Olympic
Games, I always make sure...

415
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,360
to watch the archery competitions.

416
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,830
I'm always so fascinated
when I see them hit the target.

417
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,770
It really is fascinating that
they can hit the bull's-eye.

418
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,440
How do they do that?

419
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,369
Do you have to be born with the talent?

420
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,110
You can do it if you keep practising.

421
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,210
But don't you need some
level of natural-born talent?

422
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,710
Yes, you do.

423
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,050
But being able to keep at it...

424
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,720
is a more precious talent
than being naturally good at it.

425
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,290
You were a professional archer too, right?

426
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,690
I wasn't that good, though.

427
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,060
I never won a medal.

428
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,289
But the archery bows we
made won some gold medals.

429
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,030
Doesn't that mean you've
won so many medals?

430
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh, right.

431
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,900
This was when we took over DAICHI.

432
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,540
DAICHI used to be the
number-one company, right?

433
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,140
Yes, back in the 90s.

434
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,909
But we beat them...

435
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,450
and took over.

436
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,780
Who's the person next to you?

437
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,550
Oh, him.

438
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,750
He made this blueprint.

439
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,090
He was DAICHI's best engineer.

440
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,860
So, this master gave you this blueprint?

441
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,160
Yes, as a gift.

442
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,630
And I gave him that slogan as a gift.

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,300
Did you write it yourself?

444
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,770
When I was an archer,

445
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,369
I practised calligraphy,
thinking it could help...

446
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,870
improve my concentration.

447
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,940
What does it say?

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,350
"Ongojisin."

450
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,380
What a cute child.

451
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,790
Oh, that's his son whom he had quite late.

452
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,630
He was so cute.

453
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,590
I see.

454
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,700
From here, you see our cycles.

455
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,330
I see.

456
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,640
How much does something like this cost?

457
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,540
About 30,000 dollars.

458
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,650
I guess some cycles are
more expensive than cars.

459
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes, I guess.

460
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,719
I thought the expensive ones
would cost around 1,000 dollars.

461
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,380
This is for professional cyclists.

462
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,190
I see.

463
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,560
It's widely known that professional
cyclists only ride WIND, right?

464
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,590
Yes, of course.

465
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,529
Even 0.1 or 0.01 seconds...

466
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,160
could make or break their races,

467
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,630
so they only ride the best of the best.

468
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,329
But your sales will be limited
if you only sell your products...

469
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,900
to professional cyclists.

470
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,370
Well, that is...

471
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,740
certainly a problem WIND should solve.

472
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,150
So about that problem,

473
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,780
let's solve it together.

474
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,350
(Analysis Report on WIND)

475
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,449
WIND has launched 12
models, and their prices range...

476
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,850
from 5,000 dollars to 30,000 dollars.

477
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,490
You'd think the cheapest
model would sell the most.

478
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,030
But it was actually
the worst-selling model.

479
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,660
All sports are competitive, you know.

480
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,830
The same goes for equipment.

481
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,530
No one likes the lowest-end model.

482
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,999
I see.

483
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,039
WIND A is the cheapest
model, and the model...

484
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,669
that's one tier above it has sold the most.

485
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,680
That's right.

486
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,010
That's the nature of sport.

487
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,150
No one likes the tailender.

488
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,020
Then what if WIND A...

489
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,520
isn't the tailender?

490
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,350
Pardon?

491
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,959
(Product and Material Analysis)

492
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,260
Bikes are categorized and rated
based on their frame materials.

493
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,130
That's correct.

494
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,160
Steel, aluminium, carbon. In that order.

495
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,929
If you were to switch
from an aluminium model...

496
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,369
from a different brand
to WIND's carbon model,

497
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,640
you'd have to invest another 1,000 dollars.

498
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,969
That 1,000 dollars is a hurdle
that is hindering people...

499
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,810
from switching to a carbon
model from an aluminium one.

500
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,080
Carbon bikes are on
a whole different level.

501
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,020
You shouldn't compare
them to aluminium models.

502
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Right.

503
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,420
So, WIND A is on a whole different level.

504
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,460
What if we could sell it
in the 4,000-dollar range?

505
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,760
In the competition against
the aluminium models,

506
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,230
it'll win without fail, don't you think?

507
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,860
It will definitely win.

508
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,200
Yes, who'd ride an aluminium
bike if they're the same price?

509
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,730
Everyone would ride a carbon bike.

511
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,770
Exactly.

512
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,340
Then naturally, the consumers who
were going to buy aluminium models...

513
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,440
would choose WIND instead.

514
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,110
Well...

515
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,050
I agree,

516
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,050
but the thing is,

517
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,790
it really isn't easy to
bring the price down.

518
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,989
We barely managed to
bring it down to 5,000 dollars.

519
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,060
We really can't bring it
down to 4,000 dollars.

520
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,970
What if the market were to expand?

521
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,900
Then you can manufacture
them on a mass scale, can't you?

522
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,770
Well, possibly.

523
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,710
The thing is, the frames
aren't the only important part.

524
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,080
The gear is also very important.

525
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,180
When it comes to bike gears,
SHIMIZ in Japan is the best.

526
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,350
They have a patent too.

527
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,119
They'll need to supply us with gears.

528
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,660
If not, we can't make a lot
of them even if we want to.

529
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,960
So, they're like semiconductors.

530
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,160
That's right.

531
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,300
SHIMIZ calls the shots.

532
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,330
It'll be hard to secure enough units.

533
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,040
We'll meet with SHIMIZ
and try to negotiate with them.

534
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,940
Then it has to get sorted out by next week.

535
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,850
We have an OEM deal.

536
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,920
Then we should leave right away.

537
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,689
Sir, this is my first time
working on an overseas deal.

538
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,890
Are there things I should keep in mind?

539
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,860
It's important to be respectful
of their country's rules...

540
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,490
because we're going there to meet them.

541
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,100
Doesn't that put us at a disadvantage?

542
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,100
Not necessarily.

543
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,270
Both parties must follow the rules,

544
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,670
so it shouldn't put us at a disadvantage...

545
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,610
as long as...

546
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,210
we know the rules well.

547
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,610
{\an8}(Best Korean Souvenirs and
Gifts for Japanese People)

548
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,680
Yes.

549
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,710
Hey.

550
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,480
Come on in.

551
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,750
- Have a seat. - Thank you.

552
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,120
Did you visit WIND?

553
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,660
Yes.

554
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,360
I feel like this was dumped
on you because of me.

555
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,590
No, don't say that.

556
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,030
I know you tried.

557
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,330
I heard from those at Yumin IB.

558
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,740
You got started but stopped
due to the negative opinions.

559
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,640
That's right.

560
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,480
Because of WIND's focus
on the high-end market,

561
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,650
everyone questioned
their business expandability.

562
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,620
So I thought it couldn't be helped.

563
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,660
When I heard what you told Chairman Song,

564
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,730
I felt embarrassed.

565
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,690
No, you shouldn't be.

566
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,830
Besides, I know the
reporter who wrote that article.

567
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,000
Reporter Han Ji Eun?

568
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,070
Yes. When we were acquiring CHACHA Games,

569
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,569
she wrote the article...

570
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,770
about Sanin's M and A with DC.

571
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,080
She asked me about that.

572
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,980
I see.

573
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,750
So, I should get this sorted out.

574
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,320
It's also about Project M.

575
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,449
This is an announcement.

576
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,820
As you said,

577
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,560
bicycle companies aren't
doing well these days.

578
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,930
Speed is the biggest
company in Korea, right?

579
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,490
As a bicycle manufacturer, yes.

580
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,800
They must've needed many gear units.

581
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,500
Yes, but they've put their order on
hold. They had to pay the penalty.

582
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,540
The timing is... That's too bad.

583
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,869
Speed thinks it's such a shame too.

584
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,810
They said they would've
handed it over to WIND...

585
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,040
instead of paying the penalty
had they known about it.

586
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,850
Right.

587
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,150
What time is it? Oh,
you should get going now.

588
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,680
- I'll get going, then. - All right.

589
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,020
What's that?

590
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,620
I found this while studying
Japanese for business.

591
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,230
Have you heard of "honne and tatemae?"

592
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,729
Of course, I have.

593
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,499
It refers to being agreeable
and indirect with your words.

594
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,530
Yes.

595
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,370
Attorney Oh, you're really smart.

596
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Now, you can see that?

597
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,270
Wait, did you really mean that or not?

598
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,279
If they could manufacture more products,

599
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,210
they should be able
to bring down the price,

600
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,910
but...

601
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,450
There's nothing Japanese people
hate more than changing the plan.

602
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,460
We can increase the order total
tenfold. Why would they hate it?

603
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,130
I get it. They like to stick
to manuals at all times.

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

605
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:53,230
- Please put your seat back up.
- We'll be landing shortly.

606
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,099
- Please put your seat back up.
- Ensure your tray table is stowed,

607
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,939
- Please stow your tray table.
- And fasten your seat belt.

608
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,709
Please put your seat back up.

609
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,709
- Please stow your tray table. - Okay.

610
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,340
Please put your seat back up.

611
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,380
(WIND)

612
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,850
Here.

613
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,779
Oh, hi.

614
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,850
- Hi. - Hi.

615
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,919
Thank you for making the long journey.

616
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,190
I hope it was pleasant.

617
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,830
I'm Ozaki Ryu.

618
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,129
I'm Yoon Joo No from Sanin.

619
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,999
I appreciate you taking the time...

620
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,359
to come out and see me today.

621
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,170
Not at all. The honour is ours.

622
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,470
You're Team Manager Yoon Joo No, yes?

623
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,140
My name is Hirose Haruka.

624
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,700
You can call me Hirose.

625
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,570
Hi. I'm Yoon Joo No.

626
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,439
Your Korean is good.

627
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,909
That's not true.

628
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,650
I'm still learning Korean.

629
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,180
First, we'll take you to the bus.

630
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
What's wrong?

631
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,900
- The limousine hasn't come. - What?

632
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,030
How come? Have you contacted them?

633
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,170
What? What's this?

634
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,009
Did you contact them?

635
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,640
- Are they not picking up? - No.

636
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,180
Did you check properly?

637
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,110
Then...

638
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,280
I'll take the guests. You take a taxi.

639
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,690
Understood.

640
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,160
Please go ahead. I'll follow behind.

641
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,689
- My apologies. - No.

642
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,690
It's all right.

643
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,230
Mr. Yoon. I'll go with her.

644
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,729
All right. Thank you.

645
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,730
No, it's okay.

646
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,969
No. Let me.

647
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm sincerely sorry.

648
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,699
Don't worry about it. As the youngest,

649
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,940
I like travelling alone.

650
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,470
The youngest? I'm the same.

651
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,550
How much will you say okay to?

652
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,430
I expect at least this much off.

653
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,130
That much is reasonable.

654
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,770
Look on your left. That's Mount Fuji.

655
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,439
It's impressive.

656
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,540
Yes.

657
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,009
It's quite rare to have
such a clear day, you know?

658
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,279
It only happens 30 percent of the time.

659
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,779
- I see. - Did you know?

660
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,179
Many Japanese people...

661
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,220
never even get to see Mount Fuji...

662
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,290
in their lifetime.

663
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,589
Seems like we caught a lucky day.

664
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,660
Of course.

665
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Would you like to see it up close?

666
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,160
I mean, if we get the chance.

667
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,500
Yes. If we get the chance.

668
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,870
How long will you be staying?

669
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,870
Until the deal is done.

670
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,270
I see.

671
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,380
I apologize for taking you in a taxi.

672
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,749
No. You can stop apologizing.

673
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,120
Oh, okay.

674
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,290
I brought something from Korea.

675
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,870
By any chance,

676
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,940
would you like this?

677
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,139
I heard Japanese people
buy this from Korea.

678
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,940
No, I'm all right.

679
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,710
If you don't like it,

680
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,950
how about this one?

681
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Right.

682
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,020
Okay. Thank you.

683
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,760
As expected, you're delicate.

684
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,630
"Delicate?" Thank you.

685
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,640
Please excuse me.

686
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,610
Hello? Yes.

687
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,510
What? Are you not hurt?

688
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,150
That's a relief.

689
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,220
We're taking a taxi back.

690
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,460
Yes.

691
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,690
Please hold for a moment.

692
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,760
Can you tell me when you're returning?

693
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,129
- What? - I have to book the limousine...

694
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,300
in advance.

695
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,040
I'll make sure you don't take
a taxi on your departure day.

696
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,410
- I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

697
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,209
Our flight is on the 14th at 7pm.

698
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,250
It's a Saturday.

699
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,550
Shall I have the limousine
arrive at 4pm at the hotel?

700
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,790
Well... Yes.

701
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,530
Please book one for 4pm on the 14th.

702
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,960
Yes. Thank you.

703
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,269
The limousine got into
an accident on the way.

704
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,899
That's why it couldn't make it.

705
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,770
- You don't have to apologize. - Right.

707
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,980
By the way, you came despite being busy.

708
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,689
We wanted to tour around
since we're already in Japan,

709
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,220
but our next meeting has been set.

710
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
This is cute.

711
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,059
My name is Naito Senichi.

712
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,430
I'm Yoshida Osamu.

713
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,130
The overseas sales team leader.

714
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,869
- Great to meet you. - Hi.

715
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,470
I'm Yoon Joo No from Sanin's M and A Team.

716
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,409
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Nice to meet you.

717
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,469
My name is Choi Jin Soo.

718
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,910
- I'm Kwak Min Jeong from Sanin. - Hi.

719
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,980
- I'm Yoshida. - Yoshida.

720
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,179
- Here. My name is Naito Senichi.
- I'm Kwak Min Jeong from Sanin.

721
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,250
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

722
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,619
We want to adjust the quantity to 10,000,

723
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,389
ten times the original amount.

724
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,889
We'd like to know if the
quantity can be adjusted...

725
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,300
to 10,000.

726
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,499
In other words, since the original order...

727
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,199
was 1,000,

728
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,710
you want to order another 9,000. Correct?

729
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Yes.

730
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,180
We need to check first.

731
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,150
We adhere to strict standards...

732
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,290
and only produce a fixed quantity.

733
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,989
We'd appreciate it if
you understood that...

734
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,359
we, SHIMIZ, adhere to
strict production standards...

735
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,860
and limit production to
ensure quality control.

736
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,029
Are you saying no to the quantity?

737
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,100
Does that mean 10,000 orders is impossible?

738
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,170
No, it's possible.

739
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,470
But we can't give you a discount.

740
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,870
It's a yes.

741
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,510
But we can't give you a discount.

742
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,109
I'm sure SHIMIZ has a
discount rate manual...

743
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,020
based on order quantity.

744
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,719
Do you not have a discount rate manual...

745
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,860
based on order quantity?

746
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,859
They're referring to...

747
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,990
our internal regulations' discount rates.

748
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,270
That's only for general cases.

749
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,640
We are a special case.

750
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,840
What is the manual for special cases?

751
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,319
Can you give us some time...

752
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,250
to look into it?

753
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,090
We need time to check
with our internal team.

754
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,429
How about we call it a day here?

755
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,189
You should get some rest.

756
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,360
If there is no manual
pertaining to special cases,

757
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,670
should we proceed with
the existing discount rate?

758
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,070
We will consider it favourably.

759
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,010
We leave it to you.

760
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,980
Likewise. We look
forward to working with you.

761
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,130
Can you wait for a moment?

762
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,370
I'll take you to your hotel.

763
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,179
Does saying they'll
consider it favourably mean...

764
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,980
they're in or not?

765
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
They're not.

766
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,520
What?

767
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,190
Saying they'll consider it
favourably was out of policy.

768
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,860
So, turning us down
was their real intention?

769
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,390
Good grief.

770
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,260
This is tough.

771
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,730
How can you accept the
additional orders without discussion?

772
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,040
Will you refuse it, even
if there are no discounts?

773
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,640
You know the drop in our
company's sales is a problem.

774
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,740
By the way, Mr. Yoshida.

775
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,650
Is there a manual for such a situation?

776
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,419
Most likely no.

777
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,520
Right?

778
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,620
Hirose. Escort the guests.

779
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,930
Understood.

780
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,060
We leave it to you.

781
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,130
- Hirose. - Yes?

782
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,730
You must do well.

783
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,570
Understood.

784
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,809
It seems like the sales manager
and the factory manager...

785
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,740
are in disagreement.

786
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,710
Yes.

787
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,980
Still, the sales manager said
they could make the amount.

788
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,650
But...

789
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,290
what if they bring a fake
manual for special cases?

790
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,960
We can't accept it, can we?

791
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,230
They can't fool us that easily.

792
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,230
I doubt they know how much we know.

793
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,130
My apologies for making you wait.

794
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This way, please.

795
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Let's go.

796
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,130
It's okay.

797
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,570
I'll wait for you here.

798
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,369
You'll wait for us?

799
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,980
Yes. I heard you wanted to see Mount Fuji.

800
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,210
No, we're fine.

801
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,380
Oh, I see.

802
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,250
How long will it take?

803
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,460
It'll only take one hour.

804
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,690
- Let's go. - All right.

805
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,130
Thank you.

806
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,630
Say that we get the Speed's quantity.

807
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,200
Is it tough to accept
the same conditions...

808
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,470
based on the contract?

809
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,240
It depends on the contract.

810
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,610
There's a possibility SHIMIZ
tied in a resale clause.

811
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,080
Is that monopolistic, Attorney Oh?

812
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Probably not.

813
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:25,320
- For it to be monopolistic...
- My apologies.

814
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,520
Please.

815
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,120
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

816
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,060
I'm sorry.

817
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,170
- I'll take the photo. - Hold on. Here.

818
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,140
- Hearts, please. - Hearts.

819
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,970
Please make hearts.

820
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,940
One, two, three.

821
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,480
Please check.

822
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,980
- Do you like it? - Yes.

823
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,950
It's a stunning place.

824
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,420
I'm glad that you like it.

825
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,190
- Thank you. - We should be thanking you.

826
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,290
Shall we return to the hotel now?

827
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Sure.

828
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,280
This is Shuzenji
famous for its hot springs.

829
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,879
- "Shuzenji?" - Have you been here?

830
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,989
No. I've only read it in blogs.

831
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,260
I see. If so,

832
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,590
can you spare me ten minutes?

833
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,059
There's a place for a foot bath.

834
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,199
Ten minutes?

835
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Yes.

836
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,600
Okay.

837
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,970
To Shuzenji, please.

838
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,710
If other bicycle companies
haven't cancelled their contracts yet,

839
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,019
offering to take them over...

840
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,620
without penalty...

841
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,219
They say...

842
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,489
keeping the head cool
while the feet warm is good.

843
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,820
It's wasabi ice cream.

844
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,630
- "Wasabi ice cream?" - Yes. Have some.

845
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,790
Here.

846
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,340
It's okay.

847
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,640
How is it?

848
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,209
Is it good?

849
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,980
- It's good. - Is it?

850
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,690
- It's actually good. - Really?

851
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,290
- Shall we get going? - Hold on.

852
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,430
It's time for dinner.

853
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,629
How about kaiseki, a course meal?

854
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,930
Gosh, there's no reason
for us to turn it down.

855
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,739
I hope we're not causing too much trouble.

856
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,010
Actually, I've already made a reservation.

857
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,380
You can't enjoy it without a reservation.

858
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,840
Well then...

859
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,909
There's no reason to decline.

860
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,910
Declining her offer will
cause her more trouble.

861
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,580
- Let's go. - Okay.

862
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,500
It's going to be an eight-course meal.

863
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,230
Each course will have a
brief introduction to the dish.

864
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,039
Tasting it after hearing
the introduction...

865
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,600
will enhance the experience.

866
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,509
Enjoy your meal. If you need anything,

867
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,710
please let me know at any time.

868
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,880
You've invited us to such a splendid place.

869
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,380
Thank you.

870
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,120
Please enjoy.

871
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,420
I feel bad that it's just the four of us.

872
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,820
Don't worry about it.

873
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,960
Please feel free to
talk and enjoy the meal.

874
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,690
- Thank you. - Thank you.

875
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,629
They're important guests.

876
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,729
Please take great care of them.

877
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,270
Understood.

878
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,790
Excuse me!

879
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,030
Thank you. I leave it to you.

880
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,600
Is it good?

881
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,200
Yes.

882
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,040
If you don't mind, shall
we talk over our meal?

883
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,780
- Sure. - Okay.

884
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,810
How much is the maximum
unit price we can offer?

885
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,680
It's 35 dollars with the
30 percent discount.

886
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,580
Then...

887
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,840
This is your second dish.

888
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,710
Where's the toilet?

889
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,539
You can go straightÂ down from the room.

890
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,580
Thank you.

891
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,360
Hello.

892
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
Yes.

893
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:15,570
This is Attorney Oh Soon Young
from M and A Team of Sanin Group.

894
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,340
Yes, hello.

895
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,170
Well, I just had a question.

896
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,540
You're holding off the supplies
you ordered from SHIMIZ.

897
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,110
Yes, that's it.

898
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,410
Is it possible for us to
take them off your hands?

899
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:29,880
Yes.

900
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,290
Right. Then it'd be great for both parties.

901
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,989
Would it be possible for you to share...

902
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,090
the discount rate for the gears with us?

903
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,660
- Yes. - Excuse me.

904
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,260
Yes. Thank you.

905
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,470
Could you text me the rate
if it's not too much trouble?

906
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,470
Yes. I can talk now.

907
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,010
- Are things going well? - Yes.

908
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,340
They're having kaiseki now.

909
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,240
Take good care of them until the end.

910
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,550
Yes, sir.

911
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,880
Are you still in the meeting?

912
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,450
Yes. Why do you ask?

913
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,550
Should I join you once I
drop off the Korean clients?

914
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,990
Sure.

915
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,130
Well, call me once it's over.

916
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,200
If Speed didn't cancel their contract,

917
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,770
I would have been
transferred to Tokyo by now.

918
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,270
Why do you want...

919
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,710
to go to Tokyo this badly?

920
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,510
Shizuoka is your hometown.

921
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,940
It's not that I want to leave
here because I don't like it here.

922
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,620
I truly respect your
spirit of craftsmanship...

923
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,720
and how much you're
focused on your product.

924
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,919
But white-collarÂ workersÂ like me...

925
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,190
will have fewer chances
in places like this.

926
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,130
Look at our companyÂ for example.

927
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,730
They moved the headquarters to Tokyo.

928
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,330
It's not that I want to leave.

929
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,500
My place in Shizuoka is disappearing.

930
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,380
Excuse me.

931
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,950
- Could I get the lemon drink? - Sure.

932
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,450
Our Korean clients are stillÂ sightseeing.

933
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,220
It seems they're not
interested in business at all.

934
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,220
Nice.

935
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,090
How did you manage to
figure out their deadline?

936
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,630
I was just trying to be
helpful to our company.

937
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,700
Nicely done.

938
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,840
You also want to get
transferred to Tokyo, right?

939
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
I'm going to hit the toilet.

940
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,699
I do like to move to Tokyo too.

941
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,600
If you take me with you, I'll do my best.

942
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,300
Gosh, no way.

943
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,270
Even my performance isn't
good enough for the transfer.

944
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,770
We can just get WIND to
sign the contract, can't we?

945
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,510
Well, that will help.

946
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,120
But I'm not sure if
they'll accept our deal.

947
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,290
Even so. They can't go back empty-handed.

948
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,660
That's true.

949
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,590
I'll see what I can do.

950
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,520
We had a great day of
sightseeing thanks to you.

951
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,920
Thank you.

952
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,420
Goodnight.

953
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,389
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

954
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,360
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

955
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,630
Thank you.

956
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,220
There's nothing special
in the Tokyo office.

957
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,559
That's not true. It's Shizuoka
where nothing happens.

958
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,620
What?

959
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,789
We've got Mount Fuji.

960
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,830
That's all this town has.

961
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,029
Mount Fuji? Then what does Tokyo have?

962
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,699
Well, if I were to start...

963
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,630
- What does Tokyo have? - ExcuseÂ me.

964
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,470
Tokyo has Tokyo Tower.

965
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,410
- Tokyo Tower? - Tokyo Tower.

966
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,209
There's Tokyo Tower.

967
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,840
- Tokyo Tower. - And Skytree.

968
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,480
Skytree. I saw that.

969
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,450
Yes.

970
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:03,760
They're done for the day.

971
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,790
Should I join the meeting too?

972
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,130
No.

973
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,099
You worked hard today.
So you can go home now.

974
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,470
No, I'm all right.

975
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:15,870
What?

976
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,070
You're working too hard.

977
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,670
Just go home.

978
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,970
Okay.

979
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,110
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.

980
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,150
I thought we would be
only working on this trip.

981
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,080
We got to do all the
classic touristy things.

982
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,890
She said she would show us
the downtown area tomorrow.

983
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,289
I wanted to be of help on this project.

984
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:40,960
So I studied a little bit
about the Japanese culture.

985
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,560
But sightseeing won't be the
only thing we do on this trip, right?

986
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,400
Shall we get to work?

987
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,200
Let's do it in our room.

988
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,810
Attorney Oh, could you
look into Speed's contract?

989
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,480
Yes. I did look into that.

990
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,520
They set the discount rates
based on the order volumes.

991
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,820
When did you look into that?

992
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,090
When we were having kaiseki.

993
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,889
We're looking into ordering 9,000.

994
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,700
So take a look at this. The
discount rate is 40 percent.

995
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,860
I see.

996
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:23,000
But they wanted us to buy
them without any discounts.

997
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,339
- That's unreasonable, right?
- It truly is.

998
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,070
But we need this deal more than they do.

999
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,610
- It's still hot. - Gosh, that's hot.

1000
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,340
Thank you for the heads-up.

1001
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,480
If we get the discount,

1002
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,019
WIND can launch bicycles in
the 4,000-dollar range, right?

1003
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,020
Yes.

1004
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,419
Since we can afford to buy
them with a 30 percent discount,

1005
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,790
we still have a ten
percent margin to work with.

1006
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
But...

1007
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,020
can't we just cancel our order for 1,000...

1008
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,859
and place a new order for 10,000?

1009
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,929
So we can get a 50 percent discount?

1010
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,000
No.

1011
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,960
If we do that, it will sour the deal.

1012
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,929
They don't even seem inclined
to increase our order volume.

1013
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,839
Since it has to be more than 10,000,

1014
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,600
we must order at least 10,001.

1015
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,170
That will offend them, and
the deal will fall through.

1016
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,979
SHIMIZ knows that we need their gears...

1017
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,850
and that we want this deal to be made.

1018
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,650
SHIMIZ has no reason to rush.

1019
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,489
You don't think they'll
keep stalling time...

1020
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,160
and say no in the end, right?

1021
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,790
If they weren't interested in this deal,

1022
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,890
they would've said no to our visit.

1023
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,629
Well, SHIMIZ must have
brought us to the table...

1024
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,270
since there was something they wanted.

1025
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,470
I see.

1026
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,370
If they keep stalling like this
and we reach our deadline,

1027
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,839
we'll have no choice
but to sign the contract...

1028
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,340
they present on our last day.

1029
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,850
Then they might be stalling time.

1030
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,750
I doubt that.

1031
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,949
SHIMIZ must have their
own situation to handle.

1032
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,119
They can't just waste time without a plan.

1033
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,990
So it's important to hide
each other's deadline.

1034
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,560
The deadline?

1035
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,560
The fact that we must go
back to Korea on Saturday.

1036
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,900
We didn't leak information
about our deadline, right?

1037
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,600
No, we didn't.

1038
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,240
I'm sorry. I...

1039
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,480
I'm sorry.

1040
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,320
Jin Soo, why are you sorry?

1041
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,660
She said she had to
book the airport limousine.

1042
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,060
She asked me when we were leaving Japan.

1043
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,530
So?

1044
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,690
Did you tell her?

1045
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,770
Are you serious?

1046
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,540
I'm sorry.

1047
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,580
Jin Soo. You can do this, right?

1048
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,479
- Yes. - Of course.

1049
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,679
Since both of you are
the youngest on the team,

1050
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,479
use that to build rapport...

1051
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,949
and try to get her on your side. Okay?

1052
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:50,979
Yes.

1053
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,619
It seemed her superiors
were harsh on her too.

1054
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,620
Is that so?

1055
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,889
I don't rememberÂ being harsh on you.

1056
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,190
Then I take it that Min
Jeong had been harsh on you?

1057
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,160
Jin Soo.

1058
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,730
Do you think we're here to travel?

1059
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,900
- Get a grip. - Look at him.

1060
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,400
It is your fault, Jin Soo.

1061
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,910
I'm sorry. I won't make mistakesÂ next time.

1062
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,450
There's no next time.

1063
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,309
Don't you know that
we'll be in big trouble...

1064
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,950
if we don't have this deal by Saturday?

1065
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,920
I'll do my best to fix it.

1066
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,550
So how do you think you can fix this?

1067
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,360
You're the youngest on
our team. Then act like one.

1068
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,230
Is this part of the act?

1069
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,100
Keep going. Focus.

1070
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,900
You're not going to answerÂ me?

1071
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,370
I'm sorry.

1072
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,850
I'm sorry.Â I can't say for sure.

1073
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,190
I can't really do that today.

1074
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,930
I need to talk to my...

1075
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,730
Excuse me.

1076
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,380
They requested to have a meeting today.

1077
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,549
They probablyÂ figured it out, right?

1078
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,550
Yes.

1079
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,319
The youngest employee on
their team was getting scolded.

1080
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,790
I see.

1081
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,420
All right.

1082
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,990
Hello, sir.

1083
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,459
WIND requestedÂ a meetingÂ with us.

1084
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,730
And they want it today.

1085
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,969
How typical of Koreans.

1086
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,240
They sure like a challenge.

1087
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,340
That's how Koreans work as expected.

1088
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,980
Yes.

1089
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,010
Seeing how they revealed their deadline,

1090
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,850
they must have figuredÂ it out.

1091
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,720
They seemed to be in a hurry.

1092
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
Yes.

1093
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,390
Is that okay with you?

1094
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,830
Yes. I got it.

1095
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,660
Thank you.

1096
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,929
Tell them we can have the meeting today.

1097
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:21,970
Yes, sir.

1098
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,440
- Hirose. - Yes.

1099
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,240
Don't mess it up. And keep me in the loop.

1100
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,310
- Okay. - All right.

1101
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,209
We had to request this
meeting on short notice...

1102
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,950
due to some scheduling
conflicts on our side.

1103
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,420
We appreciate you taking
the time to meet with us.

1104
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,820
I understand.

1105
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,220
We thought you had a
more flexible schedule.

1106
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,930
We wanted to show you around Shizuoka...

1107
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,530
while you are here.

1108
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,370
But it seems...

1109
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:58,570
we might have kept
you longer than expected.

1110
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,170
Not at all.

1111
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,680
Mount FujiÂ was incredible.

1112
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,380
It made me want to visit Japan again.

1113
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,780
Now,

1114
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,780
regardingÂ the contract,

1115
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,420
what are your thoughts on our proposal?

1116
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,460
We reviewedÂ it internally.

1117
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,430
But I'm afraidÂ it won't be possible.

1118
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,870
Is that based on the manualÂ of SHIMIZ?

1119
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,670
Have you also reviewed
the internal regulations?

1120
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,070
We are in the process.

1121
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,910
If there's no manual for specialÂ cases,

1122
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:42,510
will we also receive the
existing discount rate?

1123
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,590
He's asking if there's no manual,
existing discount rates will apply.

1124
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,300
We'll see what we can do.

1125
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,100
Excuse us.

1126
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,070
May we have a moment
to discuss this internally?

1127
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,770
Okay.

1128
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Go ahead.

1129
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,720
That again. They'll see what they can do.

1130
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,160
WithoutÂ any discount,

1131
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,860
it's much more expensive
than our existing unit price.

1132
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:30,860
It's better not to go through this deal.

1133
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,530
We just don't have the
time to negotiate the price.

1134
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,870
As they know about our
deadline, it won't be easy.

1135
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,710
But our deadline can
also be their deadline.

1136
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,490
(The Art of Negotiation)

1137
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,749
{\an8}SHIMIZ has no interest in
doing business with us, right?

1138
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,120
{\an8}I thoughtÂ you were a spy.

1139
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,890
{\an8}Mr. Yoshida...

1140
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,960
{\an8}needs to bring up his performance, right?

1141
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,159
{\an8}If we're to pay a higher
down payment amount,

1142
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,200
{\an8}the overall amount should be less.

1143
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,230
{\an8}Who will take responsibility
for getting WIND listed?

1144
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,030
{\an8}Are you saying I'm responsibleÂ for it?

1145
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,100
{\an8}Did the contract proceed well?

1146
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
{\an8}The deadline is imminent.

1147
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,040
{\an8}I cannot trust your company.

1148
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,879
{\an8}So did the deal go through?

1149
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,650
{\an8}They said we might have to
increase the down payment.

1150
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
{\an8}You know the pictureÂ of DAICHI...

1151
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:57,850
{\an8}that was hanging in the WIND's office?

1152
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,980
{\an8}I might need the picture.
