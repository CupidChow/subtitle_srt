So? How are things going?

10
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,379
Well,

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,190
we will sell Sanin Construction.

12
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,790
At how much?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,359
At the current market price,

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,970
we could get up to seven billion dollars.

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,099
Nonsense.

16
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,099
We should at least get two digits.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,739
Sorry?

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,480
Sanin Construction was my first project.

That being said,

20
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,580
it should get its worth.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,019
Sir.

22
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,788
Receiving three billion dollars
more than its market price...

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:37,789
What's wrong?

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,929
Can't you do it?

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,610
Tell me.

26
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,619
I'll give it a shot.

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,890
Sure.

28
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:06,860
You do that.

29
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,289

Tae Soo, don't worry.

42
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,618
I've been in the construction
business for 20 years now.

43
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,050
Exactly.

do to be in that seat?

Rather than myself being on the board,

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm more anxious...

50
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:29,200
to see you lead Sanin.

51
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,339

Yes, we're here to talk to you...

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,369

62
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,850

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,618
which is why we don't
know the exact amount...

64
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,519
You must have an estimate.

65
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,320
After all, you're an M and A expert.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,890
I'm the CEO here,

67
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,230
so I know how bidding works.

68
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,259
I just...

69
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,629
want to know what you think.

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,770
It'll be similar to your estimate.

71
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,040
The price will differ
according to the terms,

72
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,879
and retaining all personnel is one of them.

73
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,210

clear any misunderstandings...

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,689
the employees may have.

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,689
- Well... - What'll happen?

81
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,610
What about me?

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,378
The executives including you...

83
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,909
have a two-year contract...

84
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,980
in accordance with company bylaws.

85
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,679
Keeping the contracts valid
will also be one of the terms.

86
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,179
That's not what I meant.

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,749
My heart...

88
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,689
has suffered a scratch.

89

Won't you make up for that?

90
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:35,759
A compensation will
be discussed internally.

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,900
A discussion, my foot.

92
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:41,739
Guarantee a five-year contract as CEO...

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,610
and offer me shares. That'll do.

94
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,780
Company shares and a
tenure have never been part...

95
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,410
- of your contract. - That's why...

96
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,920
I'm asking for it now.

97
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,448
That could hinder the process
of selling Sanin Construction.

98
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,619
Well, that's not my concern.

99
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,920
Isn't that right?

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,128
I doubt anyone...

101
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,328
knows Sanin Construction
better than you do.

102
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,360
So you know.

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,400
This place can't function without me.

104
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,699
Right.

105
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,198
The acquiring company...

106
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,040
will see you as the most valuable asset.

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,610
That's why I suggest...

108
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,609
you negotiate in person.

109
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,679
But you're the negotiator.

110
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,150
Show me what you can do.

111
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,050
We work for Sanin Group,

112
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,559
not you, CEO Lee.

113
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,460
You darn punk.

114
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,699
You psycho...

115
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:47,869
What?

116
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,400
Did you just call me a darn psycho?

117
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,178
You. Say that again.

118
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:55,239
A darn psycho?

119
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,249
He left out "darn," sir.

120
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,280
You're a funny bunch, aren't you?

121
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,420
You're more like a bunch of thugs!

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,489
A member of my team made a mistake.

123
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,189
You seem to be worked up,

124
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,230
so we'll come find you
another time. Well, then.

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,090
What did you call me again? A darn psycho?

126
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,059
As if you could intimidate me!

127
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,660
If you lay off even one of my employees,

128
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,900
we'll have a problem!

129
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,660
Got it?

130
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,040
Mr. Yoon, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,579
It just came out.

132
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,720
Can you give me a minute? I need to...

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,318
Sure, you should...

134
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,920
I need to use the restroom.

135
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,170
Jin Soo.

136
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,169
Our goal...

137
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,939
is to sell Sanin Construction
at the highest price.

138
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,579
To do so, we must increase its value.

139
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:39,579
What I'm saying...

140
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,879
is that Sanin Construction
isn't our enemy...

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,620
but one we must persuade.

142
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,819
The people there know that...

143
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,620
hence the emotional response.

144
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,689
I apologize.

145
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,800
Don't.

146
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,959
To be honest, I found it
hard to hold back myself.

147
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,399
I almost punched the guy.

148
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,699
As if.

149
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,609
It's true.

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,740
If it weren't for Jin Soo, I would've...

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,149
My punches are more like a reflex.

152
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,880
Where was he sitting
again? Here, right? So...

153
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,448
What was it? Right, you darn punk.

154
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,088
My fist almost shot
out when I heard "punk."

155
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,020
Holding back was torture.

156
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:24,459
Unbelievable.

157
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,400
He was the first to throw an insult.

158
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,698
I'm not the only one who was improper.

159
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,728
I know.

160
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,539
So wouldn't it have been nice...

161
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,838
to have been the only
ones who were insulted?

162
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,369
Since he was disrespectful,

163
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,270
we wouldn't have had to back down.

164
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,539
The employees would've
been on our side as well.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,410
He wouldn't have had a way out.

166
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,179
But thanks to you, this
turned into an ugly fight.

167
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,309
Jin Soo.

168
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,010
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

169
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,109
Keep emotions out of your work.

170
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,049
Treat it like a game...

171
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,109
even though it's not easy.

172
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

173
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,849
M and A literally means war.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,559
They even say we haven't
had any big wars recently...

175
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,890
because of M and A transactions.

176
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,559
If wars are fought with weapons,

177
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,400
M and A transactions
are fought with contracts.

178
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,339
Like emotionless guns and swords,

179
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,140
contracts should be without emotion.

180
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:46,069
Emotions...

181
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,140
will be your demise in this war.

182
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,910
Right.

183
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,179
Although, it's not a bad
idea to sulk as well...

184
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,120
if who you're dealing
with is being impossible.

185
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,490
Sorry?

186
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,688
That wasn't deliberate, sir.

187
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,819
But even then, it should
be without emotion.

188
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,390
Emotions only cloud your view.

189
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,059
Tae Soo.

190
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,199
I played hardball like you suggested,

191
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,270
and he couldn't even squeak.

192
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,698
He must've been embarrassed...

193
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,439
because he returned alone to apologize.

194
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,179
You should've gone easy on him.

195
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,880
I went easy on him,

196
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,579
but he wet himself.

197
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,089
See? What did I tell you?

198
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,290
With tunnel vision,

199
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,660
information is distorted as you receive it.

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,089
That was unexpected from CEO Lee.

201
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,059
He yelled not to fire us earlier.

202
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,299
I know.

203
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,729
We always called him a bullhead,

204
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:46,870
but I guess that has its perks.

205
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
Even if you win people over emotionally,

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,709
you won't gain their trust.

207
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,179
Then, in any way, that negotiation
will leave some kind of side effect.

208
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,020
So before you sit to negotiate,

209
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,760
leave your emotions behind.

210
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,660
Mr. Kim, did I mention this?

211
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,269
Yes?

212
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,130
The eco-friendly products by Bareun Life.

213
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,300
I'm not too fond of them.

214
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,000
You must have time left on your hands...

215
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,208
to be concerning yourself with Bareun Life.

216
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,780
I was speaking for the chairman, not me.

217
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:31,349
What?

218
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,620
I was only trying to relay
the chairman's thoughts.

219
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,719
I apologize if I offended you in any way.

220
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,019
Did the chairman say Bareun Life...

221
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,318
should cut back on products?

222
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,890
That's not what he meant.

223
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,329
You probably know about
the hit list going around.

224
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,069
Yes.

225
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,250
It's good.

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,150
Come in.

227
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,490
Hello.

228
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,858
I'm CEO Lee Hun Min of Sanin Construction.

229
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,000
- CEO Lee, come on in. - It's all right.

230
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm here with my boys,

231
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,400
and I only dropped by to greet you.

232
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,540
- Is that so? - Yes.

233
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,438
They were walking
around like dead people...

234
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,770
when they thought Yoon Joo No...

235
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,079
was going to sell us off.

236
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,309
Thanks to you reassuring us, Director Ha,

237
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,650
we're out here enjoying our team lunch.

238
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,620
This will be our treat.

239
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,149
- Please enjoy your meal. - Sure.

240
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,160
Right.

241
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,839
CEO Kim, you must be close
to other subsidiary CEOs.

242
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,079
I am.

243
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,479
I'd love to treat you all to a meal.

244
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,679
Are you gathering us for a specific reason?

245
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,349
Not really.

246
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,790
As you know, the chairman
is on the older side now.

247
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,189
I should now look out for him.

248
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,660
Yes, of course.

249
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:26,829
The chairman is at that age.

250
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,968
Please allow me to join
you when you meet with him.

251
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,199
I'd love to treat him to a meal.

252
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:34,699
This isn't some book club.

253
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,299
Tell me what you want to say,

254
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,370
and I'll relay the message.

255
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,839
Then,

256
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,209
we'll cut back on our
eco-friendly products.

257
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,709
You do that.

258
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,390
Exhale.

259
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,229
That's it. Good.

260
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,530
Dr. Park is here.

261
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:03,859
Right.

262
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:06,969
Again.

263
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,309
You are to come in.

264
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Right.

265
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,839
Goodness. I didn't expect
you to be here in person today.

266
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,380
You're such a busy man...

267
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,179
that I haven't seen you in a while.

268
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,819
Right. Have a seat.

269
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,889
I almost had a heart attack...

270
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,490
thinking you were here to say I was dying.

271
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,189
Hardly, sir.

272
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,290
You only need a flu shot.

273
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,660
And this.

274
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,429
Nothing's up, right?

275
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
- Have you been taking your meds? - Yes.

276
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,640
Then a bit of exercise...

277
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,269
will keep you healthier
than those under you.

278
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,140
That's creepy to hear.

279
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,189
Goodness me. She still looks so young.

280
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,160
Is she also a doctor?

281
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,390
Yes.

282
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,559
She's actually my daughter.

283
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:41,729
Really?

284
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:46,300
You did a good job raising her.

285
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:48,098
I don't know about anything else,

286
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,770
but my daughter is better
than me at giving shots.

287
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,240
She skipped a year in high school...

288
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,010
and is in her last year as an intern.

289
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,410
All at 24.

290
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,920
Is that so?

291
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,449
Give me a painless shot, then.

292
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Right.

293
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,740
Sure. Let me hold that for you.

294
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:34,919
There.

295
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,349
Good.

296
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,889
What's your date of birth?

297
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,129
Here.

298
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,069
(Jungang Finance)

299
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:56,040
Write down your name and date of birth.

300
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,139
Yes, sir.

301
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Hold on.

302
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,050
Write it in Chinese characters.

303
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,389
My apologies, sir.

304
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,520
Kids these days are
fluent in English but...

305
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,329
Right.

306
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,000
Same for my children too.

307
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:31,409
(Park Eun Chae)

308
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Here you go.

309
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,450
Park Eun Chae.

310
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,190
There seems to be
something pleasant about you.

311
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,540
They say we are how we look.

312
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,069
Jin Soo, choose his best photo.

313
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,308
Leave emotions out of it.

314
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,180
Leave emotions out.

315
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,109
But this is his best shot.

316
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,479
Good morning.

317
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,020
- Morning. - Morning.

318
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,189
Jin Soo, are you done
with the draft for the teaser?

319
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,220
Yes.

320
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,469
It will be hosted...

321
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,999
by Director Kang Sang Bae of Yumin Invest,

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,569
and Kwonyeong will
provide legal assistance.

323
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,270
How much is the estimated market price?

324
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,740
It's 6.5 billion dollars.

325
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,409
Seven billion.

326
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,010
I said 6.5 billion dollars.

327
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,750
What about CEO Lee?

328
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,849
You know how he is.

329
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,480
How is he perceived by others?

330
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:52,649
I doubt it'll be any different.

331
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,789
I chose one of his best photos,

332
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,089
but maybe it needs retouching.

333
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,559
No,

334
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,930
this could work considering
the nature of the business.

335
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,099
Right. There's a reason he was made CEO.

336
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,270
We'll say he takes the initiative.

337
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:09,139
Sure.

338
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,309
And the fundamental status?

339
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,970
The fundamental status?

340
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,879
Here you go.

341
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,409
- How is it? - It's not too bad.

342
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,250
- However... - But?

343
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:25,550
The profit rate has dipped recently.

344
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,118
- Why? - They've been taking...

345
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,558
on a new business model...

346
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,190
by purchasing land and
reconstructing old buildings.

347
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,158
However, they're having
trouble managing the risk...

348
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,659
that comes with real estate purchases.

349
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:37,869
Risk management?

350
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,270
Can you give me an example?

351
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:45,240
(The residents of Choongryeol
supports the development project.)

352
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,409
They tried to push ahead with
a redevelopment project here,

353
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:53,280
but it's been put on
hold for several years.

354
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,779
They need consent from at
least 75 percent of the residents.

355
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,849
I guess they're still not there yet.

356
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,490
How much are they short by?

357
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,760
We don't have that information.

358
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,159
Let's ask those at the
construction company.

359
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,169
I feel like we might see some ghosts here.

360
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,119
Oh, sorry about that.

361
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,159
I'm Lee Jung Eum, the vice
president of Sanin Construction.

362
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,260
You must be Mr. Yoon Joo No.

363
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes, Mr. Lee.

364
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,669
- Are you here to give us a tour? - Yes.

365
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:53,270
I'll show you around.

366
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Be careful.

367
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,010
Everything you see...

368
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,109
could collapse at any moment.

369
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,180
I can't believe people still live here.

370
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm surprised you came here yourself.

372
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,530
Yes.

373
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:16,659
You could've just sent someone.

374
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,230
Well...

375
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,740
I know this place better
than anyone else. That's why.

376
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,540
Despite the situation,

377
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,839
you're still struggling to
obtain resident consent?

378
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,940
Well, the thing is...

379
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,510
Yes.

380
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,020
It's because I'm not
doing my job well enough.

381
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:42,659
Anyway,

382
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,730
how much are you short by?

383
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:46,889
Resident consent.

384
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,500
Out of the 212 households,

385
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,099
fifty-four households haven't consented.

386
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,970
So, you just need one
more household on board?

387
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:57,339
What?

388
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,169
Well, yes.

389
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,579
But it's hard.

390
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:04,980
Those who are still here have
chosen to stay and hold out.

391
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:07,879
So, they don't actually live here.

392
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I mean...

393
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,020
most of them are in no rush,

394
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,220
so it's hard, to tell you the truth.

395
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,659
- "Most of them?" - Pardon?

396
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:19,889
Oh, yes.

397
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,629
There's one resident who doesn't...

398
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:26,669
fit into that category.

399
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,240
And that person lives here?

400
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,579
It's that unit at the very end.

401
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,309
An elderly lady lives alone there.

402
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:41,919
Can we talk to her?

403
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:45,919
Now?

404
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,069
She's probably not here now.

405
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Hello, ma'am?

406
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:09,609
Are you inside?

407
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,629
(Late Payment Notice)

408
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:32,399
Can't we just sell it as it is?

409
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean, it will be redeveloped eventually.

410
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,639
Whether this gets revolved or not...

411
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,809
makes a bigger difference than you think.

412
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,809
But she won't change her mind.

413
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,710
I've been trying to convince
her for years but couldn't.

414
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,579
Is there a specific reason
why she's so against it?

415
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:52,990
Honestly, I'm not sure.

416
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,159
We'll try to persuade her.

417
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,099
Get back safely, then.

418
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,669
Take care, Mr. Lee.

419
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,180
Why isn't Mr. Lee leaving?

420
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,569
The amount the chairman asked for.

421
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,609
It was ten billion dollars, right?

422
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,210
I asked Yumin Invest.

423
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,809
They said it'd be
seven billion at the most.

424
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:54,409
I must say, the chairman is a greedy man.

425
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,319
It means he doesn't want to sell it.

426
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:59,689
Yoon Joo No kept saying in front
of everyone that the company...

427
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,819
would go bankrupt if we
didn't sell Construction.

428
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,729
The chairman couldn't interrupt
him and say, "No, don't sell it."

429
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,990
Oh, you're right.

430
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,129
The chairman doesn't want to sell it.

431
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,098
It's the goose that lays the golden egg.

432
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:11,898
It makes no sense to
sell it in this situation.

433
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,430
Yes, that's one reason.

434
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,569
The chairman started out in construction.

435
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,139
He's been wanting to build apartment
complexes since he was a young man.

436
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,180
That was his dream, you know.

437
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:24,750
Oh, that's right.

438
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,709
So, Yoon Joo No...

439
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,450
wants to sell the chairman's dream.

440
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:30,648
- My gosh. - Oh, boy.

441
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,919
An old man can never forget his past.

442
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,359
How could he? That's all he has left.

443
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,729
About Construction too. It
was barely staying afloat.

444
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,099
It only became number one
when I bought Yonga E and C.

445
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Yes, totally.

446
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,770
That's why...

447
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,500
the chairman is so fond of you, sir.

448
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,739
Don't you think someone
would tell Mr. Yoon...

449
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,240
that it's not what the chairman wants?

450
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,369
It's too late.

451
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,980
The moment he said we
should sell Construction,

452
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,609
it was all over for him.

453
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:04,078
Totally. He doesn't even know
that he's digging his own grave.

454
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,019
He just keeps on digging.

455
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,760
He keeps digging away like this.

456
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,089
Mr. Yoon.

457
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,129
I bet you have no idea
how much I missed you.

458
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,589
I missed you too.

459
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:15,930
But you know,

460
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,730
ten billion dollars is simply not doable.

461
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,030
I know.

462
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,139
Then why did you tell the chairman...

463
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:25,770
that it was doable?

464
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,339
When the chairman was
asking such a question,

465
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,440
I couldn't say we couldn't do it.

466
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,609
Besides, we could make it work.

467
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,290
We haven't met before, have we?

468
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,790
No, we haven't.

469
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,989
I'm from Yumin IB, the
book runner of this deal.

470
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,030
I'm Kang Sang Bae.

471
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:47,089
Oh, I see. The book runner...

472
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,930
In mergers and acquisitions,

473
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,199
it is our job to assess
the companies that...

474
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,499
Forget it. Just think of us...

475
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
like your real estate agent when you move.

476
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,108
First off, we've reviewed everything,

477
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,540
and two companies grabbed our attention.

478
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,710
The first one is...

479
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Chamok Construction.

480
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,378
As a construction company,

481
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,250
their specialty is civil engineering.

482
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:12,289
They recently participated in the
construction of the Nanji Bridge,

483
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,588
and they've expanded
into the Middle East too.

484
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,819
But in the Middle East,

485
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,629
they thought apartment complexes
were the fast-growing market.

486
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,690
Naturally, they tried building
apartment complexes,

487
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,000
but...

488
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:23,329
it didn't go too well.

489
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,668
Civil engineering and apartment
complexes are very different.

490
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:28,739
Of course, they're different.
But the company's CEO...

491
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,039
seems very determined.

492
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,398
(Chamok Construction)

493
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,868
(CEO Cha Myung Hwan)

494
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,369
These fools at Sanin.

495
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,909
They must be very desperate now.

496
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,879
How could they think
of selling Construction?

497
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,750
I think the group is
struggling financially now.

498
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,319
Then ask for a big discount.

499
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:48,290
Sir, we'd have to bid,

500
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,759
and it's too good an opportunity
to pass up. How about...

501
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,230
Yes, sir. I'll see if I
can lower the price.

502
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,158
I'm almost certain that
Chamok will place a bid.

503
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,668
They have to launch an apartment
complex project right away,

504
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:01,700
so the process will be pretty easy.

505
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:03,199
Good.

506
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,808
But don't you think the CEO of Chamok...

507
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,210
and the CEO of Sanin
Construction look alike?

508
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,608
I think he looks more like you.

509
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:12,609
I will sue you,

510
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
for real.

511
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:16,879
Next is Bium D and I.

512
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,319
It's a real estate firm.

513
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:20,888
It led the development of
Songdo International City,

514
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,588
so the company has a
lot of cash at the moment.

515
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:23,659
With that, they're thinking,

516
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,759
"Should we get into construction now?"

517
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,128
I think that's their situation now.

518
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,159
Recently,

519
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,129
they tried doing an M and A
deal with a construction company.

520
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,770
Which one?

521
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,470
This is off the record. Ibu Construction.

522
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,540
Why did the deal fall through?

523
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Off the record.

524
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:49,049
Things got a little too heated
during the negotiation process.

525
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,879
As you know, the
construction industry is a bit...

526
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,719
How should I put this? It's a bit macho.

527
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,588
Many people in Bium studied overseas,

528
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,190
so I think they had a culture clash.

529
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,229
That's why the deal fell through,

530
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,588
so I'm sure Bium still wants
to expand into construction.

531
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,629
And they have money.

532
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,328
We should buy it. Sanin
has a good cash flow...

533
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,429
and a great brand value.

534
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,838
But we can't really use their brand.

535
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,068
If we change the company name,

536
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,039
the brand value will be affected.

537
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,270
But if we want to participate
in the Yongsan Project,

538
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,780
we need a construction company.

539
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,919
But what's the CEO of
Sanin Construction like?

540
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,889
Most construction companies are similar.

541
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,819
That's why I hate construction.

542
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:32,159
But we should do this.

543
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,770
Yes, we should.

544
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,138
(Name: Ji Yeon U)

545
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,270
This one looks good too.

546
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,940
Then what are our risks?

547
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,679
Sanin Construction's risks.
As you probably know already,

548
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,279
the biggest one is the redevelopment
of Choongryeol Apartments.

549
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,549
The truth is, it's kind of
tricky to calculate this risk,

550
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,078
but the company has already spent...

551
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,990
They've spent 880 million dollars so far.

552
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,290
Even just from the pictures,
it looks so dangerous.

553
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,058
Can you find out if there's a
way to move ahead with it...

554
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,128
without the residents' consent?

555
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,859
Yes, I'll look into it.

556
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,158
The biggest challenge in
redevelopment projects...

557
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,669
is obtaining residents' consent.

558
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:16,598
We need an elderly lady who
lives there to sign the consent form.

559
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,970
I have no idea what her story is.

560
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,040
I'll meet her and talk to her.

561
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,809
(M and A Team)

562
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,579
Can you take this off?

563
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,089
- The elevator is here. - Pardon?

564
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,349
Okay.

565
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:35,918
Sure, I'll take it off.
You should get going.

566
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,919
All right.

567
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,290
(M and A Team)

568
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,230
Right.

569
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,559
For a sign for the M and A Team,

570
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,329
this looks too shabby.

571
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,200
(M and A Team)

572
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,040
"A good negotiator may not
be emotional but is sensible."

573
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,690
Well done.

574
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,690
Thank you for the great game.

575
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,569
When did you get here?
You should've told me.

576
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:24,368
This is your favorite time of day.

577
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,540
I shouldn't interfere.

578
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:29,740
You haven't eaten yet,
have you? Give me a minute.

579
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,540
Okay.

580
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,309
I learned a lot from you today.

581
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:35,919
My goodness. You learned from me?

582
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,720
I learned a lot from you.

583
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,649
One more soju, please.

584
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,419
The chairman said to
sell it for ten billion dollars.

585
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,989
Does it mean he doesn't want to sell it?

586
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,990
Or...

587
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,800
could there be another
reason? I'm just curious.

588
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,329
Well...

589
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,629
What do you think?

590
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm not sure.

591
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
I just think...

592
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:02,940
selling Construction would be
the most sensible thing to do.

593
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:06,980
Of course, you'd say that.

594
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,550
Then you didn't come to see me...

595
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:14,250
because you wanted to know what
the chairman was really thinking.

596
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,290
Hello.

597
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,260
We're ready to order.

598
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,960
Please convince the chairman.

599
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,339
So, you think Sanin Construction
is worth seven billion dollars?

600
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:32,709
Yes.

601
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,609
I believe it'll be valued
at around 6.5 billion,

602
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,879
but I think I can up it to seven billion.

603
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:41,480
I will try to convince him.

604
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:45,349
But he said "two digits"
in front of everyone,

605
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,790
so seven billion won't cut it.

606
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Right.

607
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:54,089
But I don't think he was
saying he wouldn't sell it.

608
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,530
You see, he started out as
a construction site manager,

609
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,270
so he's very attached to that company.

610
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:06,409
He knows that keeping Construction
would put the group in jeopardy,

611
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:08,940
but the idea of selling it makes him sad.

612
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,349
So, he wants to hold onto the
card that he could use to reverse it.

613
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:16,750
Because he knows no one
would buy it for ten billion dollars.

614
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,080
Exactly.

615
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,390
I'm not trying to pressure you,

616
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,459
but he wants to look
at the price and decide.

617
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,229
Is he...

618
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,269
just attached to Sanin Construction?

619
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,399
Or the construction industry itself?

620
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,269
To earn money through hard
physical work that makes you sweat.

621
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,749
I thought you went to visit the cemetery.

622
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,490
Were you out collecting cardboard?

623
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,459
They look heavy. How
did you carry them here?

624
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
It'd be much easier if
there were an elevator here.

625
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,069
I never said I wanted an elevator.

626
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:10,569
Pardon?

627
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,640
If you're here to talk about
the redevelopment, leave now!

628
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,140
And don't come back!

629
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,080
No, that's not why I'm here.

630
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:21,810
My goodness!

631
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,780
What are you doing?

632
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,390
- I'm really sorry.
- These are so valuable.

633
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,089
You punk. You're just like those
thugs they hired to kick us out!

634
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,359
Hey, leave it!

635
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,589
- Go. Leave! - But...

636
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,930
You must've been flustered.

637
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,430
She rarely gets angry like that.

638
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:43,470
- It was my fault.
- No, please don't worry.

639
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,039
Did you also come here to convince her?

640
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,050
Yes.

641
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,449
Is she getting ready for
a memorial ceremony?

642
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,720
That's what those bowls were for.

643
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Were they?

644
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,030
Hey!

645
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
Hey, you.

646
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:19,569
We should've gotten something nicer.

647
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,240
Nothing tastes better than this in Sejong.

648
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,649
- Hey, I hear Mr. Yoon is back. - Yes.

649
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,780
About apartment redevelopment projects.

650
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,720
I hear they're launching...

651
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,619
a fast-track procedure to allow them
to proceed without resident consent.

652
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,660
Is it true?

653
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,289
No comment.

654
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,188
Have you no conscience?

655
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,760
Did you buy me a sandwich to ask me this?

656
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,399
"No comment?" That means it's true.

657
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,299
Can't they do it sooner if
they're going to do it anyway?

658
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,740
This place looked so dangerous.

659

(Choongryeol Apartments)

660
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,209
This place?

661
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:06,720
This project...

662
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,760
It'll be taken care of soon.
It does look dangerous.

663
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,389
Yes, no joke!

664
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,189
Should I submit the paperwork
for a reassessment right away?

665
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:18,229
Look at you. You were quite
smart when you were a prosecutor.

666
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,629
You're acting like a fool
now that you're an attorney.

667
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:24,439
The government wants to relax
the redevelopment regulations now.

668
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,769
Why do you think they're doing that?

669
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,239
"We will increase the supply of
housing through redevelopment..."

670
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,310
"to bring down housing
prices." That's what they're doing.

671
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:33,149
Increasing the supply.
Who doesn't know that?

672
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,248
Right. If the government
relaxes such regulations,

673
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:38,219
it must produce some results.

674
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,149
But they haven't even passed the bill yet.

675
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:43,260
You think a mere civil
servant can do this before that?

676
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:46,490
Right, so you can't help me before that.

677
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,759
The redevelopment should
take place after they pass the bill...

678
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,030
for it to count as its result.

679
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,729
That's right, you fool.

680
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,838
I knew all about it too.

681
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,140
Then why did you come here?

682
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,240
To have a sandwich.

683
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,740
- Stop. - What?

684
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,479
I said, stop.

685
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,950
- You fool. - Stop!

Hey, you need to take action
and show them you won't sit idly by.

701

Only then will he get scared
and hand over something.

It's not like someone will
help you if you sit idly by.

You're right.

704

Hey, whatever you do,

706
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:46,149
he can't report you, ever.

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,700
Jin Soo. You want to
report Sanin Construction?

728
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,769
Then who'll make the bid?

729
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,039
Let's go make the bid for now.

730
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,780
Welcome.

731
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,220
Take a seat.

732
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:12,859
Is it today?

733
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:15,330
Yes.

734
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:19,069
How much can I expect?

735
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,870
The market forecasts...

736
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:24,200
seven billion dollars.

737
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,470
See that?

738
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,379
Then I won't sell it.

739
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:35,149
Right.

740
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,050
(Bidding Box)

741
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:45,419
(Sanin Construction Auction Room)

742
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,499
Which company do you
hope will win the bid, Mr. Yoon?

743
00:42:57,899 --> 00:42:59,069
One who will pay the most.

744
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,609
Chamok must be after it more, no?

745
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,479
Civil engineering alone is lacking...

746
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,079
momentum.

747
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,449
Workers of Sanin
Construction will find it easy...

748
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,089
to adjust to Chamok.

749
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,550
That's the best scenario.

750
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,760
Is it fun?

751
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,189
This?

752
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,330
Yes.

753
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,169
Good grief. We're expecting a guest today,

754
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,740
but Jin Soo looks extremely gloomy.

755
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

756
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,879
How about we have him on guard duty?

757
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:40,550
Shall we?

758
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,010
"Guard duty?"

759
00:43:42,649 --> 00:43:43,720
Jin Soo.

760
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,519
Have some coffee at the
coffee shop in the lobby.

761
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,999
(Bium D and I)

762
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:16,680
Ms. Kwak. People from
Bium D and I are here.

763
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:18,978
The CEO herself is here...

764
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:20,120
at the coffee shop.

765
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:23,089
I see. Chamok hasn't arrived yet, right?

766
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,260
No.

767
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,999
Keep drinking your coffee.

768
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,330
What?

769
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,430
Okay.

(Chamok Construction CFO Introduction)

771
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:46,450
Hi.

772
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,479
You're from Sanin, yes?

773
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,649
What? Well...

774
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:53,490
No, I'm not.

775
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,649
We've done our research as well.

776
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,560
Billions of dollars are on the line.

777
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:59,689
Memorizing the M and
A Team's faces is a must.

778
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,660
I see.

779
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,499
We're in your care.

780
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,030
No, we...

781
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,568
Our team manager wishes
Chamok would take over.

782
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:11,339
Gosh, thank you.

783
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,269
Then how much will it be?

784
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:15,910
Sorry?

785
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,538
There's not much time left.

786
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:19,109
Just be frank with us.

787
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,709
How much do you predict?

788
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,579
The market evaluated
it for 6.5 billion dollars.

789
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,248
Around eight billion dollars.

790
00:45:28,249 --> 00:45:29,289
Eight...

791
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,589
Come on.

792
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,519
What a crook.

793
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:34,990
Let's talk man to man.

794
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
How much is it?

795
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,769
It's an auction. I can't
disclose something like that.

796

(Bid Proposal)

798
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,019
Excuse me first.

799
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,019
I must go and submit this.

800
00:46:04,189 --> 00:46:06,560
All right. Thank you.

801
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,760
The redevelopment
issue is a favorable factor.

802
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:14,100
Isn't eight billion also possible?

803
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,669
But there's a risk with
Choongryeol Apartments.

804
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,950
It won't be a problem if that settles.

805
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:32,019
The government is unlikely to approve...

806
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,519
until the bill passes.

807
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,560
I also paid the elderly woman a visit.

808
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,390
But I only got scolded.

809
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,229
The elderly woman must be scary.

810
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,870
That's not it.

811
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,039
I dropped the sacrificial food.

812
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,939
Helping her out got me scolded.

813
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,510
Yes, Jin Soo?

814
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,510
All right.

815
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,649
The CEO of Bium is heading up here.

816
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:06,490
What a relief.

817
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,019
I'm leaving for the day first.

818
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,450
Is it Team Manager Yoon Joo No?

819
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,959
Hi. You must be CEO Ji Yeon U.

820
00:47:47,129 --> 00:47:48,129
Yes.

821
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,459
Sanin Construction is quite popular.

822
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:53,970
Yes, and it's all thanks to you.

823
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:56,470
I'd like to buy it...

824
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,470
at a cheap price.

825
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,010
But we must sell it at a high price.

826
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,310
By the way, why are
you selling Construction?

827
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,878
Isn't Construction Sanin's cash flow?

828
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:10,879
Yes, it is.

829
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,719
It's Sanin's engine.

830
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Exactly.

831
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,188
So why are you selling the profit center?

832
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:20,128
I'll answer that if you
bid for the highest price...

833
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:21,189
and win the auction.

834
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:26,930
We have yet to write the
price on our bid proposal.

835
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:29,999
Seven billion dollars.

836
00:48:30,899 --> 00:48:32,069
Will that do?

837
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,280
It's not impossible.

838
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,249
Ms. Ji.

839
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,390
I heard you tried to take over
a construction company before.

840
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,789
Yes, but it didn't work out.

841
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,160
Why didn't it back then?

842
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
Back then...

843
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,429
I must've written a low price.

844
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,069
What was the difference?

845
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:04,899
From the price you wanted.

846
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,709
It was quite big. About
one billion dollars.

847
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,910
Wouldn't it be bad for Bium
to lose Sanin Construction?

848
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,649
It's rare for a construction
company to be up for auction.

849
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,350
The government will soon
amend the redevelopment law.

850
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:21,689
If so,

851
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,958
you might have to consider...

852
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,390
selling Construction.

853
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,729
So,

854
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,859
how much?

855
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,100
Sanin Construction...

856
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,869
is much more valuable than the company...

857
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,399
you couldn't buy.

858
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:38,899
That's why...

859
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:44,109
I hope you'll buy it.

860
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:49,149
Truthfully,

861
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,780
I didn't like the CEO of that company.

862
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,550
What about yours?

863
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:56,289
Is your CEO likable?

864
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,959
No. He's worse.

865
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:08,669
- How honest of you. - Yes.

866
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,838
But the company...

867
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,339
will do you good, Ms. Ji.

868
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,310
How so? You said the CEO wasn't nice.

869
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:16,740
If you take over,

870
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,910
my job will go as far as
transforming the company...

871
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,050
to your liking.

872
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,450
And so, we ask that you factor that...

873
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,789
into the price.

874
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:06,160
(Bid Proposal, 7.5 billion dollars)

875
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Wait.

876
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,249
Bid with this one.

877
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,589
How did you know?

878
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:11,389
On the documents, the contract
is under the grandfather's name.

879
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,519
But he has passed away.

880
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,728
But the two weren't legally married,

881
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:16,359
which I found strange.

882
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,229
Legally, the grandmother
has no rights to it.

883
00:52:21,729 --> 00:52:23,870
I doubt you didn't know about it.

884
00:52:24,439 --> 00:52:25,439
My apologies.

885
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:27,208
When we first met,

886
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:28,810
you visited his grave. Yes?

887
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,109
Yes.

888
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,740
How did you know that?

889
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,780
There was dirt on your shoes.

890
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,149
Was that all it took to notice that?

891
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,359
You already knew the
grandmother wouldn't be at her place.

892
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,530
Did the grandmother oppose
the redevelopment to protect...

893
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:56,569
the grandfather's grave?

894
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,169
Yes.

895
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,970
When Grandfather was alive,

896
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,580
Grandmother wanted to move.

897
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,879
But Grandfather was against it.

898
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,220
Opposition rallies...

899
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,289
led to physical confrontations.

900
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,120
That was how Grandfather passed away.

901
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,189
Were you there when it happened?

902
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:24,999
I was.

903
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,870
Did the physical altercations
escalate to the point of fatalities?

904
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,069
You see...

905
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,910
The stories vary.

906
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,709
But Grandfather was already poor in health.

907
00:53:40,879 --> 00:53:41,879
Hence why...

908
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,050
no compensation was given.

909
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:47,419
I see.

910
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:49,620
Apparently, Grandfather was against...

911
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,919
the redevelopment...

912
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,129
as he wanted to receive a great
sum of money for Grandmother.

913
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:00,899
- But... - You found out...

914
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,499
the two weren't legally married.

915
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,499
Correct.

916
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:08,410
And you didn't report it.

917
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,410
If I do,

918
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,749
Grandmother would be kicked out.

919
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,519
They're legally strangers.

920
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,370
When Grandmother passes away,

921
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,470
will she want to be rested next to him?

922
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,169
Yes.

923
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:41,169
That's what she says every day.

924
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:51,649
Shall we wrap it up now?

925
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:54,689
We seem done.

926
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,060
Okay.

927
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:02,930
I'm nervous.

928
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,760
I have a hunch. Seven billion dollars.

929
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,100
Come on.

930
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:22,149
Chamok?

931
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,780
Yes.

932
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:29,350
(Bid Proposal, 6.9 billion dollars)

933
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,789
- How much? - It's six...

934
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,430
point nine billion dollars.

935
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,030
That is still a great price.

936
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:42,970
It's...

937
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,470
a little bit short.

938
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,370
Bium D and I...

939
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,709
What? What is it?

940
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:53,879
Is it really seven billion dollars?

941
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:55,180
Seven...

942
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:58,580
point 9,999 billion dollars.

943
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:16,640
Please excuse me.

944
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:20,539
Yes, Min Jeong?

945
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,339
Great.

946
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,050
Got it.

947
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:40,330
Director Lee.

948
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,459
It's a little over 7.9 billion dollars.

949
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,129
Good job.

950
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,629
It'd be great if the chairman
learned how to play go.

951
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,539
For two months, Bium
has the exclusive right...

952
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,339
to request data from us.

953
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
We must provide the requested data,

954
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,879
and if there are no notable issues with it,

955
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,350
Bium must pay 7.999 billion dollars...

956
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:36,850
under the contract.

957
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,850
What if there's a notable issue?

958
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,249
- Can they cut the price? - Yes.

959
00:57:42,649 --> 00:57:44,959
If both parties have a compelling reason,

960
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,688
the price can change.

961
00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:49,999
(Sanin)

962
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,030
You will now answer all my questions, yes?

963
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:55,169
I won't lie.

964
00:57:55,899 --> 00:57:56,899
Okay.

965
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,539
How old are you, Mr. Yoon?

966
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:04,780
That is not relevant to the contract.

967
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,580
That until the very end?

968
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,519
We'd like a board meeting first.

969
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,359
Let's do that.

970
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,959
(Sanin Construction)

971
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,970
Sanin Construction.

972
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:32,240
How do you see the future of it?

973
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,069
It’s the best.

974
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:37,979
Apartment brands are
like a social class in Korea.

975
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:41,510
Sanin Construction is at the top.

976
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,649
No matter how bad the recession
gets, luxury items sell better.

977
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,089
Likewise, Sanin Construction
will continue to do well.

978
00:58:49,419 --> 00:58:50,419
I can assure you of it.

979
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,459
But once we take over, we
won't use the name Sanin.

980
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,160
Won't that depreciate the brand value?

981
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:57,459
What?

982
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:02,569
I made Sanin Construction number one.

983
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,640
I have confidence in Bium too.

984
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:06,069
I see.

985
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,979
(No insight)

986
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,680
There isn't much land left
in Seoul to build apartments.

987
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,080
And the population is
decreasing in the provinces.

988
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,680
What's your opinion on this?

989
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:23,050
Haven't you heard of reconstruction?

990
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,018
To proceed with reconstructions...

991
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:27,859
You don't have to
disclose such information.

992
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,700
Redevelopment details
are quite confidential.

993
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,260
I see.

994
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,600
But we'll soon find out, won't we?

995
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,530
Yes.

996
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,869
By the way, you've gotten much stronger.

997
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:40,870
What?

998
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:42,410
Is that so?

999
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:44,879
But I don't think so.

1000
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,879
But we didn't take a single
break coming up here.

1001
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,120
Come sit.

1002
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,180
You're right.

1003
00:59:55,189 --> 00:59:57,019
- Gosh. - Good grief.

1004
01:00:00,189 --> 01:00:01,729
If you've caught your breath,

1005
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:05,959
tell me what it's about.

1006
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:07,970
What?

1007
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,200
You asked to go hiking
together for the first time.

1008
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:13,300
That means you've got something to tell me.

1009
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:19,979
You see...

1010
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:22,810
Sell Sanin Construction?

1011
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,689
Yes.

1012
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,060
I...

1013
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:40,930
started off with building apartments.

1014
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,200
Back then,

1015
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:45,370
I worked my butt off.

1016
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,339
But thinking of selling it...

1017
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:54,010
makes me wonder what I've done wrong.

1018
01:00:54,879 --> 01:00:57,350
Goodness. I can't get a wink of sleep.

1019
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,450
You didn't do anything
wrong, Chairman Song.

1020
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,930
How much did they bid for?

1021
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,629
One hundred thousand...

1022
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,999
short of eight billion dollars.

1023
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:15,399
Ask for more.

1024
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,640
Even if it can't go over ten,

1025
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:20,709
it should be over nine billion dollars.

1026
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,339
We'll tell them to keep
trying until the last moment.

1027
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:26,209
Yes.

1028
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,350
Get them to pay more.

1029
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,220
Hello.

1030
01:01:37,419 --> 01:01:39,919
I'm Lee Hun Min, the
CEO of Sanin Construction.

1031
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:43,289
I see.

1032
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,359
What brings you here?

1033
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:50,370
We'll be seeing each
other a lot from now on.

1034
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,568
I've come to introduce myself...

1035
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:54,010
in anticipation of our future partnership.

1036
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:02,910
This is one of the projects
from Sanin Construction...

1037
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,459
You've reached the M
and A Team of Sanin Group.

1038
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:17,930
Yes, Mr. CFO.

1039
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:21,769
I see.

1040
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:24,939
Okay.

1041
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:31,639
Yes. I understand. Then...

1042
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,279
as for the deadline,

1043
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,879
I'll call you back after
I report it to Mr. Yoon.

1044
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,950
Bye.

1045
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,688
That was CFO of Bium D and I on the phone.

1046
01:02:43,689 --> 01:02:46,160
He wants to learn about
future redevelopment projects.

1047
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,430
We already handed over the files.

1048
01:02:47,459 --> 01:02:49,688
Right. But he wants more
information about them.

1049
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:50,999
So he requested a meeting.

1050
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,999
This has to do with
Choongryeol Apartments, right?

1051
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,330
I'm not sure.

1052
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:56,830
Mr. Yoon.

1053
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,999
We have a bit of a problem.

1054
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,959
The contract looks precise.

1055
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,289
And so is your reputation,
Mr. Yoon. I know we can trust you.

1056
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,660
But...

1057
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:25,300
we do have some concerns.

1058
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,169
Sure. What are your concerns?

1059
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,970
We're concerned about the
progress of redevelopment projects.

1060
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:34,568
Redevelopment projects have a
complicated approval process...

1061
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:36,538
and usually take a long time.

1062
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:39,039
We know that better than anyone.

1063
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:40,749
We're in real estate.

1064
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:42,410
Right.

1065
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,018
There are attempts from the government,

1066
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:48,349
trying to ease redevelopment regulations.

1067
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:49,619
There are attempts,

1068
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,889
but it hasn't happened yet.

1069
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,189
Right. But it will happen.

1070
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:55,830
Can you guarantee it?

1071
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,560
A 100-percent guarantee?

1072
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,129
Not 100 percent.

1073
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,329
For Sanin Construction,
the redevelopment project...

1074
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,169
of Choongryeol Apartments
is the hardest case.

1075
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:07,910
That's why I wanted this meeting.

1076
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:11,879
On paper, it seemed the
project could launch anytime.

1077
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,149
But it might not have
been the case in real life.

1078
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:21,688
It will be difficult to
start immediately...

1079
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:23,889
as there's an issue with
the consent of residents.

1080
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:26,120
That is why we believe it
is more realistic to wait...

1081
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,759
until the regulations are eased.

1082
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,830
Then...

1083
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,760
give us a discount.

1084
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,628
We have to take the
risk that the government...

1085
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:35,129
may not ease the regulations.

1086
01:04:38,939 --> 01:04:40,339
How much are you thinking?

1087
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,669
We're thinking 440 million dollars.

1088
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:45,709
And interest will be added to that.

1089
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:47,609
That is too much.

1090
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,419
What's the amount that's
already been executed?

1091
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:52,120
It's 880 million dollars.

1092
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:54,148
The chance of the redevelopment
project getting approved...

1093
01:04:54,149 --> 01:04:55,649
is 50-50?

1094
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,019
It's much higher than 50 percent.

1095
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,289
Half of 880 million dollars
is 440 million dollars.

1096
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,600
If we add 20 percent of that
for the risk we have to take...

1097
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
How much is that?

1098
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,470
It's 528 million dollars.

1099
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,810
Then will the final price be
around 7.4 billion dollars?

1100
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:17,080
I mean, the purchase price.

1101
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:19,740
It's 7.4719 billion dollars, to be precise.

1102
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,680
So you evaluated the price of the risk...

1103
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,120
as 528 million dollars, correct?

1104
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,019
Yes.

1105
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:30,760
I see. I understand.

1106
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,859
That was easy.

1107
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,329
Then I'll understand that you
agreed to reducing the price...

1108
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,899
by 530 million dollars...

1109
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:43,569
and get going.

1110
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:47,039
Ms. Ji.

1111
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,370
What if we were to eliminate this risk?

1112
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:53,850
Will you pay an additional
530 million dollars?

1113
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,310
No.

1114
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,050
The redevelopment project
getting approved was the default.

1115
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,619
But we don't know when that will happen,

1116
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,918
so I asked to lower the price.

1117
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:03,958
Then you agree that the
project will be approved...

1118
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,088
at some point, correct?

1119
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:06,089
Yes,

1120
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,260
I do.

1121
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,330
The problem is that we don't
know when it will happen.

1122
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,769
I am simply stating that
Sanin should bear the interest...

1123
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,769
on the expenses already incurred,

1124
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,470
the costs for the relevant personnel,

1125
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,109
and the cost of uncertainty...

1126
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,339
regarding government regulations.

1127
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:24,780
I see. I understand now.

1128
01:06:25,479 --> 01:06:28,050
So the risk isn't about the
project not going through.

1129
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:30,580
The problem is how fast
the project will be approved.

1130
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,180
Is that correct?

1131
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,050
Yes. That's correct.

1132
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,560
But will clarifying that change anything?

1133
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,600
Why are you smiling at me?

1134
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,899
A professional agency...

1135
01:06:53,499 --> 01:06:56,410
will make it look exactly like this photo.

1136
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:01,950
Right here.

1137
01:07:05,749 --> 01:07:06,780
This is...

1138
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,890
your husband's hometown, isn't it?

1139
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,890
It is.

1140
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,129
That's where we met too.

1141
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:15,459
I know that.

1142
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,399
That's how we found this place.

1143
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,569
As you can see in the photo,

1144
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,970
there's enough space. Later...

1145
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,680
Once I'm gone,

1146
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,950
can I be buried next to him?

1147
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,180
I'll see to it myself...

1148
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,050
Ma'am.

1149
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:44,359
You trust me, don't you?

1150
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,890
You want me to trust you again?

1151
01:07:50,189 --> 01:07:51,529
If we were to get the project...

1152
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,330
approved before the
acquisition is finalized,

1153
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:57,069
will you recognize our performance
worthy of 530 million dollars...

1154
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,769
which you deemed the price of the risk?

1155
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,909
That was already included...

1156
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:02,970
I will...

1157
01:08:04,979 --> 01:08:06,080
recognize it as so.

1158
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:10,979
But by when will you get the approval?

1159
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:13,950
I plan to finish my due diligence by today.

1160
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,600
By today.

1161
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:30,198
We now have consent from
75 percent of the residents.

1162
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,739
Then did you get me
to agree to this deal...

1163
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,270
after getting their consent?

1164
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:35,539
No.

1165
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,310
We got the last consent form just now.

1166
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,239
The vice president tried his best.

1167
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:56,360
Mr. Yoon.

1168
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,669
You're not going to make us
pay the whole amount, right?

1169
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,600
The entire 528 million dollars.

1170
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,239
It was 530 million dollars.

1171
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,739
I'm investing my own money
to acquire the company.

1172
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,610
But aren't you just an employee?

1173
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,009
Why are you making it tough on me?

1174
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,680
I have to save our company.

1175
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:19,779
Ms. Ji.

1176
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:22,919
You asked me why we were selling
Sanin Construction the other day.

1177
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:28,230
Yes. I did. And?

1178
01:09:28,589 --> 01:09:30,089
I believe we must sell...

1179
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,829
the best bit for Sanin Group to survive.

1180
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,430
That is why...

1181
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,499
you're walking away with the best part.

1182
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,770
So...

1183
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,550
will you make us pay the entire amount?

1184
01:09:49,709 --> 01:09:52,720
Could I talk to Ms. Ji
in private for a moment?

1185
01:09:54,449 --> 01:09:56,320
He's been trying.

1186
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:01,430
But it seems he can't get
it up to nine billion dollars.

1187
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,600
So it's at 8.5 billion dollars?

1188
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,600
Yes.

1189
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,270
I guess that's the figure
they're trying to finalize.

1190
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:14,739
I see.

1191
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:21,110
You know,

1192
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,980
Sanin Construction was our first baby.

1193
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,989
I hope our first baby has
a good future with them.

1194
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:31,489
Right?

1195
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:32,489
Mr. Yoon.

1196
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,730
You won't make us pay
8.5299 billion dollars,

1197
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,600
will you?

1198
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:43,199
Buy a burial lot, and we'll give
you a 29.9-million-dollar discount.

1199
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:46,199
It will work in your favor as well.

1200
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,669
What do you mean?

1201
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,539
A burial lot?

1202
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:53,778
Bium D and I acquired Sanin Construction.

1203
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:56,110
It was the biggest acquisition of the year.

1204
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:58,049
Through this acquisition, Bium D and I...

1205
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,020
plans to dive into apartment
construction with full force.

1206
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,189
We also have one more
story about Bium D and I.

1207
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,619
Yes, it's a touching story.

1208
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:07,958
The redevelopment project
managed by Sanin Construction...

1209
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,158
hit a wall.

1210
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:11,800
Bium D and I sorted it out
while acquiring the company.

1211
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,529
What was the problem?

1212
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:17,230
There was a grave on the
hill behind the apartment.

1213
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:19,698
The resident was an old lady.

1214
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:21,770
It was her husband's grave.

1215
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,168
It was illegal, wasn't it?

1216
01:11:23,169 --> 01:11:26,310
Yes. They weren't legally married.

1217
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,948
Her right in the redevelopment project...

1218
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,379
could have been revoked too.

1219
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,878
The land belonged to Sanin Construction.

1220
01:11:31,879 --> 01:11:34,050
It now belongs to Bium D and I.

1221
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,519
Then what happened?

1222
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,948
However, Bium D and I...

1223
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:39,459
moved her husband's grave to his hometown.

1224
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,588
They also acknowledged her
right in the redevelopment project.

1225
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,430
That's how their project moved forward.

1226
01:11:45,129 --> 01:11:47,800
Mergers and acquisitions are
known as wars without weapons.

1227
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:50,128
That's a heartwarming
story from a battlefield.

1228
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:52,300
Yes. It's my first time encountering...

1229
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,610
such a touching story while
presenting news on economy.

1230
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:59,209
Let's watch an interview
with the CEO of Bium D and I.

1231
01:11:59,839 --> 01:12:01,578
The motto of our company, Bium D and I,

1232
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:03,650
is to create a place for people...

1233
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:05,219
where they can be happy,

1234
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,219
rather than just building fancy apartments.

1235
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,649
(CEO Ji Yeon U)

1236
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,049
We will strive to become...

1237
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,389
a construction company...

1238
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,889
that builds shelters for people...

1239
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,360
and leads our housing
environment into a better future.

1240
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:25,970
I haven't been here in ages.
Now, it brings back old memories.

1241
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:28,770
Be a bit more patient.

1242
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:31,379
I'll be there soon.

1243
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:36,249
You know what?

1244
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:39,449
To get you a nice spot like this,

1245
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,690
I had to go through a lot.

1246
01:12:43,789 --> 01:12:45,060
So when we meet again,

1247
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,829
you'd better adore me.

1248
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,419
Thank you.

1249
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,319
We thank you for joining us to celebrate...

1250
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,389
the closing of the acquisition...

1251
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,989
between Sanin Construction
and Bium D and I.

1252
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:26,199
I'm especially curious to hear...

1253
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,099
from Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo...

1254
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,400
as he put so much
effort into this contract.

1255
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,499
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

1256
01:13:36,339 --> 01:13:38,079
(Deal Closing Ceremony:
Sanin Group and Bium D and I)

1257
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,480
Thank you.

1258
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,618
Up until now, Sanin
Construction has been...

1259
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:51,089
the best construction company in Korea.

1260
01:13:51,919 --> 01:13:55,230
Now, I have no doubt that it
will be the best in the world.

1261
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:56,859
And...

1262
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,860
Yes. Thank you.

1263
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,800
As I had complete faith in that,

1264
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,199
I was able to successfully
lead this acquisition.

1265
01:14:05,869 --> 01:14:07,239
- He was against it. - Right.

1266
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:11,509
Someone else made a huge
contribution to the acquisition.

1267
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,709
But I shamelessly gave my speech first.

1268
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,109
I'm not usually this shameless.

1269
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,110
Mr. Yoon.

1270
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:19,079
Let's give a big round of
applause to welcome her.

1271
01:14:19,379 --> 01:14:20,989
CEO Ji Yeon U of Bium D and I.

1272
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:22,890
Let's give it up for her.

1273
01:14:31,529 --> 01:14:35,628
(Location: Sanin Hotel and Resort)

1274
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:38,940
I don't have a long speech prepared.

1275
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:42,770
Thank you for selling us a great company.

1276
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:46,010
We'll work hard to grow
it into a better company.

1277
01:14:47,339 --> 01:14:48,850
Please give her a round of applause.

1278
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:53,879
Thank you.

1279
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,519
- Let's enjoy some refreshments...
- This isn't right.

1280
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,819
- As you freely mingle...
- He did all the work.

1281
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,088
- Around the room.
- What's that expression?

1282
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:00,918
- You know what I mean, right?
- Please enjoy...

1283
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:02,129
- your time.
- Let's just enjoy some good food.

1284
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,459
Okay.

1285
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,839
Mr. Yoon.

1286
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:15,039
I believe you're incredible.

1287
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:17,739
And the extra 500
million dollars in the end...

1288
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,150
How did you manage that?

1289
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:23,850
I was lucky.

1290
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,520
Sorry?

1291
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,520
I thought you just played smart.

1292
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:31,190
Negotiation doesn't go well
just because you're smart.

1293
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,860
It's luck.

1294
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:46,940
There's my torturer.

1295
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,739
Congratulations, Ms. Ji.

1296
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:51,739
Best of luck to your venture
with the apartment construction.

1297
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:52,909
Thanks.

1298
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:56,510
If you decide to leave Sanin Group,

1299
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:58,449
join us.

1300
01:16:00,749 --> 01:16:01,789
We'll see.

1301
01:16:08,629 --> 01:16:09,629
Mr. Lee.

1302
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,699
I should introduce you to the
CEO of my construction company.

1303
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:13,959
Right here.

1304
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,730
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1305
01:16:16,369 --> 01:16:17,369
Hello.

1306
01:16:17,999 --> 01:16:19,339
So you're the CEO now.

1307
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:23,470
I heard you recommended me.

1308
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:25,539
I did?

1309
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:34,589
It's the chairman.

1310
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,820
Hey.

1311
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,158
My gosh. Nice to meet you.

1312
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,230
- Hello. - Yes.

1313
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,029
Sanin Construction...

1314
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:51,839
was the one I cherished the most.

1315
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:53,140
Please take good care of it.

1316
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:54,538
Yes, sir.

1317
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:56,409
I'll grow it the best I can too.

1318
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:57,739
Good luck.

1319
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:00,310
- I'll let you guys talk. - Okay.

1320
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:04,850
Hey.

1321
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:07,520
All right then.

1322
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:09,550
Good work.

1323
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:11,089
Please don't mention it.

1324
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,560
I heard you were quite
attached to Sanin Construction.

1325
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,799
Right. That's why I told him...

1326
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,198
we needed to get at
least ten billion dollars.

1327
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,259
But good grief.

1328
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,900
Director Lee kept on
pushing me to take the deal.

1329
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:25,199
I see.

1330
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,169
Thank you for approving the acquisition.

1331
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,640
Sure.

1332
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,879
Then is this all?

1333
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,940
We need more money.

1334
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,279
Well, that can't be much. Right?

1335
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:42,749
It's about 2.5 billion dollars.

1336
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:55,699
Then...

1337
01:17:58,699 --> 01:17:59,739
what else...

1338
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,239
are you going to sell?

1339
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:04,640
This time,

1340
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:06,480
I'll buy.

1341
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:11,650
Look.

1342
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,519
You sold off Sanin Construction.

1343
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,650
Now,

1344
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:17,820
you want to buy something else?

1345
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:19,959
Yes.

1346
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,089
I will.

1347
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:33,970
Mr. Yoon will buy this time.

1348
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,140
- Which company? - A gaming company.

1349
01:18:38,379 --> 01:18:39,440
A gaming company?

1350
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:42,010
That will be fun at least, right?

1351
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,510
Yes. Totally.

1352
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:48,789
Jin Soo.

1353
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:51,489
Eat a lot.

1354
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,989
No. I wasn't much help.

1355
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,489
You did well. You did a
nice job standing guard.

1356
01:18:58,029 --> 01:18:59,029
Right.

1357
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,129
I was lucky.

1358
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:04,070
What?

1359
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:06,039
Working hard doesn't
mean it will get me results.

1360
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,770
It was luck.

1361
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,169
What's he talking about?

1362
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,390
My goodness. So I heard
you scored a big one.

1363
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:31,600
Yes, I closed the deal today.

1364
01:19:32,029 --> 01:19:33,459
That's impressive.

1365
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,270
Did you really sell it
for 8.5 billion dollars?

1366
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:38,570
I hear things are going
well for Samoel Fund too.

1367
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:41,440
Gosh, we mostly make
profits for other people.

1368
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,140
Actually,

1369
01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:47,239
there was something I
wanted to discuss in person.

1370
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,150
About what?

1371
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:52,020
Yoon Joo No.

1372
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:53,779
I see.

1373
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:56,520
Let's talk more in person.

1374
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:58,890
What favor?

1375
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,419
Jumbo Pharmaceuticals.

1376
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,190
That's...

1377
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,129
Just forget about it.

1378
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,400
Isn't that what the deceased wanted?

1379
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:10,129
Let's put it behind us and move on.

1380
01:20:10,699 --> 01:20:12,039
I want to,

1381
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,470
but I'm struggling with it.

1382
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:18,440
What do you need?

1383
01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:22,409
A strategy.

1384
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:35,089
(The Art of Negotiation)

1385
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:08,430
{\an8}Director Lee wanted to
do this a long time ago.

1386
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,760
{\an8}Isn't it too late?

1387
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,800
{\an8}This is the right time and the last window.

1388
01:21:11,999 --> 01:21:13,600
{\an8}You think the distribution
sector is a joke?

1389
01:21:13,629 --> 01:21:16,169
{\an8}You want to make Delivery King a reality?

1390
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,499
{\an8}My gosh, that's hilarious.

1391
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,770
{\an8}It will be a revolution
of the distribution sector.

1392
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,609
{\an8}If we make a platform with it, I
have to shut down the game, right?

1393
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:23,610
{\an8}I won't sell it to you.

1394
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:25,579
{\an8}This will be the end of Yoon Joo No.

1395
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:27,709
{\an8}Did you share this?

1396
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,980
{\an8}Yes.

1397
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:30,409
{\an8}I hope it doesn't fail like it did before.

1398
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,448
{\an8}Ten million dollars.

1399
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:35,419
{\an8}Do Han Chul and Yoon
Joo No are both con artists.

1400
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:38,020
{\an8}We should take it this time.
So this was Yoon Joo No's idea?

1401
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:39,860
{\an8}He'd do anything to get what he wants.
