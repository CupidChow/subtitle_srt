I'm not that hungry. I'll just get going.

15
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,330
I know.

16

Oh Woon still refuses to talk to me.

17
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,240
But at least she's now
picking up the phone.

18
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,350
- I guess that's a relief.
- Of course it is.

be on good terms with him.

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,370
how many tests we'll need to conduct.

185
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,499
That's why it's better to
have a larger reserve of funds.

186
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,110
Come on. Are you kidding me?

187
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,370
That's what investors hate to hear.

188
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,980
You don't know when you'll find success...

189
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,309
but are asking for an investment.

190
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,310
That's not it.

191
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,680
It'll happen. We're almost there.

192
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,220
On top of that, we'll be
funded by the government.

193
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,360
Then it'll be a done deal.

194
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,489
Since it's impossible to go
up against government funding,

195
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,090
competitors usually give up.

196
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,929
However, to receive that funding,

197
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,230
we need good results from
phase three of the clinical trial.

198
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,970
That's what has us desperate,

199
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,640
but the drug is solid.

200
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,540
I'm only trying to expedite the project...

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,010
before our competitors catch up.

202
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,010
Mr. Ha, please.

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,180
All we need is 8.7 million dollars.

204
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,120
The amount isn't the issue.

205
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,450
It's certainty we need.

206
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,190
Unbelievable.

207
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,970
Right here.

208
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
This is not the way to
compose your IR report.

209
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,009
You need to tell a story.

210
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,740
- Our IR report? - This right here.

211
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,010
- I see. - Look at this section.

212
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,480
Who cares how many
papers this researcher wrote?

213
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,250
How many people in this world
would even know what this is?

214
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,590
I see.

215
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,360
A script...

216
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,830
needs drama.

217
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,930
Drama.

218
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,770
- Do you get what I mean?
- Pardon? Yes, sir.

219
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm not fond of this attitude either.

220
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,240
I mean,

221
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,740
be more assertive.

222
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,440
My gosh.

223
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,780
Unbelievable.

224
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,620
Mr. Ha, that's not something...

225
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm good at,

226
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,060
but my company...

227
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,860
has what it takes.

228
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,660
- With just 8.7 million dollars...
- CEO Ko.

229
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,830
I doubt you know what I make in a year.

230
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,240
- Sorry? - Do you?

231
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,340
I don't.

232
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,479
People assume you rake in millions...

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
as a company executive,

234
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,080
but that's hardly the case.

235
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,179
You'll probably make more.

236
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,890
Gosh, of course not.

237
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,420
As if.

238
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,190
To be honest, I'm jealous of you.

239
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,190
What you have is yours.

240
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,260
You have a chance to win big.

241
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,700
It isn't mine alone.

242
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,130
- My employees also... - Seriously?

243
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,910
How much of the shares do you own?

244
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,980
About 50 percent.

245
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,550
See?

246
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,710
It's clearly yours.

247
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,250
Lucky you.

248
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,970
You must not know the
predicament I'd face...

249
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,170
if the company were to
invest in your business.

250
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,610
You have it rough, don't you?

251
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,250
Maintaining a sound mind is
impossible in this line of work.

252
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm not asking for money to use personally,

253
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,079
but it requires convincing those idiots...

254
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,050
and grovelling to those
with a chip on their shoulder.

255
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,590
To do so, I must wine and
dine them out of my own pocket.

256
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,860
I see.

257
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,029
Let's say I managed to jump
through all those hoops...

258
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,000
to get you that investment.

259
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,700
What follows...

260
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,970
is my presentation of
the deal to the chairman.

261
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,500
What do you think that implies?

262
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm sticking my own neck
out to vouch for the investment.

263
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,640
So why should I go
through all that trouble?

264
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,280
My salary stays the same
whether you get the funding or not.

265
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,520
Put yourself in my shoes.
Wouldn't you agree?

266
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,590
I'm better off not proposing this at all.

267
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,560
Also, what if I did all of that...

268
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,320
and the project flops?

269
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,090
The company will hold me accountable.

270
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,200
You understand me, don't you?

271
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,829
Mr. Ha, this drug...

272
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,200
It'll be a hit. It won't be a flop.

273
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,470
You should also know...

274
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,070
that children with
developmental challenges...

275
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,779
will benefit from this drug.

276
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,140
Exactly.

277
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,450
Should this project be successful,

278
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,650
only you will benefit from it.

279
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,890
If it flops, I'll face termination.

280
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,950
So considering the outcome,

281
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,490
why would I do something...

282
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,490
that solely benefits another?

283
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,030
Let's be real.

284
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,280

Thank you.

290
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,210
But I take it...

291
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,480
you spent most of your
time working in your lab.

292
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,020
You're terrible at conducting business.

293
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,880
Sorry?

294
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,350
I told you I didn't earn much,

295
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,720
so you assumed I was
someone who could be bought.

296
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,160
Gosh, no.

297
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,730
What kind of a loser do you think I am?

298
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,930
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,970
Just leave.

300
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,770
I'll consider this conversation
as though it never happened.

301
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,400
Seriously, that fool.

302
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,470
He's awfully dense.

303
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,670
How can he run a business?

304
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,110
I scolded him. I guess it scared him.

305
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,680
I haven't heard from him since.

306
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,950
My goodness.

307
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,780
It would've scared me too.

308
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,420
But weren't you torn when
he offered 500,000 dollars?

309
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,620
Well, should I have changed
my mind at that moment?

310
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,530
Then I would've earned big
money and moved to the US already.

311
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,730
Right.

312
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,439
Hang on now. Are you suspecting me?

313
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,940
No, of course not.

314
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,940
The truth is, you were on
the M and A Team back then.

315
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,180
So technically, the Audit Team
should interview you as well,

316
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,050
but I told them not to.

317
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,550
I'll tell them I interviewed you
because we're talking now anyway.

318
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,690
That's why I suggested we meet today.

319
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,420

- Thanks. - No problem.

By the way, it won't be
easy with Yoon Joo No.

He's extremely clever when
it comes to stuff like that.

324

That may be the case,
but we have solid evidence.

Well, I have to say it looks like...

No, I have not.

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
JUMBO.

342
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,990

343
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,660

They're the first Korean
ADHD medication manufacturer.

347
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,570
It's half the price of the
ones made in the US.

348
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,470
They totally hit the jackpot with it.

349
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,740

Yes.

00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,180
But these days, they call it ASD,

354
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,620
autism spectrum disorder.

355
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,320
I see.

356
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,820
You know, autism spectrum disorder is...

357
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,160
I guess it depends on the symptoms,

358
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,900
but it doesn't only affect the patient.

359
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,330
The whole family has
to care for the patient.

360
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,870

talked about developing a cure,

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,880
- JUMBO Pharma? - Yes.

364
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,310
They're already doing a phase-three trial.

365
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,150
But the company seems to
be struggling financially now.

366
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,990
It costs a lot of money to
develop a new drug, you know.

367
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,920
And you have to move fast.

368
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,689
The one who develops it first...

369
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,560
and gets a patent will
reap all the benefits.

370
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,930
How long does a
pharmaceutical patent right last?

371
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,970
Twenty years.

372
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,530
That's right.

373
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,240
It means they can dominate
the market for 20 years.

374
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,110
That's huge.

375
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,210
On top of that, they'll soon be
selected for a national project.

376
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
- Are you sure? - Of course, I am.

377
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,150
I have my sources.

378
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,790
So, they want to complete
their phase-three trial quickly.

379
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,190
Once JUMBO is selected for the project,

380
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,960
the other companies will
have no choice but to give up.

381
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,730
Okay. Then shall we review
investing in the company?

382
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,230
No, let's put a rush on this.

383
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,400
I told them it wouldn't
be a simple investment.

384
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,670
I said we'd buy up their main stock.

385
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,769
Eight million dollars
worth of new shares...

386
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,970
and four million for their old shares.

387
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,879
Their old shares too?

388
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,210
Come on. I told them
to just hand those over.

389
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,519
What do you say?

390
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,950
Don't you think there's no
reason for us not to pursue this?

391
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,789
You're right.

392
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,760
Based on what you told me
now, it seems attractive enough.

393
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,490
- However... - Okay.

394
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,830
Then I'll go ahead and have
them sign a right of first offer.

395
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,560
Do you want to meet them with me?

396
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,970
Sure.

397
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
When will you meet them?

398
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,900
Today.

399
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,170
- Today? - That's right.

400
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,780
Actually, he should be here any minute now.

401
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,310
My gosh.

402
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,450
He came right on time.

403
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,650
- Come on in. - Hello, Director Ha.

404
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,190
- Oh, you have a guest. - Yes.

405
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,660
This is the manager of the team.
He's the one who calls the shots.

406
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,290
I see. It's very nice to meet you.

407
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,190
I'm Ko Byung Soo from JUMBO Pharma.

408
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,760
This is Dr. Ko.

409
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,869
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No.

410
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,470
- Hello. - It's a pleasure to meet you.

411
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,940
Mr. Yoon.

412
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,080
Here's the right of first offer.

413
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,250
Thank you, Attorney Oh.

414
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
Are there no issues?

415
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,680
No, everything looks good on paper.

416
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,450
What about IR?

417
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,960
It looks good.

418
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,500
I know. You did a good job with it.

419
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,339
It's all thanks to you.

420
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,840
Oh, please. This is good
for all parties involved.

421
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,140
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

422
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,480
All right.

423
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,150
Oh, we were just talking about...

424
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,350
what inspired Dr. Ko to develop the drug.

425
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,590
Yes.

426
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,490
The truth is,

427
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,730
I made up my mind to develop this drug...

428
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,070
because my child is autistic.

429
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,210
Your child has autism spectrum disorder?

430
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,810
Yes.

431
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,180
As a father who specializes in
pharmaceutical development,

432
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,950
I figured I should at
least treat my own child.

433
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Right, I understand.

434
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,860
Yes.

435
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,230
I really poured my heart and soul into it.

436
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,000
So, what's the total amount you need?

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,870
In total, it's 12.154 million dollars.

438
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,180
Right, the amount is very specific.

439
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,780
Is it because you have
a detailed plan laid out?

440
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,520
Yes, I'm certain that it'll all work out.

441
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,160
I imagine there can be many
hurdles while developing a new drug.

442
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,160
I didn't know the process allowed
such a detailed and specific plan.

443
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,570
Well, that's...

444
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,400
That's because we're
in the final stages now.

445
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,679
(New Drug Development)

446
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,450
(Developmental Disabilities)

447
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,180
By the way,

448
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,420
I know I mentioned about
my child being autistic,

449
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,160
but you don't need to
feel pressured to do this.

450
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,930
Do you not need the money?

451
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,130
Pardon me?

452
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,130
You've practically devoted
your life to developing this drug,

453
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,900
so you must want this to succeed.

454
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,740
And you need the money to do this.

455
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Well...

456
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,380
That's not what I meant.

457
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,950
There are many other
companies that want to invest in it.

458
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,250
It doesn't have to be Sanin.

459
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,830
Then is there a specific
reason you came to us first?

460
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,760
Pardon?

461
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,500
When you're developing a new drug,

462
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,000
you'd work yourself to the bone to do it.

463
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,069
Then random companies would
develop something similar...

464
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,140
and sell it, right?

465
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,539
Yes.

466
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,440
Right, so to prevent something like that,

467
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,340
you should join hands
with a big company like us.

468
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,150
No one would do such a thing
because they'd be scared of Sanin.

469
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,050
Right. If we join hands with Sanin,

470
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,090
we won't have to worry about
other companies copying our product.

471
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,720
Exactly.

472
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,660
I mean, that won't happen.

473
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,430
But if anyone pulls that
on us, we'll make them pay.

474
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,070
Yes.

475
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,270
All right. Don't you worry.

476
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,670
First, let's sign...

477
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,680
this agreement.

478
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,580
Wait, this is...

479
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,380
Signing this means we can
only negotiate with Sanin, right?

480
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,550
You see, I'm always working in the lab,

481
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,859
so I don't know much about these things.

482
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
That's correct.

483
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,259
This grants us an exclusive right...

484
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,630
to negotiate with you for a month.

485
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,359
In turn, we'll put down a
deposit of 100,000 dollars.

486
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,769
But there was another company
that requested a meeting with me,

487
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,230
and I told them I'd meet them.

488
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,740
I don't think I can back
out of the meeting now.

489
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,310
Then we shouldn't sign this today.

490
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,020
My goodness.

491
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,060
You sure know how to
negotiate since you're a CEO.

492
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,860
All right. Then give us a week.

493
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,700
However, we can only give
you 50,000 dollars as a deposit.

494
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,539
- Not 100,000 dollars? - That's right.

495
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,640
We'll have to decide in a
week, which is quite risky.

496
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,510
No, Director Ha.

497
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,120
If it's one week, I don't think
we can put down a deposit.

498
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,520
- Really? - Yes.

499
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,620
We asked for a month,
and even that's not enough.

500
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,260
If it's just one week,

501
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,260
we can't conduct due diligence.

502
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,690
I'm afraid we can't pay a deposit...

503
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,730
without completing the
due diligence process.

504
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,800
We can finish it quickly.

505
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,470
Put a rush on it and finish
reviewing the documents at least.

506
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,700
- But still... - Come on.

507
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,010
Dr. Ko here doesn't
seem like a liar, does he?

508
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,350
Well, then...

509
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,080
Sanin will get a week of exclusivity.

510
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,220
As for the deposit, it'll be
50,000 dollars. Sounds good?

511
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,290
Okay.

512
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,990
Let's do that.

513
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,630
So?

514
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,460
Did you agree to it?

515
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,710
But it's not considered
stock price manipulation.

516
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,510
Did you manipulate the stock price too?

517
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,520
We'll talk about the rest another time.

518
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
They'll interview the two of you as well.

519
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,830
Just tell them what you know.

520
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,040
I'm off.

521
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,800
What did I tell you?

522
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,370
I told you I couldn't trust him.

523
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
I apologize, sir.

524
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,610
Hey, why are you talking like that?

525
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,280
Is someone else listening right now?

526
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,560
So?

527
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,190
What's the plan now?

528
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I think a disciplinary
hearing will be held.

529
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,270
He'll get a chance to
explain everything there.

530
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,970
Oh, boy.

531
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,540
Be honest with me.

532
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,410
You.

533
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,780
Do you trust him?

534
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,720
Tell me.

535
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,290
Yes, come in.

536
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,090
Director Ha Tae Soo and
Director Cho Beom Soo are here.

537
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,390
Come on in.

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Sit.

539
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,350
Attorney Oh.

540
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,390
Take my advice for Mr. Yoon's sake.

541
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,790
Don't try to refute it. Just admit it.

542
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,460
I suggest you resolve
this politically and resign.

543
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,500
You know what will happen
at the disciplinary hearing.

544
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,140
Yes.

545
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,040
I know I'd be going there
to be punished, but...

546
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,510
Exactly.

547
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,380
People think it'll be like a trial,
but you know that's not the case.

548
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,580
I suggest you try to persuade him.

549
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,750
Okay, I'll try talking to him.

550
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,960
You see, the evidence we have
is... I can't get into the details,

551
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,630
but it's solid.

552
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,170
How solid?

553
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,470
A hundred percent.

554
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,940
So, you're sure it was
Yoon Joo No? Is that it?

555
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Yes, sir.

556
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,280
Then hand him over to the police.

557
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,350
Sir, the thing is,

558
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,850
considering the situation
Sanin is in right now,

559
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,620
nothing good will come out...

560
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,360
of people outside the
company finding out about this.

561
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,560
Sir, may I say something?

562
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,070
Yes.

563
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,270
A disciplinary hearing must be held.

564
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,469
If we don't do it despite
receiving the anonymous letter,

565
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,210
it could cause a bigger
problem down the road.

566
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,040
So what, then?

567
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,480
First, we'll kick him out.

568
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,010
Then Sanin...

569
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,780
will sue him. That'll be the
most hassle-free solution.

570
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,319
We'll seek compensation for the damages...

571
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,560
when Yoon Joo No is no
longer a Sanin employee.

572
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,920
All right. Do that, then.

573
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,590
Well...

574
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,700
Sir, then who should be the
head of the disciplinary committee?

575
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,070
Why are you asking me that?

576
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,400
Is it my job to decide that?

577
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,540
No, we'll take care of it.

578
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,060
Darn it. This is all
because of Yoon Joo No.

579
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,860
You can lead the disciplinary committee.

580
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,399
The legal manager, the
audit manager, and I...

581
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,730
will join the hearing.

582
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,300
I'll be there too.

583
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,310
How could you say that,
knowing the situation?

584
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Director Lee.

585
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,080
Director Ha and I will take care of it.

586
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,580
With the audit manager and the legal
manager, we'll have enough people.

587
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,750
How many people do you need
on the disciplinary committee?

588
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,460
Under five.

589
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,430
Then I'll join too.

590
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,030
Everyone in the company knows
that you and Mr. Yoon are close.

591
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,570
It could cause a misunderstanding.
Will you be okay with that?

592
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,769
I believe everyone in the company...

593
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,610
also knows what kind of
relationship you and Mr. Yoon have.

594
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,450
So, let me sit on the committee too.

595
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,280
Regardless of the
result, we'll make sure...

596
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,520
there are no misunderstandings.

597
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,260
Fine, let's do that.

598
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Goodness.

599
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Hello?

600
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,070
Okay, I'll meet you there.

601
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,010
All right.

602
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,279
I'm stepping out for a coffee.

603
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,849
- Do you mind tidying up the office?
- Sure.

604
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,880
Thanks.

605
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,550
Over here.

606
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,560
I need to return shortly. Give me a second.

607
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,760
Okay.

608
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,760
To take away, please.

609
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,930
I'll tell you what I know.

610
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,610
Mr. Yoon can't get away with it.

611
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,540
The anonymous letter is solid.

612
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,150
But it might just end with him resigning.

613
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,349
With the company's tough situation,

614
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,850
he doesn't want to create any gossip.

615
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,690
You mean the chairman?

616
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,390
- I see. - After he resigns...

617
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,600
No, it's nothing.

618
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,170
That's all I know.

619
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,299
Thanks for sparing me some time.

620
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,740
- Thanks for the coffee. - No problem.

621
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,570
Thank you.

622
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,029
What's this? Come on.

623
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,160
Look at how gloomy you are again.

624
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,230
What?

625
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,930
Do you feel bad for your team manager?

626
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,600
No, I don't.

627
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,670
Hyeong Seop.

628
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,610
Remember what you told me?

629
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,910
That Mr. Yoon was a complicated man.

630
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,550
Did I?

631
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,150
Yes.

632
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,450
You also said he'd be
doing all sorts in secret.

633
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,350
Oh, right.

634
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,850
See? I was right, wasn't I?

635
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,690
You don't know that yet.

636
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,560
But why the long face?

637
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,730
You think I'm right, don't you?

638
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,029
Hey. Do you think the
disciplinary committee holds...

639
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,900
a meeting whenever they want?

640
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,039
It's never held without
decisive evidence. Got it?

641
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,010
Do you think the directors are that free?

642
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,080
(Daejin Delivery)

643
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,260
In short,

644
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,130
you have all the members, right?

645
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,660
Yes.

646
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,330
But Dr. Ko won't meet me.

647
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,270
It's saying he doesn't trust me.

648
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,800
You served time for stock
price manipulation, and yet,

649
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,110
he can't trust you?

650
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,670
I didn't go to jail.

651
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,140
I was held in custody but
was released on probation.

652
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,750
What must you do to earn his trust?

653
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,920
All those guys trust in is money.

654
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,490
If I were to use money, I
would've done so ages ago.

655
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,290
Let's think of another way.

656
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,790
I don't have time.

657
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,570
As if that's easy.

658
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,060
Mr. Yoon.

659
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,230
Jin Soo?

660
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,260
What brought you here?

661
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,400
Mr. Yoon.

662
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,230
Can't you tell me the rest?

663
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,900
About what?

664
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,940
JUMBO Pharma.

665
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,240
You had no part in the stock
price manipulation, right?

666
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,480
Neither Attorney Oh nor
Ms. Kwak wouldn't talk.

667
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,220
Jin Soo.

668
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,160
At what point is someone
considered involved?

669
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,730
Mr. Yoon?

670
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,610
Are you okay?

671
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,320
What?

672
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,550
You look serious.

673
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,750
Oh, it's nothing.

674
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,430
You know autism.

675
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,470
What?

676
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,500
Did you know you shouldn't call it autism?

677
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,170
It should be called
autism spectrum disorder.

678
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,340
I see.

679
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,509
That would indeed be free from prejudice.

680
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,880
The symptoms would vary.

681
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,450
- You knew? - Yes.

682
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,220
You really know about everything.

683
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,249
But can't you still use it as a diagnosis?

684
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,290
I doubt it.

685
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,930
It was in a recent drama. They
used autism spectrum disorder.

686
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,230
Is that so?

687
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,770
What's this about?

688
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,170
What?

689
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,640
Are you taking over a
pharmaceutical company?

690
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,770
No.

691
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,550
You're the one who asked first.

692
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,820
- But... - Is it even a secret from me?

693
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,280
It hurts, you know?

694
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,190
It's not like that.

695
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,160
I know how you feel. I get it.

696
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,460
You don't need to explain.

697
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,830
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

698
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,170
I'm sorry to call on a weekend morning.

699
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,770
Are you sorry because of
the weekend or the morning?

700
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,410
Both.

701
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,150
I see. What is it?

702
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,880
Please look over JUMBO Pharma once again.

703
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,850
Understood.

704
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,090
An accident-prone area lies ahead.

705
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,390
Are you going somewhere?

706
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm guessing you're in a car.

707
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,970
Joo No?

708
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,740
Joo No.

709
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,790
(I'm heading out because of
an important matter. Sorry.)

710
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,920
- You're on your way to JUMBO? - Yes.

711
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,430
Is it for an inspection?

712
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,500
I could've tagged along.

713
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,400
From what I know, the US
made the first ADHD medicine.

714
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,670
Wouldn't there be a patent on it?

715
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,000
You're right.

716
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,140
And Americans are fussy about patents.

717
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,840
I bet JUMBO dodged the patent.

718
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,950
Shall I look into how they did it?

719
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,020
Yes. Please contact me
the minute you find out.

720
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,520
(Sales, Sales Cost)

721
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,450
Yes?

722
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,250
Mr. Yoon. I looked over
what you asked me to.

723
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,779
The company's sales
increased significantly...

724
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,919
after releasing the ADHD medicine.

725
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,960
But there was actually a loss in profit.

726
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,660
The profit dropped
when the sales did better?

727
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,329
Please check where the expenses increased.

728
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,270
It could be the R and D.

729
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,769
I did think so too.

730
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,670
But there was no such public notice.

731
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,940
I'm searching if there were other factors.

732
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,880
But it'll take some time.

733
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,090
Please call me once you find out.

734
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,590
And see if...

735
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,920
it has to do with the US
pharmaceutical company.

736
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,830
Okay.

737
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,900
"Methylphenidate and the correlations..."

738
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,740
It was two years ago.

739
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,880
That's truly odd.

740
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,990
Mr. Yoon.

741
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,430
There is indeed a problem.

742
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,329
The ADHD medicine...

743
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,669
was developed by a US
pharmaceutical company named Revion.

744
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,170
The patent period was 20 years.

745
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,969
Two years ago was when it ended.

746
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,340
The company could've applied
for an extension but didn't.

747
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,010
It was for the common good.

748
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,320
So the patent ended two years ago?

749
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:37,850
If it was two years ago...

750
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,289
Correct. It was when JUMBO released...

751
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,290
its new drug.

752
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,030
In other words, JUMBO released
a replica of the ADHD medicine...

753
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,060
when the patent ended, yes?

754
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,200
It seems like it, though
I'm not entirely sure.

755
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,230
Millions of dollars are
needed to develop a new drug.

756
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,070
It had no reason to develop a
drug with a soon-ending patent.

757
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,710
The component is the same as Revion's.

758
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,780
Then there was no patent infringement.

759
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,379
True. But the company promoted as if...

760
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,849
it had developed a new drug,

761
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,109
making it a liar.

762
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,150
Why they lied is a mystery.

763
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,320
Something sure is fishy here.

764
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,690
Maybe.

765
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,019
Since the company has a lab,

766
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,190
it must have the capacity to copy the drug.

767
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,420
I hope so.

768
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,919
Mr. Yoon. Did you go to the lab?

769
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,960
And not the headquarters?

770
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,690
I came to the address on the website.

771
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,430
It doesn't look like a lab.

772
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,300
How come?

773
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,690
Let alone a lab,

774
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,320
it's not even fit as a warehouse.

775
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,130
Did Revion release the drug...

776
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,800
as Contra?

777
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,370
Yes, that's the one.

778
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,240
This company isn't even
skilled enough to copy the drug.

779
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,310
It simply...

780
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
changed Revion's packaging
before selling the drug.

781
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,480
Those jerks.

782
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,849
Attorney Oh. Let me call you back.

783
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,850
Okay.

784
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,190
Goodness.

785
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,579
(ULTRA FOCUS)

786
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,609
(Methylphenidate)

787
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,380
"Methylphenidate."

788
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,460
Yes, Min Jeong?

789
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,689
Mr. Yoon. I did some digging.

790
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,529
As JUMBO's sales increased,

791
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,730
so did the import from Revion.

792
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,829
The drug is methylphenidate.

793
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,470
It's a medicine for ADHD.

794
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,630
Right.

795
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,399
JUMBO must've imported...

796
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,570
and sold the drug after
changing the packaging.

797
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,740
But...

798
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,139
The company sold it for
less than its cost from Revion.

799
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,110
It was a plus for those who
bought the ADHD medicine.

800
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,680
Why did JUMBO do a losing business?

801
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,250
To scam people.

802
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,180
By the way, where are you right now?

803
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,750
JUMBO's factory.

804
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,210
Sorry?

805
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,280
Isn't that dangerous?

806
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,580
It's okay. Nobody is here.

807
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,490
You should leave.

808
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,420
- I will. I'll call you again later.
- All right.

809
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,660
Joo No!

810
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,100
I'm coming.

811
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,200
Joo Seok.

812
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,340
- Hey, An Na. - Come on in.

813
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Where's Joo No?

814
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,450
He had an important business outside.

815
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,280
What important business?

816
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,079
It must be work...

817
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,619
since it's important to Joo No.

818
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,849
That punk. He should
fix the doorbell instead.

819
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,019
It's broken.

820
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,090
I know.

821
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,120
What's that important business or whatnot?

822
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,230
Joo No must be starting a project.

823
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,270
He gets busy this time of the year.

824
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,099
But it'll end soon, which
will give him a break.

825
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,540
I see. What project is he
working on these days?

826
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,170
Something about investing
in a pharmaceutical company.

827
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,940
He's keeping the details
even from me, you know?

828
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,480
It's that personality of his.

829
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,019
Unlike me,

830
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,020
he's heartless.

831
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,350
You're right.

832
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,050
Should I give him a call?

833
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,690
No. I just dropped by on my way.

834
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,460
Have dinner before you leave.

835
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,430
I don't want to trouble you. Please don't.

836
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,400
But you're not.

837
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,760
No, Oh Woon is waiting. I should go.

838
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,130
Have dinner, okay?

839
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,140
But I'm really okay.

840
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,110
(JUMBO Pharma)

841
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:31,720
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

842
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,790
I have a report to make.

843
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,730
- What is it? - It's about JUMBO Pharma.

844
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,430
I'm sorry, sir. I hit
traffic on my way here.

845
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,070
Sit down.

846
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,080
Go ahead.

847
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,909
I placed the due diligence report...

848
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,250
on your desk.

849
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,319
That's why you called me?

850
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,050
Yes. You told me to wrap it up quickly.

851
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,950
I thought you might be curious.

852
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,390
My gosh.

853
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,320
You didn't need to report to me like this.

854
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,190
When have I ever micromanaged you?

855
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,260
I know you'll handle it.

856
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,070
Yes, sir. Have a good day then.

857
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,500
Okay.

858
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,600
Oh, my.

859
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,640
What happened? Who was it?

860
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,140
He's a junior of mine.

861
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,610
It wouldn't look nice if
he knew we were together.

862
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,209
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were on the phone.

863
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,250
No worries.

864
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,080
All right. Here you go.

865
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,490
Well, it's not like...

866
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,360
I'm running an unstable company.

867
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,660
Investing in my company
wouldn't be a bad idea.

868
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Even so, it'd be a bit iffy if
he knew we were together.

869
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,269
I'm not going to tell people that...

870
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,199
we're splitting the leftover funds.

871
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,540
Hey, come on.

872
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,639
You need eight million
dollars to make the drug.

873
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,680
And the leftover fund amounts
to more than half of that.

874
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,180
Exactly. I won't tell anyone
about what we're doing.

875
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,390
It sounds like...

876
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,689
you're blackmailing me.

877
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,160
Gosh, no. I'm not blackmailing you.

878
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,860
No way.

879
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,329
I'm just so grateful to you, sir.

880
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:20,270
I actually wanted us to meet,
so I could make you an offer.

881
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,730
What offer?

882
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,400
When I get...

883
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,410
the full investment,
the 12 million dollars,

884
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,610
you'll be taking a
mere two million dollars.

885
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,680
So I was wondering if you'd like
some of my company's shares.

886
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,390
What do you mean?

887
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,289
To be honest with you,
just like I told you before,

888
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,290
I don't know exactly how
much I'll need for the research.

889
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,030
As the CEO, I have no choice
but to save some of the funds.

890
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,500
So I often sell and buy
shares of my company.

891
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,100
When I did that,

892
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,710
I realized that I could
influence the stock price.

893
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,680
Are you telling me you'll
manipulate the stock price?

894
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,990
Gosh, manipulate is such a strong word.

895
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,520
But yes, in essence.

896
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,960
I can boost it tenfold for you.

897
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,430
Are you not interested?

898
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,730
Is something going on at work?

899
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,760

00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,160
What?

901
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,630
Oh, it's nothing.

902
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,040
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

903
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,510
Eat a lot, my youngest.

904

905
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,450
There you go.

906
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,190
Someone I know...

907
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,490
told me that you were a complicated man.

908
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,360
Is that so?

909
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,900
Then what is your opinion of me?

910
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,670
Actually,

911
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,440
he said you were evil.

912
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,080
He said you just wrote
everyone off as evil...

913
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,980
when you considered yourself
to be complicated, yet kind.

914
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,920
So what you were doing was more evil.

915
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,760
He does have a point.

916
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,690
But...

917
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,100
in my opinion,

918
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,300
you see yourself to be
complicated and evil.

919
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,770
And...

920
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,070
I'm not sure if it's a good thing...

921
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,040
or a bad thing.

922
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,869

disciplinary committee meeting.

(Junior Managing Director's Office)

924
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,109
Today's agenda includes
two disciplinary reviews...

925
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,210
of Team Manager Yoon Joo
No from the M and A Team.

926
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,350
The first review is regarding
the leak of internal information.

927
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,810
The second review...

928
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,120
is regarding insider trading.

929
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,050
Sir, here's the file for the
disciplinary committee meeting.

930
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,920
- Okay. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

931
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,370
Mr. Yoon.

932
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,239
If it ends with your dismissal,

933
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,140
it wouldn't be a bad idea to accept it.

934
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,580
I also agree.

935
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,980
The company wouldn't want a scandal.

936
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:35,990
I see.

937
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,509
We shall deliberate on the
request of disciplinary action...

938
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,010
regarding Team Manager
Yoon Joo No of M and A Team.

939
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,580
If you have any questions
for him, feel free to ask him.

940
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,390
Mr. Yoon, you oversaw the
JUMBO Pharma investment...

941
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,190
three years ago in the
M and A Team, correct?

942
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,860
Yes.

943
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,870
Back then, he evaluated
the company as solid.

944
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,500
My gosh.

945
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,970
Am I remembering it correctly?

946
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,010
Yes. I do remember it.

947
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:40,350
You must have been aware that
their stock price would skyrocket...

948
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,620
once people found out that we
were going to invest in JUMBO.

949
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,090
Yes.

950
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,030
So...

951
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,700
have you told anyone
about the investment deal?

952
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,910
Have you shown this report to anyone?

953
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,249
Is this the company? The
company he's going to invest in?

954
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,250
What?

955
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:17,190
Oh, no. Joo No really hates
it when you look at his files.

956
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,559
- Okay. I won't look.
- I'm sorry about that.

957
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,429
Joo No is really sensitive about it.

958
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,500
You don't have to apologize.
I know what he's like. It's fine.

959
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,450
Hey, Oh Woon. I'm on my way home.

1061
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,109

01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:05,630

No, I can't.

1069
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,670

Yes.

1073
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,510

1074
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,350
my dismissal.

1075
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,760

01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,000
Sure. Fine. Let's keep going.

1079
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,900
You must be saying that as
you don't know what we received.

1080
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,940
Let's move on to the second review.

1081
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,910
It's about his punishment
for insider trading.

1082
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,750
Right here.

1083
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,920
This letter of notice was
sent to Yoon Joo No...

1084
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,819
to inform him to exercise his rights...

1085
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,520
as a JUMBO shareholder of 50,000 shares.

1086
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,430
This was issued in 2022.

1087
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,739
It proves that you held JUMBO
stock back in 2022. Correct?

1088
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,870
(Sanin)

1089
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,040
You had 50,000 shares.

1090
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,740
This must have been worth
at least one million dollars...

1091
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,010
at some point, right?

1092
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,250
It's one million dollars.

1093
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,060
All right.

1094
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,360
Mr. Yoon.

1095
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,700
You're also admitting that you own
JUMBO Pharma's shares, correct?

1096
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,570
Yes, I am.

1097
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,850
I was trying to do you a favour.

1098
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,620
But you turned it down.

1099
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,990
(Sanin)

1100
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,930
(The Art of Negotiation)

1101
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,030
{\an8}Is it going according to your plan?

1102
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,560
{\an8}Could it be a suicide mission?

1103
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,900
{\an8}The devil is in the details.

1104
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,770
{\an8}I came back here because I
wanted to find out the truth.

1105
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,000
{\an8}By causing our stock price to crash?

1106
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,140
{\an8}So he's trying to drag us down with him.

1107
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,270
{\an8}We must make our move first.

1108
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,440
{\an8}Word is you're still running your game.

1109
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,080
{\an8}I can bankroll it.

1110
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,650
{\an8}You see, when people get chatty,

1111
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,180
{\an8}they're bound to make a mistake.

1112
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
{\an8}How could you pin
everything on your late brother?

1113
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,720
{\an8}- Have you no sense of decency?
- Director Ha!

1114
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,260
{\an8}You're fired. Understood?
