1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
By how much?

2
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,550
They doubled it.

3
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,590
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,680
Someone offered CEO Cha twice our offer.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,380
As in 20 million dollars?

6
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,019
That's absurd.

7
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,050
Let's call it a day.

8
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,890
This is a tactic.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,900
We only met with CHACHA Games last week,

10
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,030
but someone offered twice the amount?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,170
To a nobody like CHACHA Games?

12
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,710
Word must've leaked about
our interest in CHACHA Games.

13
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,810
Which punk was it?

14
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,530
Mr. Yoon.

15
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,080
Are things going well...

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,980
with CHACHA Games?

17
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,910
Yes, things are going as planned.

18
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,320
As it should.

19
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,750
As it should.

20
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,230
(Episode 4: Your Language)

21
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,659
{\an8}Get the clearance items.

22
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,769
{\an8}Strawberries...

23
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,830
{\an8}- at a discounted price. - Hey.

24
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,770
{\an8}- Look here, lady. - Goodness.

25
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,569
{\an8}Why don't you try a strawberry?

26
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,940
{\an8}- It's tasty. - Forget it.

27
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,940
{\an8}You can't sell these here.

28
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,980
{\an8}Do you have any idea what
kind of people live here?

29
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,479
{\an8}- Fresh strawberries.
- You're causing so much noise.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,049
I'm getting complaints, so move this truck.

31
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,589
Don't be like that and try a strawberry.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,619
- Darn. - Try one.

33
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Sir.

34
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,360
This isn't part of the apartment complex.

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
Of course it is. See this brick road.

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,260
It's part of the apartment complex.

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,529
Move the truck before I report this.

38
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,230
Sir, this is publicly owned land.

39
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,129
The sidewalk was only laid
down in order for the construction...

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,100
of the complex to be granted.

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,110
You must be here because of the complaints.

42
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,209
If only you knew how
fussy these residents are.

43
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,050
The noise has them throwing a fit.

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,510
It must be tough on you.

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,250
There must be all sorts of
people living here as well.

46
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
However,

47
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,689
aren't there residents...

48
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,159
who complain that you are being harsh?

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,390
Of course there are.

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,400
Who am I supposed to please?

51
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,960
We'll turn that off for now.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Do it fast.

53
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,029
The residents can't
hear it that well anyway,

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,140
and no one comes by because of it.

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,470
Right. Sure thing. Let's do that.

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,840
We have to move in two hours anyway.

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,180
We'll start packing it up during that time.

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,649
I assume that'll be the best for us both.

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,549
- You have two hours.
- Of course. Absolutely.

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,290
- Here you go. - What...

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,249
- Enjoy these too. - What?

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,460
Thank you.

63
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,260
- Thank you. - Thank you.

64
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,630
Hey, what a relief.

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,230
Let's sell all these and go.

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,560
As if we could sell anything here.

67
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,699
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,729
I chose to come here because
this was a fancy neighborhood.

69
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,840
Exactly.

70
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,099
- The residents here... - Over here.

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
Won't buy fruit from trucks.

72
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,210
They'll buy better ones at the supermarket.

73
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,080
You don't know what you're talking about.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,309
These may be small in size
being the last batch to harvest,

75
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,509
but they're delicious.

76
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,710
(Clearance sale! Strawberries
straight from the farm)

77
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Is it a clearance sale?

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,690
What about it?

79
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,490
Those with money don't
only eat fancy things.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,359
It's actually them who
look for what's cheaper.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,760
That's how they got to be rich.

82
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,470
Rather than helping
out like I asked you to,

83
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,030
you've been nagging me nonstop.

84
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,040
Come and buy strawberries.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Get your strawberries
at a discounted price.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,239
It's a clearance sale.
Get your strawberries.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,009
Mom, I'm off. I have work to do.

88
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,010
Hey.

89
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,350
That heartless brat.

90
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,319
- Are you happy... - I haven't had...

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,879
- a lot of strawberries recently.
- To leave me working alone?

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,550
- I'm exhausted as is. - How much, ma'am?

93
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,519
Goodness me.

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,090
It's five dollars per basket.

95
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
We'll take one.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,189
- Thank you. - Thank you.

97
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,159
- Enjoy. - Is it five dollars per basket?

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,699
Yes, per basket.

99
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,859
- That... - I'll take two.

100
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,730
Two? Got it.

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,570
You should buy one more.

102
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,200
This is CHACHA Games.

103
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,770
You didn't give us any pickled radish.

104
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,770
Sure.

105
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,310
They'll get it to us right away.

106
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,010
I should've ordered jjamppong.

107
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,849
If you did,

108
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,550
you'd be regretting that too.

109
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,920
Why didn't you also order kkanpunggi?

110
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,619
Their kkanpunggi is the bomb.

111
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,090
We'll have that once we get paid.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,760
Will they really give
us 20 million dollars?

113
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,090
What if they go back on their word?

114
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,260
They approached me first
offering twice as much as Sanin.

115
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
Still, 20 million seems like a stretch.

116
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,769
A major company is entering
the e-commerce market.

117
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,240
As an entrance fee, 20 million is nothing.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,870
Ask for more, then.

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Should I?

120
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,040
- Should I negotiate? - Yes.

121
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
How about 30 million?

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
That must be the pickled radish.

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,380
Darn.

124
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,089
- Pickled radish... - Hello.

125
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,100
Hello.

126
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,400
- May I come in? - Well...

127
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,630
Ho Jin's not here.

128
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,070
Hi.

129
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,280
I was hoping to know
more about the offer...

130
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,450
you received.

131
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,880
Why would you ask that?

132
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,519
Don't be clingy and be cool about this.

133
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Hey.

134
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,320
That's rich considering you
stood us up at the meeting.

135
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,289
Who'd buy CHACHA Games
when it's a sinking ship?

136
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
Jin Soo, come on.

137
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,829
A sinking ship? No way.

138
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,660
The deal is twice of
whatever Sanin's offering.

139
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,270
Twice of whatever Sanin's offering.

140
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,270
That's the term?

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Yes.

142
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,600
"You're closing a deal with Sanin, right?"

143
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,810
"Our offer is twice theirs."

144
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
That was it.

145
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,810
There's more to a deal...

146
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,810
than just money.

147
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,780
Do you think we're naive pushovers?

148
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,020
What other than money can be important?

149
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,720
When ordering lunch,

150
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,220
you probably debated between
jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

151
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,320
Was price a determining factor?

152
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,360
What you wanted to eat...

153
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,760
was more the issue.

154
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,029
Aren't they the same price?

155
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,030
No.

156
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,640
Jjamppong is a dollar more.

157
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,969
For the price of jjamppong,

158
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,170
you can have a jumbo-sized jjajangmyeon.

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,210
But it's only a dollar.

160
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
To be honest,

161
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,280
we don't want to pivot.

162
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,480
Our next game can be a hit for sure.

163
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,779
But since we don't have money,

164
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,080
we'll get it by pivoting or diving
into e-commerce or whatnot...

165
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,420
and develop games again.

166
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,290
That's why we're going
with whoever pays more.

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,560
So if you're not going to
offer more than 20 million,

168
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,960
leave already.

169
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,630
Hold on. Is this...

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,230
leftover food?

171
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,870
You should try to empty your plates.

172
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,239
Any leftover food must be
eaten once you're in the afterlife.

173
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,710
This is terrible. What are
you going to do about this?

174
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
Have it, then.

175
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,979
- What a relief. - Right.

176
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,280
Thanks for this.

177
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
It's good.

178
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Have your fill.

179
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,640
It's a photo of CEO Cha.

180
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
What is?

181
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,840
May I see this?

182
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,710
Sure.

183
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,990
This must be him in his younger years.

184
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,860
Yes, that's his seat.

185
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,430
The woman looks familiar.

186
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,160
- Is she his girlfriend? - What?

187
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,900
Gosh, no. We don't know who she is.

188
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,330
Aren't you done?

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hold on.

190
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,080
It's good. The place serves decent food.

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,910
- Thanks for this. - Whatever.

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Shall we get going?

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,549
We probably ruined your lunch,

194
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,820
so let us put in another order.

195
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,930
It wasn't easy shoving that down my throat.

196
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,760
I thought my stomach was going to explode.

197
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,430
You seemed to be enjoying it.

198
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,140
What should we order for CHACHA Games?

199
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,570
What they were having?

200
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
Isn't there a combo of the two dishes?

201
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,440
The jjam-jjamyeon.

202
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,780
Yes, let's order that.

203
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,010
Order kkanpunggi too.

204
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,680
Four jjam-jjamyeon and
one large kkanpunggi.

205
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,020
Three bowls will do.

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,490
CEO Cha wasn't there.

207
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,230
What?

208
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,660
Someone went to CHACHA Games...

209
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,770
and offered twice of
whatever we were paying.

210
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,429
Whoever it is knew...

211
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,340
we were in talks with CHACHA Games.

212
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,909
Twice of whatever we were offering.

213
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,610
Whoever it was doesn't
care about CHACHA's values.

214
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,580
They just knew we made CHACHA an offer.

215
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,080
We're the target, so who could it be?

216
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,820
Could it be DC Games?

217
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,290
The CEO is a thug, remember?

218
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,659
He even said in an interview...

219
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,790
that he'd like to get along
with Cha Ho Jin again.

220
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,790
It could be a fund.

221
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,300
To have us buy it back?

222
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,030
What if we don't buy it?

223
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,499
It's possible...

224
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,640
if they know we desperately
need to buy CHACHA Games.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,750
Hey, did you perhaps
meet with CHACHA Games?

226
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,280
We're currently exposed to a sniper...

227
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,750
and have taken a hit.

228
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,690
However, we don't know
where the bullet came from.

229
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,960
Is he dead?

230
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,560
Your kill wasn't tallied.

231
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,930
We instinctively want to
know where the shot was fired,

232
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,770
but our opponent...

233
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,670
is out there waiting for us
to stick our head back out.

234
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,270
What do we do, then?

235
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,180
We go against our instincts.

236
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,410
Against it?

237
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,180
We'll act as though nothing happened.

238
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,720
Like we weren't hit by a bullet.

239
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,850
Until when?

240
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,730
Until we figure out who's pointing...

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,060
the gun at us.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,100
How did you know?

243
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,969
(Jenny)

244
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,070
Meet with me. We need to talk.

245
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,840
- Jin Soo. - Yes?

246
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,310
Did you...

247
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,680
beat the final level of Delivery King?

248
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,650
Yes.

249
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,320
There's a video that plays
once you beat the final level.

250
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,520
The ending credit?

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,360
That's right. Didn't the
image look a lot like...

252
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,630
the photo on CEO Cha's desk?

253
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm not sure.

254
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,270
A lot of game developers get
personal with ending credits.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,270
Either way, you don't find it unusual.

256
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Not really.

257
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,650
I'm busy. It's my first
day working at CHACHA.

258
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,890
Goodness me.

259
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,060
How many will we be
getting this time around?

260
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,670
I'm guessing about
50 each if all goes well.

261
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,170
That many?

262
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,300
Only when done properly,

263
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,970
and this is what I'm good at.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,110
Of course.

265
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,010
Is there any support I can offer?

266
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
I doubt I'll need it considering
the size of the company.

267
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,489
No, wait. Director Teo,

268
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,320
would you like to role
play as police with me?

269
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,660
As in good cop, bad cop?

270
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Exactly.

271
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,300
Our relationship's
only going to get tighter.

272
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,830
It won't be too bad to see
how well we work together.

273
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,800
Sure. I'd like that. It's been a while.

274
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,780
Excuse me.

275
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Yes?

276
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,050
We ordered your desk online.

277
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,690
- It'll arrive tomorrow. - Right. Thanks.

278
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,319
We ordered a pretty one.

279
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,190
One that's way better than mine.

280
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,530
Sure. You already told me.

281
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,859
You might not like the design, so...

282
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,100
You already said that too.

283
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Sure.

284
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,940
What's the Wi-Fi access code?

285
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,310
I'm afraid we don't
use Wi-Fi around here...

286
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,990
because a wireless
network is prone to hacking.

287
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,920
May I explain why that is?

288
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,320
It's fine.

289
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm good.

290
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,790
It's fine.

291
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,600
- Should I get you a cable instead? - Yes.

292
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,490
Would you like me to
format your laptop for you?

293
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,860
To signal a new beginning.

294
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,190
- Sure. - Then,

295
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,530
I need to take a look at your computer.

296
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,900
Thanks.

297
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,290
Who's she?

298
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,020
The girl Ho Jin likes.

299
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,930
- I see. - Hey.

300
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,030
Can I explain the Easter
egg in Delivery King?

301
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,840
- Sure. - An Easter egg...

302
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,640
is a message within the
game hidden by the developer.

303
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,470
It's mostly for fun,

304
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,240
but sometimes, there's a meaning behind it.

305
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,780
I know what an Easter egg is.

306
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,480
Which is the one in your game?

307
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,720
Well...

308
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,090
No one's been able to find it yet,

309
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,990
but let me give you
the short version of it.

310
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,590
So...

311
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,760
Allow me to explain.

312
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,200
At night, that person waits
there with that in hand.

313
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,900
- Who's that person? - Ho Jin.

314
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,870
- Why is CEO Cha there? - Guess.

315
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,410
How would I know that?

316
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,680
Here's your clue. First love.

317
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,879
It's unrequited.

318
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,380
How's that a clue? You gave her the answer.

319
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,050
Let me see. When Cha Ho Jin gets here...

320
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,220
Here. Give him this seat.

321
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,990
Have him face the windows.

322
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,199
That way, we can have
the light behind us...

323
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,100
which will make us look more charismatic.

324
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,130
Lower his chair a bit...

325
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,940
so that he can look up at me.

326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,070
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,610
Fix it while seated.

328
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,820
Look at me.

329
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,350
Okay.

330
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,260
No wonder you're a hotshot negotiator.

331
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,160
You don't miss a single beat.

332
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,360
Positioning is key in battles.

333
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,199
Have him sit uncomfortably
while looking up at my face...

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,100
that's hidden in the shadow.

335
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,830
That would intimidate anyone.

336
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,340
With that, you'll already be halfway there.

337
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,569
Bring him iced coffee during the meeting...

338
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,910
- with lots of ice. - Yes, sir.

339
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,339
Why's that?

340
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,009
Finishing his coffee fast...

341
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,310
will pressure him to
give us a quick answer.

342
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,850
That will lead to him signing the deal.

343
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,950
- Bring me the contract. - Yes, sir.

344
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,089
By having the entire contract printed out,

345
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,890
he won't think about revising anything.

346
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,970
Humans are fairly straight
in terms of input and output.

347
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,900
- They're simple creatures. - I'll say.

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,639
CEO Cha is here.

349
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Right.

350
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,780
- Should I go meet him?
- No, have him come up to us.

351
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,280
Your appointment has been confirmed.

352
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,750
You can ride that
elevator up to the office.

353
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Which floor is Samoel Fund on?

354
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,620
- That'd be the 17th. - The 17th.

355
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,890
Thank you.

356
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,459
Once he realizes this isn't a
place for just anyone to come,

357
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,360
he'll be intimidated from the start.

358
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,559
He'll then think...

359
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,000
it's in his best interest
to sign this contract.

360
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,500
I'll put my faith in you
and leave you to it.

361
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,840
Director Teo, this all banks on you today.

362
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,910
I have to be the good cop, right?

363
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,350
No, you have the look of a bad cop.

364
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,720
Goodness, CEO Cha.

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,630
It's good to meet you. Welcome.

366
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,590
- Have a seat. - Hello.

367
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,230
Hello.

368
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,570
That's nothing serious.

369
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,579
It says you'll only be dealing with us.

370
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Everyone signs that
before negotiations begin.

371
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,910
There will be a finalized
contract for you to sign later.

372
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
I see.

373
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,880
- May I read it? - Sure.

374
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,700
(Exclusive Negotiation Agreement)

375
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,230
(Exclusive Negotiation Agreement)

376
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,900
All right.

377
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,940
Won't I get to negotiate with
anyone else once I sign this?

378
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,210
Why do you ask?

379
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,010
Are you in talks with another company?

380
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,480
Not really, but...

381
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,590
Then why are you on the fence
when we're willing to pay money?

382
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,930
- May I borrow this? - Of course.

383
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,600
- Allow me. - Right.

384
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,970
- Thank you. - Sure.

385
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Thank you.

386
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,540
Can I ask why you want to buy our game?

387
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,750
CEO Cha, why did you develop that game?

388
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,950
Wasn't it to make money?

389
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,419
Money's good.

390
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,760
Who hates money, right?

391
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,960
But I truly believe...

392
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,259
that dreamers like CEO Cha
should be acknowledged more.

393
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,330
I mean that.

394
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,830
When will I get the money?

395
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,040
That's not what's important.

396
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,510
To be honest, I don't know
if this deal is the way to go.

397
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,540
What?

398
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,349
You didn't find any success...

399
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,010
nor does the company have any assets.

400
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,920
Why are we even acquiring this company?

401
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,850
You approached us
with the 20-million offer.

402
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,760
Exactly, and I was
against that from the start.

403
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,730
It's true the game flopped.

404
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,330
I'm sure your conscience agrees with me.

405
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,870
We still have Southeast Asia and China.

406
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,939
It's hard to get an
approval to launch in China,

407
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
and the Southeast Asian market
only brings in chump change.

408
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,850
I can get going, then.

409
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,450
CEO Cha, wait.

410
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Come on.

411
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,820
It's not like that.

412
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,119
- Excuse me. - Yes?

413
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,920
You have a call from the US on hold.

414
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,699
- Sir. - Wait, hold on.

415
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,959
Stay for a cup of coffee.

416
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,199
You came all the way here.

417
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
No, I should get going.

418
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,639
Come on! You're making me feel so bad.

419
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,769
Sit. Take a seat.

420
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,840
Just have some coffee, okay?

421
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,970
Hurry up.

422
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,370
Please sit here, Mr. Cha. My goodness.

423
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,650
Please have some coffee.

424
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,500
Isn't the coffee good?

425
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,530
It's Gesha, a top-tier coffee variety.

426
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,269
You can only buy it through
the fair trade program,

427
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,870
so I love it.

428
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,410
CHACHA reminds me of this coffee variety.

429
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,610
I see.

430
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,050
But I'll be honest.

431
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,490
I came here for the 20 million dollars.

432
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,760
Well, we can't give you 20 million dollars.

433
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,260
We told you we could double Sanin's offer.

434
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,800
Right, so it's 20 million dollars.

435
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Listen, Mr. Cha.

436
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,400
You need to understand this.

437
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,439
Who did you meet from Sanin?

438
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,470
Manager Yoon Joo No.

439
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,770
I knew it.

440
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,410
He said you'd get ten
million dollars, right?

441
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,449
He lied.

442
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,980
He'd never give you ten million dollars.

443
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,680
Everyone in the industry knows...

444
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,380
that he's a swindler.

445
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,020
You said he mentioned ten
million right off the bat, right?

446
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,820
That means you'll get one
million dollars at the most.

447
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,260
You see,

448
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,730
we know this process very well,

449
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,970
so we just said we'd double Sanin's offer.

450
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,900
So, will it be two million?

451
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,109
Oh, please. You're
hurting my feelings here.

452
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,870
We're not a bunch of thugs here.

453
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,910
Make up your mind until
Director Song gets here,

454
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,679
I'll do my best to make
sure you can get 2.1 million.

455
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,750
What?

456
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,290
Did you say 2.1 million?

457
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,760
Look.

458
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,889
I came here because I
was offered 20 million.

459
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,759
Come on.

460
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,729
I took all this time to
explain how it works.

461
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,630
What am I supposed to
do if you don't understand it?

462
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,329
No one would just give you...

463
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,440
the first amount you heard.

464
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,870
Ask around. It's all decided
through negotiations.

465
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,750
Forget it, then.

466
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,450
Why? Will you go to Yoon Joo No now?

467
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,490
Everyone will soon find out that
the deal between us fell through.

468
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,490
Then everyone in the industry will say...

469
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,860
you're not willing to negotiate.

470
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,260
Then Yoon Joo No won't buy it either.

471
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,630
Even if he were to buy it,

472
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
he'd never give you one million.

473
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,970
At the most, you'd get
200,000 to 300,000 dollars.

474
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,779
Mr. Cha, if you can't decide,

475
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,610
you don't have to do this with us.

476
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,980
But really, trust me.

477
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,090
I guarantee you that this
is the best offer you'll get.

478
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,820
If not, you can take it up with me.

479
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Let's be honest.

480
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,590
If we just go ahead and sign the
agreement when it's just us two,

481
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,160
Director Song can't do anything about it.

482
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,370
Well...

483
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,010
Should I sign it now?

484
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,580
Yes.

485
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,999
Goodness. If you're not
going to do it, I'll just...

486
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
No, it's not that. One moment.

487
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,610
Just a moment.

488
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,429
(Delivery King)

489
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,570
No wonder Mr. Cha is so
attached to Delivery King.

490
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,000
Delivery King is like
a letter to his first love.

491
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,640
That's why Ho Jin is not even
interested in any other women.

492
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,110
You're right.

493
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,380
Now, I get it.

494
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,950
At first, I wondered why he
worked so hard to make this.

495
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,190
Honestly, the game itself is kind of lame.

496
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,190
I told you it was lame.

497
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,160
We really have to hit the
jackpot with the next one.

498
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,560
Yes.

499
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,430
Ho Jin will sign the deal today,

500
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,660
so let's hit the jackpot
this time, for real.

501
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,270
So, Mr. Cha went to sign the deal?

502
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Yes.

503
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,610
With Sanin?

504
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,580
No.

505
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,040
It was a fund company with
a foreign-sounding name.

506
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,250
Samoel?

507
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,520
Oh, yes. That one.

508
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,790
Call him and just tell
him to hurry back here.

509
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Why?

510
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,560
Well, we need the money to
get started on our next project.

511
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,290
I've heard bad things about that company.

512
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,300
Then just tell him to get the
agreement and come back.

513
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,170
I'm off.

514
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,540
No, you can't leave yet.

515
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,540
Jenny, we should all go out for
dinner together to welcome you.

516
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,610
I've got plans.

517
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,779
Hurry up and call Mr. Cha.
Tell him to just come back.

518
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,880
Okay?

519
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,680
Yes, got it. But...

520
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
if you...

521
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,550
don't want to go out with
us because of these guys,

522
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,750
we can have dinner
together without these two.

523
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,890
Oh, I should tell you.

524
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,060
I like women.

525
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
What was that just now?

526
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,510
Hey, let's meet.

527
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm really disappointed in you.

528
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,310
Let's meet up and talk.

529
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,610
General.

530
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,019
May I behead my friend today?

531
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,089
Why did he have to call me here?

532
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,420
I said we should meet halfway.

533
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,900
What is this? What's with that gaze?

534
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,140
What? Me?

535
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,170
What's wrong with my gaze?

536
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,610
Forget it. Buy me a coffee.

537
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,880
Okay.

538
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,580
Did you doubt me?

539
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,190
No, I believed you.

540
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,020
As if.

541
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,720
But does CHACHA have that much potential?

542
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,430
Enough to justify you quitting your job?

543
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Yes.

544
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,400
Their development skills are solid.

545
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,700
They could really thrive
with a bit of business support.

546
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,700
- Is that right? - Yes.

547
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,010
Oh, they do need better
planning strategies too.

548
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,839
But aren't those guys weird?

549
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,250
They looked like total geeks.

550
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,750
Yes, they're weird.

551
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,880
But in a way, I'd say
they're innocent-minded.

552
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,990
"Innocent" isn't the word I'd use.

553
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,330
I bet you don't know Delivery
King has an Easter egg.

554
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,300
Mr. Cha Ho Jin had a
friend he grew up with.

555
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,840
- And? - He always had a crush on her.

556
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,110
So, the friend was a girl? Is she pretty?

557
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,480
Hey, come on.

558
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,180
Do you like every girl who's pretty?

559
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,510
If she's pretty, I'd like her more.

560
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Anyway,

561
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,720
he never told her how he felt.

562
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,850
He kept on hovering around her.

563
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You know what it's like, right?

564
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,090
I sure do.

565
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,790
What does that have to do with the game?

566
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,270
Keep listening.

567
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,000
- Sit here. - Okay.

568
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
So...

569
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,179
when Cha Ho Jin and Do Han
Chul first developed the game,

570
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,950
they needed someone to sing the soundtrack.

571
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,050
But they were broke, so they
decided to reach out to a friend of theirs.

572
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,920
So, they called that girl.

573
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,889
But she was no longer a little girl.

574
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,930
She was in her early 20s back then.

575
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
His first love?

576
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
What was her name?

577
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,400
Soo Yeon. Oh Soo Yeon.

578
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,670
She was a good singer too.

579
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,270
You call that good?

580
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
I thought she was quite good.

581
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,710
Seriously? Are you deaf?

582
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Take a listen.

583
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,610
Can you hear me?

584
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,980
What? Yes.

585
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,590
- Han Chul. - Yes?

586
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,750
- We're ready. - Okay.

587
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,360
Start singing when I give you a cue, okay?

588
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,299
What will be my cue?

589
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,700
Look at my eyes, and you'll know.

590
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,140
- Ho Jin, are you ready? - Yes.

591
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,900
Okay, go.

592
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,450
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

593
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It's fine. I like to walk.

594
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,559
I'll give you a ride. It's
dangerous to walk alone.

595
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,730
I like to walk along Bulgwangcheon.

596
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,260
I do it often, so I'll be fine.

597
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,770
I see. You must live in Mangwon-dong, then.

598
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,369
I'll go with you. I want to walk too.

599
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,640
I like to walk alone
while listening to music.

600
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,540
You're sure that's why, right?

601
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,839
It's not because you don't
want me to tag along, is it?

602
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Pardon?

603
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,440
- If you like to walk... - Yes.

604
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,420
Okay, then. I'll respect your wishes.

605
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,590
Hey, Ho Jin.

606
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm off.

607
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,930
All right. Good job today.

608
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,470
- Ho Jin, spare me a moment. - What?

609
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,040
Come out for a minute.

610
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,770
Hey, what's up?

611
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,600
About what we recorded
today. Can I get it too?

612
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,640
Oh, that. It'll be
released as a digital song.

613
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,780
No, I want to take a
listen before it's released.

614
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,610
You can send it to me, right?

615
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,210
Yes.

616
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,890
You seem different...

617
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,990
when you're working.

618
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,300
In the old days,

619
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,570
you always played video
games. I thought it was foolish.

620
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,540
Right.

621
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,910
Why do you like games so much?

622
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,640
Because it's fine even if you fail.

623
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,550
If you fail while playing a
game, you can start again.

624
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,890
I wasn't expecting that kind of answer.

625
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,130
The street light in front
of my house is out too.

626
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,360
How come no one would fix them?

627
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Light bulbs only last
up to about 1,000 hours.

628
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,839
If they're turned on for ten hours a day,

629
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,640
it means they'll die out in 100 days.

630
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,510
So, civil servants have to change
the light bulbs every three months,

631
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,880
which means you'll have to wait...

632
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,310
ninety days at the most.

633
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,280
Light bulbs only last up to 100 days?

634
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,320
It's like dating.

635
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,030
- Dating? - Yes.

636
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,400
They say your feelings are
bound to fizzle out after 100 days.

637
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
- Are you like that too? - What?

638
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,040
No.

639
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,140
I'm not like that.

640
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,310
You're not like that?

641
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,720
You prefer to walk alone now, right?

642
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
What?

643
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,119
You like to walk along Bulgwangcheon alone.

644
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,290
I know that much.

645
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,730
But the street light in front
of my house is out now.

646
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,000
I find it a little scary.

647
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
All right.

648
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,910
What?

649
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,540
I'll be off, then. Get home safely.

650
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,110
What?

651
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Hey.

652
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,180
Hey!

653
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,050
Don't people call you dense?

654
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,920
No, I'm incredibly quick-witted.

655
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,530
Goodbye,

656
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,690
you fool.

657
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,410
The bus will arrive shortly.

658
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,560
Why didn't he take her home?

659
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,369
Why didn't he walk her home?

660
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,770
You said he liked Soo Yeon.

661
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,570
She never asked him to walk her home.

662
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,170
What are you talking about?

663
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,780
She did.

664
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,350
When? Did she say that?

665
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,220
Hey, Soo Yeon said the street
light in front of her house was out...

666
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,020
and that she was scared.

667
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,750
Right, she said that.

668
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,660
But she never asked him to walk her home.

669
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,090
- That's right. - What is with you people?

670
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,960
Also,

671
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,300
Soo Yeon rejected Ho Jin
when he confessed his feelings.

672
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,640
What exactly did he tell her? And when?

673
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,109
Asking her to sing the soundtrack
was a love confession in itself.

674
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,740
Soo Yeon isn't even a good singer.

675
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,140
And Soo Yeon said she wanted to
walk along Bulgwangcheon alone,

676
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,110
so Ho Jin took his cue and left her alone.

677
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,510
That was like his second confession.

678
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,650
You guys are driving me crazy.

679
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,890
Seriously, aren't they crazy?

680
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,360
Am I the weird one?

681
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,490
No, it's them. They're weird.

682
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,700
Right?

683
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,030
When I was there, I
felt like the weird one.

684
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,000
How could they say that?

685
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,640
Have you heard of any developer jokes?

686
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,150
A developer was asked
to buy three apples...

687
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,750
and one watermelon if there
are watermelons at the store.

688
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,150
What would the developer do?

689
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,990
Most people would buy either
3 apples and 1 watermelon...

690
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,789
or just three apples if
there were no watermelons.

691
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,790
No.

692
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,260
It's wrong to make that
kind of decision on your own.

693
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,259
First, you'd buy three apples.

694
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,770
Then if there are no watermelons,
you must call your wife.

695
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,370
Hello?

696
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,539
I'm at the store now. I just bought apples,

697
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,680
but there are no watermelons
here, so I'll check a different store.

698
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,140
All right.

699
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,880
You need your wife's confirmation.

700
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,520
There were watermelons at the store.

701
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,220
Then what do you think the developer did?

702
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,290
The answer can't be 3
apples and 1 watermelon.

703
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,390
That's why you're
quizzing us like this, right?

704
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,999
Did he only buy three apples...

705
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,700
- and forget about the watermelon? - No.

706
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Soon Young!

707
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,730
He bought 1 apple and 3
watermelons because he got it mixed up.

708
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,240
- Wrong. - Darn it!

709
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,800
And you, Mr. Yoon?

710
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,870
One apple?

711
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,980
- Why one apple? - How did you know?

712
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,979
I just guessed.

713
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,710
Yes, one apple is the correct answer.

714
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,250
"Buy three apples."

715
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,360
"If there are watermelons, buy one."

716
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,530
There are watermelons at the store.

717
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,800
Then...

718
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,500
buy one.

719
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,530
That's why he bought one apple.

720
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,040
For real?

721
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,539
That's how developers think?

722
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,170
No wonder they come across as so quirky.

723
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,440
This is called a developer joke.

724
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,810
But honestly, I don't think it's a joke.

725
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,150
That day, Soo Yeon said
she liked to walk alone,

726
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,090
- so he didn't take her home?
- That's right.

727
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,720
Then what about the street light?

728
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,859
Soo Yeon gets scared
when the street lights...

729
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,430
in front of her house are out,

730
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,730
so Ho Jin lights her street.

731
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,970
- Until this day. - Until this day?

732
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,870
Please look at the screen.

733
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,949
After that day,

734
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,320
Cha Ho Jin started
hanging a lantern at night.

735
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,190
Come again? What did he do?

736
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,160
Every night, he hung a
lantern from the light pole...

737
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,860
and collected it at dawn.

738
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,230
- For real? - Yes.

739
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,200
He did it for 100 days.

740
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,130
A hundred days? Is it how long
light bulbs are supposed to last?

741
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:03,969
Yes, and also...

742
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,070
she started going out with Do
Han Chul after about 100 days.

743
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,010
With who?

744
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,580
Oh Soo Yeon?

745
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,309
Yes.

746
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,380
How did that happen?

747
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,580
That, I'm not sure.

748
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,399
I'm going to take a short break outside.

749
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,410
Okay.

750
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,320
It's Han Chul.

751
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,960
The song is out.

752
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,290
It's in a USB.

753
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
I'm alone.

754
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,730
I see.

755
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,969
Ho Jin wanted me to check...

756
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,040
if it played or not.

757
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
All right.

758
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,319
- You came all the way here... - Yes.

759
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,349
To give me this?

760
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,220
Yes. But I need to see if it works or not.

761
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,990
Shall we go inside to check?

762
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,700
Let's do that to be sure.

763
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,599
Cha Ho Jin must've left DC...

764
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,630
for this reason.

765
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,470
And that's Oh Soo Yeon's real house, yes?

766
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,169
Yes. The Easter egg was a confession...

767
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,240
to Soo Yeon.

768
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,700
It's this place, right?

769
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Yes.

770
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,310
The house looks awfully alike.

771
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,610
- She must've moved, right? - She did.

772
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:40,690
Who are you?

773
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,590
(Yoon Joo No)

774
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,960
Are you really from Sanin?

775
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,329
Yes. We're from the M and A Team.

776
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,760
There's something we're investigating.

777
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,230
I thought you were from the real estate.

778
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,539
Some hardcore gamers would drop by.

779
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,270
I put the house up for rent to move out.

780
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,140
"Hardcore gamers?"

781
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,770
Another word for avid gamers.

782
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,340
I know.

783
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,710
Easter egg or whatnot.

784
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,950
Either way, the hardcore
gamers always come by.

785
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,420
They claim it to be a pilgrimage.

786
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,960
It'll be fine from now on.

787
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,260
That game shut down.

788
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,390
Was High Square shut down?

789
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,100
Darn it. That's bad.

790
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,100
"High Square?"

791
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,470
Isn't it Delivery King?

792
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,940
"Delivery King?" What's that?

793
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,039
(High Square)

794
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,480
This building is named High Square.

795
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,280
They say it's because
the house is on a hill.

796
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,049
But there's a game named the same...

797
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,050
made by DC.

798
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,989
I heard the background of
that game was this place.

799
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,990
How did you know that?

800
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
The Easter egg.

801
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,230
Isn't that what brought you here?

802
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,000
You're talking about High
Square's Easter egg, right?

803
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,830
Yes.

804
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,970
Is there Easter egg other than that?

805
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,800
The game Delivery King also
used this place as the background.

806
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,810
What? There's another game?

807
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,480
Who on earth made that game?

808
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,180
So this place was also
High Square's background.

809
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,390
That tree must be a cherry tree.

810
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,790
Yes. It's really pretty in the spring.

811
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,400
High Square.

812
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,400
It's DC's killer content.

813
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,230
The story is simple.

814
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,370
One knight lives in a town
named Buddha's Light.

815
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,639
You'll find out the reason for the name...

816
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,440
toward the end.

817
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,379
Anyway, the princess of that town...

818
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,080
gets kidnapped by monsters.

819
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,880
She is held captive
at the top of the castle.

820
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:52,320
To save the princess,
the knight enters the castle,

821
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,049
kills all the monsters,

822
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,790
and gets her out of there.

823
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,360
Well, the story is quite cliche.

824
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,960
But the game itself is really fun.

825
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,600
Simple is the best.
It's the ultimate truth.

826
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,029
Did you know that an
Easter egg is hidden...

827
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,030
in High Square?

828
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,100
Look at the character
standing before the unlit lamp.

829
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,870
Before this character enters the castle,

830
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,840
you can see that's the only unlit lamp.

831
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,410
Get closer to it,

832
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,550
and you're told to write something.

833
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,490
Once you write "light on,"

834
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,750
ta-da.

835
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,320
You're given a kerosene lamp.

836
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:33,560
The name of this kerosene
lamp is Buddha's Light.

837
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,060
You now understand why the
town is called Buddha's Light, right?

838
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,830
And what are you to do with the lamp?

839
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,370
If you light it up, the
background music changes.

840
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,270
Do you hear the humming?

841
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,670
It's this very music.

842
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,840
Other than that, it's useless.

843
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,510
But it's cool, isn't it?

844
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,049
Easter eggs are hidden traces...

845
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,610
that developers leave behind, right?

846
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,579
Developers do it for fun...

847
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,019
or to add meaning,

848
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,890
but it's often used to hide their traces.

849
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,759
If Cha Ho Jin's Easter egg...

850
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,890
is hidden in High Square,

851
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,130
doesn't that mean Cha Ho Jin
is the developer of High Square?

852
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,899
That's true.

853
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,029
But DC's Do Han Chul also
has memorable moments...

854
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,730
of that rooftop house.

855
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,700
He went out with Oh Soo
Yeon living in that place.

856
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,039
Do Han Chul wouldn't have known...

857
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,710
Cha Ho Jin was holding a
lantern outside the window.

858
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,310
Even if he did know,

859
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,710
the one holding the lantern outside...

860
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,050
was Cha Ho Jin.

861
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,580
Right.

862
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,289
Both the Delivery King holding
a lantern outside the window...

863
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,790
and the knight lighting up
the lamp in High Square...

864
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,030
are Cha Ho Jin.

865
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,999
Do Han Chul copied that...

866
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,060
without knowing it.

867
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,870
It's like even copying the
typos when plagiarizing a thesis.

868
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,239
Cha Ho Jin's program...

869
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,870
had no traces of hacking, right?

870
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:56,040
You're right.

871
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,980
All traces are left in the
blockchain or whatnot.

872
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,980
But there weren't any.

873
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,850
You scared me.

874
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,590
There was no hacking, but
the Easter egg was there.

875
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,789
That means the program
wasn't copied or hacked into.

876
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,620
The hard drive was stolen as a whole.

877
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,859
That was why...

878
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,260
Cha Ho Jin sued for theft
rather than plagiarism.

879
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:24,169
Buddha's Light, the town
in High Square, must be...

880
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,040
talking about this place, Bulgwang.

881
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,940
It means Buddha's light.

882
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,480
Do they mean the same thing?

883
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,510
Yes. Bul for Buddha and gwang for light.

884
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,980
Oh Soo Yeon liked walking
along the Bulgwangcheon.

885
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,250
I get why Cha Ho Jin hates pivoting.

886
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,560
High Square, created out of
yearning for his first love, got stolen,

887
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,690
and Delivery King flopped.

888
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,529
The photo of a woman on CEO Cha's desk...

889
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,400
and the princess in High
Square must be the same person.

890
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,150
My brothers. See the
vibe of this must-eat place?

891
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,620
I can tell this place is at
least over 30 years old.

892
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,120
This place is legit. For real.

893
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,790
See this? Toothpicks made of starch.

894
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,420
These small props...

895
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,829
are what decides a must-eat place's vibe.

896
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,630
You get it, right? All right.

897
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,429
I'll be trying spicy kalguksu.

898
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,100
- Goodness. - Oh, no. I'm digging in.

899
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,669
I'm okay.

900
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,670
- Listen. - Yes?

901
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,140
You can't shoot in here.

902
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,610
Give me a minute.

903
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,410
- Are you the owner? - Yes.

904
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,110
This is no biggie.

905
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,009
I heard your kalguksu was great.

906
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,280
I'm here to promote it.

907
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,650
I'm shooting it in selfie mode.

908
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,690
If you look at my live stream,

909
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,589
over 10,000 people...

910
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,790
- are watching it.
- I don't care about the views.

911
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,990
We don't let anyone shoot in here.

912
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,560
- You don't? - No.

913
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,730
Leave. You don't need to pay for it.

914
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,560
All right. I'll leave.

915
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,000
Let's go, Brothers.

916
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,140
I'm leaving.

917
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,870
Good grief.

918
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,440
The place won't let me shoot.

919
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,780
I heard rumors this place was good.

920
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,309
But the owner is very unpleasant.

921
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,479
- Goodness.
- If you ask me for the address...

922
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,179
in the comment section, I'll let you know.

923
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,550
Don't come here, okay?

924
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,090
Listen, ma'am.

925
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,289
Those kids are practically a TV station.

926
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,730
It'll help with your business.

927
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,990
- Even so, I hate it. - Welcome.

928
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,859
But you run a business.

929
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,670
They want to spend money
on you. You should endure it.

930
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,770
Just dig into the kalguksu.

931
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,570
- Gosh. - Goodness gracious.

932
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,809
There's no way the owner would know...

933
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,510
how fast the world is changing.

934
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,710
She told us to dig into
the kalguksu, so let's eat.

935
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,450
I'm sure it'll help with her
business. How weird of her.

936
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,360
By any chance,

937
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,060
are you still against...

938
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,930
e-commerce?

939
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,300
Are other companies making money?

940
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,600
Some have started to,

941
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,369
while others haven't.

942
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,640
Forget it, then.

943
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,170
Mark my words.

944
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,610
Those companies...

945
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,640
will fail one day.

946
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,610
Just wait and see.

947
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,560
Take care.

948
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,570
Bye.

949
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,860
Congratulations.

950
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,230
I heard you got a better offer.

951
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,700
Yes, well...

952
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,470
I did.

953
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,480
Delivery King was fun. Will it shut down?

954
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,880
People like you are known to
see the whole world as money.

955
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,150
Why do you think so?

956
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,960
Honestly,

957
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,790
I signed the contract with Samoel.

958
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,460
Did you get twice the amount from Samoel?

959
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,000
Did you really try Delivery King?

960
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,010
You see my username?

961
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
White Snake.

962
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,950
"White Snake?"

963
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,920
I'm currently playing High Square.

964
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,650
I haven't finished it yet,

965
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,360
but I've found the Easter egg.

966
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
That's why I came to see you today.

967
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,130
If I were in your shoes,

968
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,600
I couldn't have made the same decision.

969
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,870
The game you devoted
your life to creating got stolen.

970
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:31,179
But that very game became
a hit at the hands of the man...

971
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,740
who stole your first love.

972
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,410
And that man keeps getting in your way.

973
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:39,780
You said...

974
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,620
you love games because
you can keep trying, right?

975
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,930
But not everyone can do that.

976
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,260
I...

977
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,000
simply did what I wanted.

978
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,300
I couldn't have done the same.

979
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,710
I'm sorry.

980
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,840
For what?

981
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,850
This and that.

982
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,380
I went off the grid.

983
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,580
It's okay.

984
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,590
And I signed Samoel's contract.

985
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,260
That hurts a bit.

986
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,260
But I'm sure it was a
decision you made for yourself.

987
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Excuse me first.

988
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:30,840
Can...

989
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,610
the contract be nullified?

990
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,080
If you already signed it,

991
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,220
there must be a penalty clause.

992
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,790
I doubt CHACHA can cover that amount.

993
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,790
You're right.

994
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,290
I don't know what kind of
contract you signed with Samoel,

995
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,860
but I hope you continue making games.

996
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,530
I like your games.

997
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,300
They're fun.

998
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,670
I’ll be looking forward to it.

999
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,760
CHACHA Games. There's got to be a way.

1000
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,490
It's one heartbreaking story, right?

1001
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,890
You're right.

1002
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,930
Can't Mr. Yoon have a meeting with CEO Cha?

1003
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,270
Great idea.

1004
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,370
As long as CEO Cha didn't sign
the contract, there must be a way.

1005
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,870
Right?

1006
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,280
CEO Cha signed for 2.1 million dollars.

1007
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,050
How frustrating.

1008
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,590
CHACHA signed the contract...

1009
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,020
with another company.

1010
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,190
I'm sorry.

1011
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,360
With where?

1012
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,000
But why are you apologizing?

1013
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,900
To think even you'd get played.

1014
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,010
I know. It just happened.

1015
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,880
I'll let the chairman know.

1016
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,810
No. I haven't given up yet.

1017
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,550
As you already know,

1018
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,649
if you think it'll fail,
the faster the report,

1019
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,890
the easier it is to settle.

1020
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:30,920
Can it be settled out?

1021
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,520
Right.

1022
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,429
If it can't be settled,

1023
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,060
everything possible should be done.

1024
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,730
Yes. I'll get in touch again.

1025
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,270
Mr. Yoon.

1026
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,080
I have something to tell you.

1027
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,180
All right. Take a seat.

1028
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,219
Actually, when you told me...

1029
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,160
to play Delivery King until the end,

1030
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,290
I suspected you were doing it on purpose...

1031
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,130
since I was against buying it...

1032
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,960
and couldn't...

1033
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,070
I didn't finish it.

1034
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,270
That's a reasonable suspicion.

1035
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,040
Like you wanted me to,

1036
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,139
had I finished the game...

1037
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,740
and seen the ending video,

1038
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,480
we could've persuaded CHACHA.

1039
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,020
I'm sorry.

1040
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,620
CHACHA Games...

1041
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,520
was offered a better deal than ours.

1042
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,630
Getting them to sign our
contract was tough from the start.

1043
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,660
Don't be disappointed too much.

1044
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,640
Mr. Yoon. CHACHA Games...

1045
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,040
was sold to Samoel.

1046
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:58,840
I know.

1047
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,080
How did you know?

1048
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,780
Last night, I met with CEO Cha Ho Jin.

1049
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,290
He told me back then.

1050
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,220
How much was the offer?

1051
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,490
It was 2.1 million dollars.

1052
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,030
I got played.

1053
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,369
I'm sorry.

1054
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,470
No. It's not over yet.

1055
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,839
Samoel will get in touch...

1056
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,410
to sell it to us.

1057
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,110
How did you know CHACHA was sold?

1058
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,780
What?

1059
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,950
Jenny told me.

1060
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:42,120
I was wondering who
was leaking our information.

1061
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,460
No. Jenny isn't that kind of person.

1062
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,590
She's quite kindhearted.

1063
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,510
I'm talking about the M and A.

1064
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,740
We're trying to buy the
company that made this game.

1065
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,410
Why buy that company?

1066
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:10,680
That jerk...

1067
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,720
Mr. Yoon. Assistant
Manager Im is the culprit.

1068
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,560
Who is he?

1069
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,029
That punk sees others as simply bad...

1070
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,530
and himself as complexly good.

1071
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,170
He's a senior from college.

1072
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,870
When he asked what our team was doing,

1073
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,400
I told him we were trying
to buy CHACHA Games.

1074
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,080
Jin Soo.

1075
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,040
Listen carefully.

1076
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,520
Good grief.

1077
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,450
He's getting scolded again.

1078
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,320
It must be tough for him.

1079
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,440
What's wrong? Did you get scolded again?

1080
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,510
No, I wasn't.

1081
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,670
Mr. Yoon is giving up.

1082
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,310
- Give up what? - CHACHA Games.

1083
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,450
He's not buying it.

1084
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,210
I see.

1085
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,850
Did another company buy it?

1086
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,160
Can't you buy it back from them?

1087
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,259
Mr. Yoon is a pro at it.

1088
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,860
It's not his money he's spending.

1089
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,300
Mr. Yoon...

1090
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:34,830
is giving up e-commerce as a whole.

1091
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,240
Seriously?

1092
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,300
Yes.

1093
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,410
He's giving up on everything.

1094
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,240
Let's give CHACHA Games another shot.

1095
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,250
How?

1096
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,880
First,

1097
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,580
we should find out CHACHA Games' interest.

1098
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,250
Come in.

1099
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,220
I didn't know you were having lunch.

1100
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,760
Hi.

1101
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,730
Hi.

1102
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,570
Please excuse me.

1103
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,310
- CEO Cha. - Yes?

1104
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,110
Don't you want to make games again?

1105
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,120
How?

1106
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,319
CEO Cha will accept our offer...

1107
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,590
as long as he can create games.

1108
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,720
Games are meaningful to Cha Ho Jin.

1109
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,929
It's love.

1110
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,430
I agree with that.

1111
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,760
But what about the contract with Samoel?

1112
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,640
If...

1113
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,510
he's giving up on e-commerce as a whole,

1114
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,270
CHACHA Games is useless now, right?

1115
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,980
Of course. Who would buy a flopped game?

1116
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,450
Right. I see.

1117
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,120
I need to go now.

1118
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,820
Hyeong Seop.

1119
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,230
It's that way.

1120
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,130
I was going to take a detour.

1121
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,480
(Sanin)

1122
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
Are you sure?

1123
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,860
Yes, I heard it from the
intern of the M and A Team.

1124
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,600
Yoon Joo No will give up
on going into the e-commerce.

1125
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,429
Could he be faking this?

1126
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,970
No, I don't think he is.

1127
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,530
How do you know that?

1128
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,600
Are you on social media?

1129
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:57,040
I'll send something
over to you. Please wait.

1130
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:59,880
(Do Han Chul)

1131
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,810
Then let's tell Yoon Joo No...

1132
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,650
you'll sell it for ten million dollars.

1133
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,220
That was the price he wanted initially.

1134
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,990
You want me to do it?

1135
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,360
I can't exactly make the offer to him.

1136
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:14,490
I'm sorry.

1137
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,329
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1138
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,170
This is David from Samoel Fund.

1139
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,100
Oh, yes. Hello.

1140
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,710
I'll go straight to the point.

1141
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,439
I heard you were interested in
a gaming company these days.

1142
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,779
As it so happens, we know
a great gaming company.

1143
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,950
So I wanted to make the introduction.

1144
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,950
That sounds great. Which company is it?

1145
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,850
Well, this is off the record.

1146
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,490
Oh, wait. If it is CHACHA
Games, I'm not interested.

1147
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,160
If it's a different company,
do make the introduction.

1148
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,390
You're not interested in CHACHA Games?

1149
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,030
No.

1150
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,760
Our team also reviewed the company.

1151
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,700
But the value of the
company was disappointing.

1152
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,430
There are better and bigger companies.

1153
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,400
I don't see any reason to go with them.

1154
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,070
You mean DC Games?

1155
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,070
No comment.

1156
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,880
I see.

1157
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,310
Have a good day then.

1158
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,300
Let's go.

1159
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,960
Hold on.

1160
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,300
Thank you. Seriously.

1161
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,870
Thank you so much.

1162
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,440
So...

1163
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,369
Sanin Group will give us
ten million dollars, right?

1164
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:36,710
Wait, no.

1165
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,039
Expecting its value to
reach ten million dollars,

1166
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,640
we'll invest 300,000 dollars.

1167
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,780
What?

1168
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,080
Hold on. What is this White Snake saying?

1169
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,689
CHACHA Games already sold
Delivery King to Samoel Fund...

1170
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,350
for 210,000 dollars.

1171
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,260
If Sanin were to buy your
game for ten million dollars,

1172
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,190
the executives of the company
would be bound to suspect me.

1173
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,260
On top of that, the board
won't approve it either.

1174
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,460
What? Look.

1175
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:01,270
You promised me ten million dollars.

1176
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,470
You said we could develop our game.

1177
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,970
Yes. I'll make that happen.

1178
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,810
You said you would only
give us 300,000 dollars.

1179
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,270
Right.

1180
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,250
I'll get the capital for your
game from someone else.

1181
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,580
From who?

1182
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,489
- Okay. The key is inside. - Hello.

1183
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,860
- Sure. I'll take care of it. - Yes.

1184
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,600
- We're not late. - No, we're not.

1185
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,940
Hello, Mr. Do Han Chul.
Congratulations on your wedding.

1186
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,480
If you don't mind, could
we talk for a moment?

1187
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,540
Who am I speaking to?

1188
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,880
Oh, right. I'm representing...

1189
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,180
CHACHA Games in the lawsuit.

1190
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,220
My name is Oh Soon Young.

1191
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:59,390
Since both games have the same Easter egg,

1192
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,030
I can easily prove that they were
developed by the same person.

1193
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:04,730
Wouldn't you agree?

1194
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,430
- Are you recording this? - What?

1195
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
No.

1196
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,940
I'm just curious about
your opinion as a developer.

1197
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,140
Well, I could agree.

1198
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,480
But that doesn't matter.

1199
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,910
The judge has to see it that way.

1200
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,210
Right.

1201
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:24,850
But you see,

1202
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,719
the judges are so busy with their work.

1203
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,890
I doubt they had time to play games.

1204
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,459
Besides, they were busy
studying when they were in school.

1205
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,590
It's obvious that they
barely got to play games.

1206
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,060
I bet they were thrown
off by this Easter egg.

1207
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,070
Thanks to that, you won
the first trial. Didn't you?

1208
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,569
What's your point?

1209
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:46,570
Hear me out.

1210
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,439
What a surprise turn of events.

1211
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,040
You see, I filed for a retrial.

1212
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,879
The name of the assigned
judge is Cho Yong Hoon.

1213
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,950
You should look him up.

1214
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,810
Judge Cho Yong Hoon.

1215
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,980
He's one of the high rankers in StarCraft.

1216
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,289
That explains it. When there was...

1217
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,649
a match-fixing scandal in an esports game,

1218
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,620
he was the one who ruled
that the match was fixed.

1219
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:07,290
So...

1220
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,760
I'm sure he'd be very
interested in our case as well.

1221
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,239
Actually, he and I played
StarCraft a lot together.

1222
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,540
(Images: Cho Yong Hoon)

1223
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,639
Here's what he did at
the beginning of our game.

1224
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,339
Instead of making offense units,

1225
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,440
he built a base in the front yard.

1226
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,150
He went with the strategy
to secure materials.

1227
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,250
My gosh. A top-tier
gamer was indeed different.

1228
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,220
So...

1229
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,390
my friend, Yong Hoon... Wait,
no. I shouldn't call him that.

1230
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,360
Judge Cho just might...

1231
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,730
give us a different ruling for
the retrial. Don't you agree?

1232
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,440
So what are you thinking?

1233
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,040
What do you want?

1234
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,880
It's to settle.

1235
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
What are the terms?

1236
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:01,950
A ten-million-dollar settlement.

1237
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,180
And ten percent of High Square.

1238
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:09,149
I'm fine with the settlement
money. But the shares...

1239
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,590
That's just absurd.

1240
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:13,790
At my first visit to CHACHA Games,

1241
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:16,690
I noticed the security camera at the wall.

1242
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:17,800
I...

1243
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,269
I found it a bit odd. I
still don't understand it.

1244
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,270
Did you do it yourself?

1245
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,139
Do what?

1246
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,639
You knew that Mr. Cha would
be able to find traces of anyone...

1247
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,380
who accessed the program
via blockchain, right?

1248
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,440
So you couldn't have
hacked into his computer.

1249
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:36,050
That's why you climbed
over the wall yourself...

1250
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,450
and stole the hard drive.
That's how the story goes, right?

1251
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,290
Do you have proof?

1252
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,190
Well, it's clear that the same
guy created both games.

1253
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,630
You stole the game without
hacking into his computer.

1254
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,460
Then...

1255
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,230
isn't it reasonable to conclude
that you stole it yourself?

1256
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,100
Given your reputation,

1257
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,800
if someone in DC Games knew about it,

1258
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,570
they would have blown the whistle.

1259
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:03,940
But no one did.

1260
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,450
Do you believe that's proof?

1261
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,279
Yong Hoon loves cases like this.

1262
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,880
Well, that's grand larceny.

1263
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,949
You'll serve a minimum of 1
year, up to a maximum of 10 years.

1264
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,390
Aggravated punishment
will also be imposed on you.

1265
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,090
You'll definitely serve
over a year in prison.

1266
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,590
Smile.

1267
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,160
So your prison sentence
will be over a year.

1268
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,830
Sir.

1269
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,070
I think you should...

1270
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,640
postpone this wedding.

1271
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,820
Ten percent.

1272
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,220
Okay.

1273
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,820
I got it.

1274
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,190
Get lost now.

1275
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,860
- Thank you very much. - Okay.

1276
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,800
Mr. Do.

1277
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,840
I remembered something
when you told me to get lost.

1278
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,940
I'm going to add in a special clause.

1279
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,210
"Around the time CHACHA
Games is to launch a new game,"

1280
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,809
"DC Games will not launch any new game..."

1281
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,750
"or hold any other events.
They will just get lost."

1282
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,220
You released a press release that
you made up with CHACHA Games.

1283
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,990
Congratulations on the wedding.

1284
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,870
Congratulations on the wedding.

1285
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,300
Okay. Bye.

1286
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,310
He's leaving.

1287
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,580
- Take care. Bye. - Bye.

1288
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,190
We just need the chairman's green light.

1289
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,659
I thought he already
gave you the green light.

1290
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,060
Yes. Wait, I mean...

1291
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,770
I need to get his approval now.

1292
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:11,300
My goodness.

1293
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,510
Why don't we get some ice cream?

1294
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,210
What kind of ice cream?

1295
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:20,739
I had it while hiking with the chairman.

1296
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,379
- Gosh, not this one. - Here you go.

1297
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,380
Get something else.

1298
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:26,049
This was on sale up until yesterday.

1299
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,550
But it was good.

1300
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,950
Gosh, it feels like we're
losing money for some reason.

1301
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:33,219
They'll probably go on
sale again at some point.

1302
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,590
Have it then. Okay?

1303
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:45,340
Joo No.

1304
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,640
I might have misunderstood the chairman.

1305
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,110
I thought the chairman was
against the e-commerce industry...

1306
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,849
because it came with a risk...

1307
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,710
and he didn't fully
understand the industry.

1308
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,320
Perhaps, that could have
been the case a long time ago.

1309
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,390
But that might not be the case now.

1310
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:11,700
The chairman might be
regretting his decision then.

1311
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,100
So he regrets not buying
Collection when he should have...

1312
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,670
and thinks that he blew his chance?

1313
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,170
Yes.

1314
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,940
He had a chance to buy
it for ten million dollars.

1315
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:28,450
It's my guess that this lost
chance could be stopping him.

1316
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,650
You're talking about the anchoring effect.

1317
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
Yes.

1318
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:34,519
{\an8}(A phenomenon in which initial
information shapes decisions)

1319
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,990
Did you already spot that?

1320
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:40,290
Is that why you offered ten
million dollars to CHACHA Games?

1321
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,130
I wasn't aware of it.

1322
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:43,630
I just thought...

1323
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,500
it was wise not to go over that amount.

1324
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,570
I thought that spending...

1325
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,300
more than ten million dollars
would be acknowledging...

1326
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,540
the chairman's mistake.

1327
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,340
How's the term for this deal?

1328
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,350
Sir, Team Manager Yoon Joo No is here.

1329
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,789
The term is to buy 30 percent of
the shares for 300,000 dollars...

1330
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,490
with the expectation that it
will reach ten million dollars.

1331
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,990
My gosh.

1332
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,760
- It's worth ten million dollars? - Yes.

1333
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:19,459
I'd like to put in writing that...

1334
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,559
we will have the right of first refusal...

1335
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,170
to buy 19 percent before
any other companies.

1336
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,670
A game, you say...

1337
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:28,340
Will it be a hit?

1338
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,540
Yes.

1339
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,380
How big?

1340
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,679
The value of a new game
in the gaming industry...

1341
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,210
cannot be estimated before its release.

1342
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,280
There could be a hundredfold profit.

1343
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,350
Or it could lead to a loss.

1344
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,659
But one fact is that CHACHA
Games received financial aid...

1345
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,460
of ten million dollars to develop
a new game from DC Games.

1346
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,630
- A financial aid? - Yes.

1347
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,530
They received the fund
with no strings attached.

1348
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,970
My gosh. Why would DC Games do that?

1349
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,370
I don't know.

1350
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,870
What we have to know is that
even if their next game fails,

1351
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,840
CHACHA Games won't face any loss.

1352
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,380
Then why don't we just acquire the company?

1353
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,980
Why buy only 49 percent?

1354
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,680
Do I not have enough money for it?

1355
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,050
CHACHA Games must hold
51 percent of the company,

1356
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,160
so they will have a sense
of ownership and work hard.

1357
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:23,429
In my opinion, that will
help our company in the end.

1358
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,100
Goodness, do you think I don't know that?

1359
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,230
If we demand more than 51 percent,

1360
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,240
I believe this deal will not go through.

1361
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,880
Buy it then.

1362
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,780
Yes, sir.

1363
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,040
How did you manage to sort out
the contract with Samoel Fund?

1364
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:15,649
If Samoel Fund requested
to cancel the contract,

1365
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,550
wouldn't they have to pay you the penalty?

1366
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,620
Usually, but that's not
what it said in the contract.

1367
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,490
I'm not so knowledgeable
about contract terms.

1368
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,860
I received the contract
nullification certificate.

1369
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:32,100
I see.

1370
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,840
Okay.

1371
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,590
Now that our deal has gone through,

1372
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,430
let me treat you to a meal.

1373
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,659
Sure.

1374
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,760
This time, we'll enjoy your generosity.

1375
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Yes!

1376
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,170
I have a question.

1377
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,379
Sure.

1378
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,139
You ordered us jjam-jjamyeon the other day.

1379
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,450
Is there a reason behind that?

1380
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,220
We could have both
jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

1381
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,319
We could make games and run a platform.

1382
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,690
Was that like a metaphor of your message?

1383
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,790
Let's just call it that.

1384
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:40,260
Mr. Cha, I also have a question.

1385
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,530
Sure.

1386
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:43,469
Did you really...

1387
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,540
hang the lantern every
single day for 100 days?

1388
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:52,640
Yes.

1389
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,440
Then I have a follow-up question.

1390
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,350
The light bulbs are good for 100 days.

1391
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,849
Since they switched the
light bulbs every three months,

1392
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:03,220
the light bulbs must have been
out only for ten days at max.

1393
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,190
But how did you end up
doing that for 100 days?

1394
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,200
Hey, the customer is pestering me
about when the package will arrive.

1395
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,270
You left a while ago. How
come you haven't delivered it?

1396
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,369
Hey, the package was already delayed.

1397
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,070
If you don't deliver it on time,
the customer will throw a fit.

1398
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,700
I'm on my way.

1399
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,840
But I took the wrong path.

1400
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:25,480
You fool. You haven't still
learned the streets here?

1401
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,879
Don't curse at me. I'm trying my best.

1402
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,880
What?

1403
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,250
Hey.

1404
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,120
Are you the one who's
been breaking the light bulb?

1405
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:39,490
I'm sorry.

1406
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:46,360
I don't know.

1407
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,170
I guess the civil servants
didn't do their job.

1408
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:53,770
Well, may I ask you a question too?

1409
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,440
This is for the developers.

1410
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,079
I was supposed to go to a
Chinese restaurant with my friend.

1411
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,340
But he's running a bit late.

1412
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,949
So he asked me to
order proactively for him.

1413
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,320
This is his order.

1414
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,149
"Order three bowls of jjajangmyeon."

1415
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,950
"But if tangsuyuk is on
the menu, order one."

1416
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:10,950
All right. How would
you order for your friend?

1417
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,920
Tangsuyuk is on the menu.

1418
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:14,620
Naturally, I'd order only
one bowl of jjajangmyeon.

1419
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,099
So that was true.

1420
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,100
What do you mean?

1421
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,100
How do their brain...

1422
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,770
You have such a smart brain.

1423
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,640
- That's what I was going to say. - Yes.

1424
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,310
No. I would order only one
bowl of jjajangmyeon for myself.

1425
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:34,540
Why would I listen to
someone who's running late?

1426
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,780
Besides,

1427
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,680
jjajangmyeon won't taste
good if the noodles get soggy.

1428
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,350
Right?

1429
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,290
- Yes, that's right. - Yes.

1430
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:45,359
No, you have to order one bowl
of jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

1431
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,690
Here's why. The conditions...

1432
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,659
By the way, has anyone figured out...

1433
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,300
the Easter egg in Delivery King?

1434
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:57,330
No.

1435
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,400
I think it will stay that way.

1436
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,910
- Stop eating. You should leave. - No.

1437
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:03,270

Ms. Han.

1441
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:57,289
This is the last story of
this week's top stories.

1442
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:00,060
Yes. There have been some
changes in the stock price of DC Games.

1443
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,969
It almost hit the ceiling, didn't it?

1444
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,070
- Yes. - What's the reason behind it?

1445
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,799
There was news of a possible
merger or acquisition involving Sanin.

1446
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,369
But it was found groundless, correct?

1447
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,570
Yes, so the stock price did go down.

1448
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,880
But it indicates anticipation of
future prospects with DC Games.

1449
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,780
Regardless of that, Sanin chose
to partner up with CHACHA Games.

1450
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,350
Pardon?

1451
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:20,820
Yes. Sanin invested in
CHACHA Games, not DC Games.

1452
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,219
Yes.

1453
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,850
It's a rare moment where
even Ms. Han makes a mistake.

Yes.

You're in charge of covering Sanin, right?

1472
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:25,250
Why do you ask? Are
you going to take revenge?

1473
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,590
What revenge?

goes under 100 dollars,

1479
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,770
Then Sanin could go bankrupt...

1480
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,370
or someone else could
be the largest shareholder?

1481
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,170
Right. That's possible.

1482
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,510
But Sanin seems to be hanging in there.

1483
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,310

company that was going under.

1488

Isn't this a failed acquisition?

1489
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,390
Even so, it's only ten million dollars.

1490
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,120
That won't be enough
for its stock price to budge.
