1
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,100
Then please do tell me about it tomorrow.

2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,930
A solution to save DADO Resort.

3
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,140
Ms. Song.

4
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,580
Selling DADO Resort is one
of the options we're considering.

5
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,980
And?

6
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,680
I was wondering if you were aware.

7
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,880
Yes.

8
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,820
But that doesn't matter...

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,160
because...

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,730
I won't...

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,730
sell it.

12
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,770
I see.

13
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Everyone,

14
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
good night.

15
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,700
What was that tension?

16
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,470
Her smile was terrifying.

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,079
(Episode 8: Opportunity Cost)

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,689
{\an8}That'll be 360 dollars.

19
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,720
{\an8}Sure.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,700
- Thank you. - The pleasure was mine.

21
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,340
Goodness.

22
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,949
I hope the food is to your liking.

23
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,220
It is.

24
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,680
And you, Director?

25
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,250
Anyway, Director Ha,

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,290
I heard you had something to say.

27
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,400
As if Sanin would have any
other requests for Samoel Fund.

28
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,570
I was just wondering
about an additional loan.

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,140
I see.

30
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,800
And here I thought...

31
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,780
you were going to apologize
for botching our last deal.

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,180
Oh, that!

33
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,510
Didn't I already apologize regarding that?

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,920
- I'm so sorry. Goodness. - Gosh.

35
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,820
That's just business. It's
not like we suffered a loss.

36
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,260
I'm grateful you see it that way.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,460
That's the thing with strategic moves.

38
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,390
A 1 out of 3 success rate
would be considered a win.

39
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,760
A hitter who bats 300 would
be the team's star player.

40
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,130
How much are you asking for?

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
Well, not much.

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,470
About 55 big ones.

43
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,610
I see.

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,309
That's easily doable,

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,480
but on what terms?

46
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,750
The interest rate should
at least be two digits.

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,020
Since I feel bad about
how our last deal went down,

48
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,390
I'll suggest ten percent...

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,389
with Sanin's stocks as collateral.

50
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,420
What do you say?

51
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,630
- But, Director Ha, - Yes?

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,230
Are you aware that Sanin
has already borrowed...

53
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,300
three billion dollars from us?

54
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,870
Of course.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,739
However, an additional 55 million...

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,839
won't make much of a difference.

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,870
It does.

58
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,110
Someone who borrowed
three billion dollars from us...

59
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,980
is asking for an additional 55 million.

60
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,950
If this means Sanin
doesn't even have 55 million,

61
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,690
could it pay back the three billion?

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,790
That's what I'm getting.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,029
Come on.

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,990
What do you take Sanin for?

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,760
It feels shaky from where
we stand, Director Ha.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,270
All right, fine.

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,840
I guess I forgot to explain.

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
So here's what happened.

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,580
I don't know why chairmen...

70
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,880
all want to own a resort of their own.

71
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,350
- A resort? - Yes.

72
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,420
Our chairman came across one he liked.

73
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,619
He must've wanted it badly...

74
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,490
because he took out a loan...

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,160
with his stocks as collateral to
buy it before anyone else could.

76
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,760
- His Sanin stocks? - That's right.

77
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,160
My gosh.

78
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,299
The loan matures in less than a month,

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
but he only just told me.

80
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,740
Who handled the deal? Mr. Yoon?

81
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,010
As if Joo No is on that kind of level.

82
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,940
He took it out through his secretaries.

83
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,580
But what would secretaries know?

84
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,349
They had the chairman sign a contract...

85
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,420
- that was designed for pushovers.
- Oh, dear.

86
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,320
He should've come to you instead.

87
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,720
He was embarrassed, that's why.

88
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,559
There are talks about Sanin going under,

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,790
so how could he openly
say he's buying a resort?

90
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,760
Which resort is it?

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm afraid I don't know its name.

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,939
Anyway, that's why he took out a loan.

93
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,640
It has nothing to do with the company.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
Then,

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,740
we'll agree on 15 percent.

96
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,280
Fifteen?

97
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,520
I believe that to be reasonable,

98
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,520
but the chairman is one stubborn man.

99
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,760
I'll have to go back to the
office and see where we stand.

100
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,930
Don't push it if it isn't manageable.

101
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,130
That's not what I'm saying.

102
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,599
You know how much I like Samoel Fund.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Goodness.

104
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,540
We value Sanin too.

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Pay for dinner with this.

106
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
It shouldn't be the other way around.

107
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,310
Come on.

108
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,810
I already paid for the meal.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Okay, fine.

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,220
I'll head back to the office
and get that number confirmed.

111
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,720
You know I'm not in a position...

112
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
to control Sanin how I like it just yet.

113
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,189
Please be understanding of that.

114
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,230
Would it benefit us if you become CEO?

115
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,670
Of course.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,900
I give you my word right here, right now.

117
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,980
The chairman is in his final years now.

118
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,010
His judgment isn't what it once was.

119
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,979
Is that so?

120
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,020
That's right.

121
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,290
Why else would he have bought a resort...

122
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,150
when the company is suffering?

123
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,700
Are we allowed to move forward
without the chairman's approval?

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Of course not.

125
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,069
Since we're here,

126
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,400
we should still inspect the facility.

127
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,370
Right.

128
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,540
Ms. Song is just as curious.

129
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,640
What's your take on it?

130
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,679
There's a clear concept.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,819
The interior design,
amenities, and the view.

132
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,220
It checks all the boxes.

133
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,050
The issue is...

134
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,389
it hasn't been turning a profit...

135
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,060
since Ms. Song took over.

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,459
The main reason for that...

137
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,800
is that the resort was modified
to fit her style and needs.

138
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,169
To be a profitable hotel,

139
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,499
it has to meet certain conditions,

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,170
but DADO failed to do so...

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,840
since it was modified to CEO Song's liking.

142
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,370
That's why it's now called a resort.

143
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,280
It's to fit the resort's
therapeutic concept,

144
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,549
but not having any neighbouring
commercial businesses...

145
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,480
or source of entertainment is a downside.

146
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,489
I'll have to go over the contract to see...

147
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,520
if the commission needs adjusting.

148
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,590
As for the interior design,
the flooring is uneven rocks...

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
with wood being the main material.

150
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,000
They all require frequent maintenance.

151
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,170
Which will result in cost.

152
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,800
- Yes. - To be honest,

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,210
this place isn't run to make a profit.

154
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,510
It stands to entertain
a chairman's daughter.

155
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,210
- Is that so? - Yes.

156
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,409
All conglomerate owners buy a resort...

157
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,820
as they would purchase a designer purse.

158
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,090
They modify it to their liking...

159
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,620
and chalk it up as
something unique and grand.

160
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,460
So the issue lies with
her ability to run it?

161
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,830
Yes.

162
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,129
On top of that, Room 123
which is occupied by CEO Song...

163
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,000
has never been booked by others.

164
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,910
The resort itself is like a
luxurious doll house of hers.

165
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,110
Would anyone be willing to buy this?

166
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,850
It has been on the radar
of one particular place.

167
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,690
Which is?

168
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,490
DOLPHIN Hotel.

169
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,360
It's only five minutes away from here...

170
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,459
and is hoping to obtain DADO Resort...

171
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,330
so that they could run
it as a premium hotel.

172
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,499
How much are they offering?

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,900
Director Kang handled the negotiations,

174
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
and the offer was 50
million dollars at the time.

175
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,109
Since you're negotiating,

176
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,710
you'd be able to at least get 55 million.

177
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,580
Do you think Mr. Yoon
is some kind of con artist?

178
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,409
He should at least get 60 million.

179
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,450
However,

180
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,220
the deal was unilaterally
broken by one party.

181
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,590
By whom?

182
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,760
CEO Song Ji O.

183
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,930
Then, it all boils down to
whether or not we can...

184
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,760
persuade her.

185
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,240
Welcome.

186
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,180
- Director Ha. - Mr. Park.

187
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,880
Have a seat.

188
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,320
What brought you to my neighbourhood?

189
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,749
How else?

190
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,050
I was passing by when I thought of you.

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,620
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- Of course I am.

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,259
Goodness.

193
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,290
Thank you.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,499
- Please enjoy. - Thanks.

195
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,530
Thank you.

196
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,999
Accept this from me first...

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
- but don't drink it. - Sure.

198
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,180
- We should at least say cheers. - Right.

199
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
There.

200
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,560
I have to say I'm a bit upset, Mr. Park.

201
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,320
Sorry? Then...

202
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,990
It's not because you're
not drinking with me.

203
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,830
I'm not some old fogy.

204
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,760
I've always been a lightweight.

205
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,830
Come on. That's not what I meant.

206
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,970
Then why...

207
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,970
I mean,

208
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,810
if there was an issue with the chairman,

209
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,110
you should've come to me for advice.

210
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,850
After all, I'm Sanin's CFO.

211
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,120
The chairman said it was top secret.

212
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,550
Not anymore, it's not.

213
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,490
So tell me the details.

214
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
Sorry?

215
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,160
You probably know the chairman
pit me against Yoon Joo No.

216
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,970
As if he's any match of mine.

217
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,630
Isn't Yoon Joo No lower in rank than you?

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,540
Right.

219
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,070
All that I can tell you is...

220
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,070
Sure. Do tell.

221
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,510
We're in urgent need
of the 55 million dollars.

222
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,710
What about the resort? Won't he sell it?

223
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,420
That will never happen.

224
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,800
That 55 million dollars...

225
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,260
which is due within one month.

226
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,570
Taking out a loan of that size isn't easy.

227
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,299
Not many would agree to it...

228
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,710
even at a high interest rate.

229
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,740
That's what I've been told.

230
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,750
Does the chairman know
how challenging this is?

231
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,280
He gave the secretaries...

232
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,280
an earful over this matter.

233
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,260
Then the chairman must
be more accepting now.

234
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,519
If you solve this matter,

235
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,830
it will be of huge help to the chairman.

236
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,830
Goodness.

237
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,639
- My car's over there.
- I appreciate the meal.

238
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,739
As if you must thank me.

239
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,009
We'll have something better next time.

240
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,939
Sure. Should I call you a cab?

241
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,210
- Gosh, no. I called for a driver.
- I see. Then...

242
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,780
- Sure. - Good night.

243
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,259
Yes, Director Ha.

244
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,790
Hello, there. Mr. David.

245
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,730
You know how you agreed...

246
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,200
to approve that loan of 55 million dollars.

247
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,240
At an interest rate of 15 percent.

248
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,110
Yes, 15 percent.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,410
I'll agree to that term.

250
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,780
I see.

251
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,380
Did the chairman approve?

252
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,820
I'll have him approve of it.

253
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,020
But how about this?

254
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,129
Can you suggest it be 18 percent?

255
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,660
That'll make my job easier.

256
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
I see.

257
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,000
I understand what you
mean and will do just that.

258
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,569
I'd love to give you a
straight and direct answer,

259
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,370
but I don't have that power just yet.

260
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,480
Tell me about it. The
sooner you're CEO, the better.

261
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,310
Goodness.

262
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,550
Anyway, please write up a
proposal like we just talked about.

263
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,320
- Sure. - Right. Thank you.

264
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Mr. CEO, you called for a driver, right?

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
They call anyone a CEO these days.

266
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Didn't you call?

267
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,140
May I...

268
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,510
Go on.

269
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,959
Rather than calling us all the time,

270
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,300
wouldn't it be better to be admitted?

271
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,760
Tell me about it.

272
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Allow me.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,010
Thank you.

274
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,910
- Good morning, Ms. Kwak.
- Right. Good morning.

275
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,310
- Here's your menu. - Right. Thank you.

276
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,480
You got up on time.

277
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,549
Attorney Oh woke me up
insisting we had to have breakfast.

278
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,919
Come on. Of course you
should have breakfast.

279
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,160
It's free since it's already been paid for.

280
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,629
I barely got to eat anything for dinner...

281
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,189
and the lunch course only
served a tiny amount of food.

282
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm starving.

283
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,130
That reminds me. Won't Mr. Yoon join us?

284
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,810
Mr. Yoon, aren't you having breakfast?

285
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,610
I'm not.

286
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,580
I hear the morning scenery
from that oreum is priceless.

287
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,280
Would you...

288
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,050
I hope you're not asking me to join you.

289
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,819
Of course not. Enjoy your breakfast.

290
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Sure.

291
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,590
Hello.

292
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,190
This is Lee Seung Soo, the
manager at DADO Resort.

293
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,290
I had something to report.

294
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,890
Sure. What...

295
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,000
I think we have guests
here who are from Sanin.

296
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
What?

297
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,830
As in who?

298
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,100
I don't know his name,

299
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,270
but he's someone who leaves an impression.

300
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,490
We'd jump at the chance
if DADO Resort is for sale.

301
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,950
But,

302
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,860
is it true?

303
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,660
Is the CEO...

304
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,590
willing to sell?

305
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,700
We're still talking to her.

306
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,260
Come on.

307
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,500
We'll talk once she's on board.

308
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,100
We're considering DOLPHIN...

309
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,240
as the one to acquire DADO.

310
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,379
If you're not interested,

311
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,780
we won't have any need to
persuade the CEO of DADO.

312
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,380
We're here to ask where DOLPHIN stands.

313
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,720
I said we'd jump at the chance.

314
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,280
However,

315
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,719
I'll be embarrassed once again...

316
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,450
if the deal falls through
at the last second...

317
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,820
like last time.

318
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,560
Allow me to apologize for that.

319
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,700
As for the reason the
negotiation fell through last time,

320
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
I owe you an explanation.

321
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,529
It had nothing to do with you.

322
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,440
It was due to DADO CEO's
personal circumstances.

323
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,540
Well, I understand the CEO had a situation.

324
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,979
Then may I go ahead and
assume that you're still interested...

325
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,450
in buying DADO Resort,

326
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,650
sir?

327
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,189
DADO Resort's reputation
of being number one in Jeju...

328
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,420
makes it valuable enough.

329
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,660
What's the point?

330
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,690
It's not profitable.

331
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,460
Isn't it in the red?

332
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,530
That's why it's a good
opportunity for DOLPHIN.

333
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,170
Buying a business that
isn't even profitable?

334
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,910
How's that a good opportunity?

335
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,779
DADO Resort is in the red at the moment,

336
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,910
so we want to sell it cheap.

337
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,280
If you choose not to buy it,

338
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,090
Sanin Group will run the resort.

339
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,450
If that happens,

340
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,189
the resort will start
turning a profit in no time.

341
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,420
The group will do a full-scale
promotion of the resort...

342
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,929
and sign an MOU to
offer all Sanin employees...

343
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,029
a promotional package.

344
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,430
- An MOU? - Yes.

345
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,729
If we run a promotion...

346
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,669
where all Sanin employees get a discount,

347
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,670
the sales numbers will double.

348
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,410
Then...

349
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,940
DADO certainly won't agree to
sell the resort at the current price.

350
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,650
Running resorts is what you're best at.

351
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,619
So as for DADO Resort being in the red,

352
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,990
it shouldn't really be a
problem for you, right?

353
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,420
Well...

354
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,020
I sure can run it well.

355
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Exactly.

356
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,430
That's why I said it'd be a
good opportunity for you.

357
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
So...

358
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,870
how much?

359
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,210
How much are you thinking?

360
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,080
I believe I told you this last time too.

361
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,880
I can't go any higher
than 50 million dollars.

362
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,719
We'd have to persuade
the CEO of DADO Resort,

363
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,589
so I'm afraid we can't patch up...

364
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,819
and reinitiate the
once-failed negotiation...

365
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,660
if the offer is still the same, sir.

366
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,930
Fifty-five million?

367
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,500
Sixty million would be our minimum.

368
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Then...

369
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,050
that thing you mentioned earlier.

370
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,620
The promotional MOU with Sanin Group.

371
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,950
I want my hotel to get that deal too.

372
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,989
All Sanin employees will get a discount...

373
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,990
at our resort,

374
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
and Sanin will reimburse us...

375
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,160
for 50 percent of the discounted amount.

376
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,239
Would you mind if I discussed
this with my team for a moment?

377
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,940
Not at all. Go for it.

378
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,820
Sixty million dollars...

379
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,290
will be enough to cover
the repair costs too.

380
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,130
As for the MOU deal, we'll
have to review the details.

381
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,430
It's a nice hotel too.

382
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,999
I think Sanin employees will be happy...

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,070
to get a discount at this hotel.

384
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,670
But...

385
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,240
do you really think Sanin will run it?

386
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,680
That, we don't know.

387
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,350
You see, this...

388
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,019
Are they just fishing for info
when Sanin will run it anyway?

389
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,090
I think that's what they're doing.

390
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,260
They'll sell it if it's high enough.
Otherwise, they'll call it off.

391
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,390
Now, I'm annoyed.

392
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,130
What?

393
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,430
Well, so?

394
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,570
Have you made your decision?

395
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,170
Yes.

396
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,790
- Sir. - Yes.

397
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,560
Have a seat.

398
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,960
- So? - Samoel will issue the loan.

399
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,360
Oh, my.

400
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,500
They'll send the money tomorrow if
you sign the agreement right away.

401
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,840
- Well done. - Thank you.

402
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,640
What are the terms and conditions?

403
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,970
Yes, it's...

404
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,780
You'll have to pay it back in
3 years, and it's 18 percent.

405
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,750
Eighteen percent?

406
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,820
Does that make sense to you?

407
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,590
I know, it doesn't.

408
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,189
I already told them
that it was unacceptable.

409
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,190
Bring it down.

410
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,760
Yes.

411
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,630
The thing is, sir.

412
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,560
We've already borrowed
three billion dollars, so...

413
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Director Ha.

414
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,570
It's not like we got that money for free.

415
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,470
We make our interest payments on time.

416
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
Ask them to bring it down.

417
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes, sir.

418
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,640
Sir, I'll try to talk to them to
bring it down to 15 percent.

419
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,010
Fifteen percent?

420
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,820
Are you kidding me?

421
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,420
Do you think I'm stupid?

422
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,050
No, sir.

423
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,189
So can you do it or not?

424
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,290
I can, sir.

425
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
Yes, you can do it.

426
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,570
Look at this view.

427
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,080
- Director Ha. - Yes, sir.

428
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,980
- Is this your first time here? - Pardon?

429
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,720
Oh, no.

430
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,950
You gave me a tour once a while back.

431
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,860
You probably don't remember
it as it was a while ago.

432
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,360
I see.

433
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,830
Not many people know about this place.

434
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,630
Right.

435
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,730
Come often.

436
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,270
It's boring to listen to
this music all by myself.

437
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,910
I will, sir.

438
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,580
- Get going. - Yes, sir.

439
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,850
All right, then.

440
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,690
Sir.

441
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,390
They're negotiating to sell
the resort in Jeju right now.

442
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,829
That fool! Has he lost his mind?

443
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,099
Why did you let him go there?

444
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,499
Tell him to come back at once.

445
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,570
Make him write a resignation letter!

446
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,300
- Bring it to me in person. - Yes, sir.

447
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,310
Goodness. That punk is really crazy.

448
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,010
How could he...

449
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,390
Sir. Hey!

450
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,250
You see, Mr. Yoon.

451
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,690
We've done some thinking too.

452
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,890
I really like the people in Sanin Group.

453
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
But the thing is,

454
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,170
you did this last time and ghosted us.

455
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,040
That made me look stupid.

456
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,139
I assure you that won't happen again.

457
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
That said,

458
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,510
get the MOU signed,

459
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,910
and we'll talk again.

460
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,650
Got it. We will talk again.

461
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,790
This isn't easy.

462
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,330
They suffered last time, you know.

463
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,899
Forget 60 million.

464
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
Can't we just tell them we'd
settle at 55 million dollars?

465
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,940
No, then this deal is over.

466
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,010
Why?

467
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,440
We've already lost their trust.

468
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,050
If we suddenly bring the
price down for no reason,

469
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
they really won't trust us anymore.

470
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,020
It'll make us look like...

471
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,249
a group of scammers
trying to get 60 million...

472
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,890
for something that's worth 55 million.

473
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,760
I mean, unless we can come up
with a reason for the price drop.

474
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,690
Right, I see.

475
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,130
At this point, I think the MOU
is more important than the price.

476
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,830
Yes, I agree.

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,810
Chairman Song has collapsed.

479
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,810
I think he found out
about you going to Jeju.

480
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,320
Is he all right now?

481
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,990
Come back right away.

482
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,720
Yes, I will.

483
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,780
What's the matter?

484
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,420
Was it the office?

485
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,690
It looks like we'll have to
write our resignation letters.

486
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,190
What?

487
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,940
(Mom)

488
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,250
How did he find out about us coming here?

489
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,620
Some DADO Resort employees...

490
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,690
must be in contact with
the secretary's office.

491
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,860
(Unread Messages, Mom)

492
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,830
Come home tomorrow. We need to talk.

493
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,700
I can't. I'm away on a work trip now.

494
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,810
Do you really need a car?

495
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,450
Does that mean we have
to go back to Seoul now?

496
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,680
Yes, I think so.

497
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,890
I'll hand in my resignation and
make sure you guys won't have to,

498
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,350
so don't worry too much.

499
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,889
Today's been paid for already anyway.

500
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,190
Can't we just leave tomorrow?

501
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,700
I know, right? This
place is very expensive.

502
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,399
It's the weekend, so the
company can't make us come back.

503
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
I mean, legally.

504
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,170
Yes, you are right.
Legally, they can't do that.

505
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,070
Right, Mr. Yoon?

506
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,480
Yes, let's do that.

507
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,520
- Did you bring it? - Yes.

508
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,500
Sir, may I come in for a moment?

509
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,930
Yes.

510
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,440
Here's your robe.

511
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,640
Okay.

512
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,440
Let me.

513
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,550
Oh, boy.

514
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,320
Tell them I'm going home tomorrow.

515
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,920
I feel fine.

516
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,050
They're still waiting for
the test results, though.

517
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,360
I suggest you wait to hear about
the results before you go home.

518
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,430
Okay.

519
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,970
- And you. - Yes, sir.

520
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,740
- About my fainting spell. - Yes.

521
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,370
Make sure no one hears about it.

522
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,980
- Yes, I already took care of it. - Good.

523
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,590
You brought the contract yourself
when you could've just emailed it.

524
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,150
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about it.

525
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,490
Let's see...

526
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
What is it?

527
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,040
They wrote ten percent
for the interest rate.

528
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,250
Goodness.

529
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,980
It's 15 percent.

530
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,550
Please take a seat for a moment.

531
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,420
Something happened, you see.

532
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,970
Listen.

533
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,069
Chairman Song collapsed.

534
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,369
- Pardon? - It's nothing too serious.

535
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,039
He went to the hospital right away...

536
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,770
and is in stable condition now.

537
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,610
Okay, so?

538
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,950
Well...

539
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,879
Chairman Song collapsed,

540
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,650
so I couldn't bring up
the increased interest rate.

541
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,320
Please understand.

542
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,720
Do you need more time to talk to him, then?

543
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,830
I'll be honest with you.

544
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,969
Before Chairman Song collapsed,

545
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,200
he said 15 percent was just not doable.

546
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,769
Is that why he collapsed?

547
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,340
No, it's not that.

548
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,870
It was Yoon Joo No's
fault that he collapsed.

549
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,980
You see, Yoon Joo No...

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,209
went to Jeju Island...

551
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,010
to sell his resort behind his back.

552
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,880
Chairman Song said he'd never sell it.

553
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,320
What is that punk thinking?

554
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,350
So? Did he sell it?

555
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,760
No!

556
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,090
Chairman Song...

557
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,660
gave that resort to his daughter.

558
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,729
But Yoon Joo No is trying to sell it,

559
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,300
so Chairman Song got
fuming mad and collapsed.

560
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,400
Goodness.

561
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,370
Well, Director Ha.

562
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,480
We'll need to discuss this too.

563
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,050
- Oh, sure. - Give us one moment.

564
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
That can't be a lie, can it?

565
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,640
No.

566
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,470
When he lies, it shows.

567
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,639
They can no longer sell
the resort to pay it back.

568
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,050
They have no choice but to borrow money.

569
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,120
So, technically,

570
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,290
we're all Sanin has now.

571
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,090
That is true,

572
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,860
but if Chairman Song has health
issues, Sanin's stock will plummet.

573
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,430
This has been fixed,

574
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
but you'll probably have
to get a new one soon.

575
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,870
Take a soft drink and leave.

576
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,410
Let's not do this.

577
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,410
Why not?

578
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,750
He said Chairman Song
collapsed. It could be risky.

579
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,460
But that could end up
becoming an opportunity for us.

580
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,230
How?

581
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,030
- Sorry to keep you waiting. - No problem.

582
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
We...

583
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,450
want more shares, then.

584
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Pardon?

585
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,790
Well...

586
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,990
You said Chairman Song
collapsed. It makes us anxious.

587
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,260
Who knows what could happen
to Sanin if he passes away?

588
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,060
Well, how many shares?

589
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,570
Double it?

590
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,640
Come on. That's too much.

591
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,809
Sanin Group is a huge enterprise.

592
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,210
It won't go bankrupt.

593
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,879
We're not asking for real shares.

594
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,310
Just as collateral.

595
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,749
If Sanin is that stable like you said,

596
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,790
then you have no reason to
turn down this offer. Am I wrong?

597
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,790
Besides, we're doing
this to help you out here.

598
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,590
If you don't like it, you can
simply turn down the offer.

599
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,200
No.

600
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,800
I'll accept it.

601
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,830
It'll be ten percent, right?

602
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,400
The ceiling is high.

603
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,560
I know you wouldn't like this,

604
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,570
but can't Sanin take over that resort?

605
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,800
With that money, the
chairman can settle his debt.

606
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,670
That's paying the chairman's
personal debt using Sanin's money.

607
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,280
Even so, the resort will belong to Sainin.

608
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,950
As Chairman Song has
given the resort to his daughter,

609
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,480
it'll cause a greater problem.

610
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,820
It can fall under...

611
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
malpractice or unlawful gifting.

612
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,290
I'm well aware of it.

613
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,030
But that's the only way...

614
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,330
you can survive.

615
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,530
I understand what you're saying.

616
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,600
But I can't help but believe that was...

617
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,640
the chairman's original plan all along.

618
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,310
Hence why...

619
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,280
I suggested selling the resort.

620
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Right.

621
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,220
Then write your resignation letter.

622
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Yes?

623
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,680
Are you ignoring my calls now?

624
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,050
I was working.

625
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,180
What work? It's the weekend.

626
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,550
Are you even lying now?

627
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,020
I'm not lying. I'm on a business trip.

628
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,560
Whatever. Do you really need your car?

629
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,260
No.

630
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,500
I don't. You can take it.

631
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,430
That means you'll give
it to Sang Hoon, right?

632
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes.

633
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,100
I don't need a car anymore.

634
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,840
Because I don't need to go to work now.

635
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,610
I'm quitting my job.

636
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,620
Are you acting up because
I asked to borrow your car?

637
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,220
No.

638
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,020
I got fired. That's all.

639
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,830
So take the car.

640
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,230
Goodness gracious.

641
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,470
Does making me flip out
every day make you happy?

642
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Mom.

643
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,840
What kind of life do you want me to live?

644
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,509
I want you to be well-off.

645
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,180
I would never hope for a poor life.

646
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,780
Don't miss work, okay?

647
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,880
But I got fired...

648
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,880
I had no intention of eavesdropping.

650
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,150
Are you okay?

651
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Yes.

652
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Min Jeong.

653
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,770
Min Jeong. You can have this.

654
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,580
After all, I got your top ruined.

655
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,980
No. I'm okay.

656
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,679
I think it'll look great on you.

657
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,620
How come? I don't think I can wear it.

658
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,120
Wear it in my stead. Please?

659
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,560
No. I'm okay.

660
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,130
Then have a cup of tea with me.

661
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,870
You must hate me a
little, Min Jeong. Am I right?

662
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,910
No, I don't.

663
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,050
Didn't you get fired because of me?

664
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,479
No. The fault lies with our team,

665
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,980
not you, Ms. Song.

666
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,950
Call me Ji O, not Ms. Song.

667
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,190
Didn't you call me Ji O yesterday?

668
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,630
All right.

669
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,330
I bet you won't call me that ever again.

670
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,600
Min Jeong.

671
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,970
You're that kind of person.

672
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,270
You don't say "no,"

673
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,980
but you don't say "yes" either.

674
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,620
Here's what I'm like.

675
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,790
If everyone says "yes,"

676
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,920
I do too.

677
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,660
I don't think anyone would
say "no" to you, Ms. Song.

678
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,990
That's not true.

679
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,130
"No" is the only thing my dad says to me.

680
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,930
That's why I could never
live the life I wanted.

681
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,140
But it looks like you are
living the life you want.

682
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,180
Is that so?

683
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,520
The life I want...

684
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,550
is to live here.

685
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,560
Not just anyone can live a life like yours.

686
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,000
Really?

687
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Yes.

688
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,600
You may not...

689
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,640
really know the life of an ordinary person.

690
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,650
I envy...

691
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,360
how bright...

692
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,120
you are...

693
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,560
all the time.

694
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,030
True.

695
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,530
I like being bright.

696
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,570
It means there's hope.

697
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,270
Do you also need hope, Ms. Song?

698
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,010
You already own a lot.

699
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,110
Do I?

700
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,950
Yes.

701
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,950
You have more than enough.

702
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,750
A random person can't live
in such a place their entire life.

703
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,060
You're right.

704
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,830
You can't live here forever.

705
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,300
Please excuse me first.

706
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,000
What?

707
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,370
Stay a little longer.

708
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,240
I'll let you in on a secret.

709
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,210
See that?

710
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,380
You can't say "no," but
you can't say "yes" either.

711
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,690
Are you actually leaving?

712
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,990
Can't you go after finishing your tea?

713
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,060
Ms. Song.

714
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,170
Some people in the
world don't have any hope.

715
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Sorry?

716
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,300
- Let me help. - No, it's okay.

717
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,980
Are you leaving?

718
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,580
No. You can't go.

719
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,249
How can you leave?
Weren't you going to give me...

720
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,820
DADO's check-up report?

721
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,690
I was waiting for it, you know?

722
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,890
Ms. Song.

723
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,360
We've given up on selling DADO Resort.

724
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,090
Don't let it bother you anymore.

725
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,400
Does that mean you're no longer
interested in DADO's health?

726
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,849
Here's an advanced development strategy...

727
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,820
for the DADO Resort business.

728
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,960
First off, our team's evaluation of
DADO Resort came out excellent.

729
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,130
I see.

730
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:51,900
Most of the resort's evaluation
list received top ratings.

731
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,040
One team member...

732
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,670
said it was the best resort they stayed at.

733
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,410
Was it you, Min Jeong?

734
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,810
- No. - The con is...

735
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,380
the course menu is good,
but the portion is too small.

736
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,120
You can ignore this part.

737
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,390
The room evaluations
were also very positive.

738
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,170
However,

739
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,900
the problem is the resort
not making any profit.

740
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,440
Don't worry about that.

741
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:32,010
All I wish is for the people
in DADO to be happy.

742
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,480
That's all that matters.
The profit means nothing.

743
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,450
But...

744
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,120
If you continue to operate with a loss,

745
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,350
you might have to close DADO.

746
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,620
We can close when that time comes.

747
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Then,

748
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,590
will you be firing the employees?

749
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,090
Sorry?

750
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,099
You said you wanted...

751
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,330
the people in DADO to be happy.

752
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Are employees included in those people?

753
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,940
What?

754
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,570
Then what must I do?

755
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,480
You can leave it to a
management specialist.

756
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,210
I can't do that.

757
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,020
I can't entrust my beloved
DADO to someone else.

758
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:15,879
Sanin Group can...

759
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,890
No.

760
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,290
The chairman can give you some help.

761
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,660
He's right.

762
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,190
My apologies.

763
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,860
Don't worry.

764
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,070
Does...

765
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,840
this conclude DADO's check-up report?

766
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,740
By the way, Ms. Song.

767
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,210
Are you okay?

768
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:47,950
Why do you ask?

769
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,020
Do I look strange to you?

770
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Yes.

771
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,300
Chairman Song. How do you feel?

772
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,000
Goodness.

773
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,140
That's not a question the
doctor should ask the patient.

774
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,509
There's nothing much to worry about.

775
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,450
But it's best to reduce
the amount of stress.

776
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,550
Work from stress was called
an illness from pent-up anger.

777
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,090
I heard there was no medicine for it.

778
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,290
You lost consciousness...

779
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,830
due to a vasovagal syncope.

780
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,899
When you get stressed out or such,

781
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,860
- the blood vessel expands... - Enough.

782
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,130
In short, you're telling me I'm old. Right?

783
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,099
No, Chairman Song.

784
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,900
Your body functioned how it should.

785
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,640
You lost consciousness...

786
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,479
because not enough blood
was flowing to your brain.

787
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,679
Your body reacted...

788
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,810
by lying down to send more blood to it.

789
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,480
It was a natural response to survive.

790
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,290
So I fainted to live.

791
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,150
Yes. That's the body's instinct.

792
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,289
Let us get your blood pressure.

793
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,320
Go ahead.

794
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,650
One's instinct is to live.

795
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,420
But why is my daughter going the other way?

796
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,160
Do I look strange to you?

797
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Yes.

798
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,800
I can't help but wonder if you're unwell.

799
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,630
How come?

800
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,640
Was that the book you were reading...

801
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,339
when we first met?

802
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,439
("4am, The Desired Time to Live")

803
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,679
Apparently, the writer...

804
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,610
wrote that book while fighting cancer.

805
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,140
And so, I also have cancer?

806
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:05,970
No.

807
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,770
Mr. Yoon...

808
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,080
Last night,

809
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,910
it seemed an ambulance came to the resort.

810
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,410
How did you know?

811
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,980
I sleep quite late.

812
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,420
That's how I saw it by coincidence.

813
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,160
You didn't have breakfast the next morning.

814
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,090
Nor did you go up the oreum.

815
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,930
And so I assumed...

816
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,160
that ambulance took you to the hospital.

817
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,330
Your reasoning is unbelievable.

818
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,299
I give credit to your reasoning.

819
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,170
But that's no decisive evidence.

820
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,710
Isn't that patch on your
arm a pain reliever?

821
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,620
You leave me no choice but to admit it.

822
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:00,930
Correct.

823
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,160
I have cancer.

824
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,240
But I...

825
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,180
underwent surgery.

826
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,080
That's a relief.

827
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,380
Although it relapsed.

828
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,090
What should I do with my daughter?

829
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,289
Your daughter must have another operation,

830
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,960
even if it's tough.

831
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,630
If not, she's only neglecting the cancer.

832
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,800
I can't do a thing when she's
stubborn about not getting it.

833
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,700
It's not me getting the surgery.

834
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,270
It's hers.

835
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,410
Is she not moving from Jeju Island?

836
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,150
No.

837
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,380
She wants...

838
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,420
to die there.

839
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,540
When did you get here?

840
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,550
A while ago.

841
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,790
Did you hear it all?

842
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,230
It wasn't intentional.

843
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,390
I see.

844
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,860
That resort.

845
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,970
She told me to sell it after she dies.

846
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,469
Her cancer is back,

847
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,210
but she's refusing surgery.

848
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,750
She wants to die...

849
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,880
in that resort.

850
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
That nasty girl.

851
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,800
I had no idea.

852
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,970
I'm sorry.

853
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,870
Don't apologize.

854
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,310
It has to do with my daughter.

855
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,890
That's why I can't sell DADO.

856
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,690
I made up my mind to die here.

857
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,930
The doctor told me...

858
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,540
I was simply unlucky.

859
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,610
In short, I have bad luck.

860
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,580
But my dad is quite rich, isn't he?

861
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,350
That makes me lucky,
which evens everything out.

862
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,749
With that in mind, I got the surgery.

863
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,450
But the cancer came back.

864
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,690
Overall, I'm an unlucky
girl. Don't you agree?

865
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,130
I thought I shouldn't
leave my death to fate.

866
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,430
I travelled around...

867
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,930
until I met DADO.

868
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,970
I was very lucky.

869
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
Shouldn't you get the second surgery?

870
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:38,140
Even if I do, the probability
of me surviving is 50 percent.

871
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,610
And nobody knows how
much longer I'll live for.

872
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,150
What if you don't get the surgery?

873
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:49,890
What's this?

874
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,590
Do you want me to get the second surgery?

875
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,760
I knew it.

876
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,540
You don't say no, but
you don't say yes either.

877
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,440
You've never gotten
surgery for cancer, right?

878
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,870
It's really painful, you know.

879
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,080
I thought death would be less painful.

880
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,480
But here's the thing.

881
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,380
Even if the surgery is successful,

882
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,020
I wouldn't be able to live like this.

883
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,690
But without the surgery,

884
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,190
I'll probably die.

885
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,860
But what if I were to die...

886
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,100
in a place like this
after living a happy life?

887
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,800
Wouldn't that be
considered a good way to go?

888
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,980
Min Jeong. So you want
me to get the surgery, right?

889
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,180
What about you, Mr. Yoon?

890
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,720
Should I risk my life when
I have a 50-50 chance?

891
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,890
- I'm not sure. - What?

892
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,019
That's not the answer I was looking for.

893
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
But I will say that...

894
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,830
you do seem truly happy...

895
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,790
here in this resort.

896
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,670
That's an original answer.

897
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,800
Okay. Great.

898
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,640
This ends today's report.

899
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,330
Ms. Song.

900
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,900
I realized that I said some
things I shouldn't have.

901
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,100
No. You didn't know about
my situation, Min Jeong.

902
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,040
Even so,

903
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,380
I failed to think that you
had your own reasons too.

904
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,440
I'm sorry.

905
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,050
Then to make up for your mistake,

906
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,680
will you take the dress
I offered yesterday?

907
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,190
Pardon?

908
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,390
Yes? Or no?

909
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,320
My answer is yes.

910
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,500
What a pity. I was having
a good time in a while.

911
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:16,940
We had a good time too.

912
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,910
By the way, are things
that bad with my father?

913
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,780
He bought this resort
for his only daughter.

914
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,380
But you're here to sell it.

915
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,220
You don't seem like a bad person.

916
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,890
So I was wondering if
things were that bad with him.

917
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,960
Things are all right for now.

918
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,860
But there will be a problem later.

919
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,100
You sound just like my doctor.

920
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,170
Goodbye.

921
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,010
Ms. Song. Thank you for everything.

922
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,950
I left the dress in my room.

923
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,180
I thought about it.

924
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,050
But the dress would
suit you better than me.

925
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,120
If that's what you want to do,
there's nothing I can do then.

926
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,260
Take care.

927
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,160
We're on our way to
hand in our resignation.

928
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,300
But that seems so trivial now.

929
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,570
Right.

930
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,540
It makes me wonder
what's really important in life.

931
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,910
I wonder how she must feel right now.

932
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,579
She was so cheerful.

933
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,610
It never occurred to me
that she could be sick.

934
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,050
Min Jeong.

935
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,390
This isn't a fancy dress.

936
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,790
I bought it at a traditional market.

937
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,330
It looked pretty, so I bought it
on my way back from the hospital.

938
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,600
I think I might have missed
the season to wear this.

939
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,170
I might have to wait until
next year to wear this.

940
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,240
But I'm not sure if I'll still be around...

941
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,380
by then.

942
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,950
Okay. Thank you.

943
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,760
There's no pity in your
eyes when you look at me.

944
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,190
That's why I really like you.

945
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,270
But I was a bit of a bother, wasn't I?

946
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,270
No.

947
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,170
Is that why she was so cheerful?

948
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,340
To be honest, her
energy level threw me off.

949
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,680
Same here.

950
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,950
Actually, I wondered if she
was having a manic episode.

951
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,620
Because things were tough on her,

952
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,690
I guess she was trying to
smile as much as she could.

953
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,590
That sounds about right.

954
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,190
She said she hated it when
people gave her the sad look.

955
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,900
If people gave her the sad look,

956
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,100
it meant that she had no hope.

957
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,870
I would have felt the same way.

958
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,539
I hope you're back to full health, sir.

959
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,610
I am.

960
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,580
My gosh.

961
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,720
They want me to double the collateral?

962
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Yes.

963
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,950
But you know, it is just collateral.

964
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,190
They will hold it temporarily.
We will get it back later.

965
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,920
You don't have to worry.

966
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,830
Come in.

967
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,530
Sir, Mr. Yoon Joo No is here.

968
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,280
Did you bring your resignation letter?

969
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,380
Yes.

970
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,450
All right.

971
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,760
So you know what you did wrong, correct?

972
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,190
I do.

973
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,860
Leave.

974
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,700
Was she happy?

975
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,080
Yes. She was happy there.

976
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,250
So what did you do there?

977
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,790
- I'll go and get it. - Get me my phone.

978
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,270
- Hey. - Dad.

979
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,310
Hey.

980
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,310
Yes. It's me. What is it?

981
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,610
It's about the resort.

982
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,050
Sell it.

983
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,590
Sell it?

984
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,290
You were going to sell it
anyway once I was gone.

985
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,360
But...

986
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,800
just sell it now.

987
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,730
Listen, Ji O.

988
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,130
I'm really sorry.

989
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,100
I won't sell the resort no matter what.

990
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,140
No. That's not what I'm saying.

991
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,580
You should really sell it.

992
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,810
Oh, right.

993
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,580
The dress.

994
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,899
Sorry to interrupt. Could
you finish this later?

995
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,900
Sure, Ms. Song.

996
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:44,679
Ms. Song. We'd like to
make another offer to you.

997
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,420
You can find the details
of our offer in the contract.

998
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,689
Whatever decision you make,

999
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,220
we will support your decision.

1000
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,429
But I'd like to say one thing.

1001
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,160
That this dress will look better on you.

1002
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,199
I will come back to the resort next year...

1003
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,640
to see you in this dress.

1004
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
Thank you.

1005
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,410
P.S.

1006
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,940
Running the resort may not be
the best way to use your skills.

1007
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,410
I'm sorry about that.

1008
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,980
You really want me to sell it?

1009
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,690
Yes.

1010
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,990
I guess I'm not cut out to be the CEO.

1011
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,290
Who said that to you?

1012
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,460
My friend.

1013
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,640
Oh, right.

1014
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,170
I...

1015
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,250
want to get the surgery.

1016
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,360
You want to get the surgery.

1017
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,830
Yes.

1018
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,500
I'll do it.

1019
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,840
I'll get the surgery.

1020
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,480
Hopefully, I can do a better job with that.

1021
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,050
The surgery...

1022
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,180
will go well, right?

1023
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,520
Of course.

1024
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,030
The surgery will go
well. Don't worry about it.

1025
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,230
Sell it.

1026
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,830
Okay, Dad?

1027
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,040
Yes.

1028
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:47,710
Ji O.

1029
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,580
Thank you.

1030
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,580
Don't thank me.

1031
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,710
Thank the people you sent.

1032
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,250
Tell them I'm very grateful.

1033
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,260
Sure thing.

1034
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,520
As for the contract,

1035
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,490
I want to stick to the contract
prepared by the people you sent.

1036
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,800
Okay?

1037
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,860
Don't change a word.

1038
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,670
Okay.

1039
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,070
Dad.

1040
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,650
Nothing.

1041
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,630
Thank you.

1042
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:51,970
Thank you.

1043
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,450
Okay. Sure.

1044
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,780
I got it.

1045
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,070
What happened?

1046
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,480
The contract we offered to Ms. Song...

1047
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,480
has a special clause.

1048
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,050
A special clause.

1049
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,990
Unit 123 of DADO Resort...

1050
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,850
will be rented...

1051
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,920
to Song Ji O without charge permanently.

1052
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,360
When everyone is saying yes,

1053
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,960
I'll say yes too.

1054
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,300
However,

1055
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,400
in the case of Song Ji O's death,

1056
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,840
this clause will be invalidated.

1057
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,510
It won't be invalidated.

1058
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,550
Because I'm not going to die.

1059
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,590
It is my understanding...

1060
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,360
that she accepted our offer.

1061
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Yes.

1062
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,510
Sir!

1063
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,839
Secretary! The chairman has fainted.

1064
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,880
I'm good.

1065
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,180
It's just...

1066
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,610
there was no blood pumping to my brain.

1067
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,920
- So I just sat down. - Pardon?

1068
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,149
- Are you all right, sir? - I'm fine.

1069
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,790
I'm all right. Come on, cut it out.

1070
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,920
I'm sitting down, so my body
can recover. I'm fine. Just go.

1071
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,330
- I'm all right. You sit down. - But...

1072
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,940
My goodness. Okay.

1073
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,450
You know what?

1074
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,750
I'm deeply indebted to you now.

1075
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,090
- I'm calling from DOLPHIN Hotel.
- Yes. Hello, sir.

1076
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:25,060
I wanted to check the
second special clause.

1077
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,490
Please wait.

1078
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,099
I see. The permanent rental
clause also ensures that...

1079
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,330
as long as she's alive,

1080
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,499
the promotion between Sanin
Group and your hotel will continue.

1081
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,740
I see.

1082
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,970
Okay. Let's do it then.

1083
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,469
I must send Ms. Song some healthy food,

1084
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,440
so she stays in good health.

1085
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,650
Sure. Thank you.

1086
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,350
How will I...

1087
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,420
pay you back for this?

1088
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,070
You.

1089
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,780
Do you want to be a board member?

1090
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:29,890
(The Art of Negotiation)

1091
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,750
{\an8}I have a country club in
North Chungcheong Province.

1092
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:04,120
{\an8}See if you can sell it.

1093
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,930
{\an8}The atmosphere in the
company has gotten intense lately.

1094
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,060
{\an8}You don't know who could
be next on the chopping block.

1095
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,230
{\an8}Gosh, look at these jerks.
They're trying to be clever.

1096
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:15,300
{\an8}Is your intention in buying
the country club to run it?

1097
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,239
{\an8}The company interested in buying
GREEN VIEW Country Club...

1098
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,440
{\an8}demands a change in the
CEO as part of their terms.

1099
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,909
{\an8}If he's getting dismissed
because he did a good job,

1100
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,140
{\an8}that's not fair. Is it?

1101
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,710
{\an8}Joo No.

1102
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,850
{\an8}Becoming a board member isn't easy.

1103
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,079
{\an8}There was a withdrawal of
100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

1104
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,520
{\an8}The 100,000 dollars weren't accounted for.

1105
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,220
{\an8}I'm almost there too.

1106
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,820
{\an8}I'll be on the board.
