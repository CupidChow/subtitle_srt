00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,100
Hello.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
Gosh, hello.

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,040
- Shall we? - Sure.

12
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,350
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,250
Don't apologize. It's part of the job.

14
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,220
You got one over on me.

15
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,230
I guess I did.

16
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,570
Do you want to switch seats?

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,670
- Cigarette smoke's coming your way.
- I'm fine.

18
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,340
- You're sweet. - Goodness.

19
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,080
Anyway, how did you learn Korean?

20
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,180
At Yonsei University.

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,849
In Sinchon? At the language institute?

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,890
Yes.

23
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,550
- I went to Yonsei University too.
- Really?

24
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,419
I was there in 2015.

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,590
In 2015, I was a freshman.

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,429
I drank a lot in Sinchon back then.

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,260
I hung out a lot in Sinchon too.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,140
We may have crossed paths.

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,170
We could have.

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,580
Back then, I thought I'd
be set once I got a job.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,520
Right.

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,720
Those were the good times for me as well.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,060
Will it get better once
we're no longer the newbies?

34
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,630
Beats me.

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm the newbie on my team too.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,770
Come on.

37
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,399
We may both be newbies,

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,740
but where we stand
couldn't be more different.

39
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,040
I was outsmarted by you, remember?

40
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,710
You were probably praised
while I got chewed out.

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,180
On top of that, I'm hungry.

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Shizuoka is famous for its fishcakes.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,490
Would you like to...

44
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,530
Shall we?

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,200
Can I ask you one thing?

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,870
Sure.

47
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,880
What do you want to know?

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,850
This way.

49
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,920
SHIMIZ has no intention
of dealing with us, does it?

50
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,890
This is all a facade,
but we're not seeing it.

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,230
Well...

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,500
SHIMIZ is actually looking
to move its head office.

53
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,600
Isn't the one in Shizuoka the head office?

54
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,140
It is,

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,380
but there are fewer number of
people living in Shizuoka now.

56
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,410
That's why we're looking to move to Tokyo.

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,350
Who'll move to Tokyo and
who'll stay in Shizuoka...

58
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,520
will be decided this month.

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,560
Mr. Yoshida will stay behind...

60
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,790
due to lack of performance.

61
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,090
I see.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,359
The same goes on in Korea...

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,630
with people only wishing to move to Seoul.

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,670
What can you do when
Shizuoka is smaller than Tokyo?

65
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,440
What about you, Ms. Hirose?
Are you moving to Tokyo?

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,650
Or are you staying in Shizuoka?

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,220
Only one from our team can move to Tokyo.

68
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,050
Mr. Ozaki will probably be chosen over me.

69
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,120
But you want to go to Tokyo, right?

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,130
Going to Tokyo will be
better for my career but...

72
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,070
I must ask.

73
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,170
Can't Mr. Yoshida
strike the deal with us...

74
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,340
and show that as his performance?

75
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,780
A deal with WIND...

76
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,150
won't be enough.

77
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,819
The money has to be received...

78
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,790
for it to be considered
as one's performance.

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
But the down payment
from the deal with WIND...

80
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,890
won't be enough.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,860
Is that why...

82
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,770
we're not being offered the discount?

83
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,000
At full price,

84
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,010
he could hit his quota.

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,740
But unless it's at a discount,

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,310
we have no reason to seal the deal.

87
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,520
It's a tough one.

88
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,660
(Episode 6: Inner Thoughts)

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,260
{\an8}This is the place. It's where I frequent.

90
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,770
{\an8}I'm loving the vibe.

91
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,240
{\an8}Shall we?

92
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,510
Then, how much is usually
offered as a down payment?

93
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,949
Normally, ten percent should be received...

94
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,750
by the end of next month.

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,580
Next month?

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,090
Those moving to Tokyo
would've already been chosen,

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,820
so that won't affect
Mr. Yoshida's situation.

98
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
That's right.

99
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,100
Go ahead.

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,540
Here are your fishcakes.

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,140
- Thank you. - Thank you.

102
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,880
Choose one.

103
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,950
- I'll have this. - Okay.

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,850
Go ahead.

105
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,990
- I'll try this one. - Sure.

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,730
How is it?

107
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,769
- It's delicious. - Is it?

108
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,300
- It's incredible. - Really?

109
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,770
It's good.

110
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
By the way,

111
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,910
why are you telling me
about SHIMIZ's situation?

112
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,320
I felt guilty in a way...

113
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,480
and wanted to tell you.

114
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,090
If by any chance,

115
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,630
you need to meet a quota too,

116
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,900
I'll look for a way...

117
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,600
so that you can move to Tokyo.

118
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,870
Sure.

119
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,979
- It's so good. - Have your fill.

120
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Right.

121
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,780
- Here. - Yes?

122
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,630
- It's strong. - Is it?

123
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,560
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

124
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,700
Thank you for today.

125
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,440
You even treated me to a meal
when it should've been on me.

126
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,080
You can treat me next time.

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,310
Sure. Next time,

128
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,420
I'll treat you to something
delicious when you're in Korea.

129
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,250
There's an innocence to you.

130
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,759
What? To me?

131
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Yes.

132
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,740
I bet you said that to only
be polite. Me, innocent?

133
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,999
Gosh, no. That came from the heart.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,040
(Honne: One's true feelings)

135
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I see.

136
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,540
Mr. Oh.

137
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,580
You were giving me spy vibes.

138
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,420
Did you get anything?

139
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,550
I did.

140
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
SHIMIZ has its own internal issues.

141
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,390
Did she tell you all about it?

142
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes.

143
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,170
Really?

144
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,070
It's crucial for Mr. Yoshida...

145
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,069
to hit his quota, right?

146
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,080
Yes.

147
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,910
How much in down payment would he need?

148
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,109
With 9,000 at a 40-percent
discount, the down payment...

149
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,750
would be 16.666 percent.

150
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,350
And at a 50-percent discount?

151
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,549
To get a 50-percent discount,

152
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,020
the order must be for over 10,000.

153
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,290
I know.

154
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I see.

155
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:21,060
The down payment would be 18 percent.

156
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,170
That'll do.

157
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,840
- Should I schedule a meeting? - No.

158
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll talk to Mr. Yoshida first.

159
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,640
Sure.

160
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,640
Excuse me while I make a call.

161
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,590
Mr. Yoon, are things going well?

162
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,560
Yes, sir. We're still in talks.

163
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,230
Meanwhile, I had a request.

164
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,700
Go ahead.

165
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,799
Could we pay the down payment in advance...

166
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,500
and at a higher amount?

167
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,900
As in how much?

168
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,210
Twenty percent.

169
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,440
And it must be paid by this month.

170
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
The company can't afford to
pay that much by this month.

171
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,390
I see.

172
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,630
Then, Mr. Park, I'll
make a different request.

173
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,259
You can ask the head office...

174
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,670
for a short-term loan to
cover the down payment.

175
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,230
However...

176
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,770
(Sanin)

177
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,540
Rather than going to Director Ha,

178
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,340
it'll be better to make the
request directly to the chairman.

179
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,780
I'm asking for a loan,

180
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,180
and Director Ha is the CFO.

181
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,820
I'll be going over his head...

182
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,050
if I go straight to the chairman.

183
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,620
Yes, I know that.

184
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,360
But the dynamics at the head
office are complicated at the moment.

185
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,459
For this particular deal,

186
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,160
it'll be better to make the request...

187
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,160
directly to the chairman.

188
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,830
I suggest a random
encounter at the lobby if able.

189
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
(Sanin)

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,550
Mr. Chairman.

191
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,750
Goodness. What brings you here?

192
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm sorry, sir.

193
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,920
I should've run the company better.

194
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,429
Your job is to make good quality products.

196
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,030
It's our job to sell them for you.

197
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,430
Still,

198
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,400
I heard you were upset about
the company not going public.

199
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,400
My gosh. As if.

200
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,640
What is it? Do you have something to say?

201
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,049
He'll be able to finalize the deal...

202
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,780
with a higher down payment amount.

203
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,150
Says who? The team leader?

204
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,150
Yes, Mr. Yoon Joo No.

205
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,689
I see.

206
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,060
If we're to pay a higher
down payment amount,

207
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,520
the overall amount should
be less. Don't you agree?

208
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,290
Sorry?

209
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
Have it approved.

210
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,530
Yes, sir.

211
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,210
Goodness. You must've
been working out these days.

212
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,740
Your thighs are still as muscular as ever.

213
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,850
Of course.

214
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,890
Those with better stamina
make better entrepreneurs.

215
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Goodness me. Have your tea.

216
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,960
The chairman approved.

217
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,660
Sure.

218
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,380
This is the secretary's office.

219
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,180
Is the Head of Planning there?

220
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,020
Yes, this is he.

221
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,920
Are you sure the order
came from the chairman?

222
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,730
I see.

223
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,760
Got it.

224
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,400
All right.

225
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
He immediately approved
it like you said he would.

226
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,960
That's great to hear. You did great.

227
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,000
However, he mentioned the
overall price to be lowered.

228
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,239
The deal itself can't be easy to strike,

229
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,010
so a lowered price seems impossible.

230
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,870
I'll have to get it done.

231
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,140
You should hurry on out
before Director Ha sees you.

232
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm worried about that myself.

233
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,990
CEO Park!

234
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,700
What is the meaning of this?

235
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,030
If you were here for a loan,

236
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,229
you should've come to me, the CFO.

237
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,069
Who are you to go straight to the chairman?

238
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,300
I was here to see you, sir,

239
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,439
but I ran into the chairman in the lobby.

240
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,340
He asked why I was here,
and I couldn't exactly lie.

241
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,480
So? Did the deal happen?

242
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,380
Not quite yet from what I understand.

243
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,149
But to close the deal,

244
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,850
a higher down payment seems necessary.

245
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,960
The decision has to be
made by tomorrow, right?

246
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,090
I'll submit everything
tomorrow for your approval, sir.

247
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,380
Thank you for responding
to such an urgent call.

248
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,780
No problem.

249
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,580
Thank you for your call.

250
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,320
I prefer traditional
Japanese tea over coffee.

251
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,060
Is that all right with you?

252
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,260
I wanted you to experience Japan...

253
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,900
while you were here.

254
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,930
Of course. I appreciate it.

255
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,910
We proposed purchasing
a significantly large quantity.

256
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,280
Around ten times the original amount,

257
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,680
believing it would be a
favourable offer for SHIMIZ.

258
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,650
However,

259
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,249
it seems we may have underestimated...

260
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,460
the cultural differences
between Japan and South Korea.

261
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Yes.

262
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,370
It can happen if you're
not familiar with our culture.

263
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,970
Thank you for understanding.

264
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,720
I have received it.

265
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,910
Then,

266
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,250
we would like to inquire...

267
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
about how we can reach
an agreement appropriately.

268
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,120
The requested quantity can be done.

269
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,660
But there are concerns regarding
the change in the schedule,

270
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,500
issues of responsibility and such.

271
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,030
Sure.

272
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,269
How about we address those concerns...

273
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,570
by paying in advance?

274
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,310
By the way, why did Mr. Yoon
want to meet him alone?

275
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,780
He wanted to be considerate of Mr. Yoshida.

276
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,510
How's that being considerate?

277
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,920
Mr. Yoshida knew that
signing the deal with us...

278
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,890
would be a good thing for SHIMIZ,

279
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,960
but he turned it down to
move up in the company.

280
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,089
If Mr. Yoshida had to
admit that in front of others,

281
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,930
he'd be embarrassed.

282
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,670
I heard Japanese people
cared a great deal about honour.

283
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,300
I guess Koreans are kind of like that too.

284
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,540
By "advance,"

285
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,050
what deadline are you referring to?

286
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,720
Based on the current contract terms,

287
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,420
we're expected to pay ten percent
of the down payment next month,

288
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,820
but we would like to pay 20...

289
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,560
this month instead.

290
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,300
This month?

291
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,670
Yes. Additionally,

292
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,210
we request the cancellation of
WIND's current order of 1,000 units.

293
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,950
We'd like to place a new order instead.

294
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,950
If...

295
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,219
it is because of the discount rate,

296
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,720
that may not be a concern.

297
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,720
From 1,000 to 10,000 units,

298
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,160
the discount rate is the
same at 40 percent anyway.

299
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,700
No, we intend to order 10,001 units.

300
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,470
In that case,

301
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,240
we understand the discount
rate would be 50 percent.

302
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Isn't that SHIMIZ's manual?

303
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,260
We will need to consider it.

304
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,600
Yes.

305
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,560
But as you know,

306
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,830
the deadline is imminent.

307
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,950
Yes, Director Lee.

308
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,520
SHIMIZ decided to accept our offer.

309
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,180
I'm glad to hear that.

310
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,890
Chairman Song will be relieved too.

311
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
You're okay, right?

312
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,190
Me? Of course, I'm fine. I'll
be stepping down anyway.

313
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,759
I just feel bad that you had to do this.

314
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,899
You're stepping down?

315
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,970
Yes, I should.

316
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,200
I can't work forever, you know.

317
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,809
I should retire and take it easy too.

318
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,940
You should be
congratulated when you retire.

319
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,409
Thanks for saying that.

320
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,079
(Junior Managing Director Lee Dong Joon)

321
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,210
Get some rest.

322
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,470
- You should call it a day too. - Yes.

323
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,670
Right, Chairman Song.

324
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,580
I need to give him an update
about something. Is it too late?

325
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,110
Should I check with the secretary's office?

326
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,650
Or you could just meet with him tomorrow.

327
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,090
All right.

328
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,560
(Jongno Go Club)

329
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,129
(Jongno Go Club)

330
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,030
- Hello. - Hello.

331
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,749
- Oh, hello. - My, it's good to see you.

332
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,849
It's been a while.

333
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,179
- I know, it's been a while. - Yes.

334
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,250
All right.

335
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,590
- Is the business doing well? - Yes.

336
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,390
- Your friends are over there. - Okay.

337
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Oh, over there.

338
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,570
(My eldest daughter)

339
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,039
(Dad, pick up some fried
chicken on your way home.)

340
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,180
(Okay.)

341
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,090
Sorry, that was an important text.

342
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,790
Director Ha.

343
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,220
Why did you want to see me?

344
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,930
Well, the other day,

345
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,700
I saw you were having a hard time,

346
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,360
so I wanted to comfort you.

347
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,870
Comfort me?

348
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Well, I know you're
under a lot of stress now.

349
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,070
Wasn't it your decision to acquire WIND?

350
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
Well, it was.

351
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,709
Then we should take
responsibility together.

352
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,780
Isn't it unacceptable to act
like it's none of your business?

353
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,149
Unacceptable? What are you talking about?

354
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,120
IPO is the IR team's responsibility.

355
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,420
Director Lee apologized to me already.

356
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,360
And WIND...

357
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,960
will go public.

358
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Mr. Oh.

359
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,230
How did you become a board
member when you were this dense?

360
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,670
What do you mean?

361
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,170
I heard you got chewed
out by the chairman recently.

362
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,080
He was just...

363
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,649
He just said some stuff out of anger.

364
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,650
And to be honest,

365
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,619
it wasn't that bad.

366
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
What are you saying?

367
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,690
Hey, that is not the point.

368
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Listen, Mr. Oh.

369
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Do you think Chairman Song
chewed you out like that...

370
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,160
because of WIND?

371
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,099
That day, he called
Director Lee to his office...

372
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,900
and scolded you like that...

373
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,510
so Director Lee would
hear it. It wasn't about you.

374
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
What?

375
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,150
But I know they're close.

376
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,150
Why would he do that?

377
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,980
Because they're close.

378
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,890
He didn't want to say it
directly to Director Lee.

379
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,589
That's why he called you there...

380
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,860
and said what he wanted
to say to Director Lee.

381
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,160
Like I said, IPO is the IR team's job.

382
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,430
- So? - What do you mean, so?

383
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,740
Don't let them walk all over you.

384
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,870
Stop beating around the bush.

385
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,810
If you have something to say, just say it.

386
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,350
Your contract renewal is coming up, right?

387
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,820
You need to tell people the
truth if you want to keep your job.

388
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,720
What are you talking about?

389
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,730
Tell the truth that
Director Lee is to blame.

390
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,490
You want people to know the truth.

391
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,959
Can you do that?

392
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,929
You said even Chairman
Song called me there...

393
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,070
because he couldn't scold him.

394
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
Right, exactly.

395
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,640
That's why we should call a board meeting.

396
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,970
What?

397
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,340
What, then? Do you have another idea?

398
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Yes.

399
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,550
- I'm sorry I'm late. - No, it's fine.

400
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,220
You're right on time.

401
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,819
I called them here to
have a drink with them too.

402
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
- Sure. - That's okay, right?

403
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:52,659
- Sir. - We're here.

404
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
Yes, hi.

405
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,100
- Mr. Kim. - Oh, hey. You're here too.

406
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,230
What brings you here?

407
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,200
I came to have dinner.
Why else would I be here?

408
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,940
What's your level?

409
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,640
Around Level Three, I'd say.

410
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,050
Come on. I can tell you'd be very good.

411
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,720
Then we can play without a bet.

412
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,590
Without a bet?

413
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
What would be the fun in that?

414
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,890
Please take a seat.

415
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,630
I'm telling you. This place has
the best sashimi in the country.

416
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,200
You know, I can't betray Director Lee.

417
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,500
I'll be going, then.

418
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,070
Hey, come on.

419
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,940
No one told you to betray him.

420
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,310
What, then? Are you
saying Mr. Kim is a traitor?

421
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,310
Let's just stay for dinner.
That's what I'm doing.

422
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,319
Mr. Oh, you have a knife at your throat,

423
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,920
yet you still care who's on whose side?

424
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,890
Look around you now.

425
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,260
The board meeting will
be held even without you.

426
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,130
Then why did you call me here?

427
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,270
You can leave, then.

428
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,030
Come on.

429
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,070
Will you stand there as you listen to us?

430
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,900
I told you. I have something to tell you.

431
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,770
Mr. Oh.

432
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,740
Come on.

433
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,080
I mean...

434
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
I understand the situation, but
a board meeting is too much.

435
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,219
You're saying we should
turn our backs on him...

436
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,920
right in front of him.

437
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,660
What, then?

438
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,859
Will you resign in his place, then?

439
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,160
Why should I resign?

440
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,160
If you can't get your
contract renewed this time,

441
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,930
you will have to leave.

442
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,569
Both Director Lee and Yoon Joo No...

443
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,170
really shouldn't do that.

444
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,570
Well, then how about...

445
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,510
Yoon Joo No takes
responsibility for everything?

446
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,610
That will be a good solution too.

447
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,250
- Please help yourself. - Yes.

448
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,120
Oh, this looks good.

449
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,290
Here.

450
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
You see,

451
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,210
I'm not saying we should
gang up against Director Lee.

452
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,340
I'm simply suggesting...

453
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,110
we give him a reason to
give up on Yoon Joo No.

454
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,780
The choice is his.

455
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,480
But...

456
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,190
if he says he'll take responsibility
for everything and retire,

457
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,990
then what are we going
to do about Yoon Joo No?

458
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,660
He'll just receive an indulgence, won't he?

459
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,660
Indulgence.

460
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,230
Why do you think Yoon Joo
No came to the head office?

461
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,170
Do you know the reason?

462
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,040
Here. Mr. Oh, come on.

463
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,380
Cheers.

464
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,290
You see,

465
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,090
when you're handling a large sum of money,

466
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,260
you get confused.

467
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,300
You know the money isn't yours,

468
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,130
but you feel like it's yours
because it's in your hands.

469
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,830
That's why money is a scary thing.

470
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,100
- Is that really true? - Yes.

471
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,910
When you do M and A deals,

472
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,280
you handle hundreds of millions of dollars.

473
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,519
So, you start thinking money is a joke,

474
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,680
and you feel like it's all yours.

475
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,049
One should be afraid of money.

476
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,050
Yes, exactly.

477
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
You know,

478
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,960
when you go out there to acquire a company,

479
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,359
you meet many fools who
ask for 20 million dollars...

480
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,500
when their company
is only worth ten million.

481
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,130
But they can never win
against M and A experts.

482
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,200
In the end, they sell their business
for five million and call it quits.

483
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,140
Then what about me?

484
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,510
I only paid 5 million for a
company that's worth 10 million,

485
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,780
which means I brought in a
profit of five million dollars.

486
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
That's true.

487
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,480
But what about my salary?

488
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,220
It's pathetic.

489
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,150
And I don't know when I might get fired.

490
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,419
So, one can't help but think, "I
should pocket some of this..."

491
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,860
"when I have the chance."

492
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,560
Right, I get it.

493
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,729
The easiest thing to do would
be to offer seven million dollars...

494
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,499
to the person who wants to
sell a company worth five million,

495
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,000
then ask for a million-dollar commission.

496
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
Then you can tell your boss that...

497
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,869
you managed to acquire a company
worth 10 million for only 7 million,

498
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,970
but that's too easy.

499
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
What?

500
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,249
Are you saying Yoon Joo No took rebates?

501
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,250
You see...

502
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,650
I'm not trying to be mean...

503
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,850
to my former mentee for
collecting some kickbacks.

504
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,160
He is...

505
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,730
My gosh.

506
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,360
I swear,

507
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,700
I've never told anyone this, but...

508
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,609
- You know JUMBO Pharma, right?
- Of course.

509
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,510
Sanin nearly went bust because of them.

510
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,680
That was...

511
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,780
That was Yoon Joo No's work.

512
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,490
I know the Prosecutors'
Office investigated that case,

513
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,820
but they found nothing. Am I wrong?

514
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,660
That's not true.

515
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,030
Yoon Joo No did it in his brother's name.

516
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
But then,

517
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,030
his brother died while being investigated.

518
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,170
Because the suspect died,

519
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,910
they had no choice but to close the case.

520
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,180
Director Lee feels bad about that.

521
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,410
He feels sorry.

522
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,610
You all know how he is.

523
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
My gosh.

524
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,820
You're very good.

525
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,720
He's always agreeable and never complains.

526
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,860
He doesn't want to be blamed for
anything, so he never speaks out.

527
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,430
A personality like that makes
problems get out of hand.

528
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,560
A wound festers when left untreated.

529
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,460
Yoon Joo No is a ticking
bomb waiting to explode.

530
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
He's a problem bound to explode.

531
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,439
So, we need to deal with
Director Lee sooner than later.

532
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,140
If not, we're all finished.

533
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,340
But...

534
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,280
Yoon Joo No must
know a lot about that stuff.

535
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,580
He bought shares in his brother's
name? Wouldn't it be too obvious?

536
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,620
Look at this.

537
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,480
This is how kindhearted people think.

538
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,990
I'm not that kind.

539
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,960
If you were told to hire someone
to manage all your money,

540
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,730
you could never do it.

541
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,860
Most people can't even
let their own children do it.

542
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Which means,

543
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,670
Yoon Joo No and his
brother were extremely close.

544
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,140
That's why it all happened.

545
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,450
Joo No.

546
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,060
Help me.

547
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,620
You're investing in JUMBO, aren't you?

548
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,360
How did you know?

549
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,870
How?

550
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,510
How did you find out?

551
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Sanin won't invest in that company.

552
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,690
That company is a fraud.

553
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,490
Hey, don't lie to me.

554
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,169
Shouldn't it go up if
Sanin is investing in them?

555
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,200
But...

556
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,400
But why is it dropping?

557
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,670
Joo No.

558
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,240
Help me out once.

559
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,310
If you don't, I'll die.

560
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,350
Please.

561
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,380
Hi.

562
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
This way, please.

563
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,090
- The quantity is 10,001.
- The quantity is 10,001.

564
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,530
- The unit price is 25 dollars.
- The unit price is 25 dollars.

565
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,369
Twenty percent of the total
amount will be paid this month.

566
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,569
- It will serve... - It will serve...

567
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,240
- as the down payment.
- As the down payment.

568
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,410
Understood.

569
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,479
Please reconfirm the
50 percent discount rate...

570
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,049
as the quantity is
10,0001, exceeding 10,000.

571
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,210
Please reconfirm the
50 percent discount rate.

572
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,820
We already have the signature of
WIND's CEO, Park Rae Gyeong.

573
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,489
We have also attached
our guarantee as the agent.

574
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,619
They have also attached
their guarantee as the agent.

575
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,660
Here.

576
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,880
Thank you.

577
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,990
Please.

578
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,859
We'll be receiving the
quantity intended for Speed...

579
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,730
in Korea from SHIMIZ.

580
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,600
In Korea from SHIMIZ.

581
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,770
The MOU agreement with
Speed will be attached later.

582
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,570
Thank you.

583
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,640
All clear.

584
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,240
We have no issues.

585
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,080
This company makes bicycles, yes?

586
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,990
They make bicycles, yes?

587
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,460
Does WIND make bicycles?

588
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,190
Yes, they do.

589
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,930
May I give him an explanation?

590
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,300
WIND also makes equipment for archery.

591
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,410
- In the archery industry...
- My apologies.

592
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
I can't sign this contract.

593
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
He says he can't sign it.

594
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,890
What's the reason?

595
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,290
Why can't you sign the contract?

596
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,390
It's because I can't trust this company.

597
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,790
Mr. Naito.

598
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,029
You're being rude before our guests.

599
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,060
Mr. Yoshida.

600
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,269
Aren't you proceeding with this contract...

601
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,000
to fill your quota and return to Tokyo?

602
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,869
Calm down, Mr. Naito.

603
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,940
You're the same, no?

604
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,140
Please excuse me.

605
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
- Wait. - Excuse me.

606
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:52,550
What are you doing, Mr. Naito?

607
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,109
Mr. Naito? What is it?

608
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,150
Mr. Naito.

609
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,290
Mr. Naito. Please wait a minute.

610
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,529
Can you not trust WIND...

611
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,830
because of the change in order quantity?

612
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,930
If we were trying to deceive SHIMIZ,

613
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,900
we would've purchased the
gears from other bicycle companies.

614
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,729
As mentioned,

615
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,599
Korea's bicycle industry is in a slump.

616
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,640
Listen.

617
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,009
The contract has once changed.

618
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,849
That means it can change again, no?

619
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,350
Signing such a contract is meaningless.

620
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,079
If the contract can change...

621
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,250
at any time, he sees no
reason for another one.

622
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,890
That's why we're
signing the contract today.

623
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,320
A contract is a promise to be kept...

624
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,229
and also specifies the
penalties when breached.

625
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,529
A contract is...

626
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,999
My apologies, but I don't understand.

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,030
But...

628
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,030
a company that has once broken its word...

629
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,100
will do it again.

630
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,340
I know that for sure.

631
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Please excuse me.

632
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:56,739
He said that a promise...

633
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,710
once broken could be broken again.

634
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,530
My deepest apologies.

635
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,740
My apologies.

636
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,910
For changing the quantity on the contract,

637
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,610
the production manager's
approval is required...

638
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,180
from the perspective of
managing supply issues.

639
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,690
I'm very sorry things
have turned out this way.

640
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,460
There must be a reason
Mr. Naito is taking such a stance.

641
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,670
I can't say what the reason is.

642
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,299
But it should be noted...

643
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,070
that he comes from a
generation of craftsmen.

644
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,040
That's why he has a very strong will...

645
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,680
and lacks business admin.

646
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,150
Does Mr. Naito's parents also make gears?

647
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,450
Not gears.

648
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,590
But his father was also a master craftsman.

649
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,790
Specifically, precision machining.

650
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,360
He even had his own factory.

651
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,270
The work clothes Mr. Naito was wearing...

652
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,470
were probably from his father's company.

653
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,040
Yes.

654
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,040
Yes.

655
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,610
Since that factory is currently SHIMIZ's.

656
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,350
Mr. Naito is continuing his family legacy,

657
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,690
running the factory himself.

658
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,289
I believe Japan is sustained...

659
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,230
by such craftsmanship.

660
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,680
(SHIMIZ)

661
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,220
Dad!

662
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,630
Ken. Why are you here?

663
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,630
Did something happen?

664
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,670
Okay.

665
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,170
What?

666
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,540
Great work.

667
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,210
Did you sign the contract?

668
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,339
- Let's eat. - No.

669
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,580
What happened?

670
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,979
We have too many cancellations these days.

671
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,080
I know.

672
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,050
The warehouse is almost full.

673
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,920
It's fine as long as we make good products.

674
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,490
That's true, but...

675
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,460
Great work.

676
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,999
I don't think we can proceed...

677
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,230
with the contract any further.

678
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,670
I'm very sorry.

679
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,410
- My apologies. - No, it's okay.

680
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,190
I'll see you off.

681
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,670
- Ms. Hirose. - Yes?

682
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,900
Is there a way I can meet Mr. Naito?

683
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,710
He usually goes to the factory.

684
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,850
Excuse me. Please take us to this address.

685
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,310
Is it SHIMIZ Factory?

686
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,179
Yes. Do you know this place?

687
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,379
Of course.

688
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,350
It's been there for over 100 years.

689
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,020
- Is that so? - Yes.

690
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,459
Is SHIMIZ's permission
required to receive...

691
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,230
Speed's quantity on their behalf?

692
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,770
Yes.

693
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,900
The resale prohibition
clause is quite strict.

694
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,770
Can we delay our
quantity contract schedule?

695
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,540
No. We already have an
OEM contract scheduled.

696
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,420
Hello.

697
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,050
Who are you?

698
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,419
We're from WIND,

699
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,720
a company in Korea.

700
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,590
Can we meet the factory manager?

701
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,600
You're involved in the contract, right?

702
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,930
Yes.

703
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,270
Mr. Naito.

704
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,510
Mr. Naito.

705
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,080
Guests from the Korean company are here.

706
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,380
(Ongojisin)

707
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,660
To show up without an appointment.

708
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,590
He said we came without notice.

709
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,830
My apologies.

710
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,860
There's a question I'd like to ask.

711
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,930
I have nothing more to say.

712
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,900
Please return.

713
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,070
Mr. Naito.

714
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,480
Right. What's this?

715
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,180
Hey, kid.

716
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,860
Check if we don't have to do it.

717
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Excuse me.

718
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,630
Can you ask if he's
coming to work tomorrow?

719
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,370
Is Mr. Naito coming to work tomorrow?

720
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,910
The manager comes to work every day.

721
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,310
I see.

722
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,440
Apparently, he comes to work every day.

723
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,450
(Ongojisin)

724
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,530
CEO Park Rae Gyeong's
name was on the contract, right?

725
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,370
Yes. His name and signature were on it.

726
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,209
Mr. Naito asked if the
headquarters made bicycles...

727
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,309
before he signed the contract.

728
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,439
Yes. I replied yes...

729
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,580
and added they also made archery equipment.

730
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,190
Did the contract proceed well?

731
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,220
My apologies. We couldn't make the deal.

732
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,060
What happened?

733
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,900
The factory manager is a metal craftsman.

734
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,970
He's against the contract.

735
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,870
I see.

736
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,110
That's not uncommon in Japan.

737
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,480
Japanese craftsmen have great pride.

738
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,380
That gave me a hard time...

739
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,550
when I took over DAICHI.

740
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,620
Right. I can imagine.

741
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,380
Yes.

742
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,689
Until the early 1990s,

743
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,120
DAICHI was number one in archery equipment.

744
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,860
But among athletes,
they had already lost...

745
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,300
the market to us.

746
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,269
DAICHI's situation worsened eventually,

747
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,700
and they had to sell the company.

748
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,540
And that was how you took over the company.

749
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,640
I didn't because I needed
DAICHI's technique.

750
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,980
Technique-wise, we were already...

751
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,820
ahead of them.

752
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,280
Then why did you buy the company?

753
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,049
(CEO's Office)

754
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,520
DAICHI had a great reputation.

755
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,260
Had another company taken over DAICHI,

756
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,430
that company would've quickly
caught up to WIND's reputation.

757
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,240
In short, you took over
as a defensive measure.

758
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,240
Correct.

759
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,470
But...

760
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,840
back then, DAICHI set such a condition...

761
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,480
for acquisition.

762
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,450
"Make better archery
equipment than DAICHI."

763
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,490
I was taken aback at first.

764
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,930
At first, I thought he was bluffing.

765
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,660
But now that I think about it,

766
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,870
he must've been sincere about it.

767
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,640
Mr. Park.

768
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,640
Can you spare me some time?

769
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,110
I'll come over at once.

770
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,110
May I ask why?

771
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,820
The DAICHI photo hanging in WIND's office.

772
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,890
That?

773
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,960
The one I took when taking over DAICHI?

774
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,930
Yes.

775
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,760
The craftsman in that photo...

776
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,860
drew the blueprint, right?

777
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:47,970
Correct.

778
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,900
That's why I gifted the frame to him.

779
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,870
"Ongojisin."

780
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,070
You remember.

781
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,380
You wrote it yourself, yes?

782
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,609
The craftsman asked me to.

783
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,779
(DAICHI)

784
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,820
The boy in the photo is
the craftsman's son, right?

785
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,850
Yes.

786
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,490
Do you remember his name?

787
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,890
I don't remember the son's name.

788
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,860
But the craftsman's name...

789
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,660
was Naito DAICHI.

790
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,870
I see.

791
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,470
Mr. Park.

792
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,000
I need that photo.

793
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,340
Sorry?

794
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,880
You need the photo?

795
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,010
Yes.

796
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,150
Hey.

797
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,820
It's right here.

798
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,060
And wait.

799
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Thank you.

800
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Thank you.

801
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,850
You even came to work today.

802
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,210
That's amazing.

803
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,580
Can't you please return?

804
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,919
There's something we must ask.

805
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,960
Could you please wait for a little while?

806
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,460
You people standing
around here is troublesome.

807
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,430
How much longer will it take?

808
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,400
Please, we ask of you.

809
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,570
Excuse me.

810
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,910
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

811
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,550
Fine. What is it that
you want to talk about?

812
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,280
I would like to check something first.

813
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,760
Did you refuse to sign the contract...

814
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,660
because you noticed Park
Rae Gyeong's name on it?

815
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,560
We'd like to confirm something.

816
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,470
Did you refuse to sign the contract...

817
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,940
because you noticed the
name Park Rae Gyeong on it?

818
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,610
You never saw Park Rae
Gyeong's name in past contracts,

819
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,980
as there were no quantity modifications.

820
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,810
But Park Rae Gyeong took
part as an authorized signatory,

821
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,120
and you saw the name. Am I not right?

822
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,390
Unlike before, you were involved...

823
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,360
in the revised contract,

824
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,360
And that made you discover
Park Rae Gyeong's name. Yes?

825
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,430
So what about it?

826
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,029
CEO Park Rae Gyeong took over DAICHI,

827
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,930
the company making archery equipment,

828
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,639
which caused the number
one archery company...

829
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,710
in the world to disappear.

830
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,520
With WIND acquiring DAICHI,

831
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,850
the best archery company in
the world, DAICHI disappeared.

832
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,420
What...

833
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,360
That's enough!

834
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,230
All right?

835
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,460
Wasn't your father...

836
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:06,630
a craftsman who made
archery equipment at DAICHI?

837
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,000
Your father was a craftsman...

838
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,799
who made archery equipment...

839
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,570
- at DAICHI, yes? - Yes, that's right.

840
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,909
Wait.

841
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,480
Did everyone come all
the way here to tell me that?

842
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,980
I have something for you.

843
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,650
(WIND)

844
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,629
To give you this, Mr. Yoon made...

845
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,230
a round trip to Korea.

846
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,929
But due to the flight delay, he was late.

847
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,899
Please forgive him.

848
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,970
Listen.

849
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,400
If it's the contract, I will not sign it.

850
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,670
And I've already told you that.

851
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,580
It's not the contract.

852
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,710
But it is related to the promise.

853
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,850
It's not the contract.

854
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,250
It's about the promise.

855
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,500
(Ongojisin)

856
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,570
That's the picture of your father...

857
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,410
and the CEO of WIND, Park
Rae Gyeong, from 30 years ago.

858
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,440
When your father...

859
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,050
sold DAICHI to CEO Park Rae Gyeong,

860
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,479
he gave the CEO the
hand-drawn blueprint of a bow...

861
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,520
as a present.

862
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,750
When your father sold DAICHI,

863
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,119
he gave CEO Park Rae Gyeong...

864
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,629
the blueprint as a present.

865
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,659
With the request to make the best bow...

866
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,660
to the CEO.

867
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,069
With the request to make
the best bow to the CEO.

868
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,799
And CEO Park gifted your father...

869
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,500
a calligraphy piece for
a motto as a present.

870
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,940
The motto was...

871
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,440
ongojisin.

872
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,309
In return, CEO Park...

873
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,279
gave your father a calligraphy
piece for a motto that said,

874
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,609
"Gain new insights..."

875
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,820
"by learning from the past" as a present.

876
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,350
Well...

877
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,560
Don't you know that...

878
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,130
this is an insult...

879
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,630
to the spirit of our craftsmanship?

880
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,500
That's how you saw it.

881
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,600
Despite that, you still hung the motto.

882
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,509
Despite your disapproval,

883
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,410
- why did you hang the calligraphy? - What?

884
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,010
That...

885
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,349
I saw it every day...

886
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,980
and tried to understand
how my father must have felt.

887
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,890
Your father chose the motto...

888
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,490
for the calligraphy.

889
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,630
The motto for the calligraphy
was requested by your father.

890
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,890
I reckon that...

891
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,130
your father must have wanted
you to continue his legacy...

892
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,500
while hoping that...

893
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,700
you would pave your own path.

894
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,409
Your father might have wanted you...

895
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,540
to continue his legacy...

896
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,479
while you pursued something new...

897
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,549
on your own.

898
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,719
(Ongojisin)

899
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,850
Dad.

900
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,850
I'm back.

901
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,120
Welcome back.

902
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
All right.

903
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,600
I told you not to come to the factory.

904
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,360
No.

905
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,400
I'll be a master craftsman just like you.

906
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:30,900
Really?

907
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,440
Yes. I promise.

908
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,940
Okay.

909
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,250
That's me.

910
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,090
Can you see?

911
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,320
That's your grandpa.

912
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,330
I'm sorry.

913
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,770
Dad, I have your life now.

914
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,610
The kid in the picture grew so much.

915
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,280
Right?

916
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,580
What's this?

917
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,750
Candy?

918
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,230
Your grandpa used to give me
candy when I came to the factory...

919
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,060
after school.

920
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,100
Thank you.

921
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,270
It's a letter...

922
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,140
from CEO Park to you.

923
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:51,420
This is a letter from CEO Park.

924
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,570
Hello.

925
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,070
I'm the CEO of WIND, Park Rae Gyeong.

926
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,840
When I bought DAICHI, your father...

927
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,280
asked me to make the best bow in the world.

928
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,450
He gave me a hand-drawn
blueprint of the bow.

929
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,220
Archery has changed so much
compared to all those years ago.

930
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,860
But my intention to make good bows...

931
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,890
has not changed.

932
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,060
WIND didn't eliminate DAICHI.

933
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,129
WIND is the only company...

934
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,570
that has been continuing
your father's craftsmanship.

935
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,310
And "ongojisin."

936
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,410
This motto was...

937
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,980
what your father wanted to tell you.

938
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,379
I heard that you had been following...

939
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,550
your father's wish.

940
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,690
I will continue to root for you
for your future endeavours.

941
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,090
From Park Rae Gyeong.

942
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,940
Thank you.

943
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,300
Thank you.

944
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,610
Thank you.

945
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,279
Thank you.

946
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,910
- Thank you. - Thank you.

947
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,720
Yes, Director Lee.

948
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,220
The deal has gone through.
We're on our way back.

949
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,360
The discount rate is 50 percent.

950
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,930
This condition is much more favourable.

951
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,190
That was a big win.

952
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,100
How impressive.

953
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,830
But you haven't reported it
to the chairman yet, right?

954
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,969
No. It's the weekend.

955
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,430
I'll do so once I'm at work.

956
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,900
But...

957
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,310
could you delay reporting
it to the chairman?

958
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,580
Sure. I'll do that.

959
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:33,710
Jin Soo.

960
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,480
Aren't you sad to be leaving Japan?

961
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,980
My gosh. But...

962
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,350
I'm so relieved that the deal went through.

963
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:43,860
Right.

964
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,190
That's why.

965
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,590
I'm hungry because we just signed the deal.

966
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,660
My gosh. Aren't you hungry?

967
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:53,600
Sort of.

968
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,970
- Right? Goodness. - Wait.

969
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,309
You're still here.

970
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,210
I didn't think you guys had time to eat.

971
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,479
My boss told me to make
sure you guys had some food.

972
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,510
I knew it. You guys are very kind.

973
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,080
- We were actually getting hungry. - I see.

974
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,580
Wait, no.

975
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,820
We know what this means now.

976
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,419
You want us to leave, right?

977
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,390
Gosh, no. We sincerely want
to treat you to a nice meal.

978
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,959
Really? You mean it?

979
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,360
Yes, really.

980
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,500
She means it.

981
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,870
I was nervous the whole day.
And now that I'm a bit relaxed,

982
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,170
I'm getting hungry.

983
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,739
Right. We're about to
have some food together.

984
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,510
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

985
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,470
Sure. Sounds good.

986
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,480
Where should I bring you?

987
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,750
Well, what's good here?

988
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,580
Then...

989
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,450
how about ramen?

990
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,720
You already had fishcakes.

991
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,560
You also had fishcakes, didn't you?

992
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,760
- I... - Yes.

993
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,130
Does it mean...

994
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,040
she knew that we were tailing them?

995
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,840
I guess so.

996
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,270
Oh, my.

997
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,779
Maybe, she's only genuine...

998
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,139
- about you. - Enjoy.

999
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,480
It's nothing like that.

1000
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1001
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,420
Let's eat together.

1002
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,590
Then...

1003
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,400
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1004
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,430
Jin Soo asked me to help you
get transferred to Tokyo too.

1005
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,240
Yes, I heard it from my boss.

1006
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,440
But...

1007
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,040
I like Shizuoka.

1008
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,980
Yes. I've heard.

1009
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,480
I see.

1010
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,220
You helped us in many ways.

1011
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,660
No. I should thank you for your help.

1012
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,730
Thank you for your help.

1013
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,990
- I'll be in touch. - Okay.

1014
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,499
Thank you for your help.

1015
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1016
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,400
Thank you for your help.

1017
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,340
(Sanin)

1018
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,979
Hello.

1019
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,980
(Board Meeting Minutes)

1020
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:29,110
Hello.

1021
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,820
Hello.

1022
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,090
Hello, Mr. Kim.

1023
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,390
It seems Director Lee won't be joining us.

1024
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,400
Well, he must be embarrassed
to show his face around.

1025
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,430
- Let's all be understanding. - What?

1026
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,640
Are you implying he's responsible
for this problem with WIND?

1027
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,170
Have you gone mad?

1028
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,680
Then who's responsible for it?

1029
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,310
Which team is in charge of
getting subsidiaries listed?

1030
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:03,850
I see.

1031
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,320
You didn't publish the
news article yet, right?

1032
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,930
No, it's on standby.

1033
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:16,530
Should I publish it?

1034
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,600
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

1035
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,900
Should we begin our meeting
without Director Lee then?

1036
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,070
Yes. Let's do that.

1037
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,270
I'm sorry I'm late.

1038
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,920
Now that everyone is present,
let us begin the board meeting.

1039
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,659
Our main agenda today is...

1040
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,690
Let's start with the other matter.

1041
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,590
That seems to be more important.

1042
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,860
I see. All right.

1043
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,430
There is the matter...

1044
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,430
regarding the failure
of getting WIND listed.

1045
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,140
Director Lee, we need you to
explain what happened there.

1046
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,940
WIND will get listed without a problem...

1047
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,050
as long as the sales are good.

1048
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,379
To get a company listed, you
need more than just numbers.

1049
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,520
It's about the momentum.

1050
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,790
So...

1051
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,460
are you holding me responsible?

1052
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,830
You're not the only one responsible.

1053
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,960
But it would be embarrassing
if you blamed someone else...

1054
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,000
for the failure. Don't you agree?

1055
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,470
If the deal went through in Japan,
things could've been different.

1056
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,400
But I take it that it didn't. Am I wrong?

1057
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:37,610
Or if you want, we can
have a show of hands.

1058
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,910
Why would we do that? This
matter doesn't require a vote.

1059
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,550
Shouldn't we make it clear...

1060
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,250
who is responsible for this?

1061
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,390
Sure. Let's do that.

1062
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,990
All right then.

1063
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:55,490
If you believe the failure of WIND
getting listed is IR Team's fault,

1064
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:56,930
raise your hands.

1065
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,670
Mr. Oh, are you raising your hand now?

1066
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,540
Yes.

1067
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,170
My gosh.

1068
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,590
Hello. I'm stopping by briefly
to bring you up to speed.

1069
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,290
First of all, the supply contract
with SHIMIZ has been completed.

1070
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,900
Who approved the down
payment for the contract?

1071
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,599
As the contract was signed on a weekend,

1072
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,430
I plan to request the approval today.

1073
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:39,340
WIND will release news
articles about its new product.

1074
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,669
As WIND struggled to get listed
due to the uncertainty about sales,

1075
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:47,110
I believe that this contract
should remedy such uncertainty.

1076
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,350
Then excuse me.

1077
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,660
May I be excused too?

1078
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,720
Director Lee. I didn't mean to...

1079
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,290
- Mr. Oh. - Yes, Director Lee.

1080
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,130
Resign if you'll blame other people
because you don't think it's fair.

1081
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:39,160
No, I never thought it wasn't fair.

1082
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,030
I'm sorry.

1083
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,100
Get back to work.

1084
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,270
I hear your contract
renewal is around the corner.

1085
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:11,730
(Main Agenda)

1086
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,070
Hey.

1087
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,210
How was your trip to Japan?

1088
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,580
It went well.

1089
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:29,980
I knew it.

1090
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:32,220
I found the players for the operation.

1091
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,720
They're still doing the same thing.

1092
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,260
That's good.

1093
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,230
Then...

1094
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:43,890
should I begin?

1095
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:52,040
I'll call you right back.

1096
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,970
Yes, Director Lee.

1097
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,710
Hey, you're still up.

1098
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,909
I'm sorry to call you at this late hour.

1099
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,850
No. Please go ahead.

1100
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,620
There's a problem.

1101
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,990
The chairman took out a loan
with the stocks as collateral.

1102
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,960
And it seems he arranged
it through his secretary.

1103
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,830
He must have wanted to do it secretly.

1104
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,570
This wasn't disclosed to the public.

1105
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:30,640
The secretary must have
realized that this was a problem...

1106
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,779
when the loan was almost due.

1107
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,410
(Stock Pledge Agreement)

1108
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,950
It could be that the chairman
didn't want anyone to know.

1109
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,350
Is this bad?

1110
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,590
Of course, it's bad.

1111
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,260
Could you help me out for my sake?

1112
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,790
Let's discuss this further in person.

1113
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,060
Okay.

1114
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,890
(The Art of Negotiation)

1115
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,760
{\an8}Can I ask you where you
spent 50 million dollars?

1116
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,860
{\an8}This is off.

1117
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,929
{\an8}We need to borrow the money
from somewhere and pay it back fast.

1118
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:56,959
{\an8}Do you think you can do it?

1119
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,099
{\an8}I'll take care of it.

1120
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,429
{\an8}If the tabloids start reporting that...

1121
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,760
{\an8}he doesn't even have 50 million dollars...

1122
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,499
{\an8}The stock price can plummet.

1123
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,929
{\an8}I bought a resort.

1124
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,500
{\an8}Are you seriously considering to sell it?

1125
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,370
{\an8}I believe we should.

1126
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,170
{\an8}I'm the owner of Unit 123.

1127
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,510
{\an8}You must be from Sanin.

1128
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,810
{\an8}You've been here for a year?

1129
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,220
{\an8}It turns out someone named
Song Ji O is the real owner.

1130
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,650
{\an8}Don't sell it.

1131
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,250
{\an8}Is there a reason I shouldn't?
