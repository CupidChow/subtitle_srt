1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,690
You.

2
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,290
Do you want to be a board member?

3
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,870
Why? Don't you want it?

4
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,050
If it's a registered member, then yes.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,420
I see. You want voting rights, is that it?

6
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,420
Yes.

7
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,560
I wish to be a member of the board.

8
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,730
No wonder you're an expert in negotiations.

9
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,140
Do you own hiking boots?

10
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,340
Is it true that Yoon Joo
No will be on the board?

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,650
Is this a done deal?

12
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,650
Yoon Joo No is going
hiking with the chairman.

13
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,790
To Mount Bukhan?

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Yes, Mount Bukhan.

15
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,930
What's significant about Mount Bukhan?

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,999
CEO Min, didn't you hike up Mount Bukhan...

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
before sitting on the board?

18
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,040
I joined the company as
a member of the board.

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,510
I see.

20
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,839
You were already one...

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
when Director Lee
offered you this position.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,310
You won't know of its significance, then.

23
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,250
So what's the big deal about Mount Bukhan?

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,190
Apparently, the chairman's
fate is tied to a lot of water.

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,789
The chairman's fate
is tied to a lot of water?

26
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,830
That's right.

27
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,459
Since too much water is around him,

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,630
he must change the flow of
the water to avoid bad luck.

29
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,100
However, that can't be
done with trees or soil.

30
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,269
Since trees rot when damaged by water,

31
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,040
and water washes soil away.

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Then what?

33
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,710
Rocks are what he must keep close.

34
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,680
So that's why he goes to Mount Bukhan.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,360
Mount Bukhan is all rocks, you see.

36
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,859
He must go there...

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,460
for the stars to align and bring him luck.

38
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,230
He even chooses an
auspicious day for the hike.

39
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,770
There's also steel.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,640
CEO Choi. With steel,
there's a risk of rust.

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,910
Rock and stone are the right option.

42
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,040
Right. Let's go.

43
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,120
You've been to his office before.

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,260
There's a grand suiseki
blocking the entrance.

45
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,530
It was placed there to
block the flow of water.

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,030
I see.

47
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,170
The chairman always voices
the importance of good health,

48
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,139
so I thought it was to test one's stamina.

49
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,979
The hike isn't just for
potential board members.

50
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,180
He always climbs up Mount
Bukhan to make important decisions.

51
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,920
You're right.

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,450
Yoon Joo No...

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,660
By the way, have we paid all our debt?

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,090
There's still some left.

55
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,430
Is that so? Tell me, then.

56
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,430
How much?

57
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,240
About 2.5 billion dollars, sir.

58
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,500
Really? Then,

59
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,240
- I guess we're almost done. - Yes, sir.

60
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,510
It's slippery here.

61
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,780
Come in.

62
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,660
These are hot.

63
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,030
Right. Thank you.

64
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,009
Hold on. Doesn't he give you a mission...

65
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,110
before letting you on the board?

66
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,480
Right. I wonder what it'll be.

67
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,920
Who knows?

68
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,190
There are a lot of tasks
he could give Yoon Joo No.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,060
Yoon Joo No's capability
isn't what anyone's questioning.

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,730
We're almost there.

71
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,770
Goodness.

72
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,040
Nice, isn't it?

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,390
As you grow older, the headaches get worse.

74
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,050
Do you know why?

75
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,360
Because...

76
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,430
you can see through people.

77
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,500
However, one can't point out
all the lies and ironies, can he?

78
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,140
Turning a blind eye is worse though.

79
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,710
Being able to see through
people gives me a headache,

80
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,350
but you're a mystery to me.

81
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,920
I have a country club in
North Chungcheong Province.

82
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,160
See if you can sell it.

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,800
Sure.

84
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,800
Good.

85
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,740
Mr. Chairman.

86
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,779
Why are you all out here?

87
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,510
What about your work?

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,149
Also... Goodness me.

89
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,950
I didn't think you'd
be this good at hiking.

90
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,759
Sir, it'll be a first to
have a team manager...

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,860
become a registered board member.

92
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,559
Get him something to eat before you go.

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,330
- Yes, sir. - I'll get going.

94
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,130
Let's go.

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
What did the chairman say?

96
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm to sell the country club in
North Chungcheong Province.

97
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,060
A country club?

98
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,960
I'll take a rain check on that meal.

99
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,360
Or maybe you two can enjoy it yourselves.

100
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,370
Hey!

101
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,510
Did the chairman tell
you to do anything else?

102
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,750
No. Selling the country
club is all that he mentioned.

103
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,680
You must've impressed the chairman.

104
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,990
Because he gave me an easier task?

105
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,850
Yes.

106
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,630
(Episode 9: The Direction)

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,530
{\an8}Come in.

108
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,200
{\an8}- Right. - Mr. Chairman.

109
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,410
{\an8}Sure. Have a seat.

110
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,910
- What is this about?
- I had something to say.

111
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,780
- Sure. Have a seat. - Thank you.

112
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,220
Go on.

113
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,230
It's nothing serious. I just
wanted to talk about Joo No.

114
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,599
He's still relatively young and
making the jump to director...

115
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,070
doesn't seem ideal.

116
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,430
Is this a formal complaint?

117
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,970
No, I'm not speaking for myself.

118
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,810
The other members of the
board might be uncomfortable.

119
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,640
Maybe it'd be wiser to
call a board meeting first.

120
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
And? If the directors veto the idea,

121
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,079
should I go back on my word?

122
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,420
No, of course not.

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,820
- Director Ha. - Yes?

124
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,520
This shouldn't be your concern right now.

125
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,060
As you know, we sold Sanin Construction.

126
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,560
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,430
I'm thinking about building
a new apartment complex.

128
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,840
- What's your take on that? - Sorry?

129
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,239
Why are you so shocked?

130
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,710
I can build apartment complexes
without breaking a sweat.

131
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,950
Yes, of course.

132
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,480
That's not something I doubt, sir.

133
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,150
However,

134
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,890
we sold the construction company.

135
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,949
Exactly. That's why...

136
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm suggesting we start anew.

137
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,459
We can't, sir.

138
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,990
There's a clause preventing us
from doing the same line of business.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,630
For how long?

140
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,970
I'll have to check to be sure,

141
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,330
but I believe it's five years.

142
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,300
Goodness. Is that so?

143
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,410
Look into another company, then.

144
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,380
We'll help it grow and buy it when we can.

145
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,040
Pardon?

146
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,520
Why? Won't it be possible?

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,920
By the way, who was that again?

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,460
What's he up to these days?

149
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
Who could you be referring to?

150
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,630
You know, the one who looks like this.

151
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Like this.

152
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,490
Get that out of here.

153
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,760
That too!

154
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,300
Hurry up.

155
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,930
Clear that side, will you?

156
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,100
Hey! Get that away!

157
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,010
Clear that already.

158
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,440
You! Hey, clear those away.

159
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,080
What now?

160
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,590
- Goodness. - Tae Soo!

161
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,050
My gosh.

162
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,220
It's been a while since
I saw you in a hard hat.

163
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,529
The macho Lee Hun Min.
It's a good look on you.

164
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,830
Tae Soo!

165
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,000
My gosh, you're being silly.

166
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,640
I see you're working hard.

167
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,209
How's GREEN VIEW Country Club?

168
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,010
The golf business isn't what it used to be.

169
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,910
That's right.

170
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,709
A lot of my friends
posted on social media...

171
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,250
that they got into golfing,

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,120
but I haven't heard much of it since then.

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,050
I'm guessing it suffered
a downturn in sales.

174
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,390
Director Kang shares that view.

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,390
We're now seeing what's
worth keeping and not.

176
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,959
According to the financial statements,

177
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,730
it's maintaining its earnings rate.

178
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,869
Compared to other country clubs,

179
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,070
GREEN VIEW is holding its ground.

180
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,570
That's a relief.

181
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,510
Although, we won't know the
details until we assess it ourselves.

182
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,310
Director Lee,

183
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,850
during the last board meeting,

184
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,950
I was asked who should be held responsible.

185
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,660
All that mounted stress...

186
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,130
I mean,

187
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,660
the travel and hotel
business isn't doing well,

188
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,700
so I let my temper get the best of me.

189
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,940
I apologize.

190
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,170
Goodness.

191
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,510
I didn't ask to see you
regarding that matter.

192
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,310
- Here. - Goodness.

193
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,090
Come to think of it,

194
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,759
I said something I shouldn't have that day.

195
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,020
Gosh, no.

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,290
Something must've come
over me. I'm such a fool.

197
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,470
Why is that loser back here?

198
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,410
Here.

199
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,410
These are playing stones for Go...

200
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,980
which I bought in China on a business trip.

201
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,580
These look expensive.

202
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,220
You love playing Go, sir.

203
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,850
Aren't these stunning?

204
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,860
Right. I appreciate the gift.

205
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,030
Anyway, I asked you here...

206
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,899
to talk to you about something.

207
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,930
Sure.

208
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,570
- Don't get the wrong idea. - Do tell, sir.

209
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,270
I'm afraid...

210
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,140
another subsidiary of
yours might have to be sold.

211
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,480
Sorry?

212
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,850
The country club is trying to be sold.

213
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,879
But sir, I mean it when I say
I've been trying to do better.

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,150
Gosh, no. This is why I said
you shouldn't get the wrong idea.

215
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,290
This is a test to see if Yoon Joo
No can make it as a board member,

216
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,260
so I ask for your assistance.

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,280
Are you sure there's no ulterior motive?

218
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,180
Of course not. Why would there be one?

219
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,250
(Lawyer Hall)

220
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
You there.

221
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,289
You can't leave the packages here.

222
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,319
Take them up.

223
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,959
I was going to take them all up at once.

224
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,190
Hurry up, then.

225
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm almost done.

226
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,070
What the...

227
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,970
Hey.

228
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,400
What about the order I put in?

229
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,940
It's ready.

230
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,640
I've been waiting for you.

231
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm almost there too.

232
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,180
How much progress have you made?

233
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,950
I'll be on the board.

234
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,820
I see. Okay.

235
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,760
But being on the board...

236
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,230
Aren't you interested in
getting a job elsewhere?

237
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Not really.

238
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,970
I need to get back in there.

239
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,570
I know.

240
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,710
But...

241
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,280
let's say you joined the board...

242
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,150
and requested the
case to be reinvestigated.

243
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,320
What if they object?

244
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,520
Then I'll know...

245
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,790
who's responsible.

246
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,680
Yes, Director Kang.

247
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,449
Mr. Yoon, it's about GREEN VIEW.

248
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,450
Someone's willing to buy it.

249
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,750
Already? That's good to hear.

250
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,190
I was hoping to see you
tomorrow. Are you free?

251
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,760
Yes, of course.

252
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,170
Mr. Yoon.

253
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,909
This is Choi Sung Il at Dream Securities.

254
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,970
I'm Choi Sung Il.

255
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,709
Greetings. I'm Yoon Joo No.

256
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,779
I heard a lot about
you, so it's a pleasure.

257
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,009
Right. One of our clients...

258
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,649
is interested in the country club business,

259
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,380
and GREEN VIEW owned by
Sanin seemed like the perfect fit.

260
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,720
And the client is suggesting
a deal on a no-name basis?

261
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,419
Our client reacts quite
sensitively to rumours.

262
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,630
- That's okay, right?
- Well, sure. Why not?

263
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,989
But what is the purpose of the acquisition?

264
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,759
Is it to run the country club?

265
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,460
Or is it for investment purposes?

266
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,069
They manage funds,

267
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,970
but they won't sell it.
They'll run it themselves.

268
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,070
Right, so you'd need to
replace the current CEO.

269
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,280
Just the CEO?

270
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,580
Yes.

271
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,609
As for the employees,
we'll keep all of them...

272
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,780
unless there's a problem with them.

273
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,620
Don't steal the good ones.

274
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Got it.

275
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,920
As for the value, how
much are you thinking?

276
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,620
Eighty million dollars
will be sufficient, right?

277
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,360
That isn't enough at all.

278
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,230
You're open to negotiating upwards, right?

279
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,530
Come on, Mr. Yoon.

280
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,239
Everyone knows that Sanin is
in urgent need of cash right now.

281
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,170
Besides, the golf industry...

282
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,570
isn't all that attractive anymore.

283
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,840
We already have plans
in place to raise the funds,

284
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,280
so we don't really need
to sell the country club.

285
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,780
For 11 billion dollars?

286
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,950
We're almost there.

287
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,990
We're wrapping up the project too.

288
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,760
Thank you.

289
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,360
You said you'd heard a lot about Mr. Yoon.

290
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,000
Then should we review it and let you know?

291
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Yes, let's do that.

292
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,680
- Thank you for coming today. - Thank you.

293
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,119
- So, you'll call us, right?
- Yes, we'll be in touch.

294
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,150
We'll talk soon.

295
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,500
I feel like I'm losing for some
reason, even though I'm buying it.

296
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
Everyone feels like that
after talking with Mr. Yoon.

297
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,770
People call him the
White Snake for a reason.

298
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,600
Hey, but 80 million? Seriously?

299
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,870
Hey, that is a generous offer.

300
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,570
Do you not have enough bullets?

301
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,209
I have more than enough bullets.

302
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,640
Should I go ahead and shoot you?

303
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,210
All right.

304
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,720
Hold on. Who's the client again?

305
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,120
I said they'd like to do
it on a no-name basis.

306
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,450
Oh, right. You said that. Got it.

307
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,820
What does a no-name basis mean?

308
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,030
No-name... It literally means...

309
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,260
they'll proceed with the deal
without revealing who the client is.

310
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,870
Can that be done?

311
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,230
It's actually quite common.

312
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,370
Let's say the buyer is a big company...

313
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,369
or really needs the company they're buying.

314
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,409
If such information is revealed,

315
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,880
the seller might ask for more money.

316
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I see.

317
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,280
Then will their name remain
a secret until the deal's over?

318
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,410
No.

319
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,780
Once we decide to sell it, they'll
have to reveal themselves too.

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,550
I see.

321
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,500
Hey, I heard you went to Mount Bukhan.

322
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
Yes.

323
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,640
I guess I'll see you
more often from now on.

324
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,980
The doors are closing.

325
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,130
Once you become a board member,

326
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,230
you'll have many questions.

327
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,100
If there's anything you want
to know, just ask me. Anytime.

328
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,770
Thank you.

329
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,700
Or we could have dinner
with Director Lee sometime.

330
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,640
Sure.

331
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,910
Let's go.

332
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Attorney Oh isn't here yet.

333
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,020
He'll meet us there.

334
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,590
At the country club?

335
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,290
He's originally from North
Chungcheong Province.

336
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,000
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

337
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,339
Soon Young really is perfect.

338
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,340
I know. He's good-looking
and has a good personality.

339
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,679
- On top of that, he's a prosecutor.
- Exactly.

340
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,910
I'm not a prosecutor.

341
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,910
He quit that job, you know.

342
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,279
Now, he's a lawyer at Sanin.

343
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,520
I know.

344
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,320
I hear they pay him even better.

345
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,019
Do you make a lot of money?

346
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,160
Then how come you're still not married yet?

347
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,490
I wonder too. It wasn't intentional.

348
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,559
He has high standards,
just like his father.

349
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,760
My goodness.

350
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,529
I guess your mom isn't going
to charge us for this meal today.

351
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,469
Soon Young, you have to
find a good woman for yourself.

352
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,699
Don't make the mistake your father made.

353
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,370
Goodness. Don't be ridiculous.

354
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,109
Thank goodness I had low standards for men.

355
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,840
If it weren't for me, Soon Young
wouldn't even have been born.

356
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,080
Oh, then I should thank my mom too.

357
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,449
Not your dad?

358
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,480
Well, I take after my dad.

359
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,850
Look at me.

360
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,850
- Yes. - You're right.

361
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,990
Oh Soon Young.

362
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,260
Bon Joo!

363
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,730
- Hey, it's been so long.
- Yes, it's been a while.

364
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,969
I heard you became a prosecutor.

365
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,030
- Yes. - He quit.

366
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,470
He's a lawyer at Sanin now.

367
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,540
Yes, thank you.

368
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,310
Yes, sit here.

369
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,280
I must say, being a
prosecutor doesn't suit you.

370
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,850
Right?

371
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,949
Anyway, how are things with you?

372
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,749
Me? Pretty good.

373
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,350
I work at a country club.

374
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,690
- You do? - Yes.

375
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,390
- My gosh. It's been so long.
- Hey, Soon Young!

376
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,090
Hey, class president. It's been so long.

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,860
Hey, long time no see.

378
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,759
Hey, do you not recognize me?

379
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
- Hey. Of course, I remember you.
- Look at that.

380
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,740
My goodness. How long has it been? Hey.

381
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,699
Oh, I guess you guys came here
because you heard I was here.

382
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,239
What? No.

383
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,540
We came here to eat and saw you.

384
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,709
Mother! Three servings
of soft tofu stew, please!

385
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,410
Can't you order something more expensive?

386
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,280
I've spent my entire paycheck.

387
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,050
Soft tofu stew, three
servings. Make it extra tasty.

388
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,949
What's this? Didn't you
come here to see me...

389
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,220
because you heard I was here?

390
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,919
I'm hungry. Let's eat first and catch up.

391
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,060
I'm starving.

392
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,290
Fine. I hope you pig
out and get indigestion.

393
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,759
- I'll sue you. - Sure, I'm a lawyer.

394
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,800
Fine.

395
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,570
Your mom bragged to
everyone that you were coming.

396
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,539
She did?

397
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,770
You'll have a drink with us, right?

398
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,010
Sorry. I have to work.

399
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,180
Let's get together soon for a drink.

400
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,750
- I'm done being friends with you.
- Goodness. Thanks.

401
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,420
Hey, Jin Soo.

402
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,220
Hello, Attorney Oh. We're on our way now.

403
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,060
We're almost there, but I'm starving now.

404
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,490
But right now...

405
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,100
I don't think you guys can come here now.

406
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,830
Why not?

407
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,370
Many of the neighbours are here now.

408
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What?

409
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,470
It must be very popular.
Should we wait in line?

410
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,770
No, it's not about the restaurant.

411
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,380
Many GREEN VIEW employees are here now.

412
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,750
We don't want rumours going
around about the company selling it.

413
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,550
I see.

414
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,850
I'll meet you guys by the main road.

415
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,250
Okay.

416
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,660
Attorney Oh will meet us by the main road.

417
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Okay.

418
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,600
Mom, I'm off.

419
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,870
Where are you going? Have
some tofu before you go.

420
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,500
- Where are you going? - I'm sorry.

421
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,070
Something urgent has come
up at work, so I have to go.

422
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,440
Let's get together soon for a drink.

423
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,649
- Hey, you should eat.
- We have all this food left.

424
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,180
I'm sorry. It's very urgent.

425
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,349
I'll call you guys.

426
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,680
- Okay. - We hope all goes well.

427
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,850
Mom, I'm sorry.

428
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,150
Gosh, you.

429
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,190
- Bye. - Bye.

430
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,220
All of my close friends work at GREEN VIEW.

431
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,990
It is your hometown.

432
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,660
Yes. There aren't any big companies here.

433
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,529
Then what will happen to your friends...

434
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,200
once the country club gets sold?

435
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,500
The buyer plans to run it themselves,

436
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,040
so they'll all get to keep their jobs.

437
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,470
Right, although there will be a new CEO.

438
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,140
They'll just replace the CEO?

439
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,410
They're interested in buying
GREEN VIEW because it's doing well.

440
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,919
If the CEO is getting
fired for doing a good job,

441
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,220
that's not fair. Don't you agree?

442
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,390
Yes, it is unfair.

443
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,720
I'll never be a CEO.

444
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,790
I'll never make you a CEO.

445
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,730
I mean, I don't understand
what's good about being a CEO.

446
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,399
Even the executives.
They all seem anxious...

447
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,100
about losing their positions,

448
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,070
but I don't think they do any work.

449
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,470
Right.

450
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,070
For them, it's all about politics.

451
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,810
Exactly.

452
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,110
I think it's better to be
just a line-level employee.

453
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,520
But if you aren't an executive,
you will get fired eventually.

454
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,290
Right.

455
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,390
If this goes well,

456
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,430
I'll become one of them.

457
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,270
Congratulations, Mr. Yoon.

458
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Congratulations.

459
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,680
- Congratulations - Congratulations

460
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,010
- Congratulations - Congratulations

461
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,290
- Congratulations on your promotion
- Congratulations on your promotion

462
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,110
The CEO will get angry too, right?

463
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,510
Jin Soo.

464
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,550
You won't get all worked up
again and swear at them, right?

465
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,350
Look at me. Let's rehearse.

466
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,950
I'll hold back this time.

467
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,930
Hello. Mr. Yoon Joo No, right?

468
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,430
Hello. You must be Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

469
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,760
I am Yoon Joo No.

470
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,160
Nice to meet you.

471
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,529
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

472
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,440
We'll talk over a cup of tea.

473
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,950
I must say,

474
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,580
the vibe isn't bad.

475
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,950
Agreed.

476
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,920
Please come on in.

477
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,520
You can sit here.

478
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,860
No, you should sit there.

479
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,960
My goodness. Please, take a seat.

480
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Sure.

481
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,730
Please sit here.

482
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Oh, my.

483
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,839
When I saw the four
of you arriving together,

484
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,550
I thought you came to play.

485
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,179
Sorry, we aren't here as your customers.

486
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,420
Gosh, don't say that.

487
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,250
I didn't mean to say I was disappointed.

488
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,750
Let's sit down.

489
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,390
Sure.

490
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,210
The head office gave me a heads-up.

491
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,740
So, I hear the company
wants to sell the country club.

492
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Yes.

493
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:11,950
It hasn't been decided yet,

494
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,350
but Sanin is struggling
financially at the moment,

495
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,620
so the company has no
choice but to sell what it can.

496
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,790
Right.

497
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,660
I understand.

498
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,030
Then...

499
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,160
will the country club be shut down?

500
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
No.

501
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,830
The company that takes over will run it.

502
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,700
So, the employees will all be transferred,

503
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,740
but we'd like to keep it
from the employees...

504
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,440
until the decision becomes finalized.

505
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,909
Hearing about it now...

506
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,980
could shake up the employees.

507
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Right.

508
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,519
I understand.

509
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,960
And if there's anything you
need to tell us, do tell us now.

510
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,129
The buyer will thoroughly
inspect the premises...

511
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,760
to assess the value of the business.

512
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,030
Things will become complicated
if problems are discovered then.

513
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,840
The business isn't doing
so well. But other than that,

514
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,270
there are no problems.

515
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,610
But isn't it doing pretty well
compared to other country clubs?

516
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,180
I have been working hard.

517
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,720
Anyway, I'm glad to hear that the
country club won't be shut down.

518
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,090
I thought I was getting fired.

519
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,660
The company that's interested in
buying GREEN VIEW Country Club...

520
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,400
wants a new CEO.

521
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,370
So, I can't keep the position?

522
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,079
It is the prospective
buyer's mandatory condition,

523
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,340
so that won't be easy.

524
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,449
However, you could transfer...

525
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,350
to another subsidiary of Sanin,

526
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,320
or we could help you find a
position at a different company.

527
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,490
The deal could also fall through, right?

528
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,690
Yes, that's also possible.

529
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,430
Then...

530
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,530
can I take some time to think about this?

531
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,900
To figure out what I should do.

532
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,310
I'd need to talk to my wife about it too.

533
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,280
Yes, take your time.

534
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,980
Just let us know during
the due diligence process.

535
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,490
Then may I take it that you
will cooperate with due diligence,

536
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,050
Mr. Lee?

537
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,060
Well, I have no choice.

538
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,930
Oh, hello.

539
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,100
Oh, Ms. Jeong.

540
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,140
Hello.

541
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,380
This is Ms. Jeong, our financial manager.

542
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,280
She takes care of GREEN
VIEW's housekeeping.

543
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,180
She's the one I turn to
when I have any questions.

544
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,090
I'm flattered.

545
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,890
Do you two know each other?

546
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,530
Yes, we've been friends since childhood.

547
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,400
I'm originally from here.

548
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,370
I see.

549
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,180
Get back safely, then.

550
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,910
Thank you. We'll wait to hear from you.

551
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,190
Take care.

552
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,360
They're from the head office, right?

553
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,500
Yes.

554
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,130
They came to do an inspection.

555
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,170
Let's go back inside.

556
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,340
I feel bad for Mr. Lee.

557
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,310
I understand how you feel, Jin Soo.

558
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,580
But with these things, it's better
to be honest and tell him the facts.

559
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Pardon?

560
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,330
You say you feel bad for him,

561
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,300
but what you really
mean is that you pity him.

562
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,230
Pity isn't exactly...

563
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,530
the kind of emotion...

564
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,870
we should feel toward
the CEO of this place.

565
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,680
It'd help him to know
exactly what's going on...

566
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,480
so he can figure out his next move.

567
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,880
That's true, but it's not really fair.

568
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
If Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek was a good CEO,

569
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,070
his accomplishments as
a CEO will be recognized.

570
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,440
Although, we don't know
when or how that will happen.

571
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,659
Doesn't that mean...

572
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,300
he might not get a proper
evaluation his whole life?

573
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,160
Yes.

574
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,400
What then?

575
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,840
What would you do in
that situation, Mr. Yoon?

576
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,640
Let's see.

577
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,640
I would...

578
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,480
do as I always have.

579
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,250
- Aren't you? - Exactly.

580
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,980
(Junior Managing Director Lee Dong Joon)

581
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,460
Director Cho. What brings you here?

582
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,960
I have a question.

583
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,160
For me?

584
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,730
Yes.

585
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,340
Since I'm in HR, I only need
to focus on human resources.

586
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,080
But due to the affiliate
company CEOs' different stances,

587
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,450
the company's atmosphere has
recently become overly intense.

588
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,620
Everyone's on edge.

589
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,680
True.

590
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,020
They must be very worried
as the company's situation...

591
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,619
is not that good at the moment.

592
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,630
Exactly.

593
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,630
It's at times like these that
we should help each other out.

594
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,570
You see...

595
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,540
I find Mr. Yoon quite unfriendly,

596
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,240
but everything he says is right.

597
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,280
What stops me from
taking his side is that...

598
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,980
you never know who'll get fired.

599
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,280
I see.

600
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,890
Mr. Yoon is simply doing his job.

601
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,589
You know the current
situation of the company.

602
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,630
Of course.

603
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,500
Someone will lose their job.

604
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,770
Although, as the HR manager,

605
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,170
I've nothing to do with M and A.

606
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,680
Well, of course not.

607
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,510
Our stance is different from that...

608
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,550
of the affiliate company CEOs.

609
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,290
Mr. Yoon seems to be the stubborn type,

610
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,560
but he minds his manners, doesn't he?

611
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,300
He does.

612
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,230
Once he joins the board of directors,

613
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,570
he'll become more flexible.

614
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,640
Right? I think so too.

615
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,610
- Weren't you going home? - I was.

616
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,640
Director Choi.

617
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,810
We're selling the country club.

618
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,180
Do you want to sign an MOU first?

619
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,020
The buyer will be there in person, yes?

620
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,050
Yes, of course.

621
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,820
But he wants to meet at the country club.

622
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
At GREEN VIEW?

623
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,399
Yes.

624
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,530
He's an impatient man and
wants to see the country club.

625
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,100
All right. Let's do that.

626
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,940
We'll meet at the country club.

627
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,980
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

628
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,520
No, don't worry.

629
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,389
The MOU for GREEN
VIEW will be signed tomorrow,

630
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,960
and the inspection will begin.

631
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
It's a relief that...

632
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,030
a buyer turned up right away.

633
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,700
Yes.

634
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,740
You simply have to
ensure there are no hiccups.

635
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,870
What else is there to talk about?

636
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,310
When this deal goes through,
I'll join the board of directors.

637
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,380
I'm wondering what the
existing directors think about that.

638
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,280
You think they'll bully you?

639
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,920
What you're currently doing...

640
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,890
is cutting out Sanin's wounds.

641
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,760
The chairman basically
complimented you on your job.

642
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,370
It's a big deal among the directors.

643
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,370
But...

644
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,710
the current situation
isn't working against you.

645
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,610
Just do your job as you always have.

646
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,980
- Understood. - Good.

647
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,530
- Director Cho. - Good evening.

648
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,770
Gosh. You've gotten much better at it.

649
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,170
Aren't you good at golfing?

650
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,439
I only golf every once in a while for fun.

651
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
I see.

652
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:48,680
But something came up, so
I'm practising after a long time.

653
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,750
Right.

654
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,390
After all, business requires playing golf.

655
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,890
We should play a round of golf together.

656
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,820
Right. We should.

657
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh, no.

658
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,670
Your shoulders are quite stiff today.

659
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,430
It seems like it.

660
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,570
What is it? Is something bothering you?

661
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,940
Me? No, not really.

662
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,210
When it comes to golf,

663
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,950
you don't win just by
hitting the ball farther.

664
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,180
The key is the direction.

665
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,090
Keep a consistent direction,

666
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,560
and you'll win.

667
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
I see.

668
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,960
I hope you're like that, Director Cho.

669
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Well...

670
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,099
Allow me to be frank with you.

671
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,270
Okay. Go ahead.

672
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,970
How about...

673
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,810
getting along with Mr. Yoon?

674
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,750
- Sorry? - I was thinking...

675
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,050
it'd be nice if you thought better of him.

676
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,780
We'll often see him from now on.

677
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,490
I see.

678
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,619
So you're on that side.

679
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,230
Gosh, no. It's not about which side I'm on.

680
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,260
Honestly, our company...

681
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,959
doesn't listen to the directors' opinions.

682
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,730
And it's not like we own many shares.

683
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,470
The chairman's approval is all we need.

684
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Okay.

685
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,310
I didn't know...

686
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,610
you were such a romantic person.

687
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,310
Sorry?

688
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,150
Wait...

689
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,060
Be careful on your way.

690
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,970
Romantic, my foot.

691
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,120
Mr. Kim. Are you outside?

692
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,889
I'm dining out with my family right now.

693
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,750
Then, I must've interrupted your time.

694
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,660
No, it's all right.

695
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,460
I need to talk to you.

696
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,160
Are you free later in the night?

697
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,430
Yes.

698
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,630
Now then...

699
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,400
Let's meet at our regular
Japanese restaurant.

700
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,070
I'll call again after making a reservation.

701
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,379
Enjoy your dinner with your family.

702
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
Okay. That sounds good.

703
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,689
My apologies when you were talking.

704
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,690
It was a call from home.

705
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,190
Right.

706
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,330
Where did I leave off?

707
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,430
Let's see. About Go.

708
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,700
You said it was fun and that
I should learn how to play.

709
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,610
That was all meaningless talk.

710
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,980
What I want to say is...

711
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,109
- Yes? - We're preparing...

712
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,080
for e-commerce, right?

713
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Yes.

714
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,190
But we won't be hiring outsiders.

715
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,689
I'm well aware of how well you've been...

716
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,990
managing Sanin Mart.

717
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,630
Thank you.

718
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,400
And I'll assist you in making
our e-commerce successful.

719
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
No.

720
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,070
I'll be resigning.

721
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,610
How come?

722
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,870
Is it because...

723
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,840
of Mr. Yoon becoming a director?

724
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,550
No. My point is that...

725
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,850
you should be in charge of it.

726
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,850
No way. It's your project, isn't it?

727
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,960
I should quit, with how old I am.

728
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,890
What about Mr. Yoon?

729
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,900
Mr. Yoon...

730
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,860
has no plan to stay in Sanin forever.

731
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,270
I see.

732
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,770
So, taking over e-commerce...

733
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,040
will be your golden chance.

734
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,380
Gosh.

735
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,520
Because I had no idea,

736
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,920
I was...

737
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,259
quite disappointed.

738
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,290
Right.

739
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,960
But to think there was a bigger picture.

740
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,400
May I take it that...

741
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,430
you're okay with e-commerce?

742
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,740
Of course.

743
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,770
In the end, e-commerce is distribution.

744
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,740
- Yes, it is. - Right.

745
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,580
- I'd like a glass. - Sure.

746
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,980
(Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo)

747
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,690
You can take the call.

748
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,260
It's all right. My family
needed me to grab something.

749
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,570
- Stop the car. - Yes, sir.

750
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,050
These jerks are putting
their minds to work.

751
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,850
Mr. Lee.

752
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,560
We won't have enough people tomorrow.

753
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,490
Yes. You should bring one more party.

754
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,760
Yes. Good.

755
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,930
Director Choi. We've arrived.

756
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,670
Right, Mr. Yoon.

757
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,609
We arrived hours ago...

758
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,110
and are now on the golf course.

759
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,640
I see.

760
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,210
We'll be waiting in the lobby.

761
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,709
But it'll take a while.

762
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,980
How about coming out
here? I'll send a caddie over.

763
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,760
Why don't we sign it next time?

764
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,389
No. The CEO feels bad about it...

765
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,800
and wants to meet and sign the MOU today.

766
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,500
Isn't this wrong?

767
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,540
It totally is.

768
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,210
Even if the buyer has the upper hand,

769
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,680
this is crossing the line.

770
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,720
Let's go.

771
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,810
The road ahead is rough.

772
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,040
Please hold onto the safety bar.

773
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,320
Good shot!

774
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,999
My apologies for making
you come all the way here.

775
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
This way, please.

776
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,840
We shouldn't disturb the tee shot.

777
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,410
Nice shot!

778
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,150
Oh, gosh. It's been a while, Mr. Yoon.

779
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,960
- Right. - You two are acquainted, yes?

780
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,830
Didn't you know that I was
the one buying this club?

781
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,700
I see.

782
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,470
We're in your care.

783
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,040
No, I'm the one in your care.

784
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,800
Let me buy it at a cheap price.

785
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,609
How about stopping the game here?

786
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,710
No way.

787
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,550
I'm winning right now.

788
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,050
Tae Soo. Don't you see
that Mr. Yoon is about to cry?

789
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,390
Don't get the wrong idea.

790
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,689
Mr. Lee and I are close friends.

791
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,729
Even after he resigned, we kept in touch...

792
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,860
and even played golf together.

793
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,030
But this guy.

794
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,869
He wanted me to tag along...

795
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,829
to check out the country club...

796
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,040
he was looking to buy.

797
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,440
You must've known we were trying...

798
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,939
to sell the country club.

799
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,410
That's why I'm telling
you not to misunderstand.

800
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,580
I only found out when I got here.

801
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,310
Really.

802
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,020
Here comes Mr. Lee.

803
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,949
Making a deal with him will be easy...

804
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,190
with his direct personality.

805
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,759
If he doesn't listen to you, tell me.

806
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
A word from me, and he'll give in.

807
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,800
All right. Now then, I'll let you two talk.

808
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,899
- I'm leaving.
- Already? What about our drinks?

809
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,470
Come on, Mr. Lee.

810
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,609
It's a waste if you
drink after working out.

811
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,070
Or we should've skipped golfing.

812
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,580
Aren't I right?

813
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,980
Mr. Yoon.

814
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,350
Becoming a director isn't easy, is it?

815
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,700
- Take care. - Bye.

816
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,639
Gosh.

817
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,440
I feel light after working
out for the first time in ages.

818
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,140
It's light as a feather.

819
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,849
Mr. Lee. Is there a reason...

820
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,220
you're proceeding with this
deal on a no-name basis?

821
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,460
I do.

822
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,730
It's due to the fear of
information leaking...

823
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,960
and someone manipulating the stock price.

824
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,370
Right. That's a possibility.

825
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,770
And you're sincerely
interested in the acquisition?

826
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,210
I am.

827
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,739
Aren't we signing the paper today?

828
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,740
We are.

829
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,130
Thank you.

830
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,930
We'll give it back after reviewing it.

831
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,700
Are you still an intern?

832
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,510
Yes.

833
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,950
It's about that, right?

834
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,110
Our deal is confidential,

835
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,979
and no falsifying of documents.

836
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,020
Yes, sir.

837
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,920
I'm sure you covered all
corners with the contract.

838
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:04,990
After all,

839
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,860
it was handled by the
best law firm in Korea.

840
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,470
Attorney Oh. What are you
checking so thoroughly now?

841
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,640
- Are you afraid I might scam you? - Wait.

842
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,660
After you review it, give it back to him.

843
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,700
- Okay. - Yes, I'll take care of it.

844
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,700
All right then.

845
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,700
Let's conduct due diligence.

846
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,840
Which cohort were you in?

847
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,910
I was in Cohort 42.

848
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,850
I see.

849
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,890
I was in Cohort 38. My name is Kang Min Ho.

850
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,420
I'm Oh Soon Young.

851
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,440
Will you go through with this deal?

852
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,270
I must. Nothing is stopping me.

853
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,380
Let's make no mistakes.

854
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Yes, sir.

855
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,530
Ms. Kwak. Could you review the documents?

856
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,269
I'll check the documents...

857
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,270
related to financial statements
going back ten years.

858
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,440
- Ten years? - Yes.

859
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:01,869
The retention period for
accounting-related documents...

860
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,480
is ten years.

861
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,350
Here are the files for
financial statements from 2015.

862
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,180
Here you go. They're from 2016.

863
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,420
Okay.

864
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,620
But when will you finish
reviewing all these?

865
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,990
Pretty soon.

866
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,320
Jin Soo. Could you check the field?

867
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,890
Yes, I'll start tomorrow.

868
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,140
- It's been a while.
- My gosh, yes. It's been a while.

869
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,080
You, Intern. Let's grab
a meal. Come with me.

870
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,520
- No. It's okay. - Come with me.

871
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,790
Enjoy your meal.

872
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,600
Excuse me.

873
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,700
What are you doing?

874
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,340
Well...

875
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,169
I'm drawing.

876
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,309
Once we begin conducting due diligence,

877
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,440
the employees are bound to feel insecure.

878
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Right. I'll explain that to them.

879
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,179
Some of your friends
work at the country club.

880
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,320
Are you sure?

881
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,520
That's why it will be better if I do it.

882
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,820
The country club will be acquired
by a foreign fund company.

883
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,259
A former CEO of Sanin's subsidiary,

884
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,100
Mr. Lee Hun Min, is the buyer.

885
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,830
He plans to run the country
club himself after the acquisition.

886
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,270
As he used to work for Sanin,
I'm sure he'll be highly dedicated.

887
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,040
He seemed too scary.

888
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,210
You already met him.

889
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,310
What if he fires us?

890
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,480
No.

891
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,780
The country club will continue to operate.

892
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,550
The buyer set employee
succession as part of his terms.

893
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,080
He says that now. But
what if he still fires us?

894
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,249
No. If he dismisses the
majority of the employees,

895
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,220
running the country club will be difficult.

896
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,860
If that was his plan, buying
the country club would be moot.

897
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,830
He wants to make a profit.

898
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,029
Actually, Sanin Group failed...

899
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,370
to take the initiative to invest
in GREEN VIEW Country Club.

900
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,629
Once a new company
acquires the country club,

901
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,170
investments can be more
robust with new investors.

902
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,909
Furthermore, I'm sure employee benefits...

903
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,210
will improve a lot compared to now.

904
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,140
We will see to it that
these conditions are met...

905
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,110
as a requirement of the sale.

906
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,849
Please read the document in front of you.

907
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,520
If you have any questions, please ask me.

908
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,120
Do you want to get a drink after work?

909
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,560
- Cheers. - Cheers.

910
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,900
Oh, right.

911
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,340
By the way, did you know that
you were the one who taught me...

912
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,080
how to drink?

913
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,879
- I did? - Really?

914
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,210
- Really? - Yes.

915
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,219
It was in the village hall. We
secretly drank the ginseng wine.

916
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,779
Then we filled it up with water.

917
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,920
Oh, was it that day?

918
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,489
Yes.

919
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,690
Back then, I didn't have
any tolerance for alcohol.

920
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,760
I passed out after a few
drinks. And when I woke up,

921
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,360
I saw you begging for forgiveness.

922
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,930
Right. I also had to pay it back.

923
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,569
My gosh. Everyone was at fault.

924
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,239
But you said you would
take the fall for everyone...

925
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,470
and take responsibility for it.

926
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,770
Good grief.

927
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,740
Do you know what your
nickname was after that incident?

928
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,210
I don't know.

929
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,980
Bon Joo of Justice.

930
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,749
- Bon Joo. - My gosh.

931
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,780
- Bon Joo. - Here.

932
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,430
By the way,

933
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,090
how did we get caught?

934
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,830
- It was because of Moon Jin. - Yes?

935
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,030
Moon Jin confessed
because she didn't want to lie.

936
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,440
Right.

937
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,500
What's she up to now?

938
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,840
She's well.

939
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,140
She also works at the club. She's a caddie.

940
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,480
What?

941
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,450
- I didn't see her at the club.
- She's taking a break.

942
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,920
I see. Is that so?

943
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,420
By the way, is everything
you said earlier true?

944
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,689
Of course, it's true.

945
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,720
Then...

946
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,160
no one is getting fired, right?

947
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,300
Right. No one is getting fired.

948
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,030
Wait. But a new CEO will take over.

949
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,770
The acquirer wants to run it himself.

950
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,740
The current CEO will probably
be transferred to a subsidiary.

951
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,640
Alternatively, he will resign with
a generous severance package.

952
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,880
That's it for the CEO?

953
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,210
Yes. Probably.

954
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,149
The KTX train bound for
Gwangju Songjeong Station...

955
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,150
will depart soon.

956
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,389
If you purchased a ticket,

957
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,859
please get on the train at Platform Ten.

958
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,860
Thank you.

959
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:49,390
Attention. The KTX...

960
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,560
I think this is it for me.

961
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,040
Would you like me to look into
another position at a subsidiary?

962
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,610
No.

963
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:04,740
I know that Sanin Group isn't doing well.

964
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,310
I'm worried that if I accept the transfer,

965
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,150
I might be taking over
someone else's position.

966
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,790
It seems only right that I resign.

967
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,990
Or I can help you get a
position in our partner's company.

968
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,230
No.

969
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,600
I'd like to rest now.

970
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,870
Is there a reason behind your decision?

971
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,580
Actually, I live here alone
when my family is abroad.

972
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,180
My son and my wife are in the States.

973
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,250
I want to live with my family now.

974
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,060
This is a photo of my son and my wife.

975
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,170
So your wife works with flowers.

976
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
Yes.

977
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,580
My son got into New York University.

978
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,850
The university's tuition fee is exorbitant.

979
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,450
The money I sent over wasn't enough.

980
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,050
She works part-time at a
flower shop to help pay the bills.

981
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,260
The CEO of the company...

982
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,690
asked her if she was
interested in buying the company.

983
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,970
But we're short on cash.

984
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,540
How much capital do you need?

985
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,440
I saved up some money over the years.

986
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,080
I need about one million dollars.

987
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,720
Your hard work for the
country club is recognized.

988
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,689
But offering you a severance package...

989
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,760
exceeding the Sanin's internal
regulations will be difficult.

990
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,960
As you know, the company
isn't in good shape financially.

991
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,270
I see.

992
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,070
However, once our due
diligence ends favourably,

993
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:14,340
we'll have a chance to discuss
your severance package.

994
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,380
I'll see what I can do
when that time comes.

995
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,190
Ball!

996
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,590
Hey.

997
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,800
- Come here. - Pardon?

998
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,330
Is the course set up properly?

999
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,830
Don't you think the design is off?

1000
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,210
I just think you messed up your shot.

1001
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,010
- What? - What's that?

1002
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,649
The golf course was mapped
out by BA Golf Design.

1003
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,680
It was also selected as the
best golf course in Korea in 2019.

1004
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,420
And our customers
are quite satisfied with it.

1005
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,090
But still. Shouldn't the
green be over there?

1006
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,490
Sir.

1007
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:10,060
There must be a 20m gap between courses...

1008
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,900
for safety issues.

1009
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,670
So if it was designed
based on your suggestion,

1010
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,800
it will be illegal.

1011
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,780
Okay.

1012
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,450
Five, six...

1013
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,930
Thirty-eight.

1014
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,660
See?

1015
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,600
There are only 38 carts.

1016
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,070
It says here that...

1017
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,040
there should be 52 carts.

1018
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,040
Were you trying to deceive me on purpose?

1019
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,370
No, sir.

1020
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,410
Some carts are out on the field right now.

1021
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,450
Then...

1022
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,780
how many carts are out on the field now?

1023
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,450
It's 14, sir.

1024
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,390
All right. One more cart is coming in.

1025
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,460
Now, there are 13 carts out.

1026
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,290
Please watch out. The cart is coming in.

1027
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,240
Should I go outside and count?

1028
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,510
There's no need.

1029
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Please take a look at this.

1030
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:31,040
You can check the carts through our system.

1031
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:33,910
Fine.

1032
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,550
But the carts are way too worn down.

1033
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,950
Right. That was already
factored into the depreciation cost.

1034
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,120
My gosh.

1035
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,620
You are all working very hard.

1036
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,530
Learn from them. Okay?

1037
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,260
Yes, sir.

1038
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,450
This was exhausting.

1039
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,220
I hated that.

1040
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,050
But I think it ended well for us.

1041
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,620
My friend, you think it's over?

1042
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,420
We must go back to the
office and get back to work.

1043
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
Let's go.

1044
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,560
- We must work. - Let's go.

1045
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,600
Ms. Kwak. To the right.

1046
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,630
I had never imagined that the
buyer would be Mr. Lee Hun Min.

1047
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,100
He was offered a position
in a foreign fund company.

1048
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,669
It's a small company,

1049
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,470
so the details about
their funds are limited.

1050
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,779
But Sung Il hid that from me...

1051
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,980
and asked me to introduce you to him.

1052
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,550
I'm not sure. But I couldn't
care less about that.

1053
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,390
Rather, could you check
if his intention is genuine,

1054
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,190
he plans to run the country club,

1055
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,630
and can guarantee employee succession?

1056
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,830
Sure. I'll look into those things.

1057
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:31,960
Okay.

1058
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,070
I'm sorry.

1059
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,100
I really had no idea.

1060
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,170
I believe you.

1061
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,340
- Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bye.

1062
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,660
Yes, Ms. Kwak.

1063
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,190
Mr. Yoon, you'll need to
come back to the office now.

1064
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,900
Is something wrong?

1065
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,130
The numbers don't add up.

1066
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,970
Go on.

1067
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,280
What happened?

1068
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,909
There was a withdrawal of
100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

1069
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,250
But they weren't accounted for.

1070
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,620
- In cash? - Yes.

1071
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,920
Withdrawals must be approved
by CEO Lee Hyeong Taek, right?

1072
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,260
Yes. And there is one more
person who can approve of it.

1073
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,200
Thank you. Bye.

1074
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,440
Number 118.

1075
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,239
- Hello. - Hello.

1076
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,480
- How can I help you?
- I'm here to make a withdrawal.

1077
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,750
- How much? - All of it.

1078
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,490
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo?

1079
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:01,950
Yes.

1080
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:04,190
You want to withdraw everything in cash?

1081
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,490
Yes.

1082
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,860
(The Art of Negotiation)

1083
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,559
{\an8}Selling GREEN VIEW
Country Club is our top priority.

1084
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,030
{\an8}My arm was injured
because the cart tipped over.

1085
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,870
{\an8}I don't have it. I spent it all.

1086
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,969
{\an8}Will the value be depreciated
if embezzlement is involved?

1087
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:28,140
{\an8}How many years of imprisonment
for one million dollars?

1088
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,370
{\an8}What a hot mess.

1089
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:31,510
{\an8}You must be on your way out.

1090
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,710
{\an8}Are you suspecting me?

1091
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,050
{\an8}How about Yoon Joo
No? Is he doing a good job?

1092
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:40,120
{\an8}Please entrust me with it.
I'll grow the business well.

1093
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,249
{\an8}You managed the fund separately.

1094
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,960
{\an8}That's also embezzlement.

1095
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,790
{\an8}I can't possibly work with people
who committed embezzlement.

1096
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,829
{\an8}He requested that all
country club employees...

1097
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,090
{\an8}be dismissed.
