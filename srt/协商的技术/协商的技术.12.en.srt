00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,940
- Have you tried it a lot? - My gosh.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,279
- Really? - Wait.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,249
- You've been here often?
- This is so good.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,379
- Hey, we're going to line up.
- Why isn't the line moving?

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,850
- I should lose weight. - Seriously.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,619
- We should get some for to-go.
- You stay out.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,690
Mr. Lee.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,330
Oh, my.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,700
How have you been?

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,460
Well, you know...

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,530
Are you still working for the same company?

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
Well...

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,310
What was the name of the company?

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,909
- It's GOGO Consulting. - Right.

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,540
- That's the one. GOGO. - Yes.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Why don't we talk?

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,350
Sure. Well...

26
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,220
Excuse me for a second.
Get me suyuk, will you?

27
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,320
Seriously? The name of the company is GOGO?

28
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,730
Is it a nightclub?

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,729
I don't think you can show
your face around Yeouido.

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,760
What?

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,570
This town is filled with con artists.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,330
I'm considered a straight guy in this town.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,239
Even so, you got caught.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,270
Exactly.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,310
I shouldn't have gotten caught like you.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,550
Word is...

37
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,450
you're still running your game.

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,150
My gosh. You must have lost your mind.

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,920
Who told you that?

40
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,590
Yet, you're not denying it.

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,690
Hey.

42
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,800
I can bankroll it.

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
Do you want to play a hand together?

44
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,840
You're unbelievable.

45
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,040
- You haven't learned your lesson. - Right.

46
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,240
I made so much money that
I can't come to my senses.

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,850
How much do you have?

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,020
Well,

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,990
I've got some.

(Episode 12: The Game)

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,540
{\an8}All right.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,740
{\an8}Mr. Yoon.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,110
{\an8}You're also admitting that you own
JUMBO Pharma's shares, correct?

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,880
Yes,

55
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,650
I am.

56
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,430
I was trying to do you a favour.

57
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,160
But you turned it down.

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,639
(Sanin)

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,740
You must not know what
I'm holding in my hand.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,680
I know exactly what it is.

61
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,680
And you must have more evidence.

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,810
Mr. Yoon.

63
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,990
That's enough.

64
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,820
Let me tell you.

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,589
This proves that Yoon Joo No was...

66
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,390
directly involved in manipulating
JUMBO's stock price.

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,560
He owned ten times the
number of shares his brother did.

68
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,240
With that many shares, he
did more than just participate.

69
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,270
He was the leader of this operation.

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,040
Director Ha.

71
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,810
Mr. Chair.

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
It's too soon to jump to conclusions.

73
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,910
Then what?

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,650
Should we hand him over to the FSS?

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,450
Or the prosecution? Should we
ask them for a second opinion?

76
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,850
Listen.

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,189
This isn't the time for
you to protect your pride.

78
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,260
You must accept your mistake and bow down.

79
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,760
We're just trying to help
you with good intentions.

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm simply answering the
questions I've been asked.

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,170
Please continue.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,899
We're not here...

83
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,910
to determine whether or
not you committed a crime.

84
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,480
The purpose of our meeting is
to decide the disciplinary action.

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,040
Accept the disciplinary action.

86
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,580
If you disagree with our decision,
you can seek legal representation.

87
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,650
Let's take a short recess.

88
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,319
A short recess for what?

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,220
We should just finish the meeting.
And we'll be free to rest then.

90
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,620
Let's take a break.

91
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,770
Fine. All right. Let's
all have a cup of coffee.

92
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Okay.

93
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
(Sanin)

94
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,080
What's gotten into him?

95
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,180
He must be out of it.

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,450
- You think so? - Yes. That's quite common.

97
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,960
Yoon Joo No rarely loses it.

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,620
My gosh, everyone loses
it at meetings like this.

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,259
Everyone pleads and
begs us to believe them.

100
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,899
They demand our help
to uncover the truth...

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,929
while claiming to be innocent.

102
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,900
They kneel on the floor and beg in tears.

103
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,930
I've fallen for it several times.

104
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,610
But once we present evidence
and press hard on them,

105
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,039
they all crumble.

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,480
There hasn't been an exception
ever. Not even once in my career.

107
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,650
Then shouldn't he plead at least?

108
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,649
I bet he wants to.

109
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,490
He probably wants to get
down on his knees right now.

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
But as you know, he likes to save face.

111
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,490
He doesn't know when to bow down.

112
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,499
Well, it only takes one shot
to take down guys like him.

113
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Precisely.

114
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,180
(Sanin)

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,060
Is it going according to your plan?

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,670
Not exactly.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Then admitting to your actions
could be a viable option too.

118
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,740
This could end with your dismissal.

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,220
Just like I told you when I
first came back to Korea,

120
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,020
I have nothing to lose.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,790
So the severity of the
disciplinary action...

122
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,720
doesn't matter either.

123
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,330
Why doesn't it matter?

124
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,860
You don't know what you're in for.

125
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,870
Will I go to prison?

126
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,200
That's why...

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,770
you want me to agree to dismissal, right?

128
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,380
Let's say this ends with
my dismissal. What then?

129
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,320
What's next?

130
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,590
Sanin Group can file a civil
lawsuit against me, right?

131
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,260
It will cost a fortune to
compensate for the damage.

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,330
Even so, why play a
hand that will backfire?

133
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,400
If you keep this up, it will
cost more than your job.

134
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,070
When they file a lawsuit, it
will be an emotional move.

135
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,070
How will you benefit from that?

136
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,440
I came back here because...

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,680
I wanted to find out the
truth about my brother.

138
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,850
So...

139
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,150
I'm only speaking the truth now.

140
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,490
So you don't care...

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,690
if you end up in prison...

142
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,290
or get sued as long as
you find out the truth?

143
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Yes.

144
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
(Sanin)

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,370
- Bring us coffee. - Yes, sir.

146
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,350
- Hear me out. - Sure.

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,690
There's no way Yoon doesn't
know about the company's situation.

148
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,890
Could it be a suicide mission?

149
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,000
A suicide mission?

150
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,230
"Sanin manipulates stock prices."

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,100
He might be planning to
expose us and ruin us completely.

152
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,970
By causing our stock price to crash?

153
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,270
So he could be trying
to drag us down with him.

154
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,410
How will he handle the consequences?

155
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,780
My gosh.

156
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,380
Why would a man who has
nothing to lose worry about that?

157
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,550
Come in.

158
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,420
Gosh, later.

159
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,330
If that's the case,

160
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,630
we must make our move first.

161
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,730
How?

162
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,400
We must get ahead of him and expose
that he manipulated the stock price.

163
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,009
My gosh. I told you that wasn't an option.

164
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,370
That's what he wants right now.

165
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,540
No.

166
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,609
"Sanin Group was able to stop..."

167
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,080
"the corporate raider, Yoon Joo
No, from manipulating the stock price."

168
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,280
That's the angle we should play.

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,020
"Sanin Group is capable of
weeding out internal risks."

170
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,020
That will be our stance.

171
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,830
How will we convince the chairman?

172
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,759
We can't convince him.

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,600
The articles would be
published without our knowledge.

174
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,030
I see. So...

175
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,570
Sanin Group is facing difficulties
because of Yoon Joo No.

176
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,540
Since he was removed, things
will only improve for Sanin?

177
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,940
What?

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,410
Yes. We can roll with that.

179
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,310
That's good.

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
But here's the thing.

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,149
For a reporter to put
out a decent news article,

182
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,849
the story must sound convincing.

183
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,620
- With facts, it will be better. - Right.

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,090
Do you think Yoon Joo No will give us any?

185
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,500
You see, when people get chatty,

186
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,400
they're bound to make a mistake.

187
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,040
Mr. Yoon.

188
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,780
Do you need anything?

189
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,780
No. I'm good.

190
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,050
Someone will come to see me.

191
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,190
Could you let me know then?

192
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920
- Who? - Excuse me.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,500
(Sanin)

194
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,040
Were you able to rest a bit?

195
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,579
I just became curious...

196
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,050
after listening to you earlier.

197
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,220
So tell me. How does
this so-called game go?

198
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,060
Could you explain it to us?

199
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,660
The stock price manipulation
is often called the game.

200
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Right.

201
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,900
But I doubt one person
can run the game alone.

202
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,699
No.

203
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,600
You will need other players
to help you for the game.

204
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,070
Among the players, there's
the mastermind. The one...

205
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
who designs the entire operation
and reaps the largest profit.

206
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,110
And...

207
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,750
This way.

208
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,890
Then there's the figurehead
to keep the mastermind hidden.

209
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,860
Let me serve it based on age.
You ordered jujube tea, right?

210
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,630
Safe.

211
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,529
- Driving.
- The bankroll provides the funds...

212
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,259
- to manipulate the market.
- I hope we can get along, sir.

213
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,300
I ordered the tea.

214
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,670
- Could you give her the tea?
- Yes, sure. Here you go.

215
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,540
Let us be humble.

216
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,709
Then there's the painter who
manipulates the stock charts.

217
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,310
I'm going to paint on the charts.

218
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,740
- And... - As for this guy...

219
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,750
Right.

220
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
My name is...

221
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,780
Jang Won Seok.

222
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,920
A long time ago, I used to
work in Yeouido as a finance guy.

223
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,859
I'm a freelancer now.

224
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,920
Exchanging names, are
we? What is this, a blind date?

225
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,590
Oh, right. Okay.

226
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,160
He was a technician.

227
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,500
But he got caught and lost his hand.

228
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,300
But you're back?

229
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,570
Yes.

230
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm back with a new hand.

231
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,979
He ought to come back.

232
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,839
There's no better business than this.

233
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,850
Exactly.

234
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,120
It's not like I can work as
a delivery man at my age.

235
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,150
My gosh.

236
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,460
Anyway, we're going to play this game...

237
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,990
solely based on trust.

238
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,730
You all know that, right?

239
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
That's why this is a tough job.

240
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,329
Right on.

241
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,500
No matter how hard or lonely it gets,

242
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,600
- let's trust our team. - Yes.

243
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,440
We should rely on each other.

244
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
- Let's take it all the way. - Yes.

245
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
- Okay. - Okay.

246
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,280
They're a group of con
artists, to begin with.

247
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,410
- Let's drink.
- So they don't trust one another.

248
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,520
In many instances,
names aren't exchanged...

249
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,020
and faces remain hidden.

250
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,520
Given the nature of this group,

251
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
to join this family,

252
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,230
you must be introduced
by an existing player.

253
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,590
My gosh. Where are you going?

254
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,400
By the way, he's clueless
that he was duped.

255
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,370
That's why he's back.

256
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,500
The mastermind must've
done a great job driving the car.

257
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,969
It was a hit-and-run,

258
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,070
- but he has no idea what happened.
- Right.

259
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,470
- Okay. - Great.

260
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,580
All right.

261
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,580
I invited all of you to the group chat.

262
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,150
Let's make a fortune and
never see each other again.

263
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,920
- That's the goal. - That's the goal.

264
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,449
- Bye. - I look forward to it.

265
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,520
Take care.

266
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,959
The mastermind, also known as...

267
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
the biggest player and the architect,

268
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,960
rarely shows up.

269
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,660
Yes, Doctor. The meeting is over.

270
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,099
Yes. I'll tell you in person.

271
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,169
(Yeouido Boutique,
Banker, Jujube Tea, Doctor)

272
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll be back soon.

273
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,980
Hey. So the Doctor is the mastermind?

274
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,320
Why are you curious about that?

275
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,180
Well,

276
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,320
the mastermind didn't show up today.

277
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,590
But he's in the group chat. Am I wrong?

278
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,290
Then just let that be.

279
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,530
Why should the identity of
the mastermind matter to you?

280
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,060
Seriously.

281
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,200
That punk.

282
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,040
Listen. I have one million
dollars at stake in this game.

283
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,370
I ought to know how this
game is going to play out.

284
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,570
Listen up.

285
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,980
I'll only explain it once.

286
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,540
There's a company named Seono Technologies.

287
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,579
- What kind of company is it?
- I don't know. And who cares?

288
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,620
I guess it has some kind of technology.

289
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,119
When the players get together,

290
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,150
they settle on a company for their game.

291
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,290
Usually, they choose companies
worth around 100 million dollars.

292
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,290
Why is that?

293
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,960
Shouldn't they pick a big
company to have a bigger profit?

294
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,460
And it will be easier to go unnoticed.

295
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,540
Because they can't freely control
the price with big companies.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,940
To be able to move ten million dollars,

297
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,970
companies worth around
100 million dollars are suitable.

298
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,240
The company is worth
around 100 million dollars.

299
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,510
Which means we need 100 big ones.

300
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,249
You said you were good for ten, right?

301
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,480
Yes. Ten million dollars.

302
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,050
Then we need exactly 100.

303
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,889
Their stock price is
between 1.2 and 1.3 dollars.

304
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Okay.

305
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,990
We're going to drive the
stock price below a dollar.

306
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,830
That's when you come in.

307
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,930
I see. Okay.

308
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,630
Don't buy them without the green light.

309
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,229
I'll let you know...

310
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,230
- when it's your turn. - Okay.

311
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,969
Keep the group chat notification on.

312
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,970
Okay.

313
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,499
They will gradually drive
the stock price up and down...

314
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,240
as the players buy the stock.

315
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,310
Then when individual investors join them,

316
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,710
they purposely drive the stock price down.

317
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,580
To raid the retail investors, so to say?

318
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,320
Correct.

319
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,919
It refers to their attempt...

320
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,320
to force individual
investors to sell their shares,

321
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
so they can buy them.

322
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,590
Once they have done the market sweep,

323
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,260
as the players sell and buy the shares,

324
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,830
they drive up the stock price.

325
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,570
As the players must be the
only ones buying and selling,

326
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,729
they sell and buy...

327
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,370
an agreed-upon number of
shares at a scheduled time.

328
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,270
This is called...

329
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,370
a matched order.

330
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,080
Usually, the transaction
goes down during lunchtime.

331
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,910
Why is that?

332
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,180
The market activity is at its lowest...

333
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,680
and is the least monitored
period around lunchtime.

334
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,890
The people at the FSS must have lunch too.

335
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
The devil is in the details.

336
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,760
Once we've gathered
enough shares, I'm going to...

337
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,830
drive it up.

338
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,500
Up to five dollars.

339
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,600
That high?

340
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,769
I'll have to publish
news articles and so on.

341
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,340
Tabloids will be part of it too.

342
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,780
I know a few YouTubers too.

343
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,979
I see. Yes.

344
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,650
I hear finance YouTube
channels are quite influential now.

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Great idea. Nice.

346
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,590
So how does the order go?

347
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,559
Remember the order the drinks were served?

348
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,760
That's the order.

349
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,990
I see.

350
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,730
Then I'm last.

351
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,760
Did you think you'd go first?

352
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,570
Once the stock price skyrockets,

353
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,870
the players sell the shares in
the order they agreed upon...

354
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,300
and slowly pull out
without getting noticed.

355
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,280
When they do, the stock price
doesn't plummet right away.

356
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,909
Due to the influx of
individual investors...

357
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,750
misled by the fabricated
news from the players,

358
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,120
the stock price often goes up,
which is contrary to expectations.

359
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,420
That's why the stock charts from
the game often show two spikes,

360
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,220
resembling the camels' humps.

361
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,530
But as JUMBO was a failed game,

362
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,200
the chart didn't resemble
the camels' humps.

363
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,270
I barely made any money
because the last one was a flop.

364
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,269
So I'm trying to come up
with a great game this time.

365
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,940
Seriously, Won Seok.

366
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,480
You have no idea how hard I'm working.

367
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,950
I got it. Thank you for your hard work.

368
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,650
- Okay. - So don't worry. You just wait.

369
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Okay.

370
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,920
Let's not...

371
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,960
see each other for a while.

372
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,390
Sure. Okay. Bye.

373
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,260
Why did it fail?

374
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,099
Someone broke the agreement first,

375
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,940
sold off the shares, and pulled out.

376
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,040
A betrayal after a betrayal.

377
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,110
That's the kind of skill set...

378
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,240
the industry requires.

379
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,150
In a failed game like this,

380
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,649
a large number of shares
would be available in the market,

381
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,050
so the stock price would plummet.

382
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,020
By the time individual
investors figure it out,

383
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,590
it's probably too late.

384
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,520
When it hits the lower limit,

385
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,030
you can't sell the shares
even if you want to.

386
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,360
How do you know that?

387
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,900
I think I've been a victim too
although I have no evidence.

388
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,440
So...

389
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,810
what was your role in this game?

390
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,970
The architect?

391
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,109
The one who designed and led...

392
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,950
the stock price manipulation of
JUMBO was Dr. Ko Byung Soo.

393
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,980
He held the largest
number of shares as well.

394
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Is that so?

395
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,390
What happened to that guy?

396
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,220
Did he go to prison?

397
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,760
As you know, it was a failed game.

398
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,659
Therefore, it must have been difficult...

399
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,330
to prove the direct involvement
of the players in the game.

400
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,880
Let's say what you're
telling us is the truth.

401
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,510
Then don't you want...

402
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,980
to catch this doctor guy?

403
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,360
I must.

404
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,370
That punk. He wants
me to clean up the mess.

405
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,870
He's practically putting
rubber gloves on my hands.

406

407
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,510

426

know an awful lot about it.

to doing something I never did.

541
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,540

But what if he already got a rebate?

545
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,059
That means he's already
in the same boat as them.

546
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,490
Then it won't be easy for him to
cancel the plan to invest in them.

Well, that is true.

548

If he already received a kickback,

549
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,070
the fact that JUMBO is a scam...

550
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,470
will put him in a difficult position too.

551
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,009
Yes, exactly. If he decides
to cancel the investment now,

552

he obtained from you.

in the report you submitted to me,

685
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,039
you wrote that we should invest in JUMBO.

686
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,509

submitted another report that said...

687
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,010
we should not invest in JUMBO.

689

me against investing in JUMBO.

691
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,770
isn't that what you had to do
to commit the perfect crime?

692
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,640
We didn't have to actually
invest in it to make the stock go up.

693
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,540
It was enough to have rumours
go around about our investment.

694
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,580
The stock would still go up.

695
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,410
Then you could just sell them all and exit.

696
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,580
In other words,

697
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,790
you said we shouldn't buy JUMBO...

702
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,640

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,240

704
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,450

00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,980
My brother couldn't
sell his shares and exit.

706
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,420
That's why...

707
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,650

709
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,330

710
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,160
You didn't profit from them,
so you did nothing wrong?

Hey, Mr. Yoon.

712
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,140
Do you really not know?
Or are you just acting dumb?

713
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,439
Just the fact that you had those shares...

714
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,839
makes you a criminal.

715
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,639
That's not what he's saying.

716
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,649
Okay, go ahead and
explain. What does he mean?

717
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,949

his late brother to weasel out of it.

723
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,859
How could you pin
everything on your late brother?

724
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,369
Have you no sense of decency?

725
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,370
Director Ha!

726
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,310
Fine.

727
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,190
All right, then.

728
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,060
Then explain this.

729
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,759
Why did you invest in JUMBO shares?

730
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,100
Fifty thousand shares, at that.

731
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,930
They...

732
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,930
aren't mine.

733
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,070
What?

734
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,210
Come on, Mr. Yoon.

735
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,770
You shouldn't lie to us.

736
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,879
This letter states that
you own 50,000 shares...

737
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,979
and that you should attend their
general meeting of shareholders.

738
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,880
We can't talk if you're going to deny this.

739
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,990
You should admit this, at least.

740
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,620
I'm trying to help you here.

741
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,529
The ones at eye level are
part of our Gold Line Package.

742
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,530
They're the best ones.

743
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,730
Each niche costs 7,000 dollars.

744
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,770
The ones right above the
Gold Line cost 6,000 dollars,

745
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,740
but most people go for the Gold Line.

746
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,809
Otherwise, you'd either have to look up...

747
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,510
or down as they aren't at eye level.

748
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,330
The ones on top are also quite popular.

749
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,500
I'll go with that one.

750
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,400
Are you a Buddhist by any chance?

751
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,339
If so, there's an event we're organizing.

752
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,540
I'm not interested.

753
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,580
Well, you know...

754
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,310
In Buddhism, taking one's own life...

755
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,819
is seen as a harmful
action that also hurts...

756
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,620
the people around you.

757
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,660
- So... - I'm not a Buddhist.

758
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,390
Oh, I see.

759
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,640
I heard his brother took
his own life in his stead.

760
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,610
What is this nonsense now?

761
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,509
High-ranking executives
from Sanin were here.

762
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,110
That's what they said.

763
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,410
What exactly did they say?

764
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,680
That he and Joo No invested
in some stock together.

765
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,020
- Goodness.
- I see. That must be the reason.

766
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,190
What is it?

767
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,229
Earlier, one worker felt
bad about the brother...

768
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,960
and wanted to give him her
prayers. But Joo No rejected her,

769
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,830
saying he's not a Buddhist.

770
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,830
How can he do that? Oh
Woon is an orphan now.

771
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,740
Well...

772
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,010
- Gosh. - Good grief.

773
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,180
Who will take care of her?
She doesn't even have a mom.

774
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,990
Isn't your child around
the same age as her?

775
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,989
Raising them together will be easy.

776
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,160
Nonsense.

777
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,960
Raising a stranger's
child is not easy at all.

778
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,330
You shouldn't say such
things even if we're at a funeral.

779
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,670
- Oh, right. You have it tough. - Hey.

780
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,210
I'm fine.

781
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,150
Oh Woon.

782
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,760
Why don't we...

783
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,300
live together?

784
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,840
Call me...

785
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,040
Dad from now on.

786
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,370
Okay?

787
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,030
Mr. Yoon.

788
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:35,970
Yes?

789
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,470
I looked into what you asked.

790
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,110
- The inheritance? - Yes.

791
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,080
Before your brother passed away,

792
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,450
he pocketed one million dollars.

793
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,290
He didn't have many assets.

794
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,590
If you inherit,

795
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,360
it'll also include the
liability for compensation.

796
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,590
You'll end up with far more debt.

797
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,130
So...

798
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,870
Is Oh Woon the inheritor?

799
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,970
Yes.

800
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,709
The first in order is your niece.

801
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,840
But she's a minor.

802
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,010
You, the second in order,
must inherit on her behalf.

803
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,380
Both you and Oh Woon
should give up the inheritance.

804
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,620
No.

805
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,190
I will inherit it.

806
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,620
You will...

807
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,660
have to pay the debt in his stead.

808
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,770
I know.

809
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,440
I inherited both...

810
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,880
a one million dollar
liability to the bank...

811
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,110
and 50,000 shares of JUMBO Pharma.

812
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,850
In other words,

813
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,949
the 50,000 shares printed...

814
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,120
on the shareholders' meeting
invitation you're holding...

815
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,690
are not mine...

816
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,260
but what I inherited from my brother.

817
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,430
Is it true?

818
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,060
Did you inherit his debt?

819
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,830
Of one million dollars?

820
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,800
- Do you have proof?
- How is that important right now?

821
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,540
Even from what we've heard so far,

822
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,809
you can be charged with insider trading,

823
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,010
nominee trading,

824
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,310
direct stock price manipulation, and...

825
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
Right?

826
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,980
Those can lead to corporate image damage...

827
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,720
and charges of breach of duty.

828
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,850
That's why you're fired. Got it?

829
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,960
I request a chance to explain myself.

830
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,790
Save it. Write your
resignation letter and get lost.

831
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,300
Is that an official order?

832
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,400
No, it's not.

833
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,700
(Sanin)

834
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,540
Could I be granted some time to think?

835
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,680
How much do you need?

836
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,720
About two hours.

837
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,550
Is that enough?

838
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,420
Yes.

839
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,289
Okay. Get some fresh air for two hours.

840
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,130
It's already time for lunch.

841
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,700
Let's all have lunch.

842
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,000
We'll take a break.

843
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,710
Great.

844
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,120
Gosh.

845
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,420
Could he really have
inherited his brother's debt?

846
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:43,990
Director Lee.

847
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,590
Did he?

848
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,190
Who knows?

849
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,070
How could you...

850
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,840
give Yoon Joo No time because he asked?

851
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,669
Director Cho. Are you
starving or something?

852
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:01,710
No.

853
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,740
Let me explain, Director Ha.

854
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,479
Disciplining him without
hearing his side of the story...

855
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,110
might cause issues later.

856
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,620
What issues?

857
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,289
The disciplinary proceedings...

858
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,519
clearly state that one gets
the chance to show cause.

859
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,860
Ignore that and discipline him,

860
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,419
and he might take legal action...

861
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,130
for not following the proceedings.

862
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,130
Could that result in the
nullification of the discipline?

863
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,770
Someone like Yoon Joo
No can make that happen.

864
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,000
I get it now.

865
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,470
Two hours can get him nothing.

866
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,040
If you ask me,

867
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,480
not sticking to the proceedings
is all Yoon Joo No has...

868
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,380
against us.

869
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,780
I see.

870
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,420
So this punk is playing his last card?

871
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,790
Yes.

872
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,389
I didn't do Mr. Yoon any favours.

873
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,530
It was me making sure he had
no way out of this, Director Ha.

874
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,870
All right. What's left now?

875
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,030
You can discipline him
once he returns in two hours.

876
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,040
Okay.

877
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,910
Okay.

878
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,620
That jerk.

879
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,590
He earned money just to buy that?

880
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
Goodness.

881
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,519
My legs are killing me.

882
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,319
(Daejin Delivery)

883
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,120
(Ko Byung Soo)

884
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,360
Darn it.

885
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,330
Whatever.

886
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,130
I'll end up behind bars now.

887
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,639
Mr. Yoon.

888
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,780
How did it go? Did they
decide on disciplinary action?

889
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,920
Not yet.

890
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,190
By any chance, did anyone come by for me?

891
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,860
No, no one.

892
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,260
Yes?

893
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,000
Hey. I found Dr. Ko's laptop.

894
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,840
I did, but it's password-locked.

895
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,510
Did you unlock it?

896
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,580
No, I couldn't.

897
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,780
Didn't you find it?

898
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,580
I found his laptop.

899
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,520
I don't know the password to unlock it.

900
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,220
I'll bring the laptop to you.

901
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,920
Okay. Make your way here.

902
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,420
Okay.

903
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Do you know how to crack a password?

904
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,570
Of a laptop.

905
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,100
No.

906
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,970
Do we have to hack into it?

907
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,540
Can you do it?

908
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,540
Me?

909
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,850
Won't CEO Cha Ho Jin be able to do it?

910
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,110
CHACHA Games?

911
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,950
What?

912
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:35,790
Nice pass.

913
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,020
You can't.

914
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,060
- No! - No!

915
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:42,930
Shoot.

916
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,670
What's up?

917
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,240
Why isn't CEO Cha answering his phone?

918
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,740
He's busy at the moment,

919
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,740
pivoting.

920
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,080
I have an urgent favour to ask.

921
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,310
Right now?

922
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,350
Okay. We're on our way.

923
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,390
CEO Cha.

924
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,090
No more basketball.

925
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,889
We need to head to Sanin right now.

926
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,900
To where?

927
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,460
Sanin?

928
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,109
- He's my senior. - I see.

929
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:33,350
- Hi. - Hi.

930
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,050
Here.

931
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,280
- Did you get caught? - No.

932
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,150
But I soon will. His
laptop is missing, after all.

933
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,820
But how will you unlock it?

934
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,730
I don't know.

935
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,370
I need to head back.

936
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,270
Okay. We'll call you
as soon as it's unlocked.

937
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:57,700
Thank you.

938
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,210
- Let's go. - Okay.

939
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,710
- Excuse me. - Sure.

940
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,280
I'm done with my job.

941
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,320
You are. Great work.

942
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,730
I'll get in touch.

943
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,840
Don't. Take care of yourself.

944
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,290
We will now resume the meeting.

945
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,920
It was short,

946
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,060
but could we take it that it
was enough time for you...

947
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,660
to prepare an explanation?

948
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,260
Yes.

949
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,760
Go ahead.

950
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,310
My brother realized Sanin had
plans to invest in JUMBO through me.

951
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,110
He bought 100,000 dollars worth of
JUMBO shares and then sold them.

952
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,050
In the process, he had
lost a great deal of money.

953
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,410
To make up for it,

954
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,680
he must've unlawfully used one
million dollars of bank money...

955
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,290
to purchase 50,000 shares again.

956
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,760
So what?

957
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,220
You had nothing to do
with those 50,000 shares?

958
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:27,660
You had no idea?

959
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,430
It wasn't until the inheritance...

960
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,970
that I learned my brother
owned that many shares.

961
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,500
We've heard that already.

962
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,770
- If there's nothing new... - However,

963
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,110
with that amount,

964
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,840
I suspect it belonged
to a manipulative force.

965
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,079
Timing-wise, when my brother
bought one million dollars...

966
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,150
worth of JUMBO shares, only wash trades...

967
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,620
In other words,

968
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,620
only the forces were trading the shares.

969
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,620
What do you mean by that?

970
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,530
Are you implying that your
brother was a member?

971
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,830
No.

972
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,829
I'm saying one of the forces...

973
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,100
betrayed by selling 50,000 shares,

974
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,800
and...

975
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,900
my brother happened to buy them.

976
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,770
Come on.

977
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,810
Isn't that too big of a coincidence?

978
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,040
Yes. You may think so.

979
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,050
- That's why... - That's why...

980
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,680
you continue to suspect me.

981
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,190
Director Lee. Remember?

982
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,090
I advised you not to buy JUMBO shares.

983
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,490
I do.

984
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,570
Who took my shares?

985
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:55,110
(JUMBO Pharma)

986
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,220
That jerk.

987
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,740
(Junior Managing Director's Office)

988
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,149
Director Lee. We need to
publish an article right now.

989
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,920
What's wrong?

990
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,879
Sanin might...

991
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,790
get caught up in share price manipulation.

992
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,119
We must issue an article that
Sanin has nothing to do with it...

993
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,290
and won't investigate.

994
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,289
I don't understand.

995
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,360
Just get on with the article at once.

996
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,730
The one...

997
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,200
who stopped that was me.

998
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,270
You remember, yes?

999
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,670
I do.

1000
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,710
Good. Thanks to me,

1001
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,410
Sanin avoided suffering damage.

1002
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,680
Had I been involved,

1003
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,350
would I have told you we
shouldn't buy the shares?

1004
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,450
Like you suspected me,

1005
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,460
couldn't you have done
so to create an alibi?

1006
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:15,890
What?

1007
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,630
So? Do you have evidence or something?

1008
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:25,000
We have more than
enough evidence against you.

1009
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,040
I'm asking if there's any against me.

1010
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,139
Hi.

1011
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,149
- Hi. - Hi.

1012
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,579
What password were you talking about?

1013
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,650
It's this laptop.

1014
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,419
This laptop belongs to a man...

1015
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,549
suspected of manipulating stock prices.

1016
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,550
The documents on here can clear up
the misunderstanding about Mr. Yoon.

1017
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,059
You're an expert in this
area, right, CEO Cha?

1018
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,690
And you have experience in hacking.

1019
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,960
Instead of hacking, I got hacked into.

1020
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,830
Right. You were the victim.

1021
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,030
And...

1022
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,470
It's only in movies that you
can easily hack into laptops.

1023
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,270
I can't do it. Plus, it'll take too long.

1024
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,710
You must do it, CEO Cha.

1025
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,080
- Is it an urgent matter? - Yes.

1026
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,790
Let's see.

1027
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,760
- Do you have a screwdriver?
- A screwdriver...

1028
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,230
- Yes, I do. It should be here. - Great.

1029
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,860
I do have evidence.

1030
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:28,300
As I explained, forces
don't trust each other.

1031
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,299
As a result, they keep a record...

1032
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,399
of the amount of money traded, the date,

1033
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,070
and the transaction details.

1034
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,470
They even save not only calls...

1035
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,640
but also every text message.

1036
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,150
So the forces leave a
record of their crimes?

1037
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,550
Correct.

1038
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,950
After all, they can't go down alone.

1039
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,290
True.

1040
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,620
It's the same as the
old days when people...

1041
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,160
bribed politicians with slush
funds and kept a ledger.

1042
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,500
Yes.

1043
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,330
That's why they keep
a record of everything.

1044
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,570
And?

1045
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,370
Where's that evidence?

1046
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,970
This is what Do Han Chul did to me.

1047
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:39,870
You know, DC.

1048
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,870
We know.

1049
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,379
Can you hand me that laptop?

1050
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,380
Sure.

1051
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,550
Here.

1052
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:53,820
Okay.

1053
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,230
(Golf Club Data, External Vendor Orders)

1054
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,300
To think...

1055
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,130
it works like this.

1056
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,230
- What were you looking for? - Ha Tae Soo.

1057
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,369
(Ha Tae Soo)

1058
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:16,340
Did my name pop up in their files?

1059
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,879
My apologies. I have
something to hand over.

1060
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,150
(Sanin)

1061
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,490
What is that?

1062
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,630
It's a record of Director Ha's...

1063
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,730
JUMBO share purchases
using insider information.

1064
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,210
From April 26 to April 29, 2021,

1065
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,540
Director Ha bought 25,000
shares in the 4-day period.

1066
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,810
On May 3 at 12:10pm,

1067
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,320
he bought an additional 25,000 shares,

1068
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,020
which totalled up to 50,000 shares.

1069
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,420
It was worth about one
million dollars at that time.

1070
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,490
And 27 minutes later, at 12:37pm,

1071
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,700
he sold everything.

1072
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,610
No, listen.

1073
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,050
He made that up.

1074
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,950
I swear I'm innocent.

1075
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,520
Seriously.

1076
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,830
Being wrongly accused is making me tear up.

1077
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,530
And here are...

1078
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,530
the transaction details of
my brother, Yoon Joo Seok.

1079
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,410
On April 29, 2021, at 9:10am.

1080
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,050
He bought shares worth 100,000 dollars...

1081
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,980
and then sold everything four days later.

1082
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,680
But...

1083
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,220
he bought 50,000 shares
again 30 minutes later.

1084
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,490
Worth one million dollars at that point.

1085
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,330
It was...

1086
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,330
one minute later after Director Ha sold...

1087
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,530
the whole 50,000 shares.

1088
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,670
In short,

1089
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,370
my brother Yoon Joo Seok...

1090
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,670
bought the shares Director Ha sold.

1091
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,379
That night, Sanin issued an article...

1092
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,110
stating it would not invest in JUMBO.

1093
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,680
And the next day, the
stock price crashed...

1094
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,750
as soon as the market opened.

1095
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,420
The stock price kept falling to the floor.

1096
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,460
My brother...

1097
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,860
couldn't sell his shares
until the very end.

1098
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,260
So what?

1099
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,730
Are you blaming me...

1100
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,100
for your brother's death?

1101
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,810
That's not what I think.

1102
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:12,140
Darn it.

1103
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:22,880
Because of me...

1104
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,020
Because of me, Joo Seok...

1105
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,720
No.

1106
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,760
Don't say that.

1107
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,790
No.

1108
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,460
It's my fault.

1109
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:42,630
I simply...

1110
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,870
wanted to know the truth.

1111
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,740
And now I know what they are.

1112
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,280
The record indicates...

1113
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,880
Director Ha took part in
the stock price manipulation.

1114
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,480
After hearing my report on JUMBO,

1115
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,520
he sold all the shares to run away...

1116
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,490
behind the forces' backs.

1117
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,690
But those shares...

1118
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,160
ended up with my brother.

1119
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,730
I sold them off after a short while.

1120
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,170
I didn't make any money off of it!

1121
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,270
You must've made a profit,

1122
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,210
though not as much as you'd planned.

1123
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,810
But even if you hadn't earned any money,

1124
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,780
the fact that you were in possession
of JUMBO's shares proves your guilt.

1125
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:32,750
That is what you, yourself, told me today.

1126
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,520
Bring that here.

1127
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,730
You should come here instead.

1128
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,160
It is where the subject of
the disciplinary hearing...

1129
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,100
sits.

1130
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,950
You punk, get over here!

1131
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,019
- Director. - Yoon Joo No!

1132
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,020
- Director. - Move!

1133
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:09,350
- You can't do this. - You punk!

1134
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:13,290
I'm a founding member of Sanin, you fool!

1135
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,529
- Director. - Move.

1136
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,189
I won't take this from kids like you.

1137
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,229
When I first started out at Sanin,

1138
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,899
you were still in your diapers!

1139
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,229
You. Get off me. Stop holding me back.

1140
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,000
Yoon Joo No!

1141
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,239
Step aside. Move.

1142
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,370
Then,

1143
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,140
it was Director Ha all along.

1144
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,150
Mr. Yoon...

1145
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,420
did leak inside information to his brother,

1146
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,549
but it wasn't intentional.

1147
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,550
And...

1148
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,020
his brother died.

1149
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,030
It'd be heartless...

1150
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,260
to find fault with him.

1151
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,160
Then,

1152
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,600
what should be done...

1153
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,940
about Director Ha?

1154
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,450
You can't park your
car there. Goodness, sir.

1155
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,650
- I won't be long. - Sure thing.

1156
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,260
(Sanin)

1157
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,910
Director Ha did a lot of work around here.

1158
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:37,880
He was even in charge of Constructions.

1159
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,540
Generating all that
funding was no small feat.

1160
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,580
How old is he again?

1161
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,619
He won't be turning 60 any time soon.

1162
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,720
I guess he put in too many hours...

1163
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,190
for someone of his relatively young age.

1164
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,600
The man must be worn out.

1165
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,060
Tell him to take a break.

1166
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,249
At the disciplinary
hearing for Yoon Joo No,

1167
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,660
Director Ha was
dismissed from his position.

1168
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,529
Really? Director Ha was terminated?

1169
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,160
Yes. He packed up
all of his things at night.

1170
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,630
He wasn't even offered severance pay.

1171
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,170
Second-in-command was cut overnight.

1172
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,600
Won't Director Ha sue the company...

1173
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,110
for wrongful termination?

1174
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,240
As if that's an option for executives.

1175
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,280
He probably was let go for a reason.

1176
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,510
By the way,

1177
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:56,210
you've got to hand it to Yoon Joo No.

1178
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,219
Maybe he really is the chairman's son.

1179
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,750
I told you he wasn't.

1180
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,120
Do you see a resemblance?

1181
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,190
The chairman's son is in the US.

1182
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:08,430
Hold on. Mr. Yoon...

1183
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,190
flew in from Hawaii.

1184
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:12,230
That's in the US.

1185
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,600
Wait. Is that how it is?

1186
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,960
(The Late Yoon Joo Seok)

1187
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,309
I'll take ten dollars' worth.

1188
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,940
- With random numbers? - Yes.

1189
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,879
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1190
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,520
- Have a good day. - You too.

1191
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,020
In my dream last night,

1192
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:13,820
stars turned into numbers
and rained down upon me.

1193
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,160
Sweet, right?

1194
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,160
What if this becomes a winning ticket?

1195
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,660
When will you stop this wishful thinking?

1196
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,230
When I win the lottery.

1197
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
I will someday.

1198
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,100
What will you do with the money?

1199
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,540
Buy a house.

1200
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:30,570
An apartment unit?

1201
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,880
No.

1202
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,849
I'm going to buy a house with a huge yard.

1203
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,050
Like the ones in movies.

1204
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,450
With basement levels.

1205
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,980
I have it all mapped out.

1206
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,920
You, me, Oh Woon, and
your wife will live together.

1207
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,090
I'd rather not.

1208
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,430
Is that so? Then give it back.

1209
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,929
You don't want to, so give it back.

1210
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,729
After that sweet dream you had?

1211
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:00,270
You weren't sold on my vision though.

1212
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
Hey.

1213
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,360
I thought you'd express your gratitude...

1214
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,360
with a beef steak.

1215
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,230
- I'll have the beef sandwich. - Sure.

1216
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,500
There's your beef.

1217
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:09,040
- Are you sure that's beef? - It is.

1218
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,620
Hey.

1219
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,990
Why did you put your trust in me?

1220
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,230
I didn't.

1221
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,030
Yet, you gave me a task that important?

1222
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,370
It seemed as though...

1223
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,670
you felt wronged.

1224
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,010
A robber can't whine...

1225
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,040
after tripping during a robbery.

1226
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,110
Why didn't you file for bankruptcy?

1227
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,280
I thought that was your expertise.

1228
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,220
You've been trying...

1229
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:58,120
to pay off your debt.

1230
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,660
Says who?

1231
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,630
You've been working as
a delivery man to do so.

1232
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,100
How far have you gotten?

1233
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,340
Not far...

1234
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:17,140
which is all the more
reason to work harder.

1235
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:19,910
What about you?

1236
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,880
How much of your brother's
debt were you able to pay off?

1237
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
Me?

1238
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,150
Well, I make good money.

1239
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,250
You annoying brat.

1240
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,530
What's this?

1241
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,930
Why do we need bottled water?

1242
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,800
We have a water dispenser.
Did you put in the order?

1243
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,070
I thought you did.

1244
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,540
Hold on.

1245
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,050
- Who... - Are you Lee Seung Soo?

1246
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,680
Yes?

1247
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,390
We're from Gangnam Police Station.

1248
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,320
I see.

1249
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,119
Lee Seung Soo is with the chairman...

1250
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,060
- Hold on. - You're coming with us.

1251
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,429
- Wait. - Don't.

1252
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,329
- I'll... Hey! - Hold on.

1253
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,400
What is the meaning of this?

1254
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,310
(Korea Securities Depository)

1255
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:36,780
(Shareholder meeting notice)

1256
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,620
Who sent this?

1257
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,520
I have no idea.

1258
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,659
Jin Soo, good morning.

1259
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,390
Good morning, Mr. Oh.

1260
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,330
Gosh, Ms. Kwak.

1261
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,330
- This is unexpected. - Morning, Jin Soo.

1262
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,900
Doors closing.

1263
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,340
Good morning.

1264
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,680
Mr. Yoon, did you stay here all night?

1265
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,550
No, I just got in early.

1266
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,150
You should've gotten some rest.

1267
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,450
I will once my work is done.

1268
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,460
Can we gather to talk?

1269
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,260
Sure.

1270
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,630
This is next year's business
plan requested by Samoel.

1271
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,600
It includes how Sanin will
pay the remaining debt...

1272
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,200
and the direction of business...

1273
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,770
the group will be taking
in the foreseeable future.

1274
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,739
I know Samoel is the creditor,

1275
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,539
but can they request such things?

1276
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:41,010
When they lent Sanin
three billion dollars? Yes.

1277
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:43,349
The interest rate is nine percent.

1278
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:45,479
That's right. Once we
renegotiate the terms,

1279
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,050
the conversion price
will go down 30 percent.

1280
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,749
Then that'll make someone else
the largest shareholder of Sanin.

1281
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,760
Right.

1282
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:55,160
Then today's briefing needs to go well.

1283
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,200
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

1284
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,970
Get over here and lend me a hand.

1285
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,570
But I'm on the M and A Team.

1286
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,669
Why you...

1287
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,310
Hey! Where are you going?

1288
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,880
Lend me a hand.

1289
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,180
Get in here.

1290
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,290
Jin Soo, watch me.

1291
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,120
Take one...

1292
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,290
and place it like so.

1293
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,730
Goodness.

1294
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,930
Hey, you know...

1295
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,700
how you said Yoon Joo No was...

1296
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,580
I mean, Mr. Yoon.

1297
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,050
Who told you Mr. Yoon
was the chairman's son?

1298
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:51,820
I don't know.

1299
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,750
I think I stumbled upon it.

1300
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:56,650
Why do you ask?

1301
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:57,950
Didn't you say he was the son-in-law?

1302
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,620
Did I?

1303
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,460
Word has been travelling
among the employees.

1304
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:07,199
As you know, Yoon Joo No
had Director Ha dismissed.

1305
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,269
A team manager had the CFO removed.

1306
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,130
The company's second-in-command.

1307
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,970
That wasn't exactly Mr. Yoon's doing.

1308
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,410
Director Ha's corruption
scandal caught up with him.

1309
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:21,710
Still. What happened is
unusual and unprecedented.

1310
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:23,510
So?

1311
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,720
So, Yoon Joo No...

1312
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,390
I mean, Mr. Yoon. That's
why people are wondering...

1313
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,260
if he's the chairman's son.

1314
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,690
Hold on.

1315
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,760
Did you just scoff at me?

1316
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,329
But that's absurd.

1317
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:42,600
They have different surnames.

1318
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:46,700
He could've been born out of wedlock.

1319
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,100
That's not true.

1320
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,510
Really?

1321
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:56,809
Hey. What about this, then?

1322
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,150
Yoon Joo No... I mean, Mr. Yoon.

1323
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,349
The White Snake.

1324
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,650
I hear his nickname is
actually the White Thread.

1325
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,990
Because of his gray hair.

1326
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,490
- Is that true? - Sure. If you say so.

1327
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:11,860
Why do I get the feeling that
you're looking down on me?

1328
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,830
Did you sense that?

1329
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,670
Get over here.

1330
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,970
Do you think being on Yoon's team
gives you some sort of authority?

1331
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,409
Hello, everyone.

1332
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,939
- Hello. - Hello.

1333
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,049
Hello.

1334
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,349
Jin Soo, shall we put up the slides?

1335
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:32,380
Sure.

1336
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:12,020
- The chairman will be here too. - Sure.

1337
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,930
Are you saying I need to
be present at this meeting?

1338
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,600
They wanted to greet
you since it's been a while.

1339
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,630
Who are they sending?

1340
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,700
Mr. David, sir.

1341
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,710
Let's go.

1342
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,260
Who will deliver the presentation?

1343
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,900
Mr. Yoon Joo No, sir.

1344
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,540
When will the chairman be here?

1345
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:06,239
I'd like for him to be here
before those from Samoel arrive.

1346
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,780
Who do they think they are...

1347
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,510
to demand the chairman's presence?

1348
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,220
You know how these funds
think they have all the power.

1349
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:16,990
They wanted to know our
business plan moving forward,

1350
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,160
and the loan we took out
will soon reach maturity.

1351
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:25,160
We'll be in trouble if they
don't grant an extension.

1352
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,099
Of course.

1353
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,800
Won't they be taking over the company?

1354
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,070
Are you ready for today?

1355
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,940
Yes.

1356
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,710
The chairman is here.

1357
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,220
Sit.

1358
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,930
I heard they wanted to see me in person.

1359
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,800
Greeting you is one of the reasons
they're attending this meeting.

1360
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,610
It'd be lovely to exchange some kind words.

1361
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,450
Those from Samoel Fund are here.

1362
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:26,360
Goodness. What a pleasure, Chairman Song.

1363
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:32,530
Mr. David, it's you I owe this pleasure to.

1364
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,000
- Please have a seat. - Sure.

1365
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,110
Shall we begin?

1366
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:44,940
Sure.

1367
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:46,740
Just a moment.

1368
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:48,510
My director hasn't arrived yet.

1369
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,350
We should wait.

1370
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,219
I was wondering why you came alone today.

1371
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,190
Sorry? Goodness.

1372
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,390
Actually, the company
hired a new executive.

1373
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,529
I see.

1374
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:05,800
We came here today so
that he could greet you.

1375
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,700
He'll be here soon.

1376
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,830
- There he is. - Goodness.

1377
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,340
Chairman Song, hello.

1378
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,580
Hurry into your seat.

1379
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,450
Allow me to greet you.

1380
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,560
Right.

1381
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:43,930
Director Ha.

1382
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,400
Yes?

1383
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:53,380
Is this your new gig?

1384
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,280
Yes, I'm a director at Samoel Fund.

1385
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:59,920
It's a small world, isn't it?

1386
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,319
This wasn't one of my cases,

1387
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,920
but Mr. David put me in charge.

1388
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:06,820
No one knows Sanin better than I do,

1389
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,530
and I have a soft spot for the company.

1390
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:11,690
It's been a while.

1391
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,330
Yes, sir.

1392
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,999
Allow me to present the business plan...

1393
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,530
for the upcoming year.

1394
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,900
Unbelievable.

1395
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,140
As if a team manager would know anything.

1396
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:26,840
Who are you to dare talk
about the future of a company?

1397
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,780
And in front of the chairman, no less.

1398
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,579
You should know...

1399
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,619
that Chairman Song is
a man of great insight.

1400
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:38,050
I learned a lot while working under him.

1401
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,960
Go on, Chairman Song.
Show us how it's done.

1402
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:46,130
Are you suggesting I present it?

1403
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:53,070
What's wrong? Don't you want to?

1404
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,260
Fine. Whatever.

1405
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,059
Then, go ahead.

1406
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,700
(2025 Sanin Business Plan Report)

1407
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,770
Allow me to present
Sanin's business plan...

1408
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,210
for the upcoming year.

1409
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,550
(The Art of Negotiation)

1410
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,300
{\an8}(Thank you for watching
The Art of Negotiation.)

1411
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,300
Dr. Park, you might want to consider...

1412
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,400
blue onesies.

1413
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:11,610
Is it a boy?

1414
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,310
The dad must also be thrilled.

1415
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,520
Well...

1416
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:28,960
Sure.

1417
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,000
I appreciate the beef steak.

1418
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:38,840
Don't mention it.

1419
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,840
Then, is my work done?

1420
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,280
No.

1421
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,450
That meal wasn't for free.
