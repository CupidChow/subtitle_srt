How much did we hit this month?

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,050
A little shy of 300,000 dollars.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,520
With 900 dollars more
today, we'll get a bonus.

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,520
What a shame.

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,190
Won't it be possible?

When have you seen a guy in a
suit buy a washing machine before?

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,470
I guess. I'll send him away.

- Let's wrap up for the day. - Okay.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,370
Is there anything specific you need?

18

Is it past business hours?

19
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,710
Gosh, no. Take your time looking around.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,479
That's a relief.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,949
Could I ask you something?

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,850
Sure. What about?

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,719
I need a washing machine and a dishwasher.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,320
Is that so?

25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,030
The one you were observing is
our best-selling washing machine.

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,060
As for dishwashers...

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,070
Here. This is our best one.

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,530
And the price?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,939
The washing machine is 810 dollars,

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,209
while the dishwasher is 450 dollars.

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,710
That'll bring your total to 1,260 dollars.

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,750
I was told my budget was 1,000.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,450
Yes, including the microwave.

difficult for us to match.

I guess.

37

What I'm asking for is probably
the employee discount price.

Right?

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,300

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,709

for the residents of Astro Apartments.

46

No.

Even so, we'll offer a discount...

49

67

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,380
to improve the former's financial health.

69
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,479

was its bread and butter.

70
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,650
Hasn't it prompted any concerns?

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,049

74
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
- That's better than expected. - Right.

75

cash through this deal,

76
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,489
people must be excited...

00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,229
about the new momentum it may present.

78
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,560
A new momentum?

79
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,299
Is there any word as to what that might be?

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm afraid there's no chatter about it yet,

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,769
but I'll look into it.

What is the meaning of this?

126

is that Sanin's crisis is far from simple.

131

There's a structural aspect to it.

132

Exactly. But that is for us to decide.

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,580
You're in no position to bring that up.

137

This is a failed project
that was once attempted.

138
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,820
Yes, I lacked in many ways.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,229
However, Mr. Yoon must
have the same idea as me.

140
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,230
Exactly.

141
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,270
But this can't fail again.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Mr. Yoon, do you believe
you can make this happen?

143
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,009
Yes, that's why...

144
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,110
The key to e-commerce is a platform.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,980
However, platforms keep
users strongly locked in.

146
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,650
We stick to one platform
and rarely jump ship.

147
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,050
But you're suggesting we
steal users from other platforms.

148
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,850
How?

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,659
As you said, consumers
stick to one platform...

150
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,820
and rarely use another.

151
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,060
They're extremely loyal.

152
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,289
Because of that, NAVER and Coupang...

153
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,500
have been dividing the market...

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,529
which has led to an aggressive competition.

155
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,530
Let me get this straight.

156
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,100
Those dividing the market
is battling for the throne,

157
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,370
but you think we have a chance.

158
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,709
Yes, whichever of the two that wins...

159
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,380
will try to improve its earnings rate...

160
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,740

from the long-term battle...

161
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,109

shipping or membership fee.

162
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,719

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,780
for its bloody victory.

164
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Right.

165
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,850
I see that as an opportunity.

166
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,619
How can that be an opportunity
when the throne is now taken?

167
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,389
Are you saying we'll have a
chance by taking on the winner...

168
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,630
of the cutthroat battle that just ended?

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Exactly.

170
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,129
Moreover, e-commerce...

171
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,530
is now shifting from a
platform war to that of logistics.

172
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,640
This, also, is an opportunity
for Sanin since logistics...

173
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,539
- is one of its strengths.
- It is the power of logistics...

174
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,179
that lowers prices and ships items faster.

175
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,379
For that reason, making
a move on e-commerce...

176
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,910
is a new opportunity for Sanin,

177
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,650
as well as a survival strategy.

179
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,560
and Sanin Fashion has its SPA brand,

180
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,130
but sales have been declining.

181
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,329
That's because most consumers...

182
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,930
now use e-commerce platforms.

183
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,930
The same can be said
about the other subsidiaries.

184
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,400
As the e-commerce market grows,

185
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,070
this will only get worse.

186
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,270
That is why this is the right time...

187
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,310
and the last window.

188
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,680
So tell me.

189
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,449
How can we sell our products online?

190
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,589
We're not NAVER.

191
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,220
We don't have a platform.

192
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,790
Then allow me to inform
you about platforms.

193
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,589
Rather than recruiting new developers...

194
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,600
or collaborating with a
company in that area of expertise,

195
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,629
an M and A deal...

196
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,229
will cut costs and save time...

197
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,330
Mr. Yoon.

198
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,940
Go ahead.

199
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,470
Do it.

200
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,980
In a nutshell, you want
to purchase a platform.

201
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,880
Go ahead.

202
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,419
But if this doesn't work,
you'll be held responsible.

203
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,480
Got it?

204
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,690
Director Ha.

205
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,589
Why don't we discuss this internally and...

206
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,130
He called it an opportunity
and a survival strategy.

207
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,260
We're doomed without it.

208
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,560
Aren't I right?

209
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,670
Yes, you're right.

210
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,000
Exactly.

211
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,670
The company is close to shutting down,

212
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,310
so you should stick your neck out as well.

213
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,010
Don't you agree?

214
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,750
Yes, I'll do as suggested.

215
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,580
Okay. Then that's it for today's meeting.

216
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,020
Director Ha, did the
chairman agree to this?

217
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,590
Let's grab tea.

218
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,730
- CEO Kim. - Yes?

219
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,200
Are you worried about
losing the distribution sector?

220
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,770
That won't happen.

221
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,970
This will be Yoon Joo No's demise.

222
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,410
How so?

223
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,680
Our logistics is strong,

224
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,350
so the plan could work
with the right platform.

225
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,220
That is why I once
took the initiative myself.

226
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,960
However,

227
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,660
there's a reason Director
Ha gave in this easily.

228
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,000
Director Lee once tried to
have this ship sail as well.

229
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,430
Right. Why did it fail back then?

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,640
His words were identical to
what Yoon Joo No said today.

231
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,710
Have you heard of Collection?

232
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,280
The online shopping platform?

233
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,440
Yes.

234
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,250
It's too famous not to know.

235
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,220
Of course you know what it is.

236
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,650
That's where the younger
generation buys their clothes.

237
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,060
It has been a roadblock for Sanin as well.

238
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
It once...

239
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,760
suggested an acquisition on our end.

240
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,770
The group had a chance
to acquire Collection?

241
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,040
You were in Hawaii at the time.

242
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,280
How much is Collection currently worth?

243
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,239
In the off-exchange market,

244
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,680
its estimate is around
four billion dollars.

245
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,880
Unbelievable.

246
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,550
Back then it was ten million dollars.

247
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,580
That's 400 times more.

248
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,390
It started off as a blog.

249
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,730
From there, it grew into a giant.

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,990
That's right.

251
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,559
People visited the blog,

252
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,360
so the management thought
it could sell a few things.

253
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,070
They offered to sell
our clothes on its blog.

254
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,330
And?

255
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,570
We offered...

256
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,670
to buy the blog for ten million dollars...

257
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,780
as long as it exclusively
sold our products.

258
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,210
It was to be Sanin's platform.

259
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Right.

260
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:43,950
That way, the company would
have a foothold in e-commerce.

261
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,720
I doubt Collection took the deal.

262
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,360
Collection did.

263
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,330
It was the chairman who upended the deal.

264
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,429
Our chairman wouldn't have had...

265
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,100
the slightest idea of
what this business was.

266
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,100
Didn't Director Lee try to convince him?

267
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,940
Even when the distribution sector
and in-person shopping hit a low,

268
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,410
the land still increases in price.

269
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
After the business itself didn't work out,

270
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,220
we were still able to turn
a profit by selling the land.

271
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,860
As for e-commerce,
you're left with nothing.

272
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,190
The opportunity cost is higher.

273
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,890
In the chairman's eyes,
e-commerce was a gamble.

274
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,270
Our chairman continuously
states he's a merchant and trader.

275
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,769
Why would he opt to gamble...

276
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,270
when he could choose the safer route?

277
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,010
Since then,

278
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,780
the idea of e-commerce
has only been enraging him.

279
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,349
Still, right now,

280
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,480
Sanin must show that
it has the power to grow.

281
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,180
If not, the stock price might plummet...

282
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,050
before we raise the 11 billion dollars.

283
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,120
I agree with you on that,

284
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,860
but isn't it too late?

285
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
It will be possible with an M and A deal.

286
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,700
You'll acquire a platform?

287
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,770
There aren't any platforms
that are on the market.

288
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,310
It didn't seem that tricky,

289
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,680
but this is harder than it looks.

290
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,980
(Mission Failed)

291
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:22,120
Just for being late,

292
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,990
I'm getting an earful.
This is one cruel boss.

293
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,019
The customer is returning the
item because shipping took too long.

294
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
(Requesting Return!)

295
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,690
Forget it. I'm done.

296
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,730
Whatever.

297
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,870
How are you doing, Ms. Kwak?

298
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm not big on video games
and can't tell how I'm doing.

299
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,370
Jin Soo, what about you?
Don't you know games well?

300
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,910
- I'm not sure.
- You don't find it straightforward?

301
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,910
It's not that.

302
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,950
I just can't explain it in words.

303
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,560
Did the briefing go well?

304
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,890
Yes.

305
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,990
What did you think of the game?

306
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,129
Right. This game may seem simple,

307
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,769
but there's a nice balance of features...

308
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,670
such as timing-based action,
business strategy, and simulation.

309
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,040
The graphics aren't that bad,

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,569
and there are details
utilized in the game...

311
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,539
that could only be known
by an actual courier...

312
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,940
which adds realism.

313
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,980
Also, an actual map has
been integrated into the game...

314
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,580
and that's the sickest.

315
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,680
Let me put it on the screen.

316
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,019
As you can see,

317
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,190
the delivery map is just
like what we use in real life.

318
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,299
After you complete a mission,

319
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,560
it gives you feedback on
possible improvements.

320
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,640
A lot of resources must've gone
into a game this sophisticated.

321
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,570
Is this game worth all that praise?

322
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,970
Yes.

323
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,110
However, I believe
this game to be a failure.

324
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,540
Why?

325
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,879
(Delivery King)

326
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,410
The game is of good quality, but...

327
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,050
But the BM lacks.

328
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,150
- BM as in business model? - Yes.

329
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,989
Even the worst games become a success...

330
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,790
with the right business model.

331
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,259
That's why the worst game is
actually a well-made game...

332
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,599
that can't generate money.

333
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,029
Because it costs more to
create but doesn't make any profit.

334
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,300
Yes, and that's the story of this game.

335
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,099
Now that I think about
it, the game was free,

336
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,340
and I didn't buy anything
while playing the game.

337
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,310
There aren't any ads either.

338
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,540
It could've easily had ads here and there.

339
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,050
Right. Which is why...

340
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,910
this game will flop.

341
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,590
You're right. It flopped.

342
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,990
It flopped for real.

343
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,659
"We thank all gamers who
loved CHACHA Games."

344
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,899
"Unfortunately, Delivery
King will end its service..."

345
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,569
"at the end of this month."

346
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,539
"We appreciate the support..."

347
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,100
"and will be back with even a better game."

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,170
There's no coming back from this.

349
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,710
Then, why don't we meet
the developer ourselves?

350
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,420
This is the place.

351
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,420
I don't think this is
it. It's a private home.

352
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,760
This is the correct address.

353
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,730
The developer must've
renovated a private home.

354
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,030
This could just be the billing address.

355
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,630
One that was written when
the business was registered.

356
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,139
Don't let this discourage you too much.

357
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,600
We can always try again.

358
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,570
We spent all our money.

359
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,140
Come on. I'll get the money somehow.

360
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,280
Who'd pay us?

361
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,079
Hey, don't you want pizza?

362
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,180
Shall I order some?

363
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,350
Sure.

364
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,260
Get going.

365
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,160
Hang in there too.

366
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,690
I'll see you.

367
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,030
- Bye. - Bye.

368
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560
Who are you?

369
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,630
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No
from Sanin's M and A Team.

370
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,730
Sure. So what?

371
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,770
Let me get this straight.

372
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,970
You're a fan of the
system and not the game.

373
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,240
We're fond of them both,

374
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,780
but it's the system we want.

375
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,240
What do you need it for?

376
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,410
To enter the e-commerce sector.

377
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,220
Hold on. Is Sanin still not
in the e-commerce market?

378
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,030
Seriously. That's hilarious.

379
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,140
You want a real-life
version of Delivery King...

380
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,870
as your platform.

381
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,440
It must've been a foolish idea on my part.

382
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,740
Gosh, no.

383
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,580
It actually makes sense.

384
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,750
Digital transformation.
Everyone does that these days.

385
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,149
Right.

386
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,490
That's why we're here to suggest a pivot.

387
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,790
A pivot?

388
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,830
I'll have to take this to my boys first.

389
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,000
Pizza's here.

390
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,770
I see we didn't bring enough.

391
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,080
No way. That actually makes sense.

392
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,649
Ho Jin worked as a
courier when he wanted out.

393
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,350
Hey. Why would you tell them that?

394
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,579
They kept saying he was awful at his job.

395
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,619
He was sick of getting
chewed out, so he made it.

396
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,420
Hey, that's not what happened.

397
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,420
The system was awful,

398
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,659
but they kept blaming the part-timers,

399
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,920
so I made it out of frustration.

400
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,159
I see.

401
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,900
No wonder it's so realistic.

402
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,860
The character is you, right?

403
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,130
- I see the resemblance. - No, it's not me.

404
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,469
In addition to handling deliveries,

405
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,569
they also have to accept
orders, secure products,

406
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,439
and assign jobs to drivers.

407
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Did you have experience with that too?

408
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
Yes.

409
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,150
I took care of the deliveries at
first, but they said I was too slow.

410
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,280
So, they had me handle orders
and dispatch drivers instead.

411
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,290
When you do that,

412
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,849
customers complain like crazy...

413
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,690
even if their orders
arrive just a day late.

414
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,589
But they were using a paper calendar
to manage the delivery schedule.

415
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,830
Are we still living in the Joseon Dynasty?

416
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,930
So, I made all of it by myself.

417
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,870
And?

418
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,070
Did you actually try using it?

419
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
No.

420
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,740
I showed the owner,

421
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,010
but he said they didn't
need it. Old folks don't get it.

422
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,940
So, I just ended up...

423
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,940
turning it into a game.

424
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,479
So, it was originally made for that.

425
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,049
Yes, you're right.

426
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,479
Let it serve its original
purpose as a platform.

427
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,779
No, the details are different.

428
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,719
Come on. We can tweak those things.

429
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,790
Besides, we can't afford
to be that picky right now.

430
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,430
- Do you think it can be done? - Yes.

431
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,759
The game allows you to get
data on information such as...

432
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,100
the total number of orders
and manufacturing output.

433
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,300
We've already set it all up
to control the difficulty levels.

434
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,579
Yes, we can use the data to
cut down on the distribution costs,

435
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,580
and I believe we can also
utilize them in marketing as well.

436
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,350
Oh, so you know what you're talking about.

437
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,250
My gosh. We really
struggled to set that up.

438
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,190
Who knew it'd be useful like this?

439
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,820
See? I told you we should do it.

440
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,460
You? When? It was my idea, you punk.

441
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,300
Wait, I have a question, though.

442
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,530
If we turn this into a platform,

443
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,330
we'll have to scrap this game, right?

444
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,470
Yes, I believe so.

445
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,080
Do you want to think about it?

446
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,450
No, I won't sell it.

447
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,250
Okay.

448
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,850
But I still learned a lot from you.

449
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,220
Thank you for your time.

450
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,519
What? Wait.

451
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,030
How much will you pay us?

452
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,730
About that...

453
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,960
We'll have to learn more about
CHACHA to be able to answer that.

454
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,499
When is the latest we can let you know?

455
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,570
The sooner, the better.

456
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,940
- Can we contact you at this number? - Hey.

457
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,410
We won't sell it.

458
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,850
Shouldn't we find some other options?

459
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,880
Not all games have that system.

460
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,750
If Mr. Cha is a good leader,

461
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,190
he'll probably contact us.

462
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Right.

463
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,630
Does he think he's Elon Musk or something?

464
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,960
Hey, are all young people
like that these days?

465
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,200
Well, those in the gaming
industry tend to be like that,

466
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,840
but those guys are a bit extreme.

467
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Right?

468
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,610
They made me feel like a boomer.

469
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,110
But Mr. Cha is the one who calls the shots,

470
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,380
and everyone on the team
seemed to be fine with it,

471
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
which tells me that Mr. Cha
is probably a good leader.

472
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,350
How do you know these things?

473
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,590
Honestly, I don't really
know either. I'm just...

474
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,420
hoping that's the case.

475
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
But even if we do hear from them,

476
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,060
I'm not sure if Mr. Cha
will accept the pivot.

477
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,270
Right. He seemed very proud of his game.

478
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,040
The pivot...

479
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Hey, Jin Soo.

480
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,240
Do you play basketball?

481
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Come on. Do a pass.

482
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Pass.

483
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
All right.

484
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,020
Look. Keep one foot planted like this.

485
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,190
Like this. Left and right!

486
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,930
You get it, right? Like this.

487
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,300
Think of Michael Jordan.

488
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,199
Like this.

489
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,029
Attorney Oh. Stay still, will you?

490
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,270
The car is shaking.

491
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,970
Okay.

492
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,340
Pivoting describes the process
of changing direction in business.

493
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,380
Actually, I knew that.

494
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,710
Oh, you did?

495
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,310
Then you should've told me.

496
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,150
I got scolded because of you.

497
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,920
It looks like we'll need
a consultant for this deal.

498
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,720
We don't know much about video games.

499
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,460
I'll try to find someone who
knows a lot about video games.

500
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,259
Actually, a friend of
mine is a consultant...

501
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,330
and a video game addict.

502
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Should I call my friend?

503
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,329
I hear Yoon Joo No wants to
start a whole new ball game...

504
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,840
to get into e-commerce.

505
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,640
Then Director Ha wouldn't have approved it.

506
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,480
Right. Even Yoon Joo No got him good.

507
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,380
Oh, you made it.

508
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,450
My goodness. Why didn't
you go ahead and start eating?

509
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,650
We should eat together.

510
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,390
- What? - Hello.

511
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,590
Director Ha said he wanted to
take me to a famous restaurant.

512
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,160
I see. Come on in and take a seat.

513
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,530
- Well, then... - This way.

514
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
So,

515
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,200
how are things going at the store level?

516
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What do you think?

517
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,270
You must be very upset with Director Lee.

518
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,939
Distribution is doing great,

519
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,850
but they want to change it
all up and try e-commerce.

520
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,020
I'll be honest.

521
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,660
Director Lee is like a father to me.

522
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,059
He used to be in charge
or Distribution, you know.

523
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,559
When he announced that
he'd hand it over to me,

524
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,700
so many people were against it as you know.

525
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,900
He managed to persuade
every single one of them,

526
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
so think about...

527
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
how grateful I must've felt.

528
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,370
I should be grateful.

529
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,910
Right, we know all about it.

530
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,350
You truly look up to Director Lee.

531
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,410
Who here doesn't know that?

532
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,920
The thing is,

533
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,549
wanting to get into e-commerce...

534
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,450
means they want me
to hand over Distribution.

535
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
My gosh.

536
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,189
It's like he gave it to
me only to take it back.

537
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,490
That's exactly what's happening.

538
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,599
I feel like an illegitimate
son who is being pushed off...

539
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,230
to the side by his real son.

540
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,400
So, Yoon Joo No is the real son?

541
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,900
Hey, that's why...

542
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,900
you should've chosen your side wisely.

543
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,510
What? Me?

544
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,970
I'm not on Director Lee's side.

545
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,710
I'm just grateful to him. That's all.

546
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,480
People seem to have
the wrong idea about me.

547
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,250
They think I'm on his side.

548
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,750
- Well, then... - Oh, thank you.

549
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,120
What's your plan now?

550
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,960
I must protect my position.

551
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,160
After everything I've been
through to come this far.

552
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,430
After all, that's how I can do
my duty to Sanin, you know?

553
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,970
Oh, boy.

554
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
My goodness.

555
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,100
I'm dying over here.

556
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,069
Come on. You exercise to live longer.

557
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,240
Don't die just yet.

558
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,780
How much is the ice cream?

559
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,110
It's three dollars.

560
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,120
Goodness. That's expensive.

561
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,550
Then go back down and get one.

562
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,120
- I'll take two. - It's too expensive.

563
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,090
He distributes these himself,

564
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,860
so he should charge a fee for that.

565
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,200
- Oh, my. - Here you go.

566
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,629
- Oh, boy. - Have a good day.

567
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,639
You too.

568
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,400
He knows how to run a business, doesn't he?

569
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,670
Let's sit down.

570
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,470
- Oh, dear. - By the way,

571
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
I see that young people aren't buying this.

572
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,619
Right. These days, you can
get everything delivered...

573
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,180
right to your door without a delivery fee,

574
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,990
so young people
probably can't understand...

575
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,820
having to pay extra in
the middle of the mountain.

576
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,059
They won't buy it because it's overpriced.

577
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,130
If it's cheap, everyone will buy it.

578
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,130
It's good.

579
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,250
Aren't you coming?

580
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,050
Got a death wish?

581
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,019
- Hello. - Hello.

582
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,090
Hello.

583
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,069
I'm Jenny, an analyst.

584
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,340
I specialize in video
games and entertainment.

585
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,970
Hello.

586
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,870
I'm Yoon Joo No from the M
and A Team in Sanin Group.

587
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,239
(CEO Cha Ho Jin)

588
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,710
CHACHA Games, Cha Ho Jin.

589
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,309
He was born in Ulsan in 1988.

590
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,119
He went to Science and Technology
High School and dropped out...

591
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,150
of Seoul National
University as a math major.

592
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,290
The elite track.

593
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes. The typical elite track,
including dropping out of college.

594
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,319
While attending college,

595
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,689
he cofounded DC Games with
his classmate, Do Han Chul,

596
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,830
and quit college.

597
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,300
He cofounded DC Games?

598
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,370
How many shares does
he have in the company?

599
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,299
Even if he just held onto one percent...

600
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,300
That'd be ten million dollars.

601
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,840
But from what I know, he doesn't
have any shares in the company.

602
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,609
That's right. Cha Ho Jin
doesn't have any DC shares.

603
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,309
Up until the time when Cha Ho Jin left DC,

604
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,180
DC wasn't a company. It was
just the name of their team.

605
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,219
D from Do Han Chul and C from
Cha Ho Jin. Hence the name, DC.

606
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,019
Why did the two of them
end up drifting apart?

607
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
That's...

608
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,460
Attorney Oh must know
more about it than I do.

609
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,430
Oh, they have a lawsuit
going on at the moment.

610
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,100
DC has a game that became
a hit. What was it called?

611
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,529
- High Square? - Yes, that's it.

612
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,200
- It became a big hit. - That's right.

613
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,900
It turned DC into the
company we know today.

614
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,869
But Cha Ho Jin...

615
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,510
sued them, saying he got the game stolen.

616
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,309
The game was developed when
he and Do Han Chul were a team,

617
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,779
so it should've been approached...

618
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,280
as a plagiarism or
copyright infringement case,

619
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,780
but he sued them for theft, which is...

620
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,849
It's an absurd strategy.

621
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,489
That's right. People in the industry...

622
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,890
all called it absurd too.

623
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,089
Have they reached a verdict?

624
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,220
Cha Ho Jin lost.

625
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,660
What if it was a plagiarism or
copyright infringement case?

626
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,030
He still would've lost.

627
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,200
Plagiarism cases are
very tricky for judges.

628
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,070
Did they really copy it?

629
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,740
Or are the similarities a mere coincidence?

630
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,110
It's also possible they came up
with similar ideas at the same time.

631
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,409
That's why anecdotal evidence is important.

632
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,480
Right, but the timing of when
Cha filed the lawsuit seems sketchy.

633
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,549
When he was struggling financially
while developing a new game,

634
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,819
he asked Do Han Chul to invest in
his project only to be turned down.

635
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,360
He sued him right after that.

636
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,730
In the judge's eyes,

637
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,259
it could seem that Cha
sued Do to get back at him...

638
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,529
for turning him down when
he asked for an investment,

639
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,170
so I think...

640
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,500
he would've lost, either way.

641
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,540
- Has he appealed the decision?
- Yes, it's in progress now.

642
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,340
And DC has sued him for a false accusation.

643
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,150
I bet CHACHA Games can't
even afford the legal fees.

644
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,749
It all comes down to money,
so they'll have to settle the case.

645
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,820
Well...

646
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,590
The thing is, they have
such a hostile relationship.

647
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,420
They've unfollowed each
other on social media.

648
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,160
Is that important?

649
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,670
For your generation, the action
of unfollowing someone is like...

650
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
ending your friendship with the person.

651
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,740
It must be true because...

652
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,409
DC keeps releasing new games
when CHACHA's new games...

653
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,149
are being launched,

654
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,780
although DC says it's a mere coincidence.

655
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,679
It doesn't look like a coincidence to me.

656
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
It can't be a coincidence.

657
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,820
How much do you think
CHACHA would be valued at?

658
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,920
We don't estimate game companies' values.

659
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,959
It's really hard to predict which
games would become successful.

660
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,289
And the value can change drastically...

661
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,760
depending on whether
or not it's successful.

662
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,430
But I can tell you a thing
or two about CHACHA.

663
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,470
CHACHA is worth nothing.

664
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,570
Delivery King is already doomed,

665
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,309
and they're in a legal battle with DC,

666
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,910
the dominant company in the industry,

667
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,480
so no one would want it
even if they offered it for free.

668
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,190
Thank you for coming.

669
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,760
Take care.

670
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,230
My boss told me...

671
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,740
your manager's nickname
was the White Snake.

672
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,370
People think he got the
nickname because of his white hair.

673
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,409
But apparently, it means
he thinks a hundred times...

674
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,880
before making a decision.

675
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,510
- Really? - Yes.

676
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,550
So, I was excited to see how
impressive this guy could be,

677
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,150
but I'm disappointed.

678
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,690
Why?

679
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,530
He wants to buy CHACHA Games.

680
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
He thought it over a hundred
times before deciding?

681
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,270
If he thought it over even just once,

682
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,070
he couldn't be saying he wants to buy it.

683
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,670
CHACHA doesn't want to
sell the company anyway.

684
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,240
Is that right?

685
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,240
Then I'm relieved.

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
Sure.

715
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,900
I thought I should do
something about it anyway.

716
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,440
Yes, exactly. You need
to show me something,

717
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,040
now that Mr. Kim is on board too.

718
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,279
Sir, do you need something?

719
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
No.

720
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Oh, hey.

721
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,150
Me?

722
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,430
You know him, right? That intern.

723
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,030
Intern? Which one?

724
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,200
You said you went to school with him.

725
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,640
That intern, you know.

726
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,770
Oh, Choi Jin Soo?

727
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,280
You two are close, right?

728
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,610
Why do you ask?

729
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,750
Find out what he's up to now.

730
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,820
He's on the M and A Team now.

731
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,190
No, I mean...

732
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,830
I need to find out what
Yoon Joo No is up to,

733
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,630
so ask that guy.

734
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,900
Got it, sir.

735
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,770
Can you not take hints?

736
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,040
Why are you following me?

737
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,870
Oh, sorry.

738
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,379
Can't he give clear directions?

739
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,180
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

740
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,120
When his contract
is up, tell him that's it.

741
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,329
Yes, sir. This time, the interns...

742
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,700
We'll tell the interns that none of
them will get a permanent position.

743
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,630
Good. Now, you understand what I'm saying.

744
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,970
Sir.

745
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,210
About CHACHA Games,
the CEO doesn't want to sell it.

746
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,640
Would it be a bad idea to
sell more of our subsidiaries?

747
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,050
CHACHA Games will sell the company.

748
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,110
Pardon?

749
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,950
CHACHA will go
bankrupt if they don't sell it.

750
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,790
Selling it is the only choice they have.

751
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,460
At times like this, it's important
to help them protect their pride...

752
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,290
so they can make the decision on their own.

753
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,290
I see.

754
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,730
And we can't sell another subsidiary.

755
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,300
If Sanin were to sell another subsidiary,

756
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,570
would you buy shares in Sanin?

757
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,610
I probably wouldn't.

758
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,010
The market reaction
wouldn't be much different.

759
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,310
It's hovering around 110
dollars at the moment,

760
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,780
but if we sell another subsidiary,
the stock price will tank.

761
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,180
It'd be like admitting that
the company is struggling.

762
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,360
If it drops to under 100 dollars,
we'll get a call from Samoel.

763
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,689
"Pay us back, or hand over the company."

764
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,499
What's that called?

765
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,430
- Bankruptcy. - Bankruptcy, bingo.

766
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,469
Just like how CHACHA has no other choice,

767
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,200
we don't have any other option either.

768
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,600
So, I'm convinced this deal will work out.

769
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,870
It has to.

770
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,780
So, let's do our best.

771
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,080
CHACHA Games had filed
a criminal case against DC.

772
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,450
Shouldn't it have been a civil case?

773
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,420
Good point. I'll look into it.

774
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,960
I'll do my best.

775
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,030
Please find out how things are at DC.

776
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,460
Sure.

777
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,160
And you, Jin Soo.

778
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,730
Have you ever completed
the final level in Delivery King?

779
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,900
Pardon? No.

780
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,570
- Keep at it. - Okay.

781
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,440
For Mobile and Online,
the numbers don't match.

782
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,680
There's a slight difference.

783
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,610
- Please check page 18.
- Do you want to grab a drink?

784
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,880
Pardon? Where?

785
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,620
- Bye. - Get home safely.

786
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,320
- Bye. - Bye.

787
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,760
Basement One. Going down.

788
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,190
The doors are closing.

789
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, I'll be off then.

790
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,500
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

791
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,970
Sir.

792
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,270
Do you just want me to
keep playing the game?

793
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,940
Yes.

794
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,370
It takes a while to beat the final level.

795
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,010
Or should I look into the developers?

796
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,180
No.

797
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,120
Try to beat the final level. It's fun.

798
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Okay.

799
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,850
- Good job today.
- Thank you for everything today.

800
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Hello?

801
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,400
Hey, I texted you. Do you
not know how to text back?

802
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,710
No. I don't know how to do anything.

803
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,510
I know nothing.

804
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,310
Is that so?

805
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,710
Then let's grab a drink.

806
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,380
- Isn't it so pretty? - What?

807
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,180
Stand over there.

808
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,620
Oh, yes.

809
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,690
Hey, I said we should grab a
drink. Why did you bring me here?

810
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,460
I...

811
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,830
come here often when I'm stressed out.

812
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,570
How old do you think this place is?

813
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,400
When I'm sitting here,

814
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,870
I think, "My worries are
just fleeting thoughts."

815
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,270
I think that to myself.

816
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,910
- Well, all right. - I'll take it now.

817
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,580
- One, two, three. - Hey.

818
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,220
Do you know why work is stressful?

819
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,819
I don't know.

820
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,990
It's stressful because you
don't know how it works.

821
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,390
Once you get to know how it works,

822
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,260
it stops being stressful,

823
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,830
but it kills you.

824
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,160
Can you come down?

825
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,140
(Delivery King)

826
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,339
(Delivery King)

827
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,580
So, what are you working on now?

828
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,750
I'm playing a game.

829
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,650
Not that.

830
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,490
I'm talking about the M and A.

831
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,190
We're trying to buy the
company that made this game.

832
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,530
Why buy that company?

833
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,200
I don't know, okay?

834
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,270
Why are you venting your anger at me?

835
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,140
- Hyeong Seop. - What?

836
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,040
You won't betray me, will you?

837
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,710
Betray you?

838
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,280
It's...

839
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,410
tough because I'm no good yet.

840
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,780
Mr. Yoon isn't giving me a hard time.

841
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,780
Don't tell anyone.

842
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Gosh.

843
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,050
That's a given.

844
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Mr. Yoon...

845
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,930
seems to be a nice person.

846
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,060
And he's competent.

847
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,470
Hey.

848
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,200
Don't let him fool you, okay?

849
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,470
All people are selfish.

850
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,310
But your team manager...

851
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,910
is selfish in a complicated way.

852
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,680
Those are the scariest people.

853
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,950
Be careful.

854
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,920
What do you mean by that?

855
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,590
In other words...

856
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,420
He sees others as simply bad...

857
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,090
and himself as complexly good.

858
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,230
That's who your team manager is.

859
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,600
Jin Soo. You see,

860
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,100
if you're going to be selfish,
at least be honest about it.

861
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,270
Right?

862
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,209
Instead of secretly doing everything,

863
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,280
it's better to do it openly.

864
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,060
Hello, Director? Yes.

865
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,690
Yes, it's CHACHA Games.

866
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,230
That's right. The company that makes games.

867
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,100
That's their next target.

868
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,470
I'm not sure about that.

869
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,740
Yes.

870
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,040
Okay. Yes. Please call anytime.

871
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,719
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness.

872
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,680
- Mr. David. - Director Ha.

873
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,360
Right. He's Director Song,
the future of Samoel Fund.

874
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
You know him, yes?

875
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:54,360
Of course. There's no
way I wouldn't know him.

876
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,500
- Take a seat. - Sure.

877
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,970
You can just call me Teo.

878
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,940
Director Teo...

879
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,539
was extremely strict...

880
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,180
when Sanin used convertible bonds.

881
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,879
It caused our chairman to fly into a rage.

882
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,380
Persuading him wasn't
easy at all, you know?

883
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,449
My apologies for back then.

884
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,759
I was simply trying to
protect my clients' money.

885
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,790
Of course.

886
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,160
I totally understand the fund's situation.

887
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,460
Here. Have a glass.

888
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,900
- Mr. David. - Thank you.

889
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,870
Well, that was all in the past.

890
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,169
We should live in the present.

891
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,170
Exactly.

892
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,210
What I meant was that
having you was reliable.

893
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,849
Let's sail smoothly together this time.

894
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,210
Let's do it.

895
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,590
Nice.

896
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,090
By the way,

897
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,219
I heard what we were taking over...

898
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,390
was Yoon Joo No's.

899
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,190
That's right.

900
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,630
Will it be all right?

901
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,730
Don't worry. We've got you, don't we?

902
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,970
But it's best to be careful.

903
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,570
You know Yoon Joo No
isn't your average man.

904
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:11,900
What is he like?

905
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,470
Remember JUMBO Pharmaceuticals?

906
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,840
He's the one who ruined them.

907
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,509
That guy's the one who ruined
JUMBO Pharmaceuticals?

908
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,510
Yes.

909
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,149
I guess you wouldn't
know as you were in the US.

910
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,550
That was Yoon Joo No's doing.

911
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,120
And here's the witness.

912
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,290
Was he not questioned by the prosecutors?

913
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
He was.

914
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,960
That's why he fled overseas.

915
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,159
Thanks to blocking corporate-level news...

916
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,730
and people keeping quiet about it,

917
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,030
not many know about it.

918
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,840
But little did I imagine
he'd return to Korea.

919
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,970
Is he shameless or just
courageous? Who knows?

920
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,710
He could've fled from the US.

921
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,410
Many return after running away overseas.

922
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,409
Well, he must've used up...

923
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,980
all his fortune to cover that incident up.

924
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,080
I'm sure his family went down too.

925
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,050
Go bankrupt, and most men get divorced.

926
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,190
Good grief. Money is
a terrifying existence.

927
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,150
Hello?

928
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Oh Woon.

929
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,050
It's Dad.

930
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,490
You're doing well, yes?

931
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,490
Dad...

932
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,400
is doing fine.

933
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,270
Oh Woon. Who is it?

934
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Hello?

935
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,070
Hey. It's me.

936
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,570
Right.

937
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,710
How is it over there? All good?

938
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Yes.

939
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,020
I'm going to see my brother this week.

940
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,920
Should I take a photo?

941
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,090
Sure.

942
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,470
Listen.

943
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,670
Yes?

944
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,400
Don't call yourself Dad to Oh Woon.

945
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,380
I'm hanging up. Take care.

946
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Okay.

947
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,009
High Square is DC's cash cow,

948
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,509
ensuring stable earnings.

949
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,479
The money is then reinvested
into game development,

950
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,410
resulting in a virtuous cycle.

951
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,420
High Square is the
engine that's operating DC.

952
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,090
Correct. Thanks to it,

953
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,120
the new games see results.

954
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,760
The stock price jumped recently.

955
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,130
Did DC announce a new game?

956
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,859
No. It's because of the photo
CEO Do Han Chul uploaded...

957
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,100
onto his social media.

958
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,500
Let's see.

959
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,699
It looked like he landed
a government project,

960
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,740
but...

961
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,400
it was simply clickbait.

962
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,880
The CEO is known for
his unpredictable behavior.

963
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,779
Shareholders even signed a petition...

964
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,980
demanding he quit social media.

965
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,710
I see. Great work.

966
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,150
Oh, right. You're moving today, yes?

967
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,490
Yes. I'm almost completely moved in.

968
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,020
I sent some move-in gifts.

969
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,430
See you tomorrow.

970

dishwasher, and microwave, right?

974
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,370
Yoon Joo No. Do I have the right person?

975
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,710
Oh, I see.

976
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,250
Shall I install the dishwasher over there?

977
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,879
Yes, please.

What are batchmates for?
To help out at a time like this.

991
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,049
But didn't you quit after trashing...

I thought of going to the press.

But worried my kind
batchmates would get the blame,

996
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,319
I wrote it on the message board.

997
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,960
- Can I have this? - Sure, whatever.

998
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,530
Here's what happened.

999
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,669
The prosecution also
advised CEO Cha Ho Jin...

1000
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,570
to pursue a civil lawsuit.

1001
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,969
However, CEO Cha Ho Jin...

1002
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,770
is suing for theft,

1003
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,539
claiming DC's Do Han Chul broke into...

1004
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,880
CHACHA Games.

1005
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,580
DC's CEO broke into CHACHA Games?

1006
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,210
Putting everything aside,

1007
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,780
it's absurd...

1008
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,020
a game company's CEO would
break into another company.

1009
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,590
But Cha Ho Jin insisted
he had hard evidence.

1010
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,020
So, I told him to bring it over.

1011
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,059
He brought a bunch of codes,

1012
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,860
declaring it to be blockchain
or something and the evidence.

1013
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,730
Good grief.

1014
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,969
Prosecutors don't even
know how to use Excel.

1015
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,770
As if they'd know blockchain.

1016
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,069
Looking down on the prosecutors...

1017
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,340
is the reason you quit.

1018
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,209
And so? Did you ask the Digital Team?

1019
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,240
I did.

1020
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,210
But there were no traces of hacking.

1021
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,620
Apparently, blockchain
records everything as evidence.

1022
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,719
But nothing was there,

1023
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,950
suggesting he was innocent.

1024
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,690
True.

1025
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,490
The CCTV installed to catch the criminal...

1026
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,329
proved the criminal's innocence.

1027
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,330
Exactly.

1028
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,030
But Cha Ho Jin claims
that's evidence of breaking in.

1029
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,730
What does that mean?

1030
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,970
I don't know. He says the
absence of evidence is the evidence.

1031
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,670
But it's ridiculous, right?

1032
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,040
DC released a game similar to CHACHA's.

1033
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,009
But with no traces of hacking,

1034
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,380
DC Games had stolen it physically?

1035
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,750
Yes.

1036
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,479
The argument that DC's CEO himself...

1037
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,220
had broken into is outrageous.

1038
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,950
Reversing his statement...

1039
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,120
made it less credible.

1040
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,060
Mr. Cha insisted he said so from the start,

1041
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,860
but it was dismissed.

1042
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,930

- I do. - What a fool.

- Yes. - You're no smartie pants.

00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,040
- Is there such a rumor? - Yes.

1075
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,840
Well, I don't want to boast or anything.

1076
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,910
But in terms of development
level and experience,

1077
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,950
we are at the top of the industry.

1078
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,280
Right. That's what I've heard.

1079
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,090
How about...

1080
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,260
working with me?

1081
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
With what?

1082
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:28,760
With Sanin's capital and
DC's technology combined,

1083
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,760
wouldn't it be a huge success?

1084
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,300
The rumor is false.

1085
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,000
We're not doing games.

1086
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,870
Don't let me down.

1087
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,240
You do know how much DC is worth, right?

1088
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,980
Of course.

1089
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,350
We only came to greet
Mr. Yoon today, didn't we?

1090
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,020
I should go since that's done.

1091
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,690
Mr. Yoon. Let's meet as friends next time,

1092
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,390
not for business.

1093
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,860
I'm fine with that.

1094
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Thank you.

1095
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,770
- I'll see you again next time. - Yes.

1096
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,550
If there's no deal, how about you and I...

1097
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,050
He's a huge jerk.

1098
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:24,980
Sorry?

1099
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,990
It's nothing.

1100
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,990
I put you in the spot by asking
you to introduce him to me, right?

1101
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,830
Don't worry about it. It's all business.

1102
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,029
Exactly. I thought you
two were actually close...

1103
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,200
when you said you were friends with him.

1104
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,110
(Sanin)

1105
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,490
Did he come knowing that we
were interested in CHACHA?

1106
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,399
- Who came? - Welcome.

1107
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,330
CEO Do Han Chul of DC stopped by.

1108
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,399
But how?

1109
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,070
Director Kang must've told him.

1110
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,770
And how did he know about it?

1111
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,440
I asked him...

1112
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,610
how much DC would need to create a game.

1113
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,850
Yes, Director Kang. You're on speakerphone.

1114
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,620
Okay. Right.

1115
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,119
As you mentioned, he's
very interested in investments.

1116
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,059
When I brought up Sanin, he
wanted to meet you right away.

1117
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,290
I'm grateful you came.

1118
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,960
How was he? Not that pleasant, right?

1119
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm not sure.

1120
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,970
But does DC need an investment?

1121
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,900
They must have sufficient funds.

1122
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,910
DC's stock price went up recently.

1123
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,309
The cause was him
uploading a social media post...

1124
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,539
as if he secured a
government support project.

1125
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,880
It'll soon drop again.

1126
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,620
But he wants to maintain that price.

1127
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,979
Correct.

1128
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,790
Why? Are stock options involved?

1129
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,189
Is it to sell his stocks
when the price is high?

1130
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,190
No. Rather than that...

1131
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,260
I think there's no particular reason.

1132
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:17,860
No reason?

1133
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,829
Yes.

1134
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:23,470
He just seems to want to
maintain the market cap ranking.

1135
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,269
Mr. Do tends to think of it...

1136
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,040
like a game score ranking.

1137
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,140

He chose DC after getting rejected by us.

1145

(Sanin)

1146
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,310
Sanin must be signing the
contract with Do Han Chul.

1147
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,609
We need to do it, Ho Jin.

1148
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,380
Or DC will take it from us again.

1149
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,060
Hi. You're Team Manager Yoon Joo No, yes?

1150
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
Who are you?

1151
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:20,029
I'm Jouranlist Han Ji Eun
from Jungang Economy.

1152
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,890
Are you free for a quick interview?

1153
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,600
Is there an issue?

1154
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,670
Rumor has it Sanin will make
its way into the game industry.

1155
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,699
Where's the source from?

1156
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,969
Considering Sanin's past nature,

1157
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,309
it's definitely an unconventional move.

1158
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,710
I'm curious about the background,

1159
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,880
since you're directly
handling the M and A process.

1160

1161
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:43,980
Correct?

1162
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,920
Nothing has been set.

1163
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,990
Then, may I use an insider quote saying,

1164
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,330
"Sanin and DC have no affiliation?"

1165
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
No.

1166

the two are affiliated?

"An insider from Sanin
didn't deny the partnership..."

1252
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,940
"with DC Games."

1253
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,850
Are you the insider in the news article?

1254
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,550
You think so?

1255
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,019
CHACHA Games must have seen the post too.

1256
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,090
They asked for ten millionÂ dollars.

1257
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,520
You were the insider.

1258
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,930
Mr. Yoon.

1259
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,459
Did you meet up with the
CEO of DC Games on purpose...

1260
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,600
to start the rumor?

1261
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,430
The CEO came to us
when I hadn't invited him.

1262
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,599
So I didn'tÂ do anythingÂ on purpose.

1263
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,770
That could be a good
excuse for CHACHA Games.

1264
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,909
An excuseÂ for what?

1265
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,940
CHACHA Games...

1266
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,409
isn't selling because the
company is going under.

1267
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,910
They're sellingÂ to beat their rival.

1268
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,650
The CEO kept his pride.

1269
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,050
Oh, right. Jin Soo, did you play the game?

1270
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,720
Oh, the game? Yes, I did.

1271
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,090
But I couldn'tÂ beat the game yet.

1272
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,070
I checkedÂ the email, though.

1273
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,970
What does TSA mean?

1274
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,410
It means the title says it all.

1275
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,410
Is that something young
people use these days?

1276
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,380
Well, the fad is over now.

1277
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,920
TSA.

1278
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,820
The screen is up now.

1279
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,630
This is the back end.

1280
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,530
In other words, it's
Delivery King's program.

1281
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,040
That's what we see when computersÂ bog down.

1282
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,370
Here's what I think.

1283
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,009
The black part is the screen,

1284
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:24,010
and the white things
are the letters. Right?

1285
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,810
What we usuallyÂ see is the front end.

1286
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,210
This is the program
behind the screen, correct?

1287
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,450
Yes. That's right.

1288
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,850
Do developers share this
kind of information with others?

1289
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,220
No. They never do that.

1290
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,660
How shouldÂ I put it?

1291
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,129
If they were fund managers,

1292
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,090
this would be their portfolio.

1293
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,330
Like the recipe of a famous
dish from a popular restaurant.

1294
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,000
Yes, that's it.

1295
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,429
He emailed me his trade secret...

1296
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,430
and his know-how?

1297
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,470
Why did he do that?

1298
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,970
Is it his way of showingÂ his confidence?

1299
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,480
Maybe, this was more like,
"You guys don't know anything."

1300
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,510
I didn't understand that either.
So I asked Jenny for her insight.

1301
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,410
She wanted to explain it in person.

1302
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,320
Did you show this email to her?

1303
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,050
Oh, yes.

1304
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:16,290
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1305
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:23,430
Why do you think CHACHA Games sent us this?

1306
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,570
They revealed their back-end codes.

1307
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,310
- Isn't this just irrational? - Exactly.

1308
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:32,480
We could easilyÂ copy the codes.

1309
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,680
Us?

1310
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:36,480
Well, everyoneÂ can write codes these days.

1311
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,979
Sure.

1312
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,820
I've never seen anyoneÂ do this.

1313
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,320
I thought it had to be 1 of these 2 cases.

1314
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,659
He's either dumb...

1315
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,130
or trusts you too much.

1316
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,890
Or he's looking down on us.

1317
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,200
Well, I don't know about that.

1318
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,530
But anyway, both of my guessesÂ were wrong.

1319
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,670
Then what is it?

1320
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,770
It's the blockchain.

1321
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,980
By blockchain, are you
talking about cryptocurrency?

1322
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:06,310
Yes, that's a blockchainÂ too.

1323
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,779
But as for this blockchain,

1324
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,010
the key point is that it can
prevent possible hacking attempts.

1325
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,049
Records of any access...

1326
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,280
will remain permanently.

1327
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,850
And the records can't be changed.

1328
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,390
So...

1329
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,930
since there would be a
record of us opening the email,

1330
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,790
they felt safe to send over
their asset. Is that right?

1331
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,660
Yes.

1332
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,100
CHACHA Games is tryingÂ to show off.

1333
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,470
Yes. I agree.

1334
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,240
They're showingÂ off...

1335
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,270
- theirÂ blockchain technology? - Yes.

1336
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,610
Using this would revolutionize
inventory management.

1337
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,810
What does this have to do
with inventory management?

1338
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,880
Jin Soo. Could you?

1339
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,729
People say when inventory
check is conducted in the military,

1340
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,660
even the number of
helicopters doesn't match up.

1341
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,269
That shows inventory quantities
are changing every minute...

1342
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,270
and it is difficult to keep
up with the updates.

1343
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:05,900
Well, I'm sure it's the
same way with companies.

1344
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,410
Yes. That's right.

1345
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,210
But you can use this system to
keep your inventory updated...

1346
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,379
because all the departments
in the company can use...

1347
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,310
a single ledger together in real time.

1348
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,320
This might not seem much to you.

1349
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,590
But it will revolutionize
the logistics industry.

1350
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:23,650
Jenny.

1351
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,659
Then do you believe...

1352
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,790
the value of the company
should be reevaluated?

1353
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,630
Yes. Absolutely.

1354
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,660
Okay.

1355
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:37,000
CHACHA Games recently
launched a game called Delivery King.

1356
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,500
It didn't perform well, so the
game is shut down for now.

1357
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,640
However, using this
game's system will allow us...

1358
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,739
to manage everything
from customer orders...

1359
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,180
to product procurement and delivery...

1360
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,610
all in one go.

1361
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,750
What? DeliveryÂ King?

1362
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,689
My gosh. What are you trying to
achieve with a game that flopped?

1363
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,320
This isn't a joke.

1364
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,160
Do you think logisticsÂ is just a game?

1365
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,930
How much?

1366
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,560
They asked for ten millionÂ dollars.

1367
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,030
Ten million?

1368
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,760
I see.

1369
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,800
If I were to get on boardÂ with this,

1370
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,200
would you be able to buy
it with ten million dollars?

1371
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,300
Yes.

1372
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,339
We decided to draft a
binding MOU that grants us...

1373
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,170
exclusiveÂ rights to negotiateÂ with them.

1374
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,139
Once the MOU is signed,
we'll be able to move forward...

1375
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,480
with ten millionÂ dollars.

1376
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,250
When?

1377
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,879
It's today.

1378
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,819
Many speculative articles
have been published as of now.

1379
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,320
- We must hurry. - Okay. Due diligence.

1380
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,990
Let's wrap up for today.

1381
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,920
Ten million?

1382
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:32,459
Why would we waste
ten million dollars on that?

1383
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,590
That's not the point now. Sir.

1384
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,730
Oh, right.

1385
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,000
You'll report this to
the chairman yourself.

1386
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,660
It's not a problem, right?

1387
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,430
DirectorÂ Lee?

1388
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:43,230
Oh, that's not a problem.

1389
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,170
(AcquisitionÂ Plan of CHACHA Games)

1390
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,780
I'll be back after I report
this to the chairman.

1391
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,120
He'll be againstÂ this, right?

1392
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,690
- Probably. - I'm so scared.

1393
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,760
Oh, right. What time is CEO Cha coming in?

1394
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,360
Is our contractÂ ready?

1395
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,700
Yes. He's comingÂ in at 5pm.

1396
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,800
I might be late.

1397
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,600
Please inform him about the delay.

1398
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,120
Is going up to see the
chairman this big of a deal?

1399
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,750
It is a big deal.

1400
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:43,059
Meeting with the decision maker...

1401
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,200
is the most critical
moment in negotiations.

1402
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,930
Things that are above our pay grade...

1403
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
can be finalized at the meeting.

1404
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,170
He could approve acquiring CHACHA Games.

1405
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,040
Or he could dismantleÂ our team.

1406
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,580
Sir, Team ManagerÂ Yoon Joo No is here.

1407
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,450
Come on in.

1408
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,290
Sit down.

1409
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,400
We've never had a 1-on-1
meeting like this, right?

1410
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,900
- This is our secondÂ time. - What?

1411
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,470
I met you 1-on-1 before I left for Hawaii.

1412
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,280
Director Lee wasn't there then?

1413
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,240
No.

1414
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,750
It was just you and me at the meeting.

1415
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:37,250
I see.

1416
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,990
I called you in here...

1417
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,020
to make somethingÂ clear.

1418
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,560
You.

1419
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,730
Are you with me?

1420
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,730
I'm asking you if I can trust you.

1421
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,240
Director Lee said you didn't.

1422
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,610
But didn't you manipulate the stock price?

1423
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,309
If you're talking about
JUMBO Pharmaceuticals...

1424
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,320
Yes.

1425
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,720
You wanted to buy the company.

1426
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,460
Didn't you?

1427
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,759
All right. Let's keep at it.

1428
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,190
- Let's keep at it. - There.

1429
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,100
Goodness.

1430
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,700
So...

1431
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,640
it's about JUMBO.

1432
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,980
You were nowhereÂ near it, right?

1433
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,750
You know, I asked just in case.

1434
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,120
Well, that's a fair question.

1435
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,730
It's not like I don't know how you work.

1436
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,700
Let me only give you the facts.

1437
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,340
If we were to go to my office right now,

1438
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,400
I would be able to show
you Yoon Joo No's report,

1439
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,310
advising the company to
buy JUMBO Pharmaceuticals.

1440
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,710
Really?

1441
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,580
I asked you if you advised
Sanin to buy JUMBO.

1442
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,920
Yes.

1443
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,790
BuyingÂ JUMBO was my idea.

1444
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:26,860
But despite that, you still
claim you did nothing wrong?

1445
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,690
- That's correct. - Then...

1446
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,930
why did your brother hold
so many stocks of JUMBO?

1447
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,970
Why?

1448
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,410
That's why Yoon Joo No was
questioned by the prosecution.

1449
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,770
I see.

1450
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,940
But he managed to avoid servingÂ time.

1451
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,310
That's because he bought the
stocks under his brother's name.

1452
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,680
So he borrowedÂ his brother's name.

1453
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,720
Naturally, the prosecution
questioned his brother first.

1454
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,660
But he died.

1455
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,530
How?

1456
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,360
He took his own life.

1457
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,160
So...

1458
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,670
you're blaming Sanin
for your brother's death?

1459
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,100
Will you take revenge?

1460
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:15,910
No.

1461
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,780
Can you promiseÂ me that?

1462
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,520
Yes.

1463
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,860
If you can promise me that, buy it.

1464
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,290
Pardon?

1465
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,530
You're probably here because
you want to buy a company.

1466
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,530
Yes.

1467
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,170
I want to acquire a gaming
company called CHACHA Games.

1468
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,770
CHACHA Games asked for ten millionÂ dollars.

1469
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,279
If we were to accept the
deal, we'll do due diligence...

1470
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,110
and negotiateÂ the price.

1471
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,279
If there's a non-disclosure agreement...

1472
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,320
Yes.

1473
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,750
Buy it.

1474
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,470
He's runningÂ late, isn't he?

1475
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,170
Should I call him?

1476
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,040
I'll do it.

1477
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,930
Some people don't like
taking calls these days.

1478
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,300
Then should we call his companyÂ instead?

1479
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,340
Sure.

1480
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,280
Is this CHACHA Games?

1481
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,580
This is Kwak Min Jeong from
the M and A Team of Sanin.

1482
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,790
We're supposed to have a
meeting with the CEO today.

1483
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,220
Oh, he alreadyÂ left.

1484
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,220
I see.

1485
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,360
I guess there's traffic.

1486
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,430
He left a while ago.

1487
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,830
Okay. I'm sure he'll be here soon.

1488
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:22,300
Okay, thank you.

1489
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,330
Then I'll proceed with the contract.

1490
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:27,140
But...

1491
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,180
make sure to buy it.

1492
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,040
Understood?

1493
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,350
Yes, sir.

1494
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:39,020
Is there a specialÂ reason for that?

1495
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,420
What reason?

1496
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,120
I'm a businessman. What
other reason could there be?

1497
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,820
Okay. I understand.

1498
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,840
For a con artist,

1499
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,680
he's an awfulÂ liar.

1500
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,450
What happened?

1501
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,450
- We can proceed. - Really?

1502
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:19,790
He didn't scold you?

1503
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,390
I knew you could do it, Mr. Yoon.

1504
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,200
It seems CEO Cha is runningÂ late.

1505
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,199
- I see. - Darn it.

1506
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,700
Are game developersÂ not punctual?

1507
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,040
I guess not.

1508
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,310
I could've been late to the
meeting. It all worked out.

1509
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:40,410
Yes, but still. This is
an important meeting.

1510
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,330
Yes, Mr. Cha.

1511
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:06,170
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.

1512
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,870
Should we reschedule then?

1513
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,310
No. It's not that.

1514
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,650
Another companyÂ offered more money.

1515
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,180
By how much?

1516
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,120
They doubled it.

1517
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,190
I'm sorry.

1518
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:39,270
Messing with someone like
him could give us a headache.

1519
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,440
He'd do anythingÂ to get his way.

1520
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,610
Well, you're right about that.

1521
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,010
But I know all of Yoon Joo No's moves.

1522
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:49,880
Is that so?

1523
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,380
Then what will happen
according to our plan?

1524
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:57,820
It's perfect.

1525
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,390
Hello. Is this CHACHA Games?

1526
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,200
Yes.

1527
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,430
I'm here because I have
an offer for the CEO.

1528
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,900
Is the CEO here?

Ho Jin, it's been a while.

We need to talk. How about over a drink?

01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,170
It's my treat.

1537
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,899
{\an8}They would double our offer.

{\an8}Is that the condition?

{\an8}- This is a setup. - They played me.
