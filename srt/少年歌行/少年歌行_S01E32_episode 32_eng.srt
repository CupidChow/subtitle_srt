22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,050

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,320

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,350
Are you saying

25
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,560
that it was one of us who killed Jin Yu?

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,630
You can't say that.

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,980
I'm not Director Zhuoqing's disciple.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
I don't know anything about the Art of Detachment!

29
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,490
If you don't believe me, you can test me.

30
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,210
But your master isn't dead.

31
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,280
He's Zhuoqing's martial brother.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,810
Over the years, you should've learned something from him, right?

33
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,230
Incense Bearer, this is a groundless presumption.

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,130
Then according to what you said, everyone in the world is suspicious.

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,640
- Is it you, you, you, you, or you? 
 - Shut up!

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,850
My best friend is dead. I'll do everything to avenge him!

37
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,580
Jin Xian!

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,860
I understand that you're upset,

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,430
but you shouldn't have said that.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,860
It was remiss of me.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,990
But I won't take the statement back.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,800
- What did you say? 
 -  His Highness Prince Bai has arrived!

43
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,440
 Your Highness.

44
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,900

45
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,120
Second Master,

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,120
I always imagined what you looked like all these years.

47
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,580
I imagined that you were a hermit who stayed on a mountain,

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,640
a brilliant scholar who wrote a lot of books.

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,840
Unexpectedly, you're still just like what I saw back then.

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,090
Second Master... actually, you weren't all that interesting.

51
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,330
But a world without

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,830
someone like you would be so dull.

53
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,160
My condolences, Your Highness.

54
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,440
I once asked why you chose me.

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,930
Why would you choose a blind prince like me?

56
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,460
And you told me you didn't choose me

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,320
because you hoped that I would ascend the throne

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,640
so that we could enjoy a luxurious life.

59
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,200
But because...

60
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,880
you thought it was worthwhile.

61
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,990
I know why Second Master died.

62
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,550
I can give up the throne,

63
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,720
but the revenge...

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,270
will definitely come.

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,450
Did Second Brother really say that?

66
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
It's hilarious.

67
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,660
I told you back then that Prince Bai has always been cautious.

68
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,250
He won't take action if the situation is uncertain.

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,700
We can only forgo this pawn. Do not act rashly.

70
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,190
Are you blaming me, Director?

71
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,710
Your Highness, you don't regret it?

72
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,480
I want to ascend the throne, but it wasn't an easy path to begin with.

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,240
Since I've made the choice, I won't regret any step I take.

74
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,880
Director, you should figure out what to do next.

75
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,320
I've already planned everything out.

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,610
Your Highness, you should stay behind the scenes to map out a strategy.

77
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,260
So I found you a person to spearhead the operation.

78
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,880
Who is it?

79
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,580
The real successor to the throne.

80
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,760
It's him?

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,100
He's still alive?

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,570
General, you have guests.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,220
I won't see them.

84
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,810
Shush.

85
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,160
Hello, General.

86
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
Leave us.

87
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,270
Yes, Sir.

88
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,320
General, I'm sorry to offend you.

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,450
Among the Five Eunuchs, you're the only one who looks right to me.

90
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,390
The rest either look like scholars

91
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,060
or like some sort of young master.

92
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,280
Then... what about me?

93
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,000
You look obedient and have a flattering smile.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,220
I can tell that you're a treacherous official.

95
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,510
But you're fit to be a eunuch.

96
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,430
General, you must be joking.

97
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,360
Enough, go on with it.

98
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,440
What do you have to see me about?

99
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,480
If it wasn't something important,

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,240
barging into the General's Residence is no small matter.

101
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,390
Of course, I'm here because of an important matter.

102
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,180
Now that Emperor Mingde is severely ill,

103
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,270
a new Dragon Seal Scroll will be written sooner or later.

104
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,100
A talented person chooses a patron of integrity.

105
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,310
Since every sector in Tianqi City is picking a good master for itself,

106
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,010
I'm here to ask about your choice.

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,890
You've got some nerve.

108
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,330
You're publicly starting a partisan dispute. It's a capital crime.

109
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,640
However, only the losing side will die.

110
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,490
Didn't His Majesty ascend the throne with the help of a partisan dispute back then?

111
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,840
My daughter has made the choice for me already.

112
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,220
Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

113
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,970
All of Tianqi City is aware of my choice.

114
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,980
Even His Majesty wouldn't doubt this.

115
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,610
Your choice is between Prince Bai, Prince Chi, and Prince Yong'an.

116
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,040
You indeed have no choice if they're the only three candidates.

117
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,210
But what if I offer you another choice?

118
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,510
A... better choice.

119
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,780
What are you trying to say exactly?

120
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,480
What I just said,

121
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,020
was from the bottom of my heart.

122
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,830
What have you got?

123
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,780
As you expected, a scroll.

124
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,120
The name on the scroll is also as you expected.

125
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,000
Where is the scroll?

126
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,140
General, you've underestimated me.

127
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,820
How could I bring such an important thing with me?

128
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,780
Even if you have the scroll, it can't change everything.

129
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,900
General... you've been in the military since age sixteen.

130
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:52,070
Going from a little patrol captain to Beili's great General.

131
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,520
However, the two old friends of yours have already left you.

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,360
One of them died on the battlefield.

133
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,540
Even his body is unable to return to his homeland!

134
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,720
Another one died at the execution ground

135
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,020
and was even persecuted for a serious crime!

136
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,800
General, don't you want to do something for these two?

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,910
I'm not a very patient man.

138
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,940
Just finish what you want to say.

139
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,900
I've found you the best choice.

140
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,490
With just one order from the General,

141
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,060
march to Tianqi,

142
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,740
and it's all within our grasp.

143
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,810

144
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,810
I suspect that it's Head Eunuch Jin Xuan of the Five Eunuchs,

145
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,470
the top master in the imperial city.

146
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,350
How sure are you about it?

147
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,330
Ninety percent.

148
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,750
You can tell Prince Bai about this.

149
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,990
Killing Jin Yu is tantamount to pushing Prince Bai to our side.

150
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,390
No rush. It's not time yet.

151
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,180
When the time comes, I'll naturally make them pay for this.

152
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,840
I've given that drop of blood that Consort Xuan gave to Hua Jin.

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,800
Hua Jin said she needs two-weeks time to derive a pill.

154
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,390
But, Prince Chi never gives others a chance to catch a breath.

155
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,750
Next, he'll use an even more drastic measure to turn the tide.

156
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,200
All right, let's stop talking about that.

157
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,430
Let's talk about something more casual.

158
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,460
Qianluo seems to like you.

159
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,490
Lei Wujie really likes you.

160
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,680
I didn't expect you to change the subject too.

161
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,190
I just think you're wrong.

162
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,540
What's wrong?

163
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,720
Not "seems.” She does like me.

164
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,640
Xiao Se, even though you changed your name, you're as shameless as ever.

165
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,410
But Lei Wujie seems to think that you like me.

166
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,940
You're even more shameless than before!

167
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,710
Ruoyi, actually, I know you like Lei Wujie too.

168
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,230
I knew it when you danced with him at the Flora Spectacle.

169
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,080
There's a very primitive and purest quality of a man on Lei Wujie.

170
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,440
We once had the quality before.

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,750
But due to various reasons, we let go of it.

172
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,060
Only he still has it.

173
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,600
Wu Xin once said he was born with a pure heart.

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,830
What about you? Do you like Qianluo?

175
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,930
I don't see a connection between these two matters.

176
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,040
Tianqi City is currently in tumult,

177
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
but we still have the mood to chit-chat with each other.

178
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
If this gets out, you're not afraid we'll be laughed at?

179
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,210
You changed the subject again.

180
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,910
If I was overly fond of romance, I would've gotten married four years ago.

181
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,770
She's got a pretty face and a beautiful body. Besides, she's a bit wayward.

182
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,770
She's definitely a prize.

183
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,490
You sound like a lecher watching courtesans at Drunken Dream House.

184
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,980
Well, do you like Qianluo?

185
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,700
I do.

186
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,900
I have work to do, so if you'll excuse me.

187
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,120
You're here.

188
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,730
Your Majesty.

189
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,790
Thank you.

190
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,570
Take a seat.

191
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,990
Divine Healer, I heard that you caught a cold a while ago.

192
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,180
How are you now? Feeling better?

193
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,040
Of course. It was just a cold, how could it trouble me much?

194
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,920
You're the Divine Healer. How did you catch a cold?

195
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,320
Your Majesty, I'll give you acupuncture therapy later.

196
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:52,380
Divine Healer, you've been sticking so many needles in my body these days.

197
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,040
Is it that hard to cure my disease?

198
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,010
Your Majesty, do you know what a healer always says?

199
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,390
What is it?

200
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,040
If a mental illness can't be cured, all diseases will be difficult to cure.

201
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,000
Something is bothering you.

202
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,350
I can't cure this.

203
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,700
"If a mental illness can't be cured, all diseases will be difficult to cure."

204
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,170
I understand what you're saying.

205
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,070
It doesn't help to understand. It needs to be cured.

206
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,390
Whoever started the trouble should end it.

207
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,820
Your Majesty, who is your problem solver?

208
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,990
- He's dead. 
 - He's dead?

209
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes.

210
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,090
He was my closest brother.

211
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,000
Our mother died when we were very young.

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,740
Although we were princes,

213
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,400
we were never pampered.

214
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,950
Even the eunuchs with some power would dare to pick on us.

215
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,130
 Physician, please go back and save him!

216
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,250
 Your Highness. Don't go! I can't.

217
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,470
 When my younger brother was six,

218
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,820
he caught a severe cold.

219
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,450
After being treated for so long, it was never cured.

220
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,380
Then when he was almost dead...

221
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,790
 Save my brother, won't you?

222
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,130
 Your Highness, it's not that I don't want to treat him.

223
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,730
 There's nothing I can do, either.

224
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,390
 My hands are tied.

225
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,960
 Save him, please!

226
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,060
 Your Highness, please go back.

227
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,730
Is that the day he died?

228
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,440
The rumors out there say,

229
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,040
on that snowy night,

230
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,580
I had knelt at the door and begged that imperial physician for four hours.

231
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,130
I was a less coddled prince.

232
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,530
But kneeling to an imperial physician

233
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,760
wasn't something he could afford.

234
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,630
In the end, I saved my brother from death.

235
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,450
Your Majesty, you're a righteous man.

236
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,650
But that was fake.

237
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,920
It was a story I told the imperial physician to spread to the world.

238
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,680
What really happened was that

239
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,400
I had been kneeling for four hours that night.

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,450
But he still insisted on leaving.

241
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,590
So I drew the long sword my mother left for me

242
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,890
and stabbed him with it!

243
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,310
From that moment on, I swore

244
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,350
I would never be a prince who was a nobody.

245
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,110
I would never be trodden underfoot by others again.

246
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,590
I wanted to reach the top of Tianqi with my younger brother.

247
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,230
So that everyone wouldn't dare look down on us.

248
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,580
Then, I became the Emperor.

249
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,600
My brother...

250
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
became Beili's Governor-in-Chief.

251
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,920
Not to mention Tianqi, even Beili and the entire world would be afraid of us.

252
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,280
But in the end...

253
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,040
my brother still died.

254
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm the one who killed him.

255
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,410
It was all because...

256
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,230
I couldn't gather my courage,

257
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,970
and I was afraid of losing the material things I had.

258
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,360
Your Majesty, why didn't you call yourself the lonely Emperor?

259
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,210
The lonely Emperor?

260
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:07,140
Maybe... every time when I think of my brother, Ruofeng,

261
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,420
I see myself

262
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,880
not as an emperor,

263
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,600
but as an older brother.

264
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,930
Only when the younger brother was around,

265
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,150
the elder brother would never feel lonely.

266
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,830
Uncle Pichuan, are you tired of living such a dull life?

267
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,930
What do you think?

268
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,210
This blade of mine is getting rusty.

269
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,400
I kind of miss Tianqi.

270
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,830
I'd like to gamble at Qianjin Gambling House, then have a drink at Diaolou Parlor,

271
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,150
and take a nap at Rainbow and Moon Pavilion.

272
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,390
You have no ambition.

273
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,310
How did His Highness have a son like you?

274
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm just kidding.

275
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,180
It seems like we can only be summoned back when Xiao Se becomes the Emperor.

276
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,450
That's not necessarily the case. We can go back on our own.

277
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,710
Based on the latest news, Emperor Mingde has been severely ill lately.

278
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,390
Severely ill?

279
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,850
Do you have some ideas, Your Highness?

280
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,950

281
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,470
The fire that brings us back to Tianqi is finally here.

282
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,380
It's not Xiao Se who lit it, but sometimes fate is strange.

283
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,190
Everything comes to me when I want to go back.

284
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,430
Well, then let's go. Let's get ready and march to Tianqi!

285
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,810
You're up late. Are you waiting for some kind of good news?

286
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,010
I'm sure it's not good news since you're here.

287
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,590
Fine. Since you put it this way, I'll leave right now.

288
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,160
- I won't cause trouble for you. 
 - I was joking.

289
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,630
Your best friend has laid dormant for years.

290
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,960
He seems a little restless recently.

291
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,850
Are they coming back?

292
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,940
Yes. But you don't look surprised.

293
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,160
Based on our enemy's ways of doing things,

294
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,910
once the time comes, they would take this step.

295
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,470
But what is it that attracts them?

296
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,810
It's not known.

297
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,150
Bai Xiao Sect only found out that before this, Jin Yan went to the General's Residence.

298
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,880
Then, the General secretly sent 16 secret agents out of the city.

299
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,200
It should be the Dragon Seal Scroll.

300
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,310
What's the Dragon Seal Scroll?

301
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,700
Back then, during the Eight Princes Rebellion,

302
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,560
each prince barged into the palace and went all the way to Pingqing Hall.

303
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,150
They were all waiting for the dying late emperor to send out the Dragon Seal Scroll,

304
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,870
each hoping their name was written on it.

305
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,690
But only Prince Langya and Emperor Mingde won in the end.

306
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,010
But when they were about to step into Pingqing Hall, the Five Eunuchs came out with the scroll.

307
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,990
Was Emperor Mingde's name written on the scroll?

308
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,100
The Five Eunuchs refused to announce it despite holding the scroll.

309
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,890
At last, Prince Langya stepped forward and took the scroll.

310
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,870
He tore it up immediately after taking a glance at it.

311
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,390
Then, he announced that the throne was passed to the Third Prince, Xiao Ruojin,

312
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,540
which is the present Emperor Mingde.

313
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,450
It means it wasn't Xiao Se's father's name that was written on the scroll.

314
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,090
- Otherwise, why would he tear it up? 
 - Right.

315
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,760
But the Five Eunuchs who were in charge of this chose to remain silent.

316
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,980
So, no one continued to pursue this matter.

317
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,810
But there are two Dragon Seal Scrolls.

318
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,770
One of them is guarded by the Five Eunuchs. It means to declare the decree.

319
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,520
Another one is guarded by the Directorate of Astronomy. It means to accept Heaven's will.

320
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,160
After one of the scrolls was torn, another one should have been sent to the Directorate of Astronomy.

321
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,950
But it just disappeared mysteriously.

322
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,450
Why did the Five Eunuchs allow him to do it?

323
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,430
There's only one possibility.

324
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,340
It was Imperial Uncle Langya's name that was written on the scroll.

325
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,880
He tore the edict that had his own name on it.

326
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,190
The Five Eunuchs couldn't stop him.

327
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,150
But several years later,

328
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,750
Prince Langya established brilliant achievements in war. The people respected him.

329
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,770
And that missing scroll suddenly reappeared.

330
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,800
Prince Langya didn't want to take the throne,

331
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,330
but there were growing voices in the Imperial Court, the army, and civil society that wanted him to be the emperor.

332
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,360
The person who hid that scroll was preparing to make the brothers turn against each other,

333
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,560
so he could achieve his goal.

334
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,080
The new emperor took the throne.

335
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,490
The Five Eunuchs of the late Emperor were going to guard the mausoleum.

336
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,800
But Director Zhuoqing was extremely powerful at that time.

337
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,650
So he naturally wouldn't be pleased with that.

338
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,250
From the very beginning, he hid the Dragon Seal Scroll and waited for that day to stage a coup.

339
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,300
I'm guessing he was the one who caused Prince Langya's case.

340
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,840
He just didn't expect Uncle Langya to die at the execution ground

341
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,960
before he could reveal the scroll.

342
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,740
And he died at the mausoleum a month later.

343
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,850
Bai Xiao Sect didn't find out about this at all.

344
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,480
Because it was Jin Xuan who hurt me back then.

345
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
And Jin Xuan was the closest disciple of Zhuoqing.

346
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,360
After Zhuoqing died, the Dragon Seal Scroll went missing again.

347
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,260
I think it's most likely in his hands.

348
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,420
And Jin Yan is Jin Xuan's most powerful helper among the Five Eunuchs.

349
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,560
Since he could persuade the general,

350
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,100
besides knowing the whereabouts of Imperial Uncle Langya's old army,

351
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,180
he should have enough leverage to do that.

352
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,220
The only thing I can think of is the Dragon Seal Scroll.

353
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,630
I don't get it.

354
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,740
Isn't the general Ye Ruoyi's father?

355
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,280
Hasn't he always been on our side?

356
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,270
Ye Xiaoying was the most loyal subordinate of Prince Langya.

357
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,790
He has waited for this moment for so long.

358
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,910
Unfortunately, our goal is the same,

359
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,190
but what we choose might be very different.

360
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,775

361
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,630

362
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,750

363
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,170
Daughter.

364
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,970
I was 17 when I first met him.

365
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,830
I was the son of a butcher in Tianqi.

366
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,840
That time, I took a butcher knife and looked at him.

367
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,480
He told me when I was slaughtering hogs and goats,

368
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,430
he saw an aura of a protector in me.

369
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,540
He asked if I would be willing to protect the nation with him.

370
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,880
Yet, I responded with, "Buying meat? If not, get lost!"

371
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,240
Then later, I became a patrol captain.

372
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,920
Then even later, I became the vice general of the Pioneer Battalion.

373
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,040
There was one time, we were surrounded by the enemy.

374
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,270
The entire Pioneer Battalion was wiped out.

375
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,520
I was taking my last breath.

376
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,600
And he was the one who got me out of the pile of bodies.

377
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,080
That was when I swore I would die for him.

378
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,010
I've never heard you tell this story before.

379
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,470
It was... a long time ago.

380
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,710
And then, I became General of the Cavalry, Commander in Chief, and then Generalissimo.

381
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,240
The late Emperor bestowed a golden armor on me

382
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,010
and gave me the title of Golden Armor General.

383
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,270
But I was still willing to be

384
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,990
the subordinate who followed his lead.

385
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,170
But that day... he died.

386
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,170
He didn't die on the battlefield,

387
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,230
but at the execution ground.

388
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,470
A month before that happened,

389
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,860
Prince Langya suddenly condemned me.

390
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,240
He took away my military token as a result of my lax control of the army.

391
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,020
I know.

392
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,520
Emperor Mingde only didn't kill me to prevent mutiny.

393
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,850
He saved this position for me just to comfort me.

394
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,510
Over the years, I've indeed pretended to be comforted.

395
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,770
So the entire world knows that I, Ye Xiaoying,

396
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,670
hold a grudge against the emperor due to Prince Langya's death.

397
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:05,210
But because I'm afraid of the emperor, I dare not revolt.

398
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:12,330
This is the outcome that everyone wanted.

399
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,430
Well then... I'll just keep acting.

400
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,075

401
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,090
Father, why are you so emotional tonight?

402
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,840
Ruoyi, today, I'll send a team of elite soldiers to escort you out of the city.

403
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
Stay away from Tianqi for a while.

404
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
Why?

405
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,800
His condition is getting worse.

406
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,610
He'll die at anytime.

407
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:48,630
Moreover, the princes in Tianqi City are engaged in a fierce fight.

408
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,540
I'm afraid there will be upheaval.

409
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,760
Upheaval?

410
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,440
When have you ever been afraid of upheaval?

411
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,570
Isn't that what you always wanted?

412
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,560
You acquiesced to my decision to help Xiao Se.

413
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,100
Why would you suddenly send me out of the city?

414
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,630
Fine. Let me ask you.

415
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:21,970
Did Xiao Chuhe enter Tianqi to become the emperor

416
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,730
or to investigate the case from back then?

417
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,480
From what I know of him, he's naturally here for the case.

418
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,140
That's it then.

419
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,010
Xiao Chuhe never understood this.

420
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,630
Only the Emperor can find out the truth of this case.

421
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,260
It's impossible for an official to turn against the emperor.

422
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,690
Therefore, in the battle between him and Prince Chi,

423
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,820
I don't think he'll win.

424
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,460
But you used to clearly value him before.

425
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,950
I valued him because I wanted to watch over him.

426
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,810
Just like how I watched over Prince Langya back then.

427
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,740
He's got the ability and the guts,

428
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,220
but he's not ruthless enough.

429
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,510
What happened to Prince Langya in the end?

430
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,790
Prince Langya died.

431
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,060
He was killed by his own brother!

432
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,390
I don't want to see the same thing happen again.

433
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,420
Just because Xiao Se never accepted your support?

434
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,850
Ruoyi, there's one thing you must understand.

435
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,040
He's Xiao Ruojin's son, after all.

436
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,940
No matter what, Prince Langya was just his uncle.

437
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,750
He's done well enough.

438
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,200
Prince Langya was right about him too.

439
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,450
But I

440
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,340
don't want to wait any longer.

441
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,630
I don't agree with you.

442
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,080
Since you believe that it's right, just stay the course.

443
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,440
I know what you're thinking.

444
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,220
You've endured for years.

445
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,790
You only held back what you didn't write down,

446
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,220
but that thing was wrong to begin with.

447
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,270
Ruoyi!

448
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,100
Ruoyi!

449
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,640
They're still just children!

450
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,425

451
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,500

452
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,075

453
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,610
I heard that you moved to Snowfall Mountain Villa last night.

454
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,170
Not just yesterday.

455
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,590
From now on, I'll be staying here.

456
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,070
Did you have a fight with your father?

457
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,510
This is new.

458
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,820
Since childhood, I've never seen General Ye say anything harsh to you.

459
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,350
He said something strange to me yesterday.

460
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,740
What did he say?

461
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,340
He doesn't think you'll win in the Battle of Tianqi.

462
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,370
He even said if you stay as an official, no matter how determined you are,

463
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,720
you still can't exonerate Prince Langya.

464
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,740
It looks like what worried me the most has already happened.

465
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,020
You mean the Dragon Seal Scroll?

466
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,880
You didn't say this to your father's face, did you?

467
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,260
Of course not.

468
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,340
If he had known we were looking into this, he wouldn't have let me leave.

469
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,560
He must have accepted that scroll.

470
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,320
My guess is next he'll gather the Langya Army and contact Xiao Lingchen to start the rebellion.

471
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,830
That's what I'm guessing as well.

472
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,690
But hearing you say this, it means this will happen for sure.

473
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,630
This will be the biggest rebellion since the establishment of Beili.

474
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,170
Hundreds of thousands of cavalries will set foot on the entire land and march towards Tianqi.

475
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,950
Countless citizens will suffer because of this.

476
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,630
The nations that lay dormant around Beili will take this chance to make a move.

477
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,490
But I don't understand.

478
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,980
What good is it to Prince Chi if the Langya Army rebels?

479
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,700
Why would the Dragon Seal Scroll appear at this very moment?

480
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,970
Why would they go to your father right when it appeared?

481
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,190
If Xiao Lingchen eventually ascends the throne, Prince Langya has his place back at the ancestral shrine.

482
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,530
What good does that do them?

483
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,800
I still can't figure this out yet.

484
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,180
But there's one thing for sure. This is definitely a trap.

485
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,680
I believe your father could figure this out.

486
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,170
But he'll still fall for it. Because he's a man with a strong ego.

487
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,170
He has no doubts about himself.

488
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:57,040
Even if he was trapped in a cage, he could still kill the sick tiger and leave without injury.

489
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,860
In the end, he would kill the hunter.

490
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,360
Indeed, he has always been conceited.

491
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,850
But this ego will eventually get him killed.

492
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,900
He'll drag the entire Langya Army and Xiao Lingchen down.

493
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,470
Even if he wins in the end, it'll also cause Beili to suffer a heavy loss.

494
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,310

495
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,350
The general has made a move?

496
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,880
Yes. Today, he has secretly left the city.

497
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,060
I thought it would take him a long time to make this decision.

498
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:44,490
Perhaps, he already made this decision four years ago.

499
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,100
He was just waiting for a chance. Now that the chance has come.

500
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,270
There's no need to hesitate anymore.

501
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,540
What were the terms?

502
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,230
I said I want a new emperor, the old rules to be abolished,

503
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,730
the Five Eunuchs not to guard the mausoleum anymore,

504
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,250
and him to give me the title of marquis.

505
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,770
Did he agree?

506
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,330
He accused me of being a cunning subordinate, trying to be the powerful official from the previous dynasty.

507
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,760
But in the end, he still agreed, didn't he?

508
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,490
Your Highness, Ye Xiaoying wouldn't sense something, would he?

509
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,030
Don't be silly. Ye Xiaoying isn't an ordinary soldier.

510
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,880
Of course, he sensed something.

511
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,610
He just didn't expect me to be the mastermind behind all this.

512
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,700
Longxie, go tell the two generals

513
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:43,520
that the day when they replace Ye Xiaoying and become the leaders of the Beili Army is about to arrive.

514
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,380
His Majesty evicted all the siblings from here except for me.

515
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,540
Do you know why?

516
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,600
Because you were raised by Imperial Father.

517
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,700
The other uncles were no match for you.

518
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,910
To be more specific, it's because His Majesty knew I wouldn't steal the throne from him.

519
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,580
The other princes were ambitious and ill-intentioned.

520
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,450
It would be trouble if they stayed in Tianqi.

521
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,650
As for me, he trusted me.

522
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,500
Prince Langya wouldn't do that either, so he trusted him as well.

523
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,090
It takes years to build this kind of trust.

524
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,330
Not something that happens overnight.

525
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,770
Then why did that incident happen four years ago?

526
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:54,600
One... changes when he takes the throne.

527
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,550
Besides, Langya was too much like an excellent emperor.

528
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:09,920
Historically speaking, those who rise too high won't end up well.

529
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:18,310
That's to say, even though you're full of talent,

530
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:24,980
you pretend to be a good-for-nothing just to cover yourself?

531
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,030
No.

532
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,400
I've always been a philanderer who likes poems, liquor, and beautiful ladies.

533
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,940
I'm not faking it. This is me.

534
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,620
Nephew, I worked hard when I supervised the nation.

535
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,000
I didn't make a single mistake.

536
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,730
The officials complimented me as well.

537
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,020
What you said to me was harsh.

538
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,130
Since you care about the nation and the people, let me tell you something then.

539
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,830
What is it?

540
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,530
In fifteen days, an army will charge into the city.

541
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,950
Tianqi will be in danger.

542
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,260
Is it that serious?

543
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,650
Langya Army.

544
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,720
Langya Army? It doesn't exist in the world anymore.

545
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,570
Ye Xiaoying's current Beili army with a Prince Langya is the former Langya Army.

546
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,900
Xiao Se, do you know what you're talking about?

547
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,460
Of course, I do.

548
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:34,360
If the army that I mentioned gathers, this entire dynasty will collapse.

549
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,030
You don't look like you're joking.

550
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,800
20,000 people in Wangli Army, 3,000 imperial guards,

551
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,050
8,000 Tianqi City Soldiers, and 1,300 Tiger Soldiers,

552
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,180
is about 30,000 soldiers.

553
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,560
While there are 200,000 people in the Langya Army.

554
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,730
Based on the rule in war, we'll be surrounded as they have more people.

555
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,910
It's 30,000 to 200,000. We can only defend the city and fight.

556
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,020
By then, divide them into two teams to rescue His Majesty.

557
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,050
When I was on my way back to Tianqi, there were army forces trying to stop me.

558
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,830
So I'm sure the imperial family is behind this.

559
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,810
There are several princes in Tianqi City and several older princes out there.

560
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,930
As long as they're from the Xiao family, they all have the chance to be the emperor.

561
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,960
You think they're up to something else?

562
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,110
I have a lot of assumptions.

563
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:32,230
But I can't make a decision until the moment when the Langya Army arrives in the city.

564
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,830
But right now, I just hope you can trust me this one time.

565
00:41:49,940 --> 00:42:00,150
