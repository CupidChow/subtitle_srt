24
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,060
Will you wake up or stay in this dream?

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,824
I want to live in a world where you exist forever.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,180
I've waited so long for this day.

27
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,760
You silly man.

28
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,482
I'm already dead.

29
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:23,778
I can never come back to the living world.

30
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:27,656
Life is but a dream.

31
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:30,348
It's only after death when you awaken.

32
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:33,184
We will meet again someday,

33
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,520
but it's not today.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,150
It's time you wake up.

35
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,420
No. I don't want to.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,120
After drinking the Oblivion Broth, I'll forget everything about this dream.

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,550
And it will be a new beginning for you.

38
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,310
Isn't that nice?

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,330
I used to think the same thing.

40
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,930
But when I saw you again...

41
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,870
I didn't want to wake up anymore.

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,519
It doesn't matter if the world has Baili Dongjun in it.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,740
Don't be so stubborn.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,260
Life is but a dream.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,060
Death is the true awakening.

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,354
I hope you won't have any regrets.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,700
Why would you tell me not to have regrets?

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,130
Do you have any idea how long I've spent in regret?

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,476
I still remember it.

50
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,090
How?

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,294
I remember everything.

52
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:04,230
Could it be... that the legend was false?

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,870
Master. Master.

54
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,120
Tang Lian?

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,392
How did you know how to get here?

56
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,440
The Third Master told me the way.

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,840
Master. There's a pressing matter.

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,400
Xiao Se and the others might be in danger.

59
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,670
Xiao Se?

60
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,430
You mean Xiao Chuhe, who came to Xueyue City the other day?

61
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,860
Yes.

62
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,270
He wants to heal his damaged meridians.

63
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,670
Yes.

64
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,070
But Mo Yi...

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,200
Mo Yi went berserk.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,960
He's reached the Malevolence Phase.

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,190
I wanted to exorcise him,

68
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,834
but he tricked me into drinking Oblivion Broth.

69
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,000
He went berserk?

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,930
We must get over there right away.

71
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,880
Apart from Xiao Se, Qianluo, Lei Wujie from the Lei Fortress,

72
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,848
and Ye Ruoyi, General Ye's daughter, are all out there.

73
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,372
Do you all know what this place is?

74
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:04,190
You people shouldn't have come.

75
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,834
I was reckless.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,040
Master!

77
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,960
Whose doing is this?

78
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,260
Mo Yi's?

79
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,590
Yes.

80
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,560
A bunch of rocks was enough to stop you?

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,740
You really are useless.

82
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,698
Yes, I've failed you.

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,860
You really have the mind of a rock.

84
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,680
You can't even take a joke.

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,170
What are you looking at? Get moving.

86
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,430
Senior Brother!

87
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,890
- Have you found him? 
 - No.

88
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,586
Time's up.

89
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:11,266
I'm here for what I seek.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,736
What do you seek?

91
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,940
You.

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Me?

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,770
Yes, you.

94
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,170
Form the formation!

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,150
The Three-Element Formation.

96
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,094
No wonder your aura felt so familiar.

97
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,300
You're a disciple of Mount Huanglong.

98
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,216
Your body shouldn't be fit to master the spiritual arts.

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,000
Purify!

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Exorcise!

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
Demise!

102
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Tokens of Celestial Masters.

103
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,880
Of the entire Mount Huanglong, aside from my master and I,

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,710
Senior Brother Qi is the only one with this level of power.

105
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,430
Are you Senior Brother Qi's disciple?

106
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,150
But the three of them haven't mastered the art of Tao.

107
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,640
You're the only one holding this Three-Element Formation together.

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,160
Let's see how much longer you can hold on.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,140
You stand before an immortal, kneel!

110
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,840
Ruoyi!

111
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,020
Ruoyi!

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,980
He forced himself to enter the Carefree Phase.

113
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,020
Ruoyi!

114
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,290
You did well, but not well enough.

115
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,730
What is it that you want?

116
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,920
You'll find out soon enough.

117
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,520
Ruoyi!

118
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Cease!

119
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,090
Sister Ruoyi!

120
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,130
Ruoyi!

121
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,894
Baili Dongjun.

122
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,490
Sir Mo Yi.

123
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,630
Ruoyi, are you all right?

124
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,900
Fortunately, martial uncle arrived in time.

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,400
Master is as powerful as an immortal.

126
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,990
Has he reached another phase?

127
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,838
The Mental Phase.

128
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,280
I saved you from your demise in the past,

129
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,956
and today helped you brew Oblivion Broth.

130
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:41,220
Yet, you've come to ruin my plan.

131
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,110
The dead cannot come back to life.

132
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,910
Sir Mo Yi, you seek to use Miss Ye's body to resurrect your younger sister.

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,324
But that isn't possible.

134
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,660
You've lost your mind.

135
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,710
Let go of your obsession before it's too late.

136
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,400
Who do you think you are?

137
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,692
Who are you to lecture me?

138
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,850
I guess there's no other way, then.

139
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,470
You've shown me kindness.

140
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,302
So Sir, please make the first move.

141
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,148
You?

142
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:12,240
You're not worth fighting me.

143
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,580
Please.

144
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,024
After that dream, you've indeed become much stronger.

145
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,940
But you're still not a match for me.

146
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,220
Indeed. I have a long way to go before I can hope to beat you.

147
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,664
Therefore, I'll need some help from others.

148
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,544
Lend me your weapons!

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,060
City Lord Baili can control three weapons simultaneously?

150
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,820
I know all the martial arts in the world.

151
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,064
Even if it's an immortal, I can still slay them!

152
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,356
Supervisor! Supervisor! There has been an anomaly!

153
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,760
Hurry, go outside and look!

154
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,228
I've seen it already.

155
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:42,020
Supervisor. I've never seen anything like it.

156
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,800
It was daytime, but the sun faded away, and the sky became lit with stars.

157
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,904
Such a phenomenon has not yet been recorded.

158
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:51,400
- Yes, it has. 
 - What?

159
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,840
In the last verse of the Scroll of Guluo, the Verse of Annihilation.

160
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,420
Stars shine in the sky along with the sun.

161
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,360
An immortal descends to the mortal realm. Heaven is shattered and Earth is razed.

162
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,460
The Scroll of Guluo?

163
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,740
Supervisor. That was a forgery.

164
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,108
It's false because it tells the secrets of fate.

165
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,044
It's too late.

166
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,680
- Form the formation. 
 - Formation?

167
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
What formation?

168
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
Dragon Seeker Formation. I must see him.

169
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
Supervisor. Do you know the cause of this anomaly?

170
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,080
Yes.

171
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,220
- Master. 
 - Eldest Martial Uncle.

172
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,100
Stand back.

173
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,600
It's a tough fight.

174
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,960
After you leave, finish the Oblivion Broth.

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,820
It'll keep you alive.

176
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,680
Run!

177
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,120
Go.

178
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,960
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

179
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
Sister Ruoyi!

180
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Who is he?

181
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,224
Head of the Directorate of Astronomy, Qi Tianchen.

182
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,130
Your Highness!

183
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,580
Your Highness, how have you been?

184
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,188
It's been years.

185
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:53,520
You are still as humorous as ever.

186
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,240
Has he reached the Mental Phase too?

187
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,020
I'm not as powerful as City Lord Baili.

188
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,940
I haven't reached the Mental Phase yet.

189
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,020
I've only managed to project my spirit here

190
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,392
with the power of the Dragon Seeker Formation.

191
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:15,500
Junior Brother. It's been years.

192
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Hello, Senior Brother.

193
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,796
Thing have remained the same, but the people have changed.

194
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:28,100
I am an old man with gray hair now.

195
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,260
But you? You haven't aged a day at all!

196
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,572
I'm glad to know you're still alive.

197
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:41,004
However... as the heir of Mount Huanglong,

198
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,600
you've strayed from the righteous path.

199
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,180
That is a grave mistake.

200
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,520
What? Are you going to stand in my way too?

201
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,036
But you and I are no longer on the same level.

202
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,920
How are you supposed to stop me?

203
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,900
Kneel!

204
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,540
Very well. I'll give you three strikes to start.

205
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,548
This is for saving me.

206
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:21,588
If you hadn't looked back that day, I would have died.

207
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,800
Kneel!

208
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,980
This is for our sect.

209
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,740
Without Mount Huanglong, I wouldn't be here.

210
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,500
Kneel!

211
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,268
This third one is for the bond we shared.

212
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,240
He took three hits from you, State Preceptor.

213
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
But he didn't get a single scratch.

214
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,108
Are we even strong enough to bring him down?

215
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,100
We're missing someone.

216
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,900
Who?

217
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,040
You studied under the academy, a descendant of Confucianism.

218
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,180
I learned the way of Tao, a state preceptor.

219
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,768
We need an exorcist to be truly unbeatable.

220
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,380
Since we are one man short, we'll just have to give it our best.

221
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,120
Our chances are slim.

222
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,724
Back then, when I took on Ye Dingzhi all alone,

223
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:37,988
the entire world thought my chances were slim.

224
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,440
Very well.

225
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,416
Then let me open a path for City Lord Baili!

226
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,020
What is that punch?

227
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,080
It's not a punch. It's swordplay.

228
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,560
The legs are the grip. The body is the blade.

229
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,432
The fists are the hilt.

230
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:11,240
The fingers are the point.

231
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,780
This is the true sword.

232
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,000
Such an incredible duel, and I can only watch from here.

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,659
In a fight like this, unless you've reached the Carefree Phase,

234
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,380
you're incapable of interfering.

235
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,124
The Carefree Phase...

236
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,560
Lei Wujie. Your current body is too weak to take on the Carefree Phase.

237
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,748
If you enter the phase by force again, you'll die.

238
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,896
You heard what the Supervisor said just now.

239
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:59,712
They need an exorcist to become unbeatable.

240
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:03,120
Did you forget? I have learned a technique before.

241
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,620
Even now, I can still hear his words.

242
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:12,400
 The technique I'm about to teach you is the Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist.

243
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,980
I practice it every day.

244
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,440
If I die, and we win the fight,

245
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,480
don't forget me, Ruoyi.

246
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
Lei Wujie!

247
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,020
He...

248
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,268
What an incredible Exorcising Fist!

249
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,776
You did well.

250
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,120
It's a shame that not many can witness this fight.

251
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,776
Otherwise, you would make a name for yourself with this one fight.

252
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,520
Qianluo. Do you have any strength left?

253
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,440
Yes!

254
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,796
Throw the spear.

255
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,280
Toss it!

256
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Xiao Se!

257
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,580
The immortal said the Taoists were unaffected by emotions.

258
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,412
It's about being unaffected by emotions, not being merciless.

259
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,360
You haven't forgotten the obsession,

260
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,960
and so you've made yourself ruthless.

261
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm so disappointed in you.

262
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,980
Who are you?

263
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,844
I am Mo Yi.

264
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,176
Mo Yi, the immortal.

265
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,460
You're Mo Yi?

266
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,100
No.

267
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,232
I am Mo Yi.

268
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,780
- Xiao Se! 
 - Xiao Se!

269
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
City Lord Baili!

270
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,060
Break!

271
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,700
- Xiao Se! 
 - Xiao Se!

272
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,920
I am the Liquor Deity of the material world.

273
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
The intoxication shall send me to the sky's limit.

274
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,159
I seek not the deities dancing in the wind, but a drunken deity!

275
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,960
Break!

276
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,468
From now on, this unparalleled scent shall perish from the world.

277
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,756
 Kind Sir, could you spare me some food?

278
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,620
 - Here. 
 - Thank you! Thank you so much!

279
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,020
 Little girl. Aren't you starving?

280
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,840
 Why don't you eat up?

281
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,780
 I'm saving it for my older brother.

282
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,936
 Sister, have you...

283
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:45,600
 only... ever had one piece of bread?

284
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,708
 Is that right?

285
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,160
 Sister... how could you be so silly?

286
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,880
 Why didn't you eat it?

287
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,224
 Why did you save all of it for your brother?

288
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:13,840
 I just ate it without thinking.

289
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,480
 Brother.

290
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,360
 It's hard for you to survive while taking care of me.

291
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,448
 I want you to live.

292
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:41,156
 I want you to live on.

293
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,780
 Brother, you look different now.

294
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,000
 You look like a deity.

295
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,100
 Brother, I'll always be with you.

296
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,172
 I'll never leave you!

297
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,880
The last bit of Oblivion Broth has been used up.

298
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,180
Your time is running out.

299
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,520
Forget it. This is my fate.

300
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,676
Who knows how long the Oblivion Broth can stall him?

301
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,480
- Xiao Se. 
 - You all should go.

302
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,880
Xiao Se!

303
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,124
If he wakes up, I'll stop him for you.

304
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:33,820
- No! We're not leaving without you. 
 - That's right!

305
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,280
Go to Tianqi for me.

306
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,640
Tell them, I won't be going back.

307
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,860
But I don't regret my decision.

308
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,620
He woke up instantly.

309
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,440
Do you still want me to save you?

310
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

311
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,124
But I won't beg for your help.

312
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,288
How honorable.

313
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,360
- Xiao Se! 
 - Xiao Se!

314
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
Lei Wujie!

315
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
After them!

316
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,560
Does it mean the Dragon Seeker Formation is broken?

317
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,008
There is no way it could have been broken with the Supervisor inside!

318
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,480
Supervisor!

319
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
Supervisor! What is happening?

320
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,284
We must... leave the rest to Xueyue City now.

321
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,604
To think it was a girl who wounded you.

322
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,560
A girl?

323
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,519
Your hidden pulse contains the energy of extreme yin.

324
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,200
When you use your strength, this inner force of extreme yin runs wild inside you,

325
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,739
causing your internal injuries to flare up.

326
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:15,060
There is only one way to save you.

327
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,360
You must forsake your inner force and the yin energy all at once.

328
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,860
From then on, you'll lose all your martial arts mastery,

329
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,960
but you can train to regain your strength.

330
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,540
You can muster your inner force again.

331
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,140
If you have the will, it's only a matter of time before you reach your prime again.

332
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,512
My inner strength can keep your meridian from dying.

333
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,420
It's enough to make a high level warrior out of you.

334
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,092
You shall slowly build up your inner strength over time.

335
00:28:56,092 --> 00:29:01,928
And it will slowly dissipate bit by bit.

336
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,592
Why did you save me?

337
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,840
I went astray. You saved me.

338
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,560
It's only right to return the favor.

339
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,340
Not to mention, you're full of potential.

340
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,260
I have the technique to slay a dragon.

341
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,936
It's only natural for me to cherish a fellow talent.

342
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,536
Many thanks, Senior.

343
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,800
There's one more palm to go. Can you take it?

344
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,660
Please enlighten me.

345
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,140
Where is Xiao Se?

346
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,128
I've already cured your beloved one.

347
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:00,056
He is upstairs.

348
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:02,344
Take care of him.

349
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,660
Put her down.

350
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,260
Take it easy.

351
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,080
Ruoyi.

352
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,140
Xiao Lu'er.

353
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,480
Xiao Lu'er was your sister?

354
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,820
Yes. She was my only sister.

355
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,040
You two look very much alike.

356
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,160
She would have looked just like you

357
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,736
if she had the chance to grow up.

358
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,420
Unfortunately, she didn't get the opportunity.

359
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I didn't manage to save Xiao Lu'er back then.

360
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,636
Today, I shall not make the same mistake.

361
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:16,720
I gave you a strand of my zhenqi just now.

362
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
It protected your heart meridian.

363
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,392
As long as you don't suffer from a severe internal injury,

364
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:26,800
you can live a normal life from now on.

365
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,460
Why did you help me?

366
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,220
Perhaps... perhaps, it's because of your outfit.

367
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,460
Your body is still weak. You need rest.

368
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,220
Miss Ye. You should get some rest.

369
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,440
Lei Wujie.

370
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,880
Xiao Baili.

371
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,292
I have a favor to ask.

372
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,448
Ask away.

373
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,880
I was trapped by my obsession for years.

374
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,120
I've never taken a good rest.

375
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,500
It's time for me to do so now.

376
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,752
When I awaken, I should visit the human world again.

377
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:23,816
Are you willing to be my guard?

378
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,544
It would be an honor.

379
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,760
Master. How long are you going to guard him?

380
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,244
Ten years... or even longer.

381
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:43,420
I have nothing better to do anyway, and the view here is quite nice.

382
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm not ready to leave yet.

383
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,020
Are you just going to forget about Xueyue City?

384
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,720
We have Qianluo's father, don't we?

385
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,816
Are you going to forget about me too?

386
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm not your only master.

387
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,380
Well... the glorious days of Xueyue City are behind us.

388
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,784
But if you return to Beili, all these problems can be solved.

389
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,824
Why does it take me going back to solve them?

390
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:11,200
You were the legendary hero of Beili!

391
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,520
Right now, Xueyue City is surrounded by enemies.

392
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,680
Who knows if the Second City Lord is back yet.

393
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,220
The Third City Lord is all by himself. Things won't be easy for him.

394
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,952
What? I have to save Beili again just because I saved it 13 years ago?

395
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,960
Sikong Changfeng is in charge of Xueyue City.

396
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,092
As for the other problems, this time...

397
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,444
it's all your turn to deal with them.

398
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:39,320
Us?

399
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,240
Yes. The path you're about to take will be different from mine.

400
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,640
You know the true identity of Brother Xiao.

401
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,780
Tang Lianyue must have told you your true identity.

402
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,340
The Imperial Court is just as perilous as the Martial Arts World.

403
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,920
The line between good and evil is very fine.

404
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
The stance comes first.

405
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,388
You must be cautious.

406
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:03,160
- But Master... 
 - All right. Enough excuses.

407
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,480
What more do you want to say?

408
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,100
By the way, after you got drunk yesterday, you said a name.

409
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,000
"Yue Yao." Who is she?

410
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,040
She was my wife.

411
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,996
Your wife?

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,600
My disciple, someday we'll meet again.

413
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,952
Don't let me down.

414
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,340
All right.

415
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,840
See you around.

416
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,332

417
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
The annual ceremony is tomorrow.

418
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,200
Your Highness, it's time to rest.

419
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,560
Zang Ming.

420
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,204
Do you think my imperial father will write his name down tomorrow?

421
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:04,680
I think that it's possible.

422
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,032
But I think that it's not possible.

423
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:10,840
Why is that, Your Highness?

424
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,656
Because he hasn't truly returned.

425
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:17,312
If his name was written down before his return,

426
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:20,828
the resistance to his return would be terrifying.

427
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,880
If imperial father loves him, he won't put him in harm's way.

428
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,512
But when His Majesty exiled Xiao Chuhe, his safety wasn't a concern.

429
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,980
Who can say for sure the exile wasn't meant to keep him safe?

430
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:45,168
You should know the most perilous place on earth is Tianqi City.

431
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,024
Your Highness will definitely stand out the most in tomorrow's ceremony!

432
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,280
How can I outshine that yellow scroll?

433
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,280
It will have everyone's attention tomorrow.

434
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,340
Any news from the palace?

435
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
No.

436
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,132
That old geezer.

437
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:15,756
He's not revealing the Dragon Seal Scroll until the very end.

438
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,260
Actually, the scroll doesn't matter anymore.

439
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
The selection of the next crown prince is tied to the fate of the nation.

440
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,920
His Majesty wouldn't appoint a blind man.

441
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,116
See? Even you get it, but Second Brother doesn't.

442
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:31,820
He is imperial's pawn to balance the situation.

443
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,424
I used his hands to get rid of Xiao Chuhe.

444
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:39,100
Then, imperial father will rid of this expendable pawn.

445
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,904
In the end, I'm the only one left in the game, right?

446
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:47,056
Maybe the Second Prince doesn't want to believe it.

447
00:36:47,056 --> 00:36:49,408
I don't care if he wants to believe it or not.

448
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:52,068
Tomorrow is inevitable.

449
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,900
You came out to feel the freeze as soon as you recovered.

450
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,600
The wind is strong on the sea.

451
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,580
Why do you need a fan?

452
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,720
The wind on the sea smells fishy.

453
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,820
My fan gives out the fragrance of sandalwood.

454
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,900
- Smell it. 
 - No need.

455
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,780
Enjoy it on your own.

456
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,140
Any plans after you get back?

457
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
I'll return to Xueyue City.

458
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,696
The beauty of four seasons. 
  (T/N: Play on Xueyue City's name)

459
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,640
It sounds like a nice place.

460
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,020
I heard the Spear Deity, Master Sikong, was also a direct disciple of the Medicine King.

461
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,660
Correct.

462
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,952
The ceremony is today.

463
00:37:54,952 --> 00:38:01,100
Rumor has it His Majesty will write down the name of the next crown prince on the Dragon Seal Scroll.

464
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,648
It has nothing to do with me.

465
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,320
I've never considered becoming an emperor.

466
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,604
What's so funny?

467
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:18,884
To the Mu family of Qingzhou, I've always been the outlier.

468
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:20,660
Do you know why?

469
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,060
I do! You studied medicine instead of business!

470
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,700
That's one of the reasons.

471
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,280
I have an older brother who got sick.

472
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
He might never become a father.

473
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,400
Therefore, I'm next in line to be the head of the family.

474
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,860
But that's not who I want to be.

475
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,820
I want to cure my brother.

476
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,440
If I can cure him, he'll certainly be the next head of the family.

477
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,560
So in the eyes of the people in Qingzhou, I'm a fool.

478
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,220
If someone is rich without empathy, what good can he be?

479
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,076
The people in Qingzhou are the real fools.

480
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,620
My grandfather told me to find the sword

481
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,820
he forged, the Mountain's Mover, and its wielder.

482
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,244
When I get home, I'll tell him it's in the hands of someone worthy of it.

483
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,040
Many tried to stop me from going on this voyage.

484
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,836
I told them,

485
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:19,160
"Even the rats care about their skin, so how can a man live without honor?"

486
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,920
"What is life without honor?"

487
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,380
They think I've gone mad from all my studying.

488
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,228
But they are the fools.

489
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:32,560
When a person dies, they can't take anything with them.

490
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,460
Only bonds between people can remain in the world.

491
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:44,080
They couldn't even tell which was more important to them.

492
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,300
So, I left Qingzhou. I left those people.

493
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,924
It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

494
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:55,300
Because I think we're the same kind of people.

495
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,980
Us? What kind of people are we?

496
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
- Young people. 
 - "Young people"?

497
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,740
We're all young people.

498
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,640
We do not despair after a defeat, and we are proud of our victories.

499
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,960
We have swords in our hands and the will in our hearts.

500
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,640
The vastness of the sea gives birth to our heroic qualities.

501
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,960
The blooming blossoms don't hide our joy.

502
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,200
The path ahead is perilous, but we shall not falter.

503
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,740
The company of friends calls for a toast to Heaven!

504
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,840
Laugh when you feel like it!

505
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,172
If you want to yell, yell loudly!

506
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:36,440
There are endless paths to take, but always follow your heart

507
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,212
and stay true to yourself.

508
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:43,580
And more importantly, we all share one thing in common.

509
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,520
What is it?

510
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,528
We are all really good-looking.

511
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,300
Those with good looks are the young.

512
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,788
Those without good looks can only be called youngsters.

513
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:04,644
Senior Sister, why didn't you look at me just now?

514
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:07,200
Because you're a youngster.

515
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,620
Me?

516
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,936
Am I that ugly?

517
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,460
♫  Using my ardent youth as an offering for my past  ♫

518
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:29,900
Xiao Se. I have a question for you.

519
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,360
Ask away.

520
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,870
When we met at Snowfall Mountain Villa, was it just a coincidence?

521
00:41:52,020 --> 00:42:01,960

522
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,240
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

523
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,620
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

524
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,740
