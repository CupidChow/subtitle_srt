24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,170
Eighth Level of Fire Infusion, Heavenly Flame.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,950
Lei Wujie, don't act rashly.

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,020
Stand there and stay aggressive.

27
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,730
Xiao Se.

28
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,790
Xiao Se! Are you okay?

29
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,010
- Xiao Se. 
 - Xiao Se.

30
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,130
Xiao Se.

31
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,980
Let's leave.

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,640
Qianluo, we can't just keep walking like this.

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,400
Is there no ally of Xueyue City around here to help us?

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,530
I have seldom left Xueyue City since I was young.

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,470
I haven't met many people in the martial arts world.

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,650
I don't know any allies of Xueyue City. Let alone looking for one.

37
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,790
What should we do then?

38
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,590
I've got an idea.

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,640
Before Father left, he gave me a thing.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,540
With it, the ally nearby will come and help us.

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,000
What is this?

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,020
With a Cloud-Piercing Arrow, the backup will come to meet us.

43
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,880
I got it. This is the distress signal of Xueyue City.

44
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,350
But this beacon is only visible within a hundred lis.

45
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,290
Is there really an ally of Xueyue City nearby?

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,090
Idiot.

47
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,600
How could you scold us upon waking up? You're the idiot.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,460
Don't scold him.

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,100
Run!

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,490
What?

51
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,680
Hurry! Run!

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,380
Sister Qianluo, he told me to run. What did it mean?

53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,820
Someone got them one step ahead of us.

54
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,950
Is there any ally of Xueyue City nearby?

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,380
Sword Heart Tomb.

56
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,290
Okay. We're safe here.

57
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,080
There's a magic formation outside Sword Heart Tomb. Outsiders can't get in here.

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you, buddies. Care to tell me your names?

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
He Qu.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
He Cong.

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,460
What special names.

62
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,890
There's no time for this.

63
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,890
Don't worry. Divine Healer Hua happens to be picking herbs at Sword Heart Tomb.

64
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,830
I'll take him there.

65
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,220
Come.

66
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,830
Brother Lei, come to Sword Pavilion with me.

67
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,540
Old Master might want to see you.

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,340
Who is Old Master?

69
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,280
You're dumb. It's certainly the head of Sword Heart Tomb.

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,100
The head?

71
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,280
There are so many swords here.

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,660
This is more imposing than the Sword Chamber in Xueyue City.

73
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,200
By the way, Brother Mingxuan, why would you be here?

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,700
I'm here to work on something.

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,930
Yet, I saw the Qiancheng Token explode in the sky as soon as I got here.

76
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,800
Not many people are eligible to use it.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
So I rushed over. It turned out to be you.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,150
Lei Wujie. Come over here.

79
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,360
This is Qilin Fang Sword.

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,040
It's the sword of Qilin's head swordsman, Li Xiuxi.

81
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,440
It ranks 16th on the Records of Famous Swords.

82
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,280
Qilin Fang Sword is a destructive weapon.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,330
If you want to touch it,

84
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,050
you might hurt yourself.

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,350
Old Master.

86
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,540
Which one is the disciple of Fairy Luoxia who asks to see me?

87
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm Luo Mingxuan, the disciple of Fairy Luoxia.

88
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,680
Is your master doing well?

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,350
She's well.

90
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,050
Is she as pretty as she used to be?

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,950
Well, I've done forging the swords you requested.

92
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,350
The heavy sword is Desperate, the light one is Farewell,

93
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,080
the long one is Phoenix, the double swords are Goumang  (God of Wood)  and Calamity,

94
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,540
and the three-foot swords are Wisdom and One-Eye.

95
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,190
There are seven swords in total.

96
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,470
Seven swords? That's generous.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,010
- Thank you, Old Master. 
 - You may have them all.

98
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:02,050
As for you, you look familiar.

99
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,500
Tingyu, it's been a long time.

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,290
You know this sword, Old Master?

101
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,840
Tingyu, Guanxue, Wanghua, and Wenfeng.

102
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,550
I forged the Elegant Four Swords when I was young.

103
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,140
I certainly recognize it.

104
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,040
You forged the Elegant Four Swords?

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,870
Are you Lord Li Suwang?

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,990
Wait a minute?

107
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,470
Weren't you already dead?

108
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,750
You... Nonsense.

109
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,540
I just haven't shown up in the martial arts world for a couple of dozen years.

110
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,180
Who told you I was dead?

111
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,280
But rumor has it, the master of Sword Heart Tomb is your brother, Li Suchen.

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,210
The rumor is not trustworthy.

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,560
Grandfather?

114
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,790
I'm such an unfilial grandson, Grandfather.

115
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,760
Get up, get up.

116
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,950
You're good at swordsmanship. Then you're not unfilial at all.

117
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,960
Since you got Tingyu Sword, you must've met your sister.

118
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,890
Good.

119
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,090
Your sister is the unfilial one.

120
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,300
She knew I was at Sword Heart Tomb all alone, but she didn't come and see me.

121
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,670
It's not like I'd force her to be the master of Sword Heart Tomb.

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,820
Why is she afraid of me?

123
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,090
Tingyu Sword is a punishment for her.

124
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,420
I confiscate it.

125
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,920
But...

126
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,080
Don't worry. Come to the Sword Pavilion tonight.

127
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,360
I'll give you a more powerful sword.

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,990

129
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,860
There's no wound.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,300
But he's got an irregular pulse.

131
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,010
It's really rare.

132
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,010

133
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,900
Let's go.

134
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,510
Miss Ye, are you okay?

135
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm fine.

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,390
I'm just a bit tired.

137
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,680
Why is your pulse so irregular?

138
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,890
They're coming. Keep on moving.

139
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,370
All right.

140
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,570
We're already here.

141
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,700
Martial Uncle?

142
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,530
Go back with me.

143
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,890
Are you going to betray the clan?

144
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,420
But I'm with two clans.

145
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,040
But your surname is Tang.

146
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,310
Why must you do this?

147
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,770
Does Tang Clan really have to do such a treacherous thing?

148
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,130
This is not your concern.

149
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,220
As a disciple of Tang Clan, all you need to do is obey orders.

150
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,270
But Master Baili told me we got to do things in all conscience.

151
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,200
That's enough, Tang Lian! Don't you forget your surname, Tang.

152
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,320
Back then, it was you who sent him to Xueyue City.

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,290
Now you want to cut ties between him and Xueyue City.

154
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,460
Tang Clan is a century-old great family.

155
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,130
Is this how the clan treats their disciples?

156
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,070
Tang Lian, I'll give you one last chance.

157
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,240
You're the best disciple of Tang Clan among your peers.

158
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,380
I hope you won't make the wrong choice.

159
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,650
Tang Lian.

160
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,460
Miss Ye, leave.

161
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,470
Find the nearest troop. Go!

162
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,690
Watch out, Miss Ye!

163
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
It's been so long since I used this.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,540
I almost forgot its name.

165
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
Mind Peace Bell Technique.

166
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,970
Yes, that's the name.

167
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,620
Wu... Ye Anshi.

168
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,450
I was Ye Anshi at Tian Wai Tian.

169
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,530
Now that I've returned to Central Plains. It's better to call me Wu Xin.

170
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,690
- Thanks for your help. 
 - Oh, it's you.

171
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,540
I let you go back to Tian Wai Tian last time.

172
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,410
How dare you return to Central Plains?

173
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,320
Let me go back?

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,970
You?

175
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,140
Let's go.

176
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,290
Have you stopped Jingxia?

177
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,060
I got the information today that Su Muyu, the head of Su family from Dark River,

178
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,630
and Xie Qidao, the head of Xie family, joined forces to stop Li Hanyi from heading North.

179
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,920
But Li Hanyi saw through the ambush and eventually broke through.

180
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,230
Her whereabouts are still unknown.

181
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,950
It seems like Dark River is making a move.

182
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,370
Jingxia is too assertive.

183
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,940
What about the three old masters of Tang Clan?

184
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,580
They didn't want to come forward.

185
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,270
But Li Hanyi already broke through that time.

186
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,990
They got no choice but to come out. They still failed to get her.

187
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,570
As for the reason why Tang Clan would work with Dark River,

188
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,820
I guess it's because Ninth Prince had known about Tang Clan before he went there.

189
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,150
They knew about your relationship with Ninth Prince.

190
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,410
So they thought it was your order.

191
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,750
How could Old Ninth be so certain that Dark River would work with him?

192
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,160
Because Ninth Prince impersonated a person.

193
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,380
Who?

194
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,620
Xiao Chuhe.

195
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,840
Grandfather, I'm here.

196
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,090
You're here.

197
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,870
What sword do you want to give me?

198
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,400
It's certainly one of the best swords in the world.

199
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,220
One of the best swords in the world?

200
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,910
Is it on the Records of Famous Swords?

201
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,940
Come. Look at the Records of Swords on both sides.

202
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,100
The top ten famous swords are the best in the world.

203
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,240
Look. The tenth sword in the Record of Swords, Worry-Free.

204
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,730
It is as shiny as jade.

205
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,440
Its sword body is stunning. Unlike the swords in the human world.

206
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,710
It's with an aura of a deity.

207
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,230
The current owner is still unknown.

208
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,260
The ninth is a duo called Frost and Snow.

209
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,110
They are a couple.

210
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,640
The frost in autumn, the snow in winter. It's ordinary when they are separated.

211
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,980
But when they join together as a duo, it'll bring magical power.

212
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,360
The current owner is still unknown.

213
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,990
The eighth sword is Haoque.

214
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,140
It qualifies as the first sword of righteousness in the human world.

215
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,670
It's so righteous that it can slaughter thousands of demons.

216
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,030
It used to belong to Beili's Protector-in-Chief.

217
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,790
It's stored at Heavenly Sword Pavilion in Tianqi City now.

218
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,190
The Sword Slave is watching over it.

219
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,070
The seventh sword is Mountains Mover.

220
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,940
Its qi of sword is extremely strong.

221
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,420
Once it's lifted, it can move thousands of mountains and make waves.

222
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,000
Among these top ten famous swords,

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,750
it's the only one forged by a sword forger of the present age.

224
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,510
The current owner is still unknown.

225
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,780
The sixth sword is Qingxiao.

226
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,310
This is the treasure of Mount Wangcheng, the sword of the successive masters.

227
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,470
The current owner is Zhao Yuzhen, the master of Mount Wangcheng,

228
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,810
the Tao Sword Deity who's among the five Sword Deities.

229
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,250
Take a look at this side.

230
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,290
The fifth sword is Pojun.

231
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,970
It's blunt and heavy.

232
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,420
The regular people can't lift it up.

233
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,190
It's called the Sword of Dominion.

234
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,660
Its current holder is Yan Zhantian, the Rage Sword Deity.

235
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,580
The fourth sword is...

236
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,940
There are four characters, three characters,

237
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,660
and mostly two characters in the names of the swords in the world.

238
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:11,050
But this sword, it only has a character.

239
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,860
Heart.

240
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,430
Yes.

241
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,720
The fourth sword in the Sword Record is Heart.

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,620
It's the only sword with a single-character name.

243
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,110
It has a psychic ability which allows it to connect with the sword owner.

244
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,080
It's got pure thought. It can break the thoughts of regular swords.

245
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,460
It's passed down to the successors of Sword Heart Tomb.

246
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,230
Now, it's passed down to Lei Wujie.

247
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,610
Grandfather, you're going to pass this sword to me?

248
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,160
Your mother used to be the sword holder.

249
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,560
You deserve to inherit it.

250
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,570
But, some people reckon swords and humans are two different things.

251
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,410
Like your sister, she refused to accept this Heart Sword.

252
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:21,620
But she went to Mount Kunlun to seek for the Iron Glacier.

253
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,070
But someone thinks that the sword is the heart, and the heart can be used as a sword.

254
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,240
Like your mother.

255
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,830
Grandfather, can you tell me about my mother?

256
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,300
Your mother was a nice person.

257
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,900
She was kind and smart with a gentle personality,

258
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,960
and she was one of the very rare geniuses.

259
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,900
If it wasn't for that darned Lei Mengsha,

260
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,760
she would've been the successor of the Sword Tomb.

261
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,360
How did mother meet father?

262
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,900
Lei Mengsha came to visit Sword Heart Tomb with his best buddy, Baili Dongjun.

263
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,000
He didn't stay at the Sword Pavilion, but went to Sword Heart Cliff.

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,630
It was okay.

265
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,200
But he insisted on competing with Xinyue.

266
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,380
It was all right, too.

267
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,210
Yet, he coincidentally won.

268
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,520
All right. Never mind he won. But he...

269
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Grandfather, why do you sound a little jealous?

270
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,990
Since then, your mother had been clamoring to see the world with Lei Mengsha.

271
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,330
I thought I'd just let her do it.

272
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,670
As she was young, she couldn't just stay in the valley for her entire life.

273
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:00,470
Moreover, Lei Mengsha was an outstanding man and he came from a great family.

274
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,790
So I agreed.

275
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,260
Over years, I've regretted it.

276
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,550
I asked myself why I would agree to it.

277
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,800
I should've kept her here.

278
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,820
Kid, tell me, if I had kept her here back then,

279
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,380
would things have turned out differently?

280
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,890
You're right, but I wouldn't have existed then.

281
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,630
You brat.

282
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,650
How could you share the same personality with your father?

283
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,030
You look simple-minded.

284
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,600
Grandfather, don't you still have me and Sister?

285
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,290
We'll often come to see you.

286
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,190
You can come see me. But don't try to get any swords from me.

287
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,620
Grandfather, you said you'd pass the Heart Sword to me. You can't regret it.

288
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
You silly brat.

289
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,740
This is not an ordinary sword.

290
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,370
Even if I want to give it to you, it still depends on whether or not it acknowledges you.

291
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,960
Lift.

292
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,220
Lift again.

293
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,880
Kid, don't always try to control the sword.

294
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,700
You've got to communicate with it wholeheartedly.

295
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,370
Only then will it respond to you.

296
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,230
Try it again.

297
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,210
 Xiao Jie, long time no see.

298
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,570
 Mother.

299
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,240
 Is that you, Mother?

300
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,420
 I'm just your imagination.

301
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,240
 The resonance between the Heart Sword and you has transformed into me.

302
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,660
 Mother, I miss you so much, Mother.

303
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,070
 Sister, Grandfather, and I have reunited.

304
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,610
 If you and Father were still alive, we could live together like we used to.

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,060
 Silly kid, it's all right.

306
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,090
 As long as you've kept us in your mind, our family will always be together.

307
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,570
 By the way, Mother, I'm the Guardian Azure Dragon now.

308
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,600
 But, I don't know what I should do as a real guardian.

309
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,840
 Before I answer your question, you need to tell me why you hold a sword.

310
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,170
 Because there's someone I want to protect.

311
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:54,010
 To a guardian, holding a sword is to protect the people they want to protect.

312
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,750
 The people I want to protect?

313
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,850
 Protect those who I want to protect.

314
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,020
Protect those who I want to protect.

315
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,160
Protect those who I want to protect.

316
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,870
Good, very good.

317
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:26,220
After ten years, this Heart Sword has finally found its real owner.

318
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,890
 Protect those who I want to protect.

319
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,450
 Mother, don't worry.

320
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,930
 I won't let you down.

321
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,670
Kid, I heard that you had been trying to avoid the chase all night.

322
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,490
Go on back and get some rest now.

323
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,860
Try the power of this Heart Sword early tomorrow morning.

324
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,990
Grandfather, you haven't told me about the remaining swords yet.

325
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,870
I've heard about the top three many times,

326
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,240
but it sounds more extraordinary from the mouth of the best sword forger in the world.

327
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
All right.

328
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,690
As you wish.

329
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,860
Come.

330
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,460
The third sword is Iron Glacier.

331
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,880
This is the coldest sword in the world.

332
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,160
It was sealed on the summit of Mount Kunlun.

333
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,360
It once belonged to the Greatest Kunlun Sword Deity.

334
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,900
Now, its master is Xueyue Sword Deity,  Li Hanyi.

335
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,630
My sister really is amazing.

336
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,940
She didn't inherit Heart Sword, but pursued a more powerful one.

337
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,310
Hey, brat, since you've got Heart Sword now,

338
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,600
you should say Heart Sword is the best one.

339
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,270
We can lose to Sister. It's not embarrassing.

340
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,720
The second sword is the Vermilion.

341
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,290
This is the treasure of Wushuang City.

342
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,360
It's kept in the Wushuang Sword Box now.

343
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,880
The sword is sharp.

344
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,660
Once you strike with it, it must see blood.

345
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,890
Wushuang, the City Lord of Wushuang City, owns it now.

346
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,320
I wonder when Wushuang will be able to draw this sword.

347
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,980
Being able to draw the Vermilion will prove that he's already a sword deity.

348
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,930
Then all that's left is...

349
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,470

(T/N: Heaven's Executioner)

350
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,820
This...

351
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,240
Grandfather, why is the drawing of the first sword blank?

352
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,900
I'll tell you why.

353
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,620
The first sword of the Swords Records is Tianzhan.

354
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,960
The world's number one sword.

355
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,300
The sword of Heaven's will can only be held by the chosen one.

356
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,510
It's stored in the Directorate of Astronomy and guarded by Qi Tianchen, the State Preceptor.

357
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,960
Tianzhan is the deity sword that was left by the first Emperor.

358
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,970
It hasn't appeared in the world for centuries now.

359
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,200
Although I'm the master of Sword Heart Tomb, I've never seen this sword before.

360
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
So of course I couldn't paint it.

361
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,940
I-It hasn't appeared in the world for centuries?

362
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,280
Could it be rusted?

363
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,820
No, it won't.

364
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,530
A chosen one like our first Emperor won't show up that easily.

365
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,050
Girl, how is the young man's condition?

366
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,410
He's got a big problem.

367
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,480
His hidden pulse was severely injured.

368
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,180
Everyone knows that the significant pulses include the Eight Extra Meridians,

369
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,800
the Twelve Regular Meridians, and the Fifteen Collateral Meridians.

370
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,010
But actually, each person has a hidden pulse.

371
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,800
Because one's internal power is kept in the hidden pulse.

372
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,610
He can't practice martial arts since his hidden pulse is injured.

373
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,690
But I can sense a scary power in his hidden pulse.

374
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,310
If this power backfires on him, it'll put him in great danger.

375
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,370
It seems it has backfired on him once before.

376
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,570
But this time it wasn't serious.

377
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,260
So he only suffered a qi deficiency. He just needs to nourish his body.

378
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,450
But in the future...

379
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,210
What's the matter?

380
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,610
There's a disease that you can't cure?

381
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,800
Forget about me, even if my master comes, my guess is it'll still be incurable.

382
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,350
As for that fickle senior brother of mine, I'm afraid he couldn't cure him either.

383
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,600
You're talking about Sikong Changfeng, the Spear Deity?

384
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,370
My master said if my senior brother had only studied medical skills,

385
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,060
there wouldn't be any disease in the world that he couldn't cure.

386
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,120
But he chose to learn medical skills and spear at the same time.

387
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,670
He even ran off to be a City Lord.

388
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,400
How can he master medical skills if he's half hearted about it?

389
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,240
Well, you focus on studying medical skills.

390
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,040
You came to the Sword Heart Tomb and spent a year here picking medicinal herbs.

391
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,030
I've asked you to learn sword skills from me many times, but you refused.

392
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,250
Why can't you cure him then?

393
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,540
I'm still young!

394
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,400
Still young?

395
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,540
Making up excuses!

396
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,170
You're awake.

397
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,030
Are you feeling better?

398
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,580
Much better.

399
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,490
Don't worry.

400
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,510
I won't let you get hurt again.

401
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,250
Drink your medicine first.

402
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,030
Here.

403
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,790
It's already been three days. You can finally get out of bed.

404
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,640
Thank you, Divine Healer.

405
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,310
No need to thank me. I only did you a little favor.

406
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,060
I can't heal your injured hidden pulse.

407
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm already used to hearing that.

408
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,000
I read an ancient book in Medicine Valley before.

409
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,700
There's a medical skill recorded in it.

410
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,440
It's called the Soul Mending Skill.

411
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,150
It can bring death back to life. It can also reconnect broken souls and meridians.

412
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,790
It's just that the book doesn't mention the right way to use it.

413
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,710
Perhaps it's a long-lost skill.

414
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,420
After all, even my master, the world's top physician, doesn't know about this skill.

415
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,190
So that's to say, you're Xin Baicao's disciple.

416
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,070
That's right.

417
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,240
In the past few days, Qianluo told me that you're Changfeng's disciple.

418
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,620
So, you should call me Senior Uncle.

419
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,260
How old are you?

420
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,620
I'm young. But I have big ambitions.

421
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,410
What big ambitions?

422
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,370
For example, healing your injury.

423
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
I'm serious.

424
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,060
I believe you.

425
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,050
By the way, they said you lent them your inner force through some so-called Circulation Formation.

426
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,360
What book is it?

427
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,810
Can you show it to me?

428
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,470
Sure.

429
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,480
This book is written by Xie Xuan, Scholar Sword Deity.

430
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,210
The technique in it can slowly heal my hidden pulse.

431
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,760
What a peculiar book.

432
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,000
If you want, I can lend it to you for a few more days.

433
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,640
No need. I've memorized it already.

434
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,620
I didn't expect you to be gifted with such a great memory.

435
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,940
But that Lei buddy of yours can't wait any longer.

436
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,660
He's eager to leave the tomb and go to the Lei Fortress.

437
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,470
He keeps saying his sister will kill him if he's late.

438
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,620
What kind of sister is that? She's ferocious.

439
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,460
She's one of the world's top five Sword Deities.

440
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,070
What do you think now?

441
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,060
But since he's in a hurry,

442
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,560
then I should pay Master Li a visit first.

443
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,000
Greeting to Master Li.

444
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,600
How are you feeling?

445
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,300
Much better. Thanks for your help, Master Li.

446
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,290
Hua Jin deserves all the credit for that.

447
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,160
I didn't do anything.

448
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,480
It's just that I didn't expect to be able to meet you here.

449
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,070
By the way,

450
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,960
what do you think about Dark River's pursuit of you?

451
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,100
Dark River never stops until they die.

452
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,350
If their purpose was to kill us,

453
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,500
they should've sent stronger assassins.

454
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,260
What?

455
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,410
Su Changli isn't strong enough?

456
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,050
Among us, I'm most likely the target.

457
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,020
If they asked for Dark River's help to ensure I get killed,

458
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,820
they should've sent an expert like Su Muyu, the Umbrella-Wielding Demon.

459
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,840
So I'm guessing there's something else behind this.

460
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,920
Maybe it's related to our destination.

461
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,600
Lei Fortress...

462
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,820
Hero banquet...

463
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,970
These are just my guesses.

464
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,690
The top priority is that we have to rush to Lei Fortress now.

465
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,950
Before the enemy starts their plot, we still have room to maneuver.

466
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,640
You said you're called Xiao Se.

467
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,890
Yes.

468
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,660
Whatever my name was back then, that is the only name I'll use in the future.

469
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,260
Those people from Dark River are afraid of Sword Heart Tomb so they dare not break in.

470
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,130
But they won't necessarily leave.

471
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,840
I'll go repel them tonight.

472
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,150
Then early tomorrow morning you all can go.

473
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,440
How could we have you personally take care of this?

474
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,440
My grandson would do it for you.

475
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,540
And I do it for my grandson.

476
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,260
It really is a perfect night to kill someone.

477
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,180
Are you worried that Sword Heart Tomb will help them?

478
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,170
We've seen He Qu and He Cong, the two Sword Guardians.

479
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,510
Their sword techniques are far behind yours. There's nothing to fear.

480
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,040
Aside from them, there's another expert in Sword Heart Tomb.

481
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,800
Another expert? Who?

482
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,720
The Sword Heart with the moon on it kills someone in a dream.

483
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,200
Li Xinyue?

484
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
She has been dead for years already!

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,970
Li Xinyue is dead, but Heart Sword isn't.

486
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,370
The person who taught her sword technique is also still alive.

487
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,030
Who is that person?

488
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,840
The world's best sword forger,

489
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,830
Li Suwang.

490
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,620
Tengkong, a great sword.

491
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,760
It's an imitation sword of the world's fifth most famous sword, Pojun.

492
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,130
I forged it when I was young.

493
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,960
It's been a long time since I last saw it.

494
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,320
It's a good sword.

495
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,370
Unfortunately, it's in the wrong person's hands.

496
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,630
Your strong killing aura has ruined a good sword.

497
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,090
A sword is intended to be a weapon.

498
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,840
How dare you judge swords in front of me?

499
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,740
Grandfather!

500
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,230
Grandfather, I'll take care of my own matters.

501
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,990
You don't have to do this for me.

502
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,200
This person is hard to deal with.

503
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,880
I've met many hard to deal with people already.

504
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,190
I'm still alive and well.

505
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,410
Let's let the swords speak again.

506
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,220
I've learned a technique from Li Hanyi, the Sword Deity.

507
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,800
It's called...

508
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,880
Unpredictable Cloud and Mist.

509
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,270
Heart Sword? Alright.

510
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,870
A sword isn't a weapon,

511
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,700
but your friend.

512
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,290
To be killed by such a sword is fine.

513
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,260
Indeed, I struck you just now.

514
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,440
But it didn't hurt you.

515
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,770
To a killer, to lose is to die.

516
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,950
It's a puppet again.

517
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,570
Let him go.

518
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,660
This is just how he gets away.

519
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,260
Mu Ying is nothing to worry about.

520
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,170
Kid, are you all right?

521
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,130
Lei Wujie!

522
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,730
Sir, it was you who tampered with Su Changli's move just now, wasn't it?

523
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,710
It was.

524
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,970
Just now when I fought him,

525
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,340
I disrupted his zhenqi.

526
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,700
But he didn't sense it.

527
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,500
So when he fought Xiao Jie,

528
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,840
he thought that he dodged the sword.

529
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,750
In the end, with an inch off, his heart meridian was shattered.

530
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,160
Why did you do this?

531
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,310
Xiao Jie is talented,

532
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,300
but he's soft-hearted.

533
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,020
I can feel that he's going to be a gentleman when fighting.

534
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:44,080
However, a gentleman's sword needs a killing aura too.

535
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,800
His sword seeks victory, not survival.

536
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,780
The martial arts world is dangerous,

537
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,720
A sword like this

538
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,190
won't last long.

539
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,390
I don't want to kill people,

540
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,660
but they want to kill me.

541
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,810
Whether it's the martial arts world or not, it's always been like this.

542
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,870
I understand your concern.

543
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,680
Please entrust Lei Wujie to me.

544
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,780
If it wasn't for you,

545
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,570
I wouldn't have made Xiao Jie to do something like this.

546
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,090
What do you mean?

547
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,030
Four years ago, my daughter died.

548
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:46,270
Now, I hope that my grandson can return safely.

549
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,320
I will remember that.

550
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,140
I'll never forget that you saved my life.

551
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,560
If we're fated, I hope to see you again.

552
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,640
Wait!

553
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,020
This is for you.

554
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,410
What is this?

555
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,360
I know you're rich and carry around precious Penglai Pills, eating them like candy.

556
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,590
But this is different.

557
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,780
A dying man could last three more days after taking it.

558
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,830
If something happens to you again, take it and come to me in three days.

559
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,390
I'll save you.

560
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,360
All right.

561
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,310
Who is that Xiao Se?

562
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,200
Why did you bow to him?

563
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,110
He said he was Xiao Se and that he was no longer the man he used to be.

564
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,710
But there's one thing that won't change.

565
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,460
That his surname is Xiao.

566
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,280
As long as his surname is Xiao,

567
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,890
then, everything he does will never end.

568
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,920
Should I go over there?

569
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,500
But Master didn't teach me how to comfort a man.

570
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,090
Luo Mingxuan!

571
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,820
You don't need to worry about me.

572
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,560
Actually, I knew that such a day would come.

573
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,630
In the martial arts world, sometimes you don't want to kill people,

574
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,560
but they want to kill you.

575
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,250
I understand.

576
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,180
It's not up to you, that's how it is.

577
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,390
But this is wrong!

578
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,440
The fighting will grow hatred among people and it'll never end!

579
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,240
This is not the martial arts world I want!

580
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,930
I know.

581
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,380
What you want is a peaceful world where you can enjoy life.

582
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,130
Am I being simple-minded?

583
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,440
Do you know what kind of martial arts world lies in my heart?

584
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,080
I once thought the martial arts world was like the imperial court.

585
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,210
There would only be unlimited ambitions.

586
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,310
Until I met you, Wu Xin,

587
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,460
Tian Wai Tian, Xueyue City, and Dark River.

588
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,350
Now, I think the martial arts world is like a mirror.

589
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,130
A mirror?

590
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,670
When we stand before a mirror, we can see ourselves.

591
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,120
When we face the martial arts world, what we see is our hearts.

592
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:29,960

593
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,850
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

594
