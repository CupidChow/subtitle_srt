00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,150
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,890
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,170
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,300
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,370
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,420
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,690

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,670
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,000
The Lei family had four heroes in the past.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,530
Today, only Qianhu remains.

26
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,650
Who said he was the only one?

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,900
Old Master Tang.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,780
After all these years, have you not moved on from the feud between Lei Fortress and the Tang Clan?

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,950
Lei Hong.

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,660
Did you know? When I was younger, I once said this to the old master.

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,930
I said I had a dream to have only one clan in the world.

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,480
What do you mean by "one clan in the world"?

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,650
It can also refer to the Tang Clan of Shu.

34
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,280
I understand what you mean now, old man.

35
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,500
The Tang Clan didn't come for revenge, but to slaughter everyone!

36
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,170
Why does Shabu want to leave?

37
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,760
Maybe it's sensing the master's sword intent.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,110
Why is Master summoning it?

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,200
Are we too late?

40
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,070

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,590
Take a stroll through hell, your soul might actually remain in this world!

42
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,350
Young man, watch and learn!

43
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,180
Lei Qianhu. Seems like your injury had already damaged your veins.

44
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,420
You were just trying to hold off the pain.

45
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,840
Hold off?

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,680
I still have a lot of fighting spirit left!

47
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,090
Clan Leader!

48
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,060
The Hellish Palm...

49
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,250
I underestimated him.

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,650
You're wounded. Leave now.

51
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,760
- I can take it from here. 
 - Yes.

52
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,940
Stop!

53
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,650
Lightning falls from heaven, a crane in the clouds.

54
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,740
What a shame. You're too late.

55
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,180
Your brother...

56
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,330
is already a dead man.

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,260
Clan Leader!

58
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,410
Qianhu!

59
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,850
Let's go!

60
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,190
Qianhu...

61
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,910
Just now...

62
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,720
I used brute force to alter the ninth level of Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch.

63
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,140
Have you lost your mind?

64
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,300
How could you use a technique that could've killed you?

65
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,970
 Listen closely.

66
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,650
 The Lei family has three ultimate techniques.

67
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,640
 Each of you can pick one to master.

68
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,660
 The first technique...

69
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,480
 The Formless Fist.

70
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
 Amazing!

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,130
 The second technique...

72
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,170
 Thunderclap Finger!

73
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,000
 The third technique...

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,320
 Could it be the most powerful?

75
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,370
 Probably.

76
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,020
 Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch!

77
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,190
 What was that?

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
 Awesome!

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,830
 The Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch is our Lei Family's most powerful technique of the three.

80
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,670
 But the technique can easily backfire on the user.

81
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,080
 The ninth level is called Annihilation.

82
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,240
 It not only annihilates the sky above, but also yourself!

83
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,080
The fate of the Lei Clan was at stake.

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,570
I couldn't be too cautious.

85
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,560
Brother He... you're finally back.

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,890
Stop talking.

87
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,740
Lei Hong. Tend to A'Hu's injury!

88
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,140
It's too late for that...

89
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,030
Chief Supervisor of the Lei Clan, Lei Tianhen, heed my order.

90
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,740
At your service!

91
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,580
The Lei Clan's

92
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,210
19th Clan Leader hereby passes the leadership...

93
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,600
Passes the leadership...

94
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,450
to my martial brother, Lei Hong.

95
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,000
After we fend off the enemies,

96
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,410
step into the Lei Clan's ancestral shrine.

97
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,960
Hold the Ceremony of Three Roars and Six Rumblings.

98
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,120
Inaugurate... the 20th Clan Leader.

99
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,780
As you wish.

100
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,760
Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

101
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,030
 Listen up, you guys.

102
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,830
 Brother Hong. Let's train for five more years and then go on our own adventure.

103
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,080
 Five years?

104
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,010
 No, that's way too long.

105
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,080
 Make it three years. We'll leave after three years!

106
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,620
 Deal!

107
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,290
 What about me? You two made a pact and left me out of it!

108
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,750
 Qianhu, Brother Hong and I are going on our adventure

109
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,110
 to make sure more people know the might of the Lei Clan.

110
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,740
 But if Brother Hong and I are met with misfortune out there, what will happen to the Lei Clan?

111
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,270
 So, when Brother Hong and I are away, you must protect our family.

112
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,900
 Okay, Brother.

113
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,610
 Then I look forward to hearing about your glorious feats.

114
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,880
 I'll keep the Lei family safe!

115
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,100
The Nine Heavens Thunder, which shocked Heaven and Earth!

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,270
Nine Heavens Lightning Fall?

117
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,400
Leader!

118
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,560
What's going on?

119
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
How come his inner force is so powerful?

120
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,050
Fatal Flying Blossoms.

121
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,890
The Two Heroes of the Lei Clan

122
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,770
indeed live up to their reputations.

123
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,880
But to go against so many powerful foes, only death awaits you!

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,000
We beg to differ!

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
They'll live!

126
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,750
Master Hu! Master Hu!

127
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,930
Master Hu!

128
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,490
Master Hu... I was late.

129
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,790
Tang Lian.

130
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,510
Are you going to betray your clan?

131
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,180
Old Master.

132
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,790
After this is over... I'll accept the clan's punishment.

133
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,050
But I must uphold my principles.

134
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,910
The Hellish Palm.

135
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,890
This must be the Leader of Dark River, Su Changhe.

136
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,310
You do know a thing or two.

137
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,910
So, who might you be?

138
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,670
Masters of the Lei Clan, I ask you to stall the leader Su Changhe.

139
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,640
We'll take down Old Master Tang.

140
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,980
I'm old enough to be your grandfather.

141
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,880
Fighting a bunch of children is somewhat embarrassing for me.

142
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,130
Embarrassing?

143
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,450
Is fighting an elder embarrassing?

144
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,280
I disagree!

145
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,810
The new generation naturally replaces the old.

146
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,070
Old age doesn't make you right!

147
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,560
You conspired with the Dark River to attack the Lei Fortress.

148
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,850
That is truly an embarrassing act!

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,880
Lei Wujie. When did you learn to give such a speech?

150
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,030
I speak out of grief and anger.

151
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,350
Bring it on, then.

152
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,620
Old Master Tang has 70 years' worth of internal energy.

153
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,590
His zhenqi can match a deity.

154
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,030
Lei Wujie can't land a strike on him.

155
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,550
The Tang Clan has a hidden weapon... built to break through the protection of zhenqi.

156
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,880
Tang Lian, are you angry enough to fight Old Master Tang?

157
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,780
I...

158
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,150
Lei Wujie. Give it everything you have.

159
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,990
I believe in you.

160
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:31,520
Xiao Se, if I use that move, I'll be unconscious in ten moves.

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,960
Then stay conscious until then.

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,430
Very well! I believe you, even though you always lie to me.

163
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,240
You've reached the Carefree Phase at such a young age.

164
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,800
Mastery from the sword deity "Unpredictable Cloud and Mist"!

165
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,650
 Every weapon in this world is alive.

166
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,000
 They all have a life.

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,160
 They all have souls.

168
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,680
 They can become connected to the wielder's heart.

169
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,670
 Watch closely.

170
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,700
 Wind can be gentle,

171
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,600
 but it can also cut like blades.

172
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,120
 This technique was taught by the Spear Deity.

173
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,000
 Its name is Windbreaker!

174
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,920
Xiao Se...

175
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,010
I withstood 13 moves.

176
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,390
I got you three of them.

177
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,670
You did well.

178
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,380
Qianluo!

179
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,150
Senior Sister.

180
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Xiao Se. Leave now.

181
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,170
A technique of the Directorate of Astronomy.

182
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,030
Interesting.

183
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,490
Old Master. That's enough.

184
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,400
Tang Lian. Well done.

185
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,050
You even dare try to fight me now?

186
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,570
However, you're not worthy yet.

187
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,050
Old Master. Please. End this now.

188
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,210
End this?

189
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,890
- Senior Brother! 
 - Senior Brother!

190
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,080
Get them out of here!

191
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,180
You see me as your eldest martial brother.

192
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,490
As long as I can fight, I won't let any of you die.

193
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,270
Senior Brother! Leave now.

194
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,920
Senior Brother!

195
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,300
- Senior Brother! 
 - Senior Brother!

196
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,100
Now you've fallen.

197
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,990
Not yet.

198
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,580
Not yet? Strike me if you can, then.

199
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,610
I will never use the hidden weapon of the Tang Clan again.

200
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,430
Are you severing ties completely with the Tang Clan and defecting to Xueyue City?

201
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,390
I used the hidden weapon of the Tang Clan on you just now.

202
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,220
I feel ashamed.

203
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm unworthy of using another Tang Clan hidden weapon.

204
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,970
If you're ashamed, why haven't you backed down?

205
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,660
I must uphold my principles.

206
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,790
Xiao Se. Xiao Se, you have to go.

207
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,290
We can die anyway, but not you.

208
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,300
Leave?

209
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,710
No one is leaving alive.

210
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,190
Senior Brother!

211
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,410
- The Wuji Staff. 
 - Ruoyi.

212
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,060
We're all the same.

213
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,870
There is only one Sikong Qianluo in this world.

214
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,010
One Ye Ruoyi.

215
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,230
One Tang Lian.

216
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,200
One Lei Wujie.

217
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,290
So today... no one is allowed to die.

218
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,600
Xiao Se... you really are an expert.

219
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,680
Yes. I told you I didn't know martial arts before. I lied.

220
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,880
Why can't people like you join the fight sooner?

221
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,600
Do you have to wait until we're wounded...

222
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,530
to make the entrance?

223
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,780
Sorry, Airhead.

224
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,010
 The Circulation Art can not only help you slowly regain your strength,

225
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,230
 it can help you recover your maximum strength for a brief moment.

226
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,780
 But if you use it, your previous hard work will be in vain.

227
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,450
 Your life will be in danger.

228
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,320
I should have stood out sooner and been the hero.

229
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,510
If I survive... we'll talk about this again.

230
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,920
♫  Our success depends on whether you believe in yourself  ♫

231
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,490
♫  I shall live up to my promise  ♫

232
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,830
♫  I want to break through my limit as I listen to the wind  ♫

233
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,220
♫  My journey begins to change with my thoughts  ♫

234
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,190
Xiao Se...

235
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,130
Xiao Se reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

236
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,530
Old Master. Let me give you a hand.

237
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,270
 This is the greatest prodigy of Beili.

238
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,500
 Despite his young age, his inner force is actually as strong as mine.

239
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,840
 Why can't our inner forces take him down?

240
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,480
 Why, instead, are they circling within the three of us?

241
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,430
Senior Brother Tang.

242
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,650
Do you have a plan?

243
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,950
Whoever moves forward right now...

244
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,410
will only have one outcome.

245
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,800
What is it?

246
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,660
Death.

247
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,980
Old Master!

248
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,040
How dare you! You killed Old Master Tang.

249
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,050
I'll avenge him!

250
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,000
- Xiao Se. 
 - Xiao Se!

251
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,020
Xiao Se!

252
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,410
I have hundreds more bells coming.

253
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,310
Care to give them a try?

254
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,100
- You're here. 
 - I'm here.

255
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,240
I leave... the rest to you.

256
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,600
Xiao Se!

257
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,910
It seems I should arrive sooner next time.

258
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,550
You came all the way here...

259
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,360
just to save him?

260
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,310
Extremely touching, isn't it? It doesn't matter.

261
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,350
Someone else came a long way for you to take your life.

262
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,110
Let's go!

263
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,150
Su Changhe!

264
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,950
Sister!

265
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,340
Master!

266
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,200
Are you all right?

267
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm still alive.

268
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,180
Wait there.

269
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,820
Why are you still chasing me?

270
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,210
It seems a fight is inevitable.

271
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,380
Brother Zhantian, your lightness technique is still as swift as ever.

272
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,830
So, you want to protect these people!

273
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,300
That seems to be the case.

274
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,570
But I don't think you plan to take their lives.

275
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,270
Thank my foolish disciple for asking me to carry a message for the Tang Clan.

276
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,650
Looks like I came late.

277
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,270
Forget it.

278
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,750
This is all determined by fate!

279
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,870
Without medical attention, these kids might die here.

280
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,230
But Li Hanyi, she...

281
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,070
Leave it to Lei Hong.

282
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,480
Scholar Sword Deity, please tend to their injuries.

283
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,360
All right.

284
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,380
Hanyi!

285
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,570
Stop chasing them, Hanyi!

286
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,130
You've been defeated.

287
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,610
Senior, please calm down.

288
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,120
Who might you be?

289
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,830
I'm Tang Ze of the Tang Clan.

290
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,470
I came with Old Master Tang for the banquet.

291
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,580
I want to make a deal.

292
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,050
I wish to discuss it with you.

293
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,820
A deal?

294
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,990
What makes you think you have the right to do so?

295
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,330
Are the lives of all the guests enough to make you listen?

296
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,780
What do you mean?

297
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,980
I'm not talented, but I can neutralize Dark River's poison.

298
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,830
What if I say no?

299
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,880
I assure you, you won't even feel your own death,

300
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,550
and I'll already have the antidote you're carrying.

301
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,530
But what if that isn't the antidote, but a lethal poison?

302
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,810
Or perhaps, some of them are the antidote, while the others are poison?

303
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,510
If you check every pill in every bottle,

304
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,330
most of them will have died by then.

305
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,920
This incident has nothing to do with the Tang Clan.

306
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,980
The Dark River infiltrated the hero banquet and poisoned the heroes.

307
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,150
The Tang Clan and warriors of the Lei Fortress were unharmed.

308
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,190
Finally the assassins from the Dark River were defeated.

309
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,290
Old Master Tang lost his life in the battle.

310
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,770
You shameless scoundrel!

311
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,220
You are right.

312
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,410
- Very well. 
 - I know the consequences.

313
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,980
However, the Lei Clan will make the Tang Clan pay for this bloodshed.

314
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,700
This feud will go on for generations to come.

315
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,670
I'll keep that in mind.

316
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,850
Director, you actually made the time to drop by for a visit.

317
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,030
What a surprise.

318
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,940
State Preceptor, you haven't stepped outside Tianqi City for over a decade now, right?

319
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,170
What could be so important that you had to personally go?

320
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,850
It was a promise to an old friend.

321
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,020
By the way, I heard that five days ago,

322
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,830
His Majesty visited the Directorate of Astronomy after his return.

323
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,100
But Golden Marquis Lanyue left the city before that.

324
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,250
So that was what brought you here?

325
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,550
You were too mysterious.

326
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
All right.

327
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,550
Then I shall get to the point.

328
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,220
His Majesty made a sudden announcement to appoint an heir.

329
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,050
According to the rules in Beili, the succession of the throne will be divided into two scrolls.

330
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,120
One for the Five Eunuchs to interpret His Majesty's will.

331
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,340
The other goes to the Directorate of Astronomy to deliver Heaven's Will.

332
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,620
Only when the names on the two scrolls are the same,

333
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,700
the successor of the throne will be acknowledged.

334
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,350
However, I haven't received that scroll.

335
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,420
That doesn't sit right with me.

336
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,870
Therefore, I boldly wanted to ask you

337
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,920
if have you received that scroll?

338
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,150
No.

339
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,790
Did they ever ask you?

340
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,420
Yes.

341
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,720
Then... did you tell them your answer?

342
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,410
I said before, Heaven's will is merely a possibility.

343
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,760
I merely expressed my own opinion.

344
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,210
In the end, His Majesty must be the one to decide.

345
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,000
The White brings order to the land.

346
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,940
The Vermilion expands the land.

347
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,170
With the Dragon in the opposition, there will be no peace.

348
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,400
The State Preceptor only stated these lines?

349
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,360
Did he really say this?

350
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,730
Absolutely.

351
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,020
After the court was dismissed, 13 officials went to the Director of Astronomy.

352
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,360
But he refused to talk to anyone.

353
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,010
Only Director Jinxuan managed to see the State Preceptor.

354
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,060
Longxie. Tell me.

355
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,700
How would you interpret these lines?

356
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,460
The first two lines are easy.

357
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,770
Lord Bai, Xiao Chong, is one to defend this nation.

358
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,570
He has great composure and keeps a cool head.

359
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,250
Prince Chi, you're the leader to expand our land.

360
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,570
That means your bravery is commendable.

361
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,660
In the future, we'll need a ruler who is also a commander against Nanjue.

362
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,020
But the last two lines are full of variables.

363
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,700
With the last two lines...

364
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,340
It makes the first two lines seem pointless.

365
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,240
Not just the first two lines.

366
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,710
Actually the entire verse is pointless.

367
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,940
These lines... don't sound like words of advice.

368
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,230
Given that they came from the State Preceptor, they feel more like a warning.

369
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,270
A nation to defend, land to expand.

370
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,710
There is only one true dragon.

371
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,750
There can only be one son of Heaven.

372
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,970
The victor gains great power, and the rest can only bow below.

373
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,350
A river of blood.

374
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,710
Generation after generation, one dynasty after another,

375
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,650
the stars are ever-changing.

376
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,510
Dynasties rise and fall.

377
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,880
That is the only rule

378
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,300
that never changes.

379
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,120
Senior Brother! Senior Brother?

380
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,320
Is anyone there?

381
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,450
Stop yelling.

382
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,120
If you keep yelling, your wound may tear open.

383
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
Martial Uncle.

384
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,450
You must have a death wish to use the Inferno with your abilities.

385
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,420
Be grateful that you're still alive.

386
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,970
Martial Uncle. The Lei Fortress...

387
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,360
Don't worry.

388
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,220
Our brethren in the Lei Fortress are mostly unharmed.

389
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,870
All of the poison has been detoxified.

390
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,480
The hero banquet seemed like a great battle,

391
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,730
but only two lives were lost.

392
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,990
Master Hu and Old Master Tang...

393
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,680
The two men who had enough power to shake the martial arts world.

394
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,920
From now on, the power balance will begin to shift.

395
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,110
This is my fault.

396
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,650
I should have arrived sooner!

397
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,250
It's time to move on.

398
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,970
Over the years, he has always suffered from a toxic cold.

399
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,820
Now, he is finally freed from it.

400
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,350
By the way, did you find my sister?

401
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,450
No.

402
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,360
We haven't received any news about her.

403
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,650
No. I have to go look for her.

404
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,400
You're in no shape to do anything right now.

405
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,970
But she's in danger!

406
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,740
Leave it to your master.

407
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,190
If you're feeling better, you should check on your friend.

408
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,220
His condition isn't looking good.

409
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,840
Xiao Se?

410
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,070
How is he?

411
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,650
The Scholar Sword Deity and Wu Xin transferred their qi to treat him.

412
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,150
They've been inside for some time already.

413
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,810
Sir. How is Xiao Se?

414
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,450
How is he?

415
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,230
Xiao Se's hidden pulse was already damaged.

416
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,020
When he moved his qi by force, its root was damaged.

417
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,940
We've done everything we can.

418
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,380
We can only alleviate his injury for some time.

419
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,760
A day or two at most.

420
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,000
Then who can save him?

421
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,040
Your Master, Qi Tianchen, can.

422
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,320
But he already went back to Tianqi City.

423
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,450
Medicine King Xin Baicao can help him too.

424
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,250
But his whereabouts are unpredictable.

425
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,310
No one knows where he is.

426
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,560
What about his disciple?

427
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,940
Your father?

428
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,310
No.

429
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,630
There's another disciple at Sword Heart Tomb.

430
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,820
It's not far from here.

431
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,240
I can ask Martial Uncle to send a letter.

432
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,800
It'll only take half a day.

433
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,650
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

434
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,750
I'll try again.

435
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,660
There's still time! We have the Three-Day Pill.

436
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,220
Three-Day Pill?

437
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,710
The Tao Sword Deity left the mountain.

438
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,330
Why wasn't Xueyue City informed?

439
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,390
Why did Tang Lian's request for backup only arrive now?

440
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,440
Calm down. Calm down.

441
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,580
At least, the children are now safe.

442
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,770
Lei Hong went after Hanyi as well. There shouldn't be any serious problems.

443
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,960
How can I calm down?

444
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,390
The Tao Sword Deity is dead and the Xueyue Sword Deity has gone insane.

445
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,480
The Lei Clan was raided. Old Master Tang and Lei Qianhu are both dead!

446
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,820
But Xueyue City was the last to learn about the news?

447
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,110
And it was only thanks to Lei Yunhe's letter!

448
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,190
The Xueyue City is known to be the finest intelligence agency.

449
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,580
Are we that incompetent?

450
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,410
Calm down. Hear him out first.

451
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,710
Start talking!

452
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,840
Recently, all the Spider Shadows sent to gather intel were intercepted.

453
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,980
Some were captured, and some were killed.

454
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,590
It seems someone is trying to keep the information from reaching us.

455
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,810
How many of them are there?

456
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,690
How are they capable of this?

457
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,120
At least... over a hundred skilled experts.

458
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,270
Who could have the power to mobilize so many experts?

459
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,300
No. I must find them.

460
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,450
You mustn't!

461
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,880
Two city lords are already away.

462
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,220
If you leave, Wushuang City might take action.

463
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,740
"Dark River attacked during the hero banquet."

464
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,590
"Young Master Xiao used his inner force to protect the heroes,"

465
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,370
"but is now heavily wounded."

466
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,520
"His life hangs on by a thread."

467
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,110
"Miss Sikong gave him the Three-Day Pill already."

468
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,770
"Miss Hua Jin, please hurry to the Lei Fortress."

469
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,010
What? He took the pill?

470
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,710
What's wrong?

471
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,150
The pill can bring out every bit of a person's life force.

472
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,740
He can survive for three days, regardless of how serious the injury is.

473
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,810
But if he's not healed after three days, nothing and no one can save him anymore.

474
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,080
What... All the more reason to go there immediately.

475
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,160
Look. Take my Violet Stallion and go.

476
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,750
Then I'll get going.

477
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
Be careful on the road!

478
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,910
Got it!

479
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,990
Lei Wujie. Have some water.

480
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,410
I'm good.

481
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,370
You've been keeping watch the entire day.

482
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,620
Go get some rest.

483
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,630
Your condition is just as bad as Xiao Se's.

484
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,970
It's fine. Just some scrapes.

485
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,790
Are you sure?

486
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,620
Are you worried about me?

487
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,920
Looks like you really are almost better.

488
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,040
Either way, I'll live.

489
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,100
You speak in such interesting ways.

490
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,380
So... Miss Ruoyi.

491
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,370
Why don't you head back and get some rest.

492
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,630
I'll stay here. You and Qianluo can take over tomorrow morning.

493
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,670
All right.

494
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,410
Lei Wujie.

495
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,670
Sir.

496
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,630
Do you remember the gift I gave you back in Xueyue City?

497
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,300
Yes! Late Snow.

498
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,980
Did you read it?

499
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,990
No.

500
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,280
That's why you still sound so immature when you talk to girls.

501
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,730
Each of my gifts is medicine to cure what ails you.

502
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,750
Don't take the book so lightly just because it can be found easily on the market.

503
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,980
That book is very valuable to you.

504
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,970
Too dense.

505
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,300
You are too dense.

506
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,160
But...

507
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,770
Should I really read that book?

508
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,090
Dark River has only killed for money over the past years.

509
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,430
Why did they suddenly dare to raid the hero banquet?

510
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,470
What? Do they want to make enemies with all the heroes?

511
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,740
Their target was Xueyue City, the Lei Fortress, and the Tang Clan.

512
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,170
We were simply caught up in trouble.

513
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,900
 Officers.

514
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,730
This...

515
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,770
You must have come from the Lei Fortress.

516
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,670
I have some questions for you.

517
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,810
There's nothing to tell.

518
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,910
Insolence!

519
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,150
Do you know who our general is?

520
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,050
Stand down!

521
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,350
Do not fight the soldiers of Beili.

522
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,160
Greetings, General.

523
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,670
Kneel!

524
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,210
 Greetings, General.

525
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,800
At ease, Chief.

526
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,380
Get up, please.

527
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,930
I came by because I have some questions.

528
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,820
Ask away, General.

529
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,070
I shall tell you everything I know.

530
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,230
Sit.

531
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,410
Dark River attacked the hero banquet.

532
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,020
How were the casualties?

533
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,640
Lei Qianhu of the Lei Clan and Old Master Tang died during the fight.

534
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,840
But they managed to save everyone else.

535
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,270
As for Dark River, I don't know if they suffered any losses.

536
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,420
There weren't any remains.

537
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,220
Xueyue City sent out many young disciples.

538
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,940
They arrived late for the banquet, but just in time for the great battle.

539
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,610
But I didn't meet them.

540
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,000
How come?

541
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,100
It's said they had suffered grave injuries from the battle.

542
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,890
Some were in a coma too.

543
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,930
They're being healed at the Lei Fortress as we speak.

544
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,000
However, these are mere rumors.

545
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,290
I haven't seen it myself.

546
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,470
Cursed Dark River.

547
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,840
If my daughter really has been hurt,

548
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,760
I'll turn the entirety of Beili upside down to hunt them all down!

549
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,370
Good horse.

550
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,720
Hang in there. We're almost there.

551
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,190
The Lei Fortress is only dozens of li away.

552
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,690
Good horse.

553
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,300
It can't run anymore.

554
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,330
It will die of exhaustion if it does.

555
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,960
What do I do then?

556
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,150
Why are you in such a hurry to get to Lei Fortress?

557
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,560
I have to go treat a patient there. Any later and it'll be too late.

558
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,400
Come on. Sir, your horse.

559
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,290
Let me have your horse. I'll buy it.

560
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,050
If you can't bear to, I'll give you silver.

561
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,310
When I get to Lei Fortress, I'll send the horse back here.

562
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,830
All right?

563
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,530
There's a simpler way. We'll go together.

564
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,860
Steward.

565
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,030
Take good care of her horse.

566
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,320
Understood!

567
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,330
Brother Lei.

568
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,030
Brother Lei?

569
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,630
The sun is already up.

570
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,970
I...

571
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,720
I didn't fall asleep.

572
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,420
I only fell asleep just now.

573
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,340
Lei Wujie. I know you're tired.

574
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,330
Hurry, go get some rest.

575
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,880
I'm all right.

576
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,010
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

577
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,420
Senior Brother Wujie, bad news.

578
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,790
There are soldiers outside. The Lei Fortress has been surrounded.

579
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,380
Soldiers?

580
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,000
We have respect for the Lei Fortress. So we won't intrude.

581
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,100
But if the Clan Leader doesn't show up, we shall enter by brute force!

582
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,890
If you want to enter, you'll have to go through me first!

583
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,590
Despite your injury, you're still brave as ever.

584
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,490
Who are you?

585
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,090
A great question.

586
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,540
My name is written on this sword I'm carrying.

587
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,020
Child.

588
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:43,940
The sword you're wielding is the fourth-greatest sword in the world, the Heart Sword.

589
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,310
You do know a thing or two.

590
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,830
What?

591
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,890
Are you scared now?

592
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,010
You're holding Sister Xinyue's sword.

593
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,440
But you got your foolhardy demeanor from your father.

594
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,260
But... how come you know my parents?

595
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,920
I know a lot more about them.

596
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,690
Come on. Let me put your sword skills to the test.

597
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,880
Let's see if you have your parents' prowess from all those years ago.

598
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,000
He is still recovering from a serious injury.

599
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,420
If you're the one to test his skills, it might kill him.

600
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,190
 Acting Sect Chief.

601
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,740
You came with such a large troop, General Ye.

602
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,650
Do you wish to tear the Lei Fortress apart?

603
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,860
Martial Uncle, who is he?

604
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,340
He is your father's best friend,

605
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,460
the general of Beili's main force, Ye Xiaoying.

606
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,670
Ye Xiaoying the Slayer?

607
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:14,970

608
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,450
