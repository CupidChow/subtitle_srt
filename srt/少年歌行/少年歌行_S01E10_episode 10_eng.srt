00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,160
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17

♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,540
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,300
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,240
Come forth!

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,700
What's wrong with my Tingyu Sword?

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,780
- You... 
 - I knew you were a wo...

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,960
woman.

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,060
But that doesn't do you justice.

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,480
You're like a fairy.

30
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,340
I will return three months later for another challenge.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,640
Her voice is soothing too.

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,800
From now on, I'll call you Peach Blossom Sword.

33
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,020
 And after that, Zhao Yuzhen waited by the peach blossom tree

34
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,720
 for three months.

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,400
 From winter to spring, until the peach blossom blooms again.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,820
 No need to use the Fire Formation Secret Arts

37
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,620
 and he could have big, plump, sweet peaches soon.

38
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,140
 However... The one who promised she would return after three months...

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,580
 did not come at all.

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,280
Master said all beautiful people lie.

41
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,640
It seems like it's true.

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,440
I guess waiting for peaches is more realistic.

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,300
 Silly.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,540
Are you still waiting for the peaches?

45
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,180
You're late.

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,400
I went to search for this sword, so I was late for seven days.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,260
Oh, Iron Glacier from the Records of Famous Swords.

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
A fine sword you have there.

49
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,420
Oh, my little fairy. Why are you wearing a mask again?

50
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,080
It doesn't look good on you.

51
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,500
Taking it off is better.

52
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,920
Talkative.

53
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,520
Zhao Yuzhen. What is that technique?

54
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,300
The secret technique of Mount Wangcheng, Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill.

55
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,740
Why don't you use your sword?

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,480
Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill is the strongest technique of Mount Wangcheng.

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
It is as good as, if not better than, the Infinite Sword Technique.

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
I don't care.

59
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,520
Unsheathe your sword now.

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,400
Only if you take off your mask.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
You...

62
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,160
Satisfied?

63
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,740
Now, draw your sword.

64
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,720
Peach Blossom.

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,580
Creation and destruction are all a tribulation.

66
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,440
And before the coming of life, infinite tribulations have taken place.

67
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,060
♫   Deep in the clouds, I hear your zither whispering faintly  ♫

68
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,040
Zhao Yuzhen. What is that sword technique?

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,920
Infinite Sword for infinite tribulations.

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,400
Those who are caught in it will suffer for an eternity.

71
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,100
Sure. Just as the infinity in its name suggests. I too have my technique.

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,680
♫   The red candle dances with you  ♫

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,160
♫   The snow flies freely everywhere  ♫

74
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,860
♫   How many years have passed?  ♫

75
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,880

♫   This life is full of tribulations  ♫

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
How beautiful.

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,180
♫   The seasons are just our fates passing through this life  ♫

79
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,600
Charge!

80
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,460
Sure. Here I come.

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,220
♫   A moment of romance, a moment to remember  ♫

82
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,800
♫   It's hard for tears to untie the knot in my heart  ♫

83
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,960
♫   When feelings disappear, who's to blame?  ♫

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,980
♫   A lifetime of longing for the love of half a lifetime  ♫

85
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,580
♫   The seasons never age and this love will last forever  ♫

86
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:03,660
♫   At the end, looking back  ♫
 ♫   You are in the waning light  ♫

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,520
♫   A moment of romance, a moment to remember  ♫

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,120
♫   It's hard for tears to untie the knot in my heart  ♫

89
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,940
♫   When feelings disappear, who's to blame?  ♫

90
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,500
♫   A lifetime of longing for the love of half a lifetime  ♫

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,100
♫   The seasons never age and this love will last forever  ♫

92
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:39,050
♫   At the end, looking back  ♫
 ♫   You are in the waning light  ♫

93
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:49,420
♫   At the end, looking back  ♫
 ♫   You are in the waning light  ♫

94
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,320
- You...
 - You...

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,940
Go ahead.

96
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,080
Little fairy.

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,740
You are beautiful, so why do you hide your face under a mask?

98
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,120
You are strong, so why don't you leave the mountain and have an adventure?

99
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,440
My master told me that if I leave the mountain, many people will die.

100
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,380
When I come here the third time, you will come with me and leave the mountain.

101
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,700
I...

102
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,080
I have to get my martial uncle's permission.

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,260
How strong is your martial uncle?

104
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,000
Stronger than me at the moment.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,060
But it might not be the case after a year.

106
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,540
 Then I will be back here after one year.

107
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,400
If he won't let you go, I'll fight him until he does.

108
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,200
We protected him for 16 years, but he still can't escape the mortal pursuits.

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,420

110
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,740
Master told me all that.

111
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,100
And then, he passed out drunken.

112
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,620
After that, my second master also visited Mount Wangcheng.

113
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,960
Just right after your martial uncle, Lei Yunhe, visited it.

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,040
I don't know about the details,

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,320
but if you want to know, you can ask Second Master.

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,360
I don't dare to.

117
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
Oh, right.

118
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm in Xueyue City for a while now,

119
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,700
but why haven't I met the Principal City Lord, Baili Dongjun?

120
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,060
You have.

121
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,800
Have I?

122
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,320
When have I met him?

123
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,760
Not only have you met him,

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,740
but you've also drunken the Beauty of Four Seasons liquor that he made, too.

125
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,940
That's him?

126
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,520
I have to thank him when I see him next time.

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,960
Come on. Drink.

128
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,960
Oh, I have another question.

129
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,920
Why can't Zhao Yuzhen leave the mountain?

130
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,660
There are many rumors about Zhao Yuzhen.

131
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,060
When he was born, a ray of sunlight shone into the room.

132
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,920
The Senior Celestial Master of Mount Wangcheng came to receive him in person

133
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,440
because Zhao Yuzhen is the reincarnation of a deity.

134
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,800
Then he brought Zhao Yuzhen back to Mount Wangcheng.

135
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,320
Since then, Zhao Yuzhen has stayed there.

136
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,620
They say Zhao Yuzhen can't leave the mountain

137
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,620
because of a prophecy by the Senior Celestial Master, Lu Suzhen.

138
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,760
Apparently, if he leaves the mountain, it will bring unrest.

139
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,400
It might even become a threat to a certain someone in Tianqi City.

140
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,740
Therefore, 5,000 Iron Troops are stationed 30 li away from Mount Wangcheng. 
  (T/N: 1 li = 1 mile)

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,600
Just in fear that he will leave the mountain.

142
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,320
Some also say that Zhao Yuzhen contains the fate of Mount Wangcheng.

143
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,820
But the prophecy is most likely fictional.

144
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,480
They're just worried that he won't come back.

145
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,160
So with his power, no one can stop him as long as he wants to leave?

146
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,340
For a decade, he has hardly left

147
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,120
his courtyard, let alone the mountain.

148
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,180
I think he's waiting for someone.

149
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,120
If that person doesn't show up, I think he'll keep waiting.

150
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,920
You have something on your mind.

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,560
I was born to the Tang Clan.

152
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,140
I am a disciple of Tang Lianyue, an elder of the Tang Clan.

153
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,500
I thought I would live and die for the Tang Clan,

154
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,520
but I was sent to Xueyue City out of a sudden.

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,320
And now, I'm a disciple of the Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun.

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,420
Master Lianyue told me to wait for someone here.

157
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,080
And I have waited for six years.

158
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,420
The Tang Clan always does this.

159
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,340
All of you were born with countless duties and responsibilities.

160
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,840
So you lead a life of burdens.

161
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,440
You have to meddle in Xueyue City's affairs while performing the duty your clan gave you.

162
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,080
People try to live every day too,

163
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,960
but they live for themselves.

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,820
They don't have that many other things to worry about.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,720
Are you sure you're here in Xueyue City for money alone?

166
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,300
Everything regarding money is a grand matter.

167
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,460
Eight hundred taels is really grand then.

168
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,480
You're wrong.

169
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,980
It's eight million taels.

170
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,880
If you had that much money, what would you do?

171
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
Assemble an army and raze Tianqi City to the ground.

172
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,040
I'll join you.

173
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,620
Why?

174
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,780
You came to Xueyue City with me. So I'll go to Tianqi City with you.

175
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,920
Sure.

176
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,540
You're not the person I'm waiting for?

177
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is a man waiting for another man?

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Don't speak to your senior brother like that. I will beat you up.

179
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,100
You're just taking advantage of my lack of martial skills.

180
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,500
Do you want to compete in something else?

181
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,520
Sure. In what do you want to compete?

182
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,580
You're a disciple of Liquor Deity.

183
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
So let's compete with our alcohol tolerance.

184
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,740
Sure.

185
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll get some liquor here.

186
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,820
Come on.

187
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,620

188
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,660
Mount Wangcheng.

189
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,800
 The elders are discussing if they should expel you.

190
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,320
 Let them be. I must practice my sword skill and become a sword deity.

191
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,260
 Brother Hong, I know you are headstrong, and I'm not here to persuade you.

192
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,740
 But tell me, why are you doing this?

193
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,760
 Because I saw it on Mount Wangcheng.

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,040
 What is that? No sword aura can be this powerful.

195
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,920
 Miss.

196
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,620
 Did you do that?

197
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,100
 Yes. So what?

198
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,580
 Nothing.

199
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,620
 No. It's not nothing. You... You...

200
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,280
 Miss. I'm Lei Hong.

201
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,940
 The beauty of that slash.

202
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,520
 Mount Wangcheng?

203
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,040

204
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
 Who's there?

205
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,500
 How dare you venture into Mount Wangcheng?

206
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,340
 I'm Lei Yunhe from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

207
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,200
 I'm here to scale the mountain.

208
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,240
 Zhao Yuzhen! Come out now!

209
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,720
 You are courting death!

210
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,940
 Thunderclap Finger.

211
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,900
 Purge!

212
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,320
 My friend saw your technique, and he said the sword is the most beautiful of all martial arts.

213
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,300
 I'd like to see if it's true.

214
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,360
Zhao Yuzhen. I am here again.

215
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,400
I am Lei Yunhe from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect. I'm here to scale the mountain.

216
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,680
The spring moon illuminates the courtyard.

217
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,920
The silver light waltzes on the cup of wine.

218
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,300
As I traverse the corridor, a waft of the half-fallen plum blossom enters my nose.

219
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,900
Under the misty moon is where the young people entertain themselves.

220
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,640
Unlike the autumn moon that guides lost souls.

221
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,620
This is the last pot.

222
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,760
Looks like senior brother won.

223
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,240
Come on, Senior Brother.

224
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,040
Senior Brother?

225
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,300
Truly vigorous. He passed out while seated.

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,900
Oh, I forgot to inquire about the lady in green.

227
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Someone sneaked into Xueyue City at night.

228
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,760
That's where Master is training!

229
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,140
Who are you?

230
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,080
I should ask you that question.

231
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,100
I can tell you my name, but do you have the guts to hear it?

232
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,960
My master is training in solitude. No one is to disturb her.

233
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,420
Please return after a few days if you want to see her.

234
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,320
After two days, I won't stop you if you come here.

235
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,780
So you are a disciple of Li Hanyi.

236
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,940
She has a disciple now?

237
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,080
What is your name?

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
Lei Wujie.

239
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,120
Okay. Move aside now.

240
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,280
I have to see Li Hanyi. Don't waste my time.

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,660
I just said she is currently training.

242
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,320
I may not be strong, but I can't let you enter like this either.

243
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,660
Ridiculous. You can't stop me.

244
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,220
Fire Infusion from the Lei Clan.

245
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,700
And Wushuang Fist. Not bad.

246
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,680
Who are you? Why did you enter Xueyue City at night?

247
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,900
Do you know this sword?

248
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,240
It's a broken sword.

249
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,920
Li Hanyi broke my sword.

250
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,740
Its name is Severance.

251
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,660
One slash to sever the water, and a thousand rivers change their course.

252
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,200
You're the City Lord of Wushuang City, Song Yanhui.

253
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,900

254
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,100
Is Wushuang City invading Xueyue City now?

255
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,940
What are you on about, brat?

256
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm here to test my sword with your master.

257
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,120
I don't have time for you.

258
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,460
Move aside.

259
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,200
City Lord Song, if you want to enter,

260
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,520
you'll have to fight me.

261
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,980
You are not qualified enough to unleash my sword.

262
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,240
Let go of me!

263
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,060
Like I said, as long as I am still alive, you can't enter.

264
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,980
Tingyu.

265
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,740
 Find the reason to draw your sword.

266
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,600
 The reason to draw my sword...

267
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,820
Sword Art.

268
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,800
 I too have my technique.

269
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,560
 Sword Art, Beautiful Day.

270
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,820
Beautiful Day.

271
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,240
A technique by Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

272
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,360
Please enlighten me, City Lord Song.

273
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,200
It is beautiful.

274
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,060
Now you are qualified.

275
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,100
Master.

276
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,320
The Beautiful Day passed down by a sword deity, you said?

277
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,600
When did I ever teach you a lousy technique like that?

278
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,180
If this gets out, it will make me look very bad.

279
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,640
Master, I now have a reason to draw my sword.

280
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,480
If that is enough to make you this elated,

281
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,480
how am I supposed to teach you even stronger techniques?

282
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,380
He drew his sword to protect someone.

283
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,880
You found yourself a good disciple.

284
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,160
Why does it always come to this?

285
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,080
I heard you have found a disciple too.

286
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,900
He managed to unlock the Wushuang Sword Box and is training to command the 13 swords.

287
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,800
My disciple is far more talented than I am.

288
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,240
Within five years, he'll become a sword deity.

289
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,600
Sure.

290
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,400
Five years.

291
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,180
Within three years, my disciple will become a sword deity.

292
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,220
As confident as always.

293
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,840
Song Yanhui, you sparred with me thrice and you failed thrice.

294
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Today will be your final attempt.

295
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,900
After today, you will stop hoping that you can surpass me.

296
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,240
Bring it on.

297
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,940
Third City Lord.

298
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Luoxia. Have you seen what a sword deity is like when they are mad?

299
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,800
They say a sword deity is above emotion.

300
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,320
They don't experience happiness, rage, sadness, or sorrow.

301
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,140
Other than the Wrathful Sword Deity who made a name with his imposing aura,

302
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,980
other sword deities don't get angry easily.

303
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,100
They don't because if they do, the world will be sundered.

304
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,460
Hanyi is angry now.

305
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,780
Song Yanhui hurt Lei Wujie?

306
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,580
Lei Wujie managed to unsheathe Tingyu Sword, but for the reason Hanyi fears the most.

307
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,120
Luoxia. Song Yanhui and you have a history in Canglan River, don't you?

308
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,680
Go save him.

309
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:44,460
Otherwise, the City Lord of Wushuang City will die in Xueyue City.

310
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Any regrets for dying by my sword?

311
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,060
Crossing the blades today, I have no regrets.

312
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,400
You're weighed down by your duty.

313
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,800
If you weren't the City Lord of Wushuang City, you would have reached a greater height.

314
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Please spare him.

315
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,260
Why?

316
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,720
You already failed thrice.

317
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Why do you have to do this again?

318
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,740
Haven't you had enough?

319
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,500
You drew your sword to protect others.

320
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I hate to see this,

321
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,400
but I see why.

322
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,580
Because your father is Lei and your mother is Li.

323
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,880
I'll accept this.

324
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,460

325
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,560
 You... Why are you in Xueyue City?

326
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,980
Stop moving.

327
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,140
And don't play dumb.

328
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,680
You know very well I'm in Xueyue City.

329
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,980
Whether you're here or not, what difference does it make?

330
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,460
Whether you win or not, what difference does it make?

331
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,800
I have a disciple now.

332
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,660
His vast potential is second to none.

333
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,640
I'm sure he can restore Wushuang City to its former glory.

334
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,720
I lost, but my disciple won't.

335
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,640
Is restoring Wushuang City's former glory that important?

336
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,900
Is defeating Xueyue Sword Deity that important?

337
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,860
What about me?

338
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,740
Am I not important?

339
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,540
Yes.

340
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,080
Sorry.

341
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,240
- You deserve a beating. 
 - You...

342
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,720
What?

343
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,060
I just want to hit you.

344
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,040
Rascal. Do you know who I am?

345
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,240
Why should I care? You bullied my master.

346
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
I swear on my name that you will leave this place bruised.

347
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,060
Master. Once I have him, I'll castrate him for you.

348
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,620
Come again and I'll hit you again.

349
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,540
Master, you lost again.

350
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,120
Yes.

351
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,240
I lost thoroughly.

352
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,060
Li Hanyi and I are several leagues apart.

353
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,840
From now on, I won't spar with her in Xueyue City anymore.

354
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,000
It's okay. I'll win on your behalf.

355
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,180
I met someone this time.

356
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,540
His name is Lei Wujie.

357
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,340
 I'm Lei Wujie of the Lei family from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

358
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,980
 Never heard of you.

359
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,960
 You will.

360
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,640
It's rare to see that you actually remember someone's name.

361
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,280
Because he's unique.

362
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,500
Just like everyone I met on that day.

363
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,720
I remember their faces.

364
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,580
He is a disciple of Li Hanyi now.

365
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,680
I tested his martial arts skills.

366
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,180
He's still quite inferior to you.

367
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:42,080
I told Li Hanyi that you would become a sword deity within five years.

368
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,860
But she said Lei Wujie only needs three years.

369
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,640
It seems like she has high expectations of her disciple.

370
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,120
You can command ten swords now.

371
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
Good.

372
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
If Lei Wujie can become a sword deity within three years, then I'll do it within a year.

373
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
Go forth.

374
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,840
Withdraw!

375
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,680
I count on you to bring Wushuang City back to its prime.

376
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,380
Master. I don't want to be the City Lord of Wushuang City.

377
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,680
I just enjoy training with my swords.

378
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,500
But if that's your wish, I'll do it.

379
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,480
All right. Come back to Wushuang City with me.

380
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720

381
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,900
He is Song Yanhui.

382
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,080
I hit the City Lord of Wushuang City?

383
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,400
He is Song Yanhui.

384
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,720
I hit the City Lord of Wushuang City?

385
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,860
My goodness.

386
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,960
Oh, no.

387
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, no.

388
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,740
What should I do?

389
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,220
Where's your master?

390
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,480
Song Yanhui has left?

391
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,300
He already left last night.

392
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,020
You still wear that mask everywhere you go.

393
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,800
It's ugly.

394
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,680
Your beauty hasn't faded after all these years.

395
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,400
Does wearing a mask now help to preserve one's beauty?

396
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,780
That's amusing.

397
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,700
If you care about him, why don't you return to Wushuang City with him?

398
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,000
I am not his priority.

399
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,520
It doesn't matter whether I'm there or not.

400
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,280
Yesterday, I...

401
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,220
How is Lei Wujie?

402
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,600
Is he all right?

403
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,380
He is not gravely wounded.

404
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,620
He just needs a few days of rest.

405
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,460
When do you plan to tell Lei Wujie who you are to him?

406
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,040
I don't know how to address the subject.

407
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,420
When I sent him to the Lei family, he was just three years old.

408
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,760
Who knows if he still remembers that he has an older sister.

409
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,080
Besides, I have been busy practicing my swordsmanship for years.

410
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,560
I have never visited him once in the Lei family.

411
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,300
I am not a good sister.

412
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,480
But I'm happy with the way it is now.

413
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,700
I mean it.

414
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,380
How is the current situation any good?

415
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,660
When I told you to go to see Zhao Yuzhen, you said the same thing.

416
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
That was different.

417
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,920
The Stillwater Sword technique I'm learning requires me to have a still heart.

418
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,780
But he...

419
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,340
 How is he feeling?

420
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,740
 With the aid of our celestial masters, he regained consciousness.

421
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,300
 But it'll be a while before he can make a full recovery.

422
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,240
 Does that mean he cannot see any visitors for the next few days?

423
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,760
 Master says that if someone disturbs him, he might go rogue again.

424
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,100

425
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,460
 All right then.

426
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,060
 Please ask Master Lu to tell him that I was here.

427
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,540
I guess it's good for both of us.

428
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,080
You're just like that scoundrel.

429
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,300
I would hit you if you weren't stronger than me.

430
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Just unbelievable.

431
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,540
I can finally wield Tingyu Sword now.

432
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,000
However...

433
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,960
 No. You don't unsheathe it with your strength.

434
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,120
Something feels off.

435
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,480
It's like something is missing.

436
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,880
Xiao Se! Senior Brother!

437
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,080
How did you know we would be here?

438
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,900
It seems like you have mastered the First Level of Stillwater Sword.

439
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,380
Unlike someone I know whose fleeing skill just keeps improving.

440
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,500
Senior Brother.

441
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,600
Will you fight me?

442
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,360
Sure.

443
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,940
This sword was given to me by Xueyue Sword Deity.

444
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,420
Beautiful Day!

445
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,560
That's your Beautiful Day?

446
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,540
Do you have Second Master's approval?

447
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,880
Senior Brother, please don't tell my master.

448
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,780
I've been practicing with her and if I ever make a mistake,

449
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,900
she hits me on my head.

450
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,600
 Wrong.

451
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,360
 Xiao Jie. How many times have I told you?

452
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,280
 When you thrust, the sword has to be horizontal.

453
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,580
 That wasn't Sancai Sword Technique at all.

454
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,360
 Xiao Jie.

455
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,580
 Xiao Jie. Stop crying.

456
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,460
 I'll buy you candied hawthorn, all right?

457
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,300
Lei Wujie?

458
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Snap back, you dummy.

459
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,760
Sorry.

460
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,500
It's just that when Master hits me, it feels quite familiar.

461
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,300
You're indeed a dummy.

462
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,640
It hurt a lot when you were hit.

463
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,380
But now, you reminisce about the moment when you were hit.

464
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,080
Oh, right. Where is the Second Master?

465
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,440
She trains with her sword in the mountain every day.

466
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,960
In the morning, she supervises my training.

467
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,220
But after that, she's gone.

468
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,240
When it's time to eat, she appears again. On time too.

469
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,780
Do I hear a complaint?

470
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Of course not.

471
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm just thinking that if one day I quit martial arts,

472
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,260
I will leave the mountain and be a chef.

473
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,500
Anyway, why are you two looking for me?

474
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,620
For two things.

475
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,820
What is it?

476
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,460
One, your martial uncle, Lei Yunhe, visited Mount Wangcheng again.

477
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,340
He made a path with one strike again.

478
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,720
The second strike overturned the Qiankun Hall.

479
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,340
And the third strike seized Zhao Yuzhen's Qingxiao Sword.

480
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,940
I heard they fought overnight

481
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,520
 and the entire Mount Wangcheng was enveloped by storm and thunder.

482
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,860
 Other than the Six Saints who stayed to spectate,

483
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,240
others left the mountain to avoid the crossfire.

484
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,580
And then, your martial uncle rode his crane and left.

485
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,800
 Zhao Yuzhen also admitted that this time, Lei Yunhe did not lose.

486
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,160
That's great. What's the second thing, then?

487
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,700
The second thing is about a person.

488
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,840
Who?

489
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,520
Ye Ruoyi.

490
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,620
Who? I don't know her.

491
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,320
No. You know her.

492
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,660
Not only do you know her,

493
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,740
but she also offered you her handkerchief to wipe your nosebleed.

494
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,860
Why did you bring her up?

495
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,780
I didn't ask about her.

496
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,480
All right. Then we leave.

497
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,060
Continue, please.

498
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,980
Continue, please.

499
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,160
Ye Ruoyi came to Xueyue City in the same year as me.

500
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,400
She is the daughter of Ye Xiaoying, the Defender General.

501
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,140
Daughter of a general?

502
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,940
Why is she in Xueyue City?

503
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,440
To recuperate.

504
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,180
No one knows what sickness she has.

505
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,920
The Third Master is a masterful healer,

506
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,220
but her condition hasn't improved after many years.

507
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,640
The experts from the Directorate of Astronomy have offered their service too but to no avail.

508
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920
It must be something complicated.

509
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,740
Don't dwell on it.

510
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,500
Tell me. Do you want to befriend her?

511
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,180
Befriend?

512
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,720
The annual Flora Spectacle of Xueyue City will take place in three days.

513
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,840
All disciples will attend it.

514
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,380
Including the reclusive Ye Ruoyi.

515
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,260
Do you want to be there?

516
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,720
Flora Spectacle... Will my master be there?

517
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
Do not tell her about it.

518
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,980
Third Master said anyone can come.

519
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,400
Except for Li Hanyi.

520
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,880
Why?

521
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,320
Perhaps because once she swings her sword...

522
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,720
 Go!

523
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,480
all flowers from the Flora Spectacle will be destroyed.

524
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,440
What do we do during the spectacle?

525
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,740
Do we fight?

526
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,640
The Flora Spectacle is not about violence, but elegance.

527
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,680
Most participants are from the younger generation.

528
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,900
They recite poems and drink.

529
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,060
It's one of our annual grand events.

530
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,360
I can drink.

531
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,100
But reciting poems?

532
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,780
I can't do that.

533
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,680
Besides, we are martial artists.

534
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,360
Reciting poems feels too... pretentious to me.

535
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,620
Why?

536
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,100
When Wuxin taught you the fist technique in Yushi, he recited a poem as well.

537
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,200
Was he being pretentious then?

538
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,580
Right.

539
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,540
Wuxin is a spectacular individual.

540
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,320
I wonder how he is doing now.

541
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
He is no easy foe.

542
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,700
He mastered the Six Higher Knowledge Arts right away

543
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,940
and fought Wushuang from Wushuang City.

544
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,680
It's been a while now, so he must have improved a lot.

545
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Sect Master.

546
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,700
Duan Chenyi's remnants and family have been captured.

547
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,080
How do we proceed now?

548
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Expel them from Tian Wai Tian.

549
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,340
Noted.

550
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,280
When I traveled with your father in Beili, I came across this poem.

551
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,700
It reads, "The autumn is upon us,"

552
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,180
"but the moon from my hometown will always shine the brightest."

553
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,800
"But the moon from my hometown will always shine the brightest."

554
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,900
That's a fine poem.

555
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,720
Sect Master, what is a hometown to you?

556
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,160
Tian Wai Tian or Hanshui Temple?

557
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,080
Yu Ji.

558
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,980
Uncle Yu Ji, do you know where my father came from before he joined Tian Wai Tian?

559
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,800
The Grand Master was the son of a general from the previous dynasty.

560
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,620
He was born in Tianqi City.

561
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,500
He was born there,

562
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,780
but what he regarded as his hometown was Gusu.

563
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,340
He spent a few blissful years with my mother there.

564
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,080
They gave birth to me too.

565
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,980
So my hometown should be Gusu.

566
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,140
I have gone there before.

567
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,220
There is a lake.

568
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,860
And next to the lake is a weeping willow.

569
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:40,380
I was told that my mother used to comb her hair with the lake as her mirror.

570
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,740
But one morning,

571
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,080
people found her comb there,

572
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,820
but not herself.

573
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,520
And then, father brought me here.

574
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,180
If I'm not mistaken,

575
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,800
father died in Gusu.

576
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,020
Where your hometown is doesn't matter.

577
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,900
Your hometown is where the people you hold dear reside.

578
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,620
All right.

579
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,820
We have eliminated all threats of Tian Wai Tian.

580
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,140
With you two here, there will be no problem for the foreseeable future.

581
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,380
Sect Master, are you...

582
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,160
I want to train in solitude.

583
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,560
Until when?

584
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,520
Until I attain the Mental Phase of the Unknown.

585
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:50,000

586
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,100
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

587
