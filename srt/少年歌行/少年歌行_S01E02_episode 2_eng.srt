2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,160
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,860
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,300
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,420
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,740
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,420
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,740
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,670

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,060

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Interesting.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,620
These people don't even know what the Golden Coffin contains.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,260
And they dare meddle in this.

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,960
Senior Brother. While it's chaotic down there...

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,620
- Hand it over!
 - Hand it over now!

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,680
I can't tell how strong the white-haired man with the jade sword is.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,060
- Hurry up now! 
 - Quick!

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,560
So noisy.

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,140
Senior Brother... D-Did you see him unsheathe his sword?

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,380
Only the first three slashes.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,160
After that... it was all a blur.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,620
I've been cleaning up a lot of weaklings lately.

36
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,480
To my surprise, it seems quite a few got through.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,660
I'm afraid neither Tang Lian nor I can defeat him.

38
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,604
In order to do that...

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,440
Although Sangu City saw a surge in visitors recently, many people have gone missing too.

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,380
In order to spare Young Master Tang the hassle,

41
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,980
I've already eliminated all the unnecessary ones.

42
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,440
You make that sounds nice,

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
but you merely wiped out my rivals.

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,560
And now you want me to fight you.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes, that too.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,132
So you're here for the coffin, too.

47
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,240
That belongs to Xueyue City.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,900
It seems like you don't what it is you're transporting.

49
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,020
It doesn't belong to Xueyue City.

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,812
You know what it is?

51
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,508
Of course.

52
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,660
Sir, I think you're mistaken.

53
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,828
Right now, the most important thing here at Belle Manor is our bet.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,640
If you're not interested,

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,112
please move aside.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,740
A bet?

57
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,948
A bet of life and death.

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,388
I'm a swordsman.

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,576
Only my sword decides my fate.

60
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:59,048
Not a few dice.

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,344
However, I'm in the mood to play this game with you two tonight.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,828
If you two win, you'll have one night to flee.

63
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,408
Looks like you really have a lot of confidence.

64
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,256
Confident or not,

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,260
we'll know after the game.

66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,044
Telekinesis.

67
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:42,464
I can't believe you would use such lousy tricks like this.

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,060
What?

69
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,460
Come here!

70
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,900
Do the people from Xueyue City only know how to kill and nothing else?

71
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,900
One round to decide the outcome.

72
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,400
If you win, I'll leave.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,020
If I win, leave the coffin here.

74
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,968
That sounds fair.

75
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:07,820
I once gambled with someone for three days straight

76
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,260
in Tianqi City's Qianjin Gambling House and even won a city.

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,840
Do you believe me?

78
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,808
Only seeing is believing.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,432
If you can win a city, then...

80
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,840
Five, five, six. Big.

81
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,044
This is why you people in the martial arts world are boring.

82
00:05:56,044 --> 00:06:00,296
A bet is only fun when you gamble.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,468
If you already know the outcome,

84
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:07,072
then the bet is meaningless.

85
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:10,160
Then tell me, what do you want to wager on?

86
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,220
I'll wager on five, five, six.

87
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,380
Big.

88
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,680
You...

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,020
Okay.

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,484
It's been decided then.

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,400
Oh, no.

92
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,360
Shattering Touch.

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
 A victim of it might look fine from the outside,

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,020
 but his innards will be completely destroyed.

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,920
 The die within the casing must be...

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,540
Of course, it looks grim.

97
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,240
Since it's a gamble, how could it be that easy?

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you want to change your decision then?

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Change my decision?

100
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,460
The sure-fire way to win a bet

101
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,240
is to believe that you will win.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,412
As long as you believe you'll win,

103
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,264
you will win.

104
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,820
Let's see.

105
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,080
Five, five, six.

106
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,204
Impressive abilities, Young Master.

107
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:21,088
No talent really, no.

108
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:22,880
It's just a small trick.

109
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,580
I don't know any martial arts.

110
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,864
You don't?

111
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,804
The path you're walking is a dangerous one.

112
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,812
If you can't fight,

113
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
it's best to stay out of this then.

114
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,164
Are you breaking your promise now?

115
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,424
I said I wouldn't kill you.

116
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,404
But my friends might beg to differ.

117
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:46,188
They don't have as much patience as I do.

118
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,372
We also have a friend.

119
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:53,488
He can be a bit goofy, but his martial arts aren't bad.

120
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:56,880
So your friends might not have the advantage.

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,540
If you knew who I was,

122
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,080
you wouldn't have made that claim at all.

123
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,020
The White-Haired Deity of Tian Wai Tian.

124
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,340
Tian Wai Tian?

125
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,744
Twelve years ago, your name would indeed invoke fear.

126
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Who are you?

127
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,380
How do you know me?

128
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,116
Not many know you.

129
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:20,368
But naturally, some do.

130
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,980
I didn't expect to run into someone from Tian Wai Tian here.

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,392
Did you forget your promise from before?

132
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,500
Lu Yudi from Wushuang City?

133
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,032
Wouldn't have thought you'd be here too.

134
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:44,440
Tang Lian. Regardless of our rivalry,

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,656
the Golden Coffin cannot end up in his hands!

136
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,700
The content of the coffin originally belonged to Tian Wai Tian.

137
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,676
You want to stop me?

138
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,520
There are nine stages for martial arts and above them exist four phases.

139
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,340
They are the Hard Phase of Mortals, the Unrestrained Phase of Earth,

140
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,600
the Carefree Phase of Heaven,

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,612
and the Mental Phase of the Unknown that only exists in legend.

142
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,100
The martial arts of the White-Haired Deity is already in the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,796
Tian Wai Tian.

144
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,744
As expected from them.

145
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,104
What is this Tian Wai Tian?

146
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,140
You might not be familiar with the name of Tian Wai Tian.

147
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,880
But it also goes by another name that will surely jog your memory.

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,460
- Demon Sect. 
 - Demon Sect?

149
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,220
Can we win?

150
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,008
If he hadn't shown mercy just now, that slash just now would have...

151
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,100
You're all descendants of my old friends.

152
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,956
Out of respect for your masters, I won't kill you.

153
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:31,396
But if you get in my way again, don't blame me for not showing mercy.

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,480
Cloud Shuttle!

155
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,020
Light Frost!

156
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,180
Thread!

157
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,560
Jade Wish!

158
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,864
The Wushuang Sword Box from Wushuang City.

159
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:26,200
I heard no one has been able to command it for a century now.

160
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,360
Kiddo, what is your name?

161
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,120
Wu Shuang,  (unparalleled)  from the Imperial Wushuang City!

162
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,260
After the emergence of Xueyue City,

163
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,960
Wushuang City has already lost its imperial title.

164
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,200
It will be added back sooner or later.

165
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Interesting.

166
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,200
What do you want?

167
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't want to miss the opportunity to fight a powerful foe.

168
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,224
Naturally, I'm here to learn from my senior.

169
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,960
Arrogant, aren't you?

170
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,768
I don't have time for you.

171
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:01,400
Charge!

172
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,020
Stop there!

173
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,208
Wu Shuang, come back!

174
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,880
After them!

175
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,900
That White-Haired Deity said his friends were here too.

176
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,400
If I were you, I would go watch over that coffin right now.

177
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,900
Do we continue after them?

178
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Yes.

179
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,260
That's... Lei Wujie's thunderbolt explosive.

180
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,676
I am Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect's,

181
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,380
Lei Wujie for the Lei family!

182
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,780
Is there anyone else who's not afraid to die?

183
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,900
Attack!

184
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,188
He's so fast.

185
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,640
Fire Infusion of the Lei family.

186
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,380
No wonder.

187
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,800
Attack!

188
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,160
Tang Lian?

189
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,956
You managed to come out of there alive?!

190
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,460
- How are you feeling? 
 - I just picked up that technique,

191
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,700
so I haven't fully mastered it yet.

192
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,220
But I feel much better now.

193
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,260
I can fight around ten of them, no problem.

194
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,800

195
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,416
Fire Infusion.

196
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:54,160
Where you convert your rage into a short burst of power.

197
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,824
How long will your dying ember last?

198
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,840
Enough to defeat people, like you, who are neither human nor demon!

199
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,196
Such audacity.

200
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:10,620

201
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,428
What... what is going on?

202
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,536
It's sorcery.

203
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,460
Sorcery??

204
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,260
What kind of sorcery?

205
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,940
Look.

206
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,080
What?

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,360
Do you notice any discrepancies?

208
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,884
The moon is so big.

209
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,460
But it looks like it is pasted in the sky.

210
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,464
Today is the 22nd.

211
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,060
It should be a last quarter moon.

212
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,348
How could it be a full moon?

213
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,504
Then Senior Brother, you mean...

214
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,360
It's a Guxu Technique.
 (T/N: loneliness and emptiness)

215
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,604
It is an evil formation.

216
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:13,172
Anyone who's it in will enter a dream-like state.

217
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:15,800
You have to be careful now.

218
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,032
In this dream, everything is an illusion,

219
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:24,364
but everything is also real.

220
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,820
Senior Brother, what are you talking about?

221
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,988
I don't quite get it.

222
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,580
Careful!

223
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,700
Senior Brother...

224
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,100
You got him!

225
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,092
How did you do that?

226
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,224
This is a formation filled with murderous traps.

227
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,580
What you see might not be real.

228
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,300
In moments like these, you need to forget about your eyes,

229
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,520
and use your ears instead.

230
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,948
Forget about my eyes?

231
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:16,444
Listen for their positions.

232
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:19,020
One of the compulsory lessons in Xueyue City.

233
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,740
Listen carefully.

234
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,820
Our world is vast and wind currents are everywhere.

235
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,640
The biggest weakness of this formation is that it blocks all external noises.

236
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,936
So in the Guxu Formation, you just need to listen carefully.

237
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:41,164
of a crack in the air, that's when your enemy exposes himself.

238
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,692
Listen...

239
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,760
Here.

240
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,260
Got him!

241
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,292
You're gifted.

242
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,460
I've learned martial arts since I was young after all.

243
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,452
And I trained my hearing too.

244
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,220
Locate positions by sound and killing with your eyes closed.

245
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,900
If you think with just that, you can break the Guxu Formation, you're too naive.

246
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,208
 I guessed right.

247
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,800
 In order to meet with Fairy Rui,  senior brother would definitely pass by Belle Manor.

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,736
 It seems like he's been trapped in some sort of formation.

249
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,840
Is this the Guxu Formation that trapped father when he fought

250
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,052
against the Demon Sect?

251
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,800
Senior Brother, why are there so many of them?

252
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,280
What should we do now?

253
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,540
Remain calm. Stay composed.

254
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,380
They can't do anything to us!

255
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,520
 I just have to buy time until the White-Haired Deity comes back.

256
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,081
 There's nothing you can do!

257
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,568
 Father told me that the Guxu Formation relies on the formation and disruptive sounds.

258
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:02,096
 Break the flute and you break the formation.

259
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,020
Senior Brother, what was that sound?

260
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,420
A spear.

261
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,920
Qianluo is here.

262
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,300
Stop talking.

263
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,140
I need to follow the sound.

264
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,920
The formation is broken!

265
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,880
 Boss!

266
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,980
What do you think, Senior Brother?

267
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,772
Isn't our teamwork impeccable?

268
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:42,760
You must be Miss Sikong. I'm Lei Wujie.

269
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,860
Don't let your guard down. It's not over yet.

270
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,380
You!

271
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,220
I've already dispelled this sorcery.

272
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,740
What else do you have?

273
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,748
Go on and show me!

274
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:57,880
Indeed. You broke the formation.

275
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,296
So you still followed us here.

276
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:05,668
Truth be told, we don't want to offend Xueyue City.

277
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:10,540
But it seems like Wushuang City and Tian Wai Tian are involved now too.

278
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,360
If we don't intervene today, it'll probably be too late.

279
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,228
What's inside the coffin is important to us

280
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,620
and we really cannot give it up.

281
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,920
What exactly is in this coffin?

282
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,488
For some, it's fame and fortune.

283
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,100
For others, it's a powerful technique.

284
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,184
For us, it's just an answer.

285
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,720
An answer?

286
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,300
- Thirteen years ago... 
 - Enough.

287
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,048
The Wangyi Pavilion Massacre thirteen years ago.

288
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:49,544
Within one night, the entire pavilion was wiped out.

289
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:52,908
Only after the eldest son of the owner, Xie Liuyi, was knocked out,

290
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,168
did he survive.

291
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,200
After he regained consciousness, he lost his memory regarding that night.

292
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,460
He then studied under Sage Tian Quan and became an assassin.

293
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,744
His name in the martial arts world, Ming Hou.

294
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,796
You seem to know quite a bit.

295
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,920
Unfortunately, the Wangyi Pavilion Massacre was an unsolved case.

296
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,480
Even if there were clues to be had, they would have disappeared after 13 years.

297
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,860
Do you truly believe the coffin contains your answer?

298
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,332
Although truth be told, I'm getting more and more interested in this coffin.

299
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Stop!

300
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,568
This is getting more and more interesting.

301
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,064
L-Living dead!

302
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,292

303
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,260
And it's a monk?

304
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,412
A living monk?

305
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,660
No ordination scar.

306
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,444
He isn't a monk.

307
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,520
Bring him with us first.

308
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,100
Ming Hou!

309
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,880
I've met you before.

310
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,060
I've paid a visit to Abbot Wang You,

311
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,080
but he wouldn't help me.

312
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,308
The old monk said before, the answer you want, no matter what it is,

313
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:40,076
would become your inner demon.

314
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:44,476
I appreciate Abbot Wang You's kindness.

315
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,280
However, knowing the answer will be my inner demon,

316
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,020
not knowing will also be my inner demon.

317
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,200
Makes sense.

318
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,820
Ming Hou!

319
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,180
Are you all right?

320
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,280
What the old monk wouldn't tell you,

321
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,544
I've already told you.

322
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
This is suffering you'll have to face alone.

323
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,324
All the best.

324
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,240
To return the favor,

325
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,000
we can get you out of here.

326
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,324
This is my own suffering to face.

327
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,780
You should go.

328
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,140
Let's go!

329
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,940

330
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,260
- Wu Shuang! 
 - Wu Shuang! Wu Shuang!

331
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,380
- Wu Shuang! 
 - Wu Shuang! Wu Shuang!

332
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,760
Wu Shuang!

333
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,120
Wu Shuang!

334
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,680
- Senior Brother! Quick, come overe here! 
 - Wu Shuang!

335
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,140
- Wu Shuang! 
 - The Wushuang Sword Box?

336
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,360
What...

337
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,760
How can this be?

338
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,960
Is Junior Brother... Is he...

339
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,360
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

340
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,540
How can this be?

341
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,932
How could this happen?

342
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,020
How am I supposed to face the City Lord now?

343
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,180
- It's all my fault! 
 - Senior Brother.

344
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,564
I got ahead of myself and that's why he's dead.

345
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,932
Oh, my junior martial brother!

346
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,920
Wushuang...

347
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,840
Why are you all here?

348
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,112
He was fast and I got tired of chasing him, so I fell asleep.

349
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,540
- I'm going to kill you!
 - Senior Brother!

350
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,940
- Senior Brother! 
 - I'm going to kill you!

351
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,220
- Senior Brother!
- Senior Brother.

352
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,840
- Don't do this. 
 - Let go of me! Let go!

353
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,260
- Calm down, Senior Brother! 
 - Come here!

354
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,300
- Calm down. 
 - Come here right now!

355
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,880
Stop. Calm down.

356
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
- Don't do anything reckless. 
 - Yes.

357
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,340
Forget it. That person's martial arts skills were great.

358
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,880
He could have killed you easily. I'm glad you're fine.

359
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,820
What should we do now then?

360
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,588
Even if we return to Belle Manor now, we won't get what we're after.

361
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,072
Let's retreat and come up with a plan.

362
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:46,420
Let's go.

363
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,440
Close your eyes! Don't look into his eyes!

364
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,212
Your liaison is finally here.

365
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,300
I'm Wu Chan.

366
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,780
This is my junior brother.

367
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,252
He is also a disciple of Abbot Wang You.

368
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:30,860
He's Wu Xin.

369
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,300
This isn't a great place to talk.

370
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Let's leave here first.

371
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,180
Lian, aren't osmanthus cakes your favorite?

372
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,880
What's the matter?

373
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,140
Let me feed you.

374
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,460
There are people around. Stop playing.

375
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,240
Such a prude.

376
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,100
By the way, why did you come along?

377
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,120
I like that Young Master over there.

378
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,860
Is there a problem?

379
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,940
Oh right, Tang Lian.

380
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,740
I received a missive stating that per Nine Dragon Sect's request,

381
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,100
Xueyue City assigned you to escort my junior brother to meet up with me.

382
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,560
But it didn't mention your friends here.

383
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,010
May I know...

384
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,380
This is the daughter of the Spear Deity Sikong Changfeng, Sikong Qianluo.

385
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,172
I'm Lei Wujie of the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

386
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,348
I'm just the owner of an inn.

387
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:39,824
The young man of the Lei Clan and I have a business to settle in Xueyue City.

388
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:42,380
This is Fairy Rui from Belle Manor.

389
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,972
They are with me.

390
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,580
Why was your junior brother in the Golden Coffin?

391
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,320
The Golden Coffin is a treasure of Hanshui Temple,

392
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,520
it's capable of suppressing one's inner force.

393
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,080
- Suppress? 
 - He's studied the 32 Secret Arts of the Rakshasa.

394
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,280
Master Da Jue thinks he is dangerous, so he is to travel within the Golden Coffin.

395
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,572
I heard once you master any one

396
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:10,564
of the secret arts, you can obtain godlike power.

397
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:14,124
And to think your junior brother here learned all of them.

398
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,824
Abbot Wang You was a revered monk.

399
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:22,960
Why would he allow Wu Xin to study those secret arts?

400
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,380
This all starts with Abbot Wang You.

401
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,580
Abbot Wang You had mastered the Six Paths of Buddhism.

402
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,720
Among which his Divine Eye was the most powerful.

403
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,280
 They say visitors who went to Hanshui Temple

404
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,672
 just have to look at Wang You

405
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:44,300
 and they will automatically repent for their sins.

406
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
It was that powerful?

407
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,680
Nothing needed to be said?

408
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,080
His mastery of Divine Eye was so proficient

409
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,240
 that he could read someone's mind and change it with one look.

410
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,340
 That's how he enlightened people.

411
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,820
However, several months ago,

412
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,960
Abbot Wang You suddenly passed away.

413
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,996
Rumor has it that after Abbot Wang You passed away, his body turned to dust

414
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,496
 and disappeared into thin air.

415
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:12,580
The rumor is right.

416
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,824
How did he die suddenly?

417
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,600
Another rumor says that Abbot Wang You died from a heavy burden.

418
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,764
You know many things, Brother.

419
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:25,980
That's right.

420
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,400
Someone had been forcing Master to surrender my junior brother over because he

421
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,588
once performed my master's mind-reading trick too.

422
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:36,320
But his is called Devil Eye.

423
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,700
Devil Eye?

424
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,308
What technique is that?

425
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:40,940
I've never heard of it before.

426
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,340
The Divine Eye sees your soul and reads your mind.

427
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,416
But the Devil Eye doesn't see your soul.

428
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,680
It sees your inner demon.

429
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,316
If I'm not mistaken, your junior brother here cannot study Buddhism somehow,

430
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:01,492
so Abbot Wang You let him study the Rakshasa secret arts.

431
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,808
And now, he alone has those 32 secret arts and is incredibly powerful.

432
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:11,080
No wonder so many people want him.

433
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,680
Master Da Jue wants to use the Purification Chants to erase those secret arts from Wu Xin.

434
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,392
But that will cripple him.

435
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:20,260
From what I know,

436
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,700
after learning that, Wu Xin used the Tortoise Breathing Technique and laid down in the coffin.

437
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,720
He didn't fight back.

438
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,836
So the Demon Sect is interested in your junior brother because of those secret arts?

439
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:33,960
Demon Sect?

440
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,460
Enough.

441
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,420
Knowing too much about the Demon Sect brings ill fortune.

442
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,600
He is right.

443
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,920
Who's there?

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
You again.

445
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,480
All right.

446
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,600
Hand him over to me and you all can live.

447
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,100
In your dreams.

448
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,640
Senior Brother, let me help you!

449
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,380
Protect my junior brother!

450
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,840
Aren't you going to help?

451
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,180
I don't know any martial arts.

452
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,780
Protect Wu Xin.

453
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,100
That White-Haired Deity's martial arts have reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven level.

454
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,072
All of you will be barely able to touch him.

455
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
Wait for me!

456
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,780
Wait for me!

457
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,740
I haven't gotten on yet!

458
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,380
It's futile.

459
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,020
That person's abilities are too great.

460
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,340
A numerical advantage won't change anything.

461
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,220
What should we do then?

462
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,448
Use this.

463
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,580
You know what that is?

464
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,488
Judging from its shape, it must be the Lei Clan's Qilin Fire Fangs.

465
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:46,020
They say it carries the Qinlin's anger and can scare a god away.

466
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
The recipe for that has been lost a long time ago!

467
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,860
We only have one left and my sect leader has it!

468
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,560
How could he possibly give it to me?

469
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,640
Wait. My sect leader told me not to tell that to anyone.

470
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,700
Poor Lei Clan.

471
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,100
But you're right.

472
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,040
This is our only option.

473
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,616
I don't want to carry on with you juniors.

474
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:08,300
I'll say it again, hand him over to me.

475
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,880
My patience has a limit.

476
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,500
Move aside! I'll take care of it!

477
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,880
So it has come to this.

478
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,860
A sword?

479
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,620
The Lei Clan prohibits its disciples from using a sword, doesn't it?

480
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,900
Is that the sword, Shabu?
 (T/N: Killing Terror)

481
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,308
The long sword, Shabu.

482
00:35:58,308 --> 00:36:00,740
You're a disciple of Lei Hong.

483
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,800
All right.

484
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,976
All of you truly think I won't kill you.

485
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,900
What an imposing sword aura.

486
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,404
Seems he's really angry now.

487
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,460
Too much.

488
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,756
You look too much like him.

489
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,620
Crimson Frost Leaves.

490
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,908
I didn't expect this move from you despite your injury.

491
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,088
You must be within the top three of the Tang Sect.

492
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,400
Have you heard of this saying?

493
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,000
What saying?

494
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,820
Three moves of the Tang, leaves one dead.

495
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,180
It seems like I underestimated you.

496
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,364
Who else wants to try me?

497
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,000
Me!

498
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,940
If you don't want to be permanently disabled, don't get up.

499
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
 Can you still stand up?

500
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,980
 Stop gawking. Only you can hear me.

501
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,061
 If you still have any strength left,

502
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:23,380
 then stand before me.

503
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,904
 Stop looking around.

504
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:29,420
 If you keep looking around, that white-haired man will take me away soon.

505
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,620
 Hurry up and stand before me.

506
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,100
Tang Lian. I don't want to kill you.

507
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,980
Why force me to?

508
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,920
 How many more hidden weapons do you have?

509
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,040
 Bone Nail. Iron Spike. Dragon Needle.

510
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,892
 You only have one chance.

511
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,900
 Unleash all of them.

512
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,320
 The Fatal Flying Blossoms

513
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,200
 isn't something every Tang Sect member can use.

514
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,932
 But you're Tang Lian.

515
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:00,660
 You can do it.

516
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,832
If you insist,

517
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,060
prepare for my attack then.

518
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,560
 Now!

519
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,132
 You didn't let me down.

520
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:36,536
 But that won't delay him for too long.

521
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:57,000

522
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,000
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

523
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,380
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

524
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,500
