2
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,690
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,270
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,600
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,620
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,720
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,900
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,020
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,720
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,250
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,270
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,320
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,590
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,700
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,150
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,970
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,070

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,890
I once thought the martial arts world was like the imperial court. There would only be unlimited ambitions.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,140
Until I met you, Wu Xin,

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,000
Tian Wai Tian, Xueyue City, and Dark River.

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,260
Now, I think the martial arts world is like a mirror.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,770
A mirror?

29
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,270
When we stand before a mirror, we can see ourselves.

30
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,540
When we face the martial arts world, what we see is our hearts.

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,730
You mean... we see what we want to see?

32
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,790
That's right.

33
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,280
Where your heart wants to go is the martial arts world.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,950
If your heart is full of resentment and darkness,

35
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,380
then you'll think that the martial arts world is ruthless.

36
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,710
But if your heart sees hope and brightness,

37
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,740
then you'll become more enlightened in the martial arts world.

38
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,720
So remember, no matter what happens,

39
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,020
don't forget what you were like when you first entered the martial arts world.

40
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,800
That is your true self.

41
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,160
Your grandfather says you lack a killer's heart,

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
that's exactly your most invaluable trait.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,350
But in this martial arts world, it's about life and death, we cannot avoid it.

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,190
You can only follow your heart to wield your sword.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,440
in order to protect what you cherish.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,630
I understand.

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,900
That's good.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,940
Let's go. Time to go to Lei Fortress.

49
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,910
We've wasted enough time.

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,790
Senior Sister. Brother Mingxuan.

51
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,160
Sorry for making you worry.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,350
No need to apologize to us.

53
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,280
Reward your horse.

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,090
Hedgehog Luo. Are you going to Lei Fortress too?

55
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,640
H-Hedgehog? What?

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,270
Look at you, you look like a human hedgehog.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,010
So you're jealous of me?

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,860
I won't be going with you all to Lei Fortress.

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,430
Master is waiting for me. She'll scold me again if I come back late.

60
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,790
All the best on your journey, everyone.

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,200
Take care.

62
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,690
Take care.

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,190
Rest for a moment.

64
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,850
Thank you.

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,950
This beauty was born with a birth defect in the heart meridian.

66
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,250
It is a miracle that she still breathes.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,530
Indeed.

68
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,770
She has received treatment in Xueyue City for many years.

69
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,710
She's Ye Ruoyi, Brother Lei's new love interest.

70
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,430
That dummy fell in love?

71
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,340
Hurry. Bring me to him.

72
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,070
That said, why did you come back?

73
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,740
To visit old friends.

74
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,280
The Spear Deity told me to return to Tian Wai Tian, and I did,

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
but he didn't say I couldn't come back to Beili.

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,840
Besides, if I didn't come back, all of you would be dead soon.

77
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,660
What do you mean?

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,310
Do you think you're the only one being hunted now?

79
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,660
I received news that after Xiao Se and Lei Wujie left Xueyue City,

80
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,600
they didn't head to Lei Fortress right away.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,410
They went to Mount Wangcheng instead.

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,410
After they left the mountain, they disappeared.

83
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,150
I followed their tracks and found this.

84
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,490
It said you were ambushed in the Tang Clan and needed help.

85
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,240
The homing pigeon told me that it was supposed to head to Tianqi City,

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,150
but it was intercepted on its way by me.

87
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,920
Homing pigeon?

88
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,390
You can speak with animals?

89
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,840
All creatures have souls.

90
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
I can even communicate with other plants and creatures.

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,150
Do you believe me?

92
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,060
I didn't dispatch this homing pigeon.

93
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,560
Of course, it wasn't you.

94
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,850
It told me that Ye Ruoyi dispatched it.

95
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,390
She is no simple woman.

96
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,560
Lei Wujie is going to be in trouble soon.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,190
What do you mean?

98
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,650
Because their whereabouts have been leaked.

99
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,430
The message from the homing pigeon was intercepted before it reached the General's Residence.

100
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,340
Are Lei Wujie and Xiao Se that important?

101
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,830
I used to think they were only important to me.

102
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,920
How unexpected.

103
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,390
Minghou.

104
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,480
You're with him?

105
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,740
I asked him to come here to pick us up.

106
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,140
He has gone insane, but his killer instinct remains.

107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,870
Don't approach him carelessly.

108
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,150
Why is he doing your bidding?

109
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,970
That's a long story.

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,450
This is...

111
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,550
What a strong aura.

112
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,780
Did you see him draw his sword?

113
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,940
He didn't.

114
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,000
He used the scabbard to knock Ming Hou back.

115
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Why is it, whenever I return to the martial arts world, I find powerful individuals.

116
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,210
Hard, always so hard.

117
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,380
I've just supressed her injury.

118
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,930
If we get into another fight, I'm afraid even immortals can't bring her back.

119
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,210
Take her away. I will buy you some time.

120
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,680
Can you?

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm different from who I used to be.

122
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,900
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,760
Even if a Blade or Sword Deity were here, I can hold my ground.

124
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,540
Okay. Be careful.

125
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,210
Sir. Your opponent is me.

126
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,650
Astral Travel. Divine Eye.

127
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,580
Yes. They're powerful skills.

128
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,250
And this one too.

129
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,370
Mahakasyapa Palm of Ye Dingzhi.

130
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,450
I know who you are now.

131
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,640
Likewise.

132
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,030
But I can only confirm it once I see your sword.

133
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,530
We'll have to see if your worthy of it!

134
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
Mahakasyapa Palm again.

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,310
This is called Arhat Bind.

136
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,980
Arhat Bind?

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,040
Even the Buddha will fail to bind me!

138
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,300
You wish to see my sword, don't you?

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,170
Take a good look today.

140
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,970
Defeat the Army Sword.

141
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,950
It is ranked 5th on the list of famous swords.

142
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,050
The Sword of Dominion.

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,270
You are indeed the Rage Sword Deity.

144
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,440

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,190
Old Master.

146
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,500
Why did you came back alone.

147
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,350
Where's Tang Lian?

148
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,330
The Sect Master of Tian Wai Tian, Ye Anshi, rescued Tang Lian.

149
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,670
What Sect Master of Tian Wai Tian?

150
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,750
He's just an adolescent child.

151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,300
Compared to your peers, you are far from Lianyue.

152
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,680
Yes.

153
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,700
It's fine if Tang Lian is gone.

154
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,360
But that woman is trouble.

155
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,730
General Ye Xiaoying crossed someone like that.

156
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,480
The Tang Clan will have a difficult future.

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,280
I can only put my hopes on an old friend.

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,050
An old friend?

159
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,470
He's on his way here as we speak.

160
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,850
He should have arrived by now.

161
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,910
Rage Sword Deity.

162
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,350
Pardon my insolence, but if I may ask...

163
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,800
We don't know each other.

164
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
Why do you wish to see me dead?

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,250
Because... you are the son of Ye Dingzhi.

166
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,680
My only regret in this world is that I didn't fight your father.

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,910
So you came to bully his son?

168
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,010
That's unbecoming of you, I'm afraid.

169
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,070
Therefore, I want to kill you to vent my anger.

170
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,740
If you want to kill me, it won't be that easy.

171
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,900
How so?

172
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,080
Run, Ming Hou.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
We can't deal with him.

174
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,780
Go!

175
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,110
Unrestrained Shapeless Technique.

176
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,310
This was the technique Ye Dingzhi used back then!

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,910
Good.

178
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,670
Not good enough.

179
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,490
Die!

180
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,680
Let's go.

181
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,150
Well done, old man.

182
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,830
Mu Yumo. You're late.

183
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,310
Sometimes I like to make you wait for me.

184
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't look at me like that.

185
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,520
I'm too old for your seduction.

186
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,330
You must be joking.

187
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,410
In your young or old age, you've always been a heartless man.

188
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,460
Where is that disciple of yours who's just as heartless?

189
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,170
Why isn't he here?

190
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,250
He is in Lianyue Pavilion.

191
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,400
Before he finishes his task, he won't leave that place.

192
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,720
Back to business.

193
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,330
Your guest hasn't arrived yet.

194
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,820
He's not coming anymore.

195
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,620
I know him well.

196
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,320
Either he comes or he won't at all.

197
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,970
The Rage Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian, never comes late.

198
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,020
It won't be easy to do this without him,

199
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,280
but it's not impossible.

200
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,650
And I thought I could meet the famous Rage Sword Deity.

201
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,280
In the end, it was just a small chat with you.

202
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,980
How boring.

203
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,130
Array of Thousand Arachnids.

204
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,470
And what's up your sleeve?

205
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,970
How marvelous.

206
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,690
The ultimate secret poison of the Tang Clan and the ultimate secret array of Dark River.

207
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,960
Victory will be ours.

208
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,610
Do not underestimate our foes.

209
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,920
Who may our esteemed guest be?

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,430
It's the Leader of Dark River.

211
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,730
I am the Second Prince of Beili, Prince Bai, Xiao Chong.

212
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,150
I have been waiting a long time to meet you.

213
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,370
You were waiting for me?

214
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,870
Indeed.

215
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,370
Your younger brother impersonated someone

216
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,810
and used Dark River to help himself.

217
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,980
Although he's of a prominent background, when the Dark River kills

218
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,380
we never looks at one's identity.

219
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,060
Therefore, he has to die.

220
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,920
Please show mercy, Leader.

221
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,790
If I hadn't shown any mercy,

222
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,850
he would've died the moment he met me.

223
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,450
The Ninth Prince wanted Dark River to work with the Tang Clan to eliminate the Lei Clan.

224
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,930
The Lei Clan is a key ally of Xueyue City.

225
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,170
Eliminating the Lei Clan is akin to breaking one of Xueyue City's arms.

226
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,410
This is a good deal for Dark River.

227
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,840
However, eliminating the Lei Clan is just the prologue.

228
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,620
You came to me and this is when this matter really starts to unfold.

229
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,890
Starts?

230
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,090
Yes.

231
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,820
I said I was waiting for you because among all the princes in Tianqi City,

232
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,930
I've always had my eyes on you from the beginning.

233
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,120
I will help you ascend to a higher status,

234
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,130
while you will help Dark River flood the entire martial arts world.

235
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,360
Second Brother!

236
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,500
Do you know your mistake now?

237
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,580
Elder Brother.

238
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,630
I... know I was wrong.

239
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,020
Apologize to the Leader right now.

240
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,530
No need.

241
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,620
You knew who I was already?

242
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,880
Young man. You underestimated Dark River.

243
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,950
From the moment you stepped foot in here, we already knew who you were.

244
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,160
We spared you because...

245
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,990
Prince Bai, Xiao Chong. You're our best bet.

246
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,470
Leader.

247
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,510
If I may be frank, Dark River isn't my first choice.

248
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,900
Aren't you afraid that I would kill you both here if you turned me down?

249
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,900
I don't think you're that unwise as to sabotage yourself.

250
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,030
But choices have to be made now.

251
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,670
Prince Bai.

252
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,210
Some things shouldn't be decided so hastily.

253
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,870

254
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,160
We've only eaten plain buns for days, I'm losing weight.

255
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,370
Be grateful you even have plain buns to eat.

256
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,510
Why didn't you ask your grandfather for money when you left Sword Heart Tomb?

257
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,420
Every sword they sell there is worth a fortune.

258
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,040
Your grandfather is also among the top three wealthiest men in the martial arts world.

259
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,340
Why are you this poor?

260
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,170
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why?

261
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,100
What's going on?

262
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,010
 - See?
 - What is the bounty about?

263
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,410
I'll go have a look.

264
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
 Those old guys can't even do anything.

265
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,570

266
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,970
 One thousand taels!

267
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,640
Xiao Se!

268
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
The magistrate is looking for a physician and will pay 1,000 silver taels for it!

269
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,170
1,000 silver taels!

270
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,030
Do the three of us know medicine?

271
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,950
That thousand taels has nothing to do with us.

272
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,980
Who cares if we don't know medicine!

273
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,300
Don't you have that Penglai Pill or Three-Day Pill?

274
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,410
Hush.

275
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,330
Do you know how expensive one Penglai Pill is?

276
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,840
Do you know how many people will come after me if they knew about the Three-Day Pill?

277
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,190
I know the Penglai Pill is precious.

278
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,840
But in this small town, no one has heard of it anyway.

279
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,190
Use it to save a life.

280
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,180
It'll accumulate good deeds for you too.

281
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,410
- Come on, come on. 
 - Hands off.

282
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,600
I've studied medicine before.

283
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,110
Who said we need my Penglai Pill in order to save someone?

284
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,630
Airhead.

285
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,900
You studied medicine?

286
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,030
What exactly did you do in the past?

287
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,430
Your lightness technique is great, gambling skills are up there,

288
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,190
and you studied medicine! You're amazing!

289
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,480
All right. Keep it down now.

290
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,940
Can you teach me?

291
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,020
I was reckless.

292
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,370
Please forgive me.

293
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,040
You weren't reckless. You did the wrong thing.

294
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,510
I just wanted to help you, Second Brother.

295
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:20,680
In this world, many people will do anything to gain profit.

296
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,880
Needless to say, you can find them all over Tianqi City.

297
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,310
And many others can leave behind profit for righteousness.

298
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,710
They have principles and faith.

299
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,430
They don't want to be sullied one bit.

300
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,030
They're willing to live for it and also die for it.

301
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,990
Xiao Chuhe is like that.

302
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,380
That's why he ended up where he is now.

303
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,150
I respect people like that!

304
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,180
But I can't become someone like them.

305
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,900
He is flawless.

306
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,700
While I've been colored.

307
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,560
But this color... can only be white.

308
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,670
I also have lines that can't be crossed.

309
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,810
I understand.

310
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,600
A missive from Shao Han has arrived.

311
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,540
His Majesty is probably asking why we haven't come back yet.

312
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,670
Have there been unusual movements from other princes?

313
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,920
Everything else is normal.

314
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,550
Other than Prince Chi, Xiao Yu.

315
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,780
He claims to be sick and hasn't come out for more than a month.

316
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,520
That decadent prince...

317
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,870
Jingxia.

318
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,150
Do not underestimate Prince Chi.

319
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,870
Although only you and he were given the titles of princes,

320
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,310
you earned it with your talent.

321
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,010
What did Xiao Yu do?

322
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,220
Isn't it all because his mother is Father's favorite?

323
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,140
You can't judge a book by its cover.

324
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,530
Prince Chi, Xiao Yu, is a formidable enemy.

325
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,880
Also, you just made another mistake.

326
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,500
We weren't the only ones given the titles of prince.

327
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,700
You're referring to Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe?

328
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,780
Dark River has already said that they wouldn't stop hunting him.

329
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,280
In my opinion, you should just help them...

330
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,520
Presumptuous!

331
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,170
Did you forget what I just told you?

332
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,200
Did you get in touch with Master?

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,720
My people are looking for him as we speak.

334
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,380
But the Rage Sword Deity is hard to track down.

335
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,750
I just know that he left when he had almost arrived at the Tang Clan.

336
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,290
I hope we can contact him in time.

337
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,940
Only he

338
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,070
can stop everything.

339
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,000
Physician, how is it?

340
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,230
Her meridian system is beyond repair. Prepare for her funeral.

341
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,120
Farewell.

342
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Physician!

343
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,430
God will bless us. She will be fine.

344
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,460
- She will be. 
 - I only believe in the physicians now.

345
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,400
Right.

346
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,380
It seems like only the Medicine King, Xin Baicao, can save her now. I'll go look for him.

347
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,000
Sir.

348
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,410
Someone gave us this and said she would be cured after consuming it.

349
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,920
Penglai Pill?

350
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,120
Peng...

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,070
What is a Penglai Pill?

352
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,910
A sacred pill from the Hall of Medicine in Tianqi City.

353
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,260
Only the royal family can use it.

354
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,050
How many of them are there?

355
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,320
Two men and one woman. The woman carries a spear.

356
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,870
As for the two men, one is dressed in red and another in green.

357
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,510
It's them!

358
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,540
Xiao Se! Qianluo!

359
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,230
Lei Wujie!

360
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,910
- Senior Brother. 
 - Senior Brother! Senior Brother.

361
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,040
I...

362
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,800
It's only been a few days and you miss me that much already.

363
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,370
You have no idea!

364
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,030
Without you, we were bullied wherever we went.

365
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,670
So you only know how nice I am when you're being bullied.

366
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,540
Of course, not!

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,720
If you're here, is Miss Ye here too?

368
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,550
Is the patient Ruoyi?

369
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,970
Ruoyi.

370
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,140
The Penglai Pill will unblock your meridian system.

371
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,080
I know it'll hurt a lot, but I know you can survive it.

372
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,960
Hang in there.

373
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
I haven't had time to say this to you.

374
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,620
Long time no see.

375
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,270
Rest now.

376
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,540
- How is she? 
 - Xiao Se.

377
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,760
How is Ruoyi?

378
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,240
She's all right for now.

379
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,250
Did you know Sister Ye from before?

380
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,670
You seem to know her condition very well.

381
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,580
If I didn't mishear, she said "long time no see" just now?

382
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,950
We've known each other since we were young.

383
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,410
If you two already knew each other, why didn't you acknowledge one another?

384
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,030
Unless...

385
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,570
Unless you two used to be together.

386
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,340
What?

387
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,790
We're just old acquaintances.

388
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,270
How dare you.

389
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,470
How dare you.

390
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,600
All right.

391
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,150
You three, come with me.

392
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,080
I need to speak with you.

393
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,900
What did I do?

394
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,630
So the Tang Clan plans to betray Xueyue City?

395
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,990
I don't know what my old master is plotting now,

396
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,590
but it's clear that he doesn't want to side with Xueyue City anymore.

397
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,030
So he must have a better offer.

398
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,020
Senior Brother, this is serious.

399
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,410
You should return to Xueyue City to inform the Third City Lord.

400
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,100
I can't.

401
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,720
You haven't made up your mind yet?

402
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,080
No.

403
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,150
The Tang Clan is my family, but Xueyue City is my sect.

404
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,800
I don't want to betray either of them.

405
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,420
I just want to stop this from happening.

406
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,270
I can't go back to Xueyue City, because I have another important task at hand.

407
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,090
What is it?

408
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,950
Lei Fortress will hold a hero banquet soon.

409
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,980
But right now, they don't know about the changes within the Tang Clan.

410
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,270
This banquet might be the start of Tang Clan's defection.

411
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,520
I already wrote to Xueyue City, but it might be too late.

412
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,500
So I have to head to the Tang Clan to stop this.

413
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,030
But this will be challenging.

414
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,170
Indeed. I can't do this alone.

415
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,300
But as long as I do my best, I won't regret it.

416
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,280
Don't worry, Senior Brother. You've got us too!

417
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,170
As for Ruoyi, I checked her heart meridian just now.

418
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,960
She was able to survive until now because there's zhenqi in her body and it's very familiar.

419
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,650
It was Wu Xin.

420
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,030
Wu Xin?

421
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,240
Where is he?

422
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,210
He didn't come with you?

423
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,150
We ran into a strange swordsman.

424
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:39,150
He wore a black cape and carried an enormous sword.

425
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,210
Wu Xin kept him busy so I could take Miss Ye and run.

426
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,850
Could it be him?

427
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,020
 Yan Zhantian and the Tang Clan are all on the move now.

428
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,280
 Could the mastermind be Second Brother?

429
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,250
 But with his character, Second Brother wouldn't collude with Dark River.

430
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,410
 Could it be...

431
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,380
Xiao Se, you know him?

432
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,130
The Rage Sword Deity.

433
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,910
The Rage Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian?!

434
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,140
He ranks 3rd on the Top-Ranked List.

435
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,480
He's as famous as my sister!

436
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,110
But how can Wu Xin fend him off?

437
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,570
I've already observe carefully.

438
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,290
Wu Xin is much stronger than before.

439
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,250
If I'm not mistaken, he should be in the Carefree Phase now.

440
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,570
Even if he can't defeat the Rage Sword Deity, he should be able to run.

441
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,200
Why? You think Wu Xin doesn't stand a chance against him?

442
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,550
No.

443
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,330
It just reminded me of another Sword Deity.

444
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,870
Lei Wujie.

445
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,640
Why hasn't the Xueyue Sword Deity contacted you yet?

446
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,280
That's right!

447
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,180
The three strongest individuals of the Tang Clan.

448
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,550
Tang Yin, Tang Lie, Tang Yue.

449
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,510
You're here to kill me, too?

450
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,120
The Tang Clan is working with Dark River.

451
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,610
What a rare sight.

452
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,950
I bet this is Su Changhe's doing, right?

453
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:13,050
From the moment I met him, I knew he would be devoured by his own ambition one day.

454
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,640
Li Hanyi, how arrogant of you.

455
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,510
Arrogant?

456
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,930
It's just two head figures of Dark River and the three strongest fighters of the Tang Clan.

457
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,510
I'll just get rid of all of you.

458
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,100
Muyu.

459
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,400
They say Beili is the land of swords and Nanjue is the land of blades.

460
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,250
It's time to show them how foolish they are.

461
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,960
Iron Glacier, as majestic as always.

462
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,830
I'm called Xie Qidao because one will die after I swing my blade seven times.

463
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,770
I've already swung it six times.

464
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,880
If you won't die in my next attack! I'll have to change my name.

465
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,930
No need.

466
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,380
Because today, you'll die!

467
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,660
Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

468
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,310
Don't get ahead of yourself now!

469
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,150
I have yet to perform the final slash.

470
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,620
It's named Deity Killer.

471
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,140
Why did he stop all of a sudden?

472
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,930
This is a unique technique for those who study fist and blade techniques.

473
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,720
It's called Convergence.

474
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,750
Right now he's channeling all his strength before he does the final slash.

475
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,620
Su Muyu. You couldn't stop me last time.

476
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,210
Today, it will be the same.

477
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,870
It's different today because I'm not alone.

478
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,700
If you truly wish to force Xueyue City's hand,

479
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,850
then please accept your demise!

480
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,280
Qingxiao.

481
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,140
Pardon my disobedience here.

482
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,330
I have to leave today.

483
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,490

484
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,850
Martial Uncle Yin.

485
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,780
They all say I'm the world's greatest diviner.

486
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,780
But I think the title should be yours.

487
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,020
How else are you here to stop me whenever I want to leave?

488
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,260
Do I need to divine to know if you want to leave or not?

489
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,850
 Mount Wangcheng is such a blissful place.

490
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,020
Even the animals can communicate.

491
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,120
They know I'm about to leave.

492
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,510
Martial Uncle,

493
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,650
I wish to leave the mountain to see things.

494
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,170
It's getting boring here.

495
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:04,240
Yuzhen. Are you going to let us down after what your master and Mount Wangcheng did for you?

496
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,480
It can't be helped.

497
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,760
I've left Qingxiao Sword behind.

498
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,660
Please take over my position too.

499
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,720
Once Feixuan grows up, he can inherit my position.

500
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Peach Blossom.

501
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,340
Peach Blossom. Let's go find her, all right?

502
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,960
For the sake of my dead martial brother, I cannot allow you to leave!

503
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,190
Martial Uncle. You can't stop me.

504
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,230
 I do not seek the Heaven's Will, yet the Heaven's Will came knocking at my door.

505
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,740
 I only wish to drink liquor in the peach blossom forest.

506
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,900
 Martial Uncle Yin and Master, forgive me.

507
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,100
Master!

508
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,810
Grand Martial Uncle, don't leave.

509
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,170
Why?

510
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,140
Even Martial Uncle Yin can't stop me.

511
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,000
Why are you here?

512
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,480
Do you want a beating?

513
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,440
Fei Xuan. Your Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill is nearly mastered.

514
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,630
To marvel at it, you need to see the world.

515
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,170
After three months, you'll venture out of the mountain.

516
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,480
Do not come back within three years.

517
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,570
Fansong. You will accompany Fei Xuan.

518
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,660
You are fated to have two masters.

519
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,070
One is me and our fate has run its course.

520
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,920
There's another in the martial arts world.

521
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,230
He is as good a swordsman as me.

522
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,150
No. I don't want two masters.

523
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,530
I just need you.

524
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,840
Foolish child.

525
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,020
I'm merely leaving the mountain, not walking to my own death.

526
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,790
No need to cry like that.

527
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:54,660
But Grand Martial Uncle, what you said sounds like your final speech.

528
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:03,020
I just think that I'll be gone for a long while.

529
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,550
Don't worry. I won't die.

530
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,850
I'm Zhao Yuzhen, the one who's almost reaches godhood.

531
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,260
I fear no heavenly tribulations.

532
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,350
I'll leave and come back with a wife.

533
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,850
Master!

534
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,970
I look forward to the day we'll meet again!

535
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,500
He is the Tao Sword Deity.

536
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,690
So what if there's a heavenly tribulation?

537
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,250
He can dispel it in one second!

538
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,990
That was a beautiful slash.

539
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,720
As expected from a Sword Deity.

540
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,950
But it's a pity.

541
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,860
Haven't you notice that your power has been dampened?

542
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,000
This Phase-Suppressing Array was specifically set up for you.

543
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,140
Su Changhe...

544
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,310
And we laced the entire bamboo forest with colorless and odorless poison from the Tang Clan.

545
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,300
Once inhaled,

546
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,790
it'll slowly eat away at your inner force.

547
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,760
You're just like before, always resorting to dirty tricks like this.

548
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,800
Indeed.

549
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,920
Otherwise, how could I keep the Xueyue Sword Deity here forever?

550
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,660
You think my inner force has all but depleted.

551
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,920
But I still have the strength to perform one more slash.

552
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,100
And after this slash, I will die and so will you.

553
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,190
You overestimated yourself.

554
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,610
♫   Deep in the clouds, I hear your zither whispering faintly  ♫

555
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:52,120
♫   Cruel winter moon, turns every scene into a dream  ♫

556
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:01,190
♫   In a daze, the red candle dances with you  ♫

557
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,330
Little Fairy. I've missed you so much.

558
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,730
I've always wondered what our reunion would be like.

559
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,410
The Tao Sword Deity, Zhao Yuzhen.

560
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,550
I forgot we have an audience.

561
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,620
You're the ones who've hurt her. Is that right?

562
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,080
Yes.

563
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,270
Don't blame me then.

564
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,470
I'm usually a pacifist. But when I fight, someone will die.

565
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,270
Be careful now.

566
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,550
Little Fairy. Wait for me.

567
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,290
Okay...

568
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,520
Hellish Palm.

569
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,930
You want to play these tricks with me.

570
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,720
Back off!

571
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,230
The ninth level of Taiyi Lion Secret Arts from Mount Wangcheng.

572
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,830
They always say among the Five Sword Deities,

573
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,970
the Lone Sword Deity is the strongest, because he can occupy one city alone.

574
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,700
He is unrivaled.

575
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:28,340
But I've always believed that you are the strongest.

576
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,780
Whether I'm the strongest or not doesn't matter.

577
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,310
I do not draw my sword easily.

578
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,530
I have 36 Peach Blossom swords.

579
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,070
What do you think?

580
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,330
Delusional.

581
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:46,560
Buddha says that all those with forms are delusions.

582
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,850
And what do you Taoists believe?

583
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:56,280
All those have a form, except for my Little Fairy, are delusions.

584
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,020
I say that. I can speak on behalf of Taoism.

585
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,910
Infinite Sword Array. Hear me! Rise!

586
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,200
Am I too late?

587
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,270
Are they all real swords?

588
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,860
How can one person summon these many weapons?

589
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,630
They must be swords conjured from the qi of sword.

590
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,670
- But they are just as lethal... 
 - Advance!

591
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,890
- They're like real ones. 
 - Go!

592
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,300
Leader. We'll all die if this carries on.

593
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,070
Leader, please find us an opening!

594
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,300
You have a solution?

595
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,050
You won't be disappointed.

596
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,030
Okay!

597
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,080
Let me send the Tao Sword Deity to the afterlife today.

598
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,290
- Little Fairy. 
 - It's too late.

599
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,570
Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm contains 27 needles in total.

600
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,380
The Tang Clan got hit by three.

601
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,580
I intercepted 23.

602
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
And the last one...

603
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,100
Little Fairy...

604
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,120
Li Hanyi was hit!

605
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,860
Kill them.

606
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,780
Zhao Yuzhen forced himself to reach the Mental Phase before performing that slash.

607
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,860
I'm sure it will backfire on him.

608
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,810
Then let's go after them.

609
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,030
Leader.

610
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,190
Leader, long time no see.

611
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,960
How interesting.

612
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,240
The Tao Sword Deity left his mountain and a veteran left Tianqi City.

613
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,340
Please come with me.

614
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,500
If that is the wish of the State Preceptor, I shall comply.

615
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,240
Let's go.

616
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,870
Was I truly too late?

617
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:20,020

618
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,600
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫
