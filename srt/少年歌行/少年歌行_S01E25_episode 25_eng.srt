00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

22

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,070

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,170
Twenty-three years ago,

25
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,800
your ancestors escorted His Majesty and fought their way to Tai'an Hall!

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,330
Amidst that bloodbath, many people died!

27
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,090
But their glory remains!

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,870
This glory runs in your veins!

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,530
Let me ask you!

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you willing to clear a path for Prince Yong'an who is returning to the city by himself?

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,000
 We are willing!

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,260
Good!

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,790
Tiger Soldiers, listen to my orders!

34
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,630
Get ready, soldiers!

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,630
In one hour, we shall depart!

36
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,480
 Yes, Sir!

37
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,421

38
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,370
It's you?

39
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,970
I remember you!

40
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,300
The first disciple of Wushuang City,  Lu Yuzhai.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,040
I remember you too.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Lei Wujie of Xueyue City.

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,660
Wrong.

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,950
What did I get wrong?

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm not that stupid junior brother of mine.

46
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,500
I have a good memory.

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,270
If I've met them once, I'll always remember them.

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,680
You got my name right, but my title wrong.

49
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,490
You've left Xueyue City?

50
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,110
That's not it either.

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,010
I just didn't come here on behalf of Xueyue City this time.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,460
I'm here as one the the Four Guardians of Tianqi!

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,500
Guardian of the East, Azure Dragon.

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
Four Guardians of Tianqi?

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,860
When I was a child, I heard their legendary stories.

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,320
The Azure Dragon was Li Xinyue, the Sword Heart with dreams.

57
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,640
The sword in your hand must be the fourth most famous sword in the world, the Heart Sword.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,700
Then you should even more grateful, you're going to fight a legend.

59
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,300
However, before we start,

60
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,130
I have two things to say to you.

61
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,010
First, as a spear user, you're no match for my Senior Sister Qianluo,

62
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,120
and you're a thousand times worse than my third martial uncle.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,990
What's the second thing?

64
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,260
Second, as a senior brother,

65
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,190
you can't compare to my senior brother, Tang Lian.

66
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,330
And you, Wushuang City, think you can be the best in the world with this?

67
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,870
What a joke.

68
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,590
Get in formation!

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,720
I hate things like formations the most.

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,930
The Kunlun Sword Deity once said swords are a lone weapon.

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,830
The sword is lonely, and so is the swordsman.

72
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,490
A group action like this is simply deplorable.

73
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,780
But I heard that Sword Heart Tomb also has a legendary sword formation.

74
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,840
Sword Heart Tomb's Thousand Men Formation guards the sacred site of the tomb.

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,310
It's impenetrable.

76
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,460
A little stunt like yours could never compare.

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,220
Based on what I heard,

78
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,160
you're not a talkative and aggressive person.

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,350
Maybe it's because I've been hanging out too long with someone who likes to be sarcastic.

80
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,430
I've picked up some bad habits.

81
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,070
I used to be a humble and polite, hot-blooded young man!

82
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,420
You're stalling for time.

83
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,280
You saw through all that?

84
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,640
No, wait. I'm going to fight against a dozen of you alone.

85
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,380
What's wrong with me stalling for a little time?

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,030
It's useless.

87
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,340
Besides Wushuang City, there are too many people who want to kill him.

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,760
Stalling us only gives others the opportunity to kill him.

89
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,400
At least, we only want to capture him.

90
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,400
The number of those who want to kill him is as great as those who want to save him.

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,790
As for what you said about capturing him,

92
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:32,490
do you know what he would say to you if he heard you say that?

93
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,530
What would he say?

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,220
Kiss my ass!

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,060
Attack!

96
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,900

97
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,640
Report!

98
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,380
What's going on?

99
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,890
General, there's someone blocking our way ahead.

100
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,810
Someone is blocking our way?

101
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,260
Who dares to block our way?

102
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,630
This road is closed.

103
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,850
Who are you?

104
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,350
How dare you stand in the way of the Luo City Army!

105
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,990
One of Tianqi's Four Guardians, the Vermilion Bird, the guardian of the South.

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,570
You must be the descendant of that predecessor.

107
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,900
For the sake of his friendship with His Majesty, please move out of the way, Miss.

108
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,660
Do you know what this line means?

109
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,490
Whoever crosses this line will die!

110
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,160
General!

111
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,220
Kill her!

112
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,780
- Yes, Sir! 
  - Kill!

113
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,320
 Kill!

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,430
I shall clear the path for you with my spear

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,190
and help you ascend to the throne of Tianqi!

116
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,225

117
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,300

118
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,750

119
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,500
Culminating the energy of a sword with a city.

120
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,320
The Lone Sword Deity's melancholy sword thought truly lives up to its reputation.

121
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,750
Last year at this time, in this place,

122
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,590
her face blushed like the peach blossoms.

123
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,180
Who knows where that beautiful face has gone,

124
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,840
the peach blossoms still bloom in the gentle breeze.

125
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,410
What brings you here, Spear Deity?

126
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,310
I was wondering why Ji Ruofeng reopened the martial arts list.

127
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,690
It turns out that the Bai Xiao Sect has a new successor.

128
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,580
Where is your father?

129
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,320
He has not yet recovered from his serious injury, so I have to do it for him.

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,130
Why did you reopen the list?

131
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,240
I want to put an end to the past martial arts era

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,030
and mark a start for the new age.

133
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,490
Interesting.

134
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,620
Spear Deity, you made it to third place on the Top-Rank List this time,

135
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,990
but you're still a little behind Luo Qingyang.

136
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,640
Spear Deity, are you confident that you can stop him?

137
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,880
My senior brother also made it to second place,

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,010
but when we were in Xueyue City, I beat him up every day.

139
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,660
He's the Principal City Lord, yet all he does is drink and make liquor every day.

140
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,430
Whenever I see someone like him, I'll beat them up every time.

141
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,670
This... is my tribute to the City Lord of Qiliang City. 
  (TN: Qilian means desolate, melancholy)

142
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,890
Qiliang City?

143
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,420
When Beili was founded, this city was once prosperous,

144
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,650
but due to climate change, the inhabitants moved south.

145
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,460
It ended up as ruins.

146
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,760
People called it Qiliang City.

147
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,740
Later, the Sword Deity lived here alone, and so people called it Muliang City out of respect.

148
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,460
He guards this city all on his own. This kind of spirit is truly admirable.

149
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,430
He's here.

150
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,990
Let's go.

151
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,390
He has no intention of leaving the city.

152
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
How do you know?

153
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,510
The sword intent on his scabbard has already told me.

154
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,630
This is really a duel between masters of the top ranking.

155
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,130
It really is hard to understand.

156
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,300
But I haven't delivered my gift yet.

157
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,930
You can follow his example.

158
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,110
Throw the liquor to him.

159
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,710
I'll give it a try.

160
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,360
Now that the gift has been delivered, I'll be going.

161
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,260
So this is Ji Ruofeng's daughter, the new successor of Bai Xiao Sect.

162
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,840
And the new White Tiger.

163
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,950
Sir, your tea.

164
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,310
Does it rain a lot here?

165
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,220
Yes. It rains here often, especially in this season.

166
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,530
Sometimes, it rains for two weeks.

167
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,980
Did you come from far away, Sir?

168
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,270
Yes.

169
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,990
I have two homes, both in faraway places.

170
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,150
What brings you here, then?

171
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,380
I want to kill someone.

172
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,180
Sir, you sure know how to joke.

173
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,790
Waiter, do you have liquor here?

174
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,870
Yes, but it's not the shop's.

175
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,460
It's liquor I keep for myself to drink.

176
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,830
Can I buy it from you?

177
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,380
I'll pay you three times the original price.

178
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,480
It's just common liquor. That's very generous.

179
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,150
Please wait a moment.

180
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,190
Sir, here's your liquor.

181
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,630
What is the name of this liquor?

182
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,900
This jug of liquor is only ten copper coins. How could it have a name?

183
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,210
It's just homemade plain liquor.

184
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,540
Plain liquor?

185
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,710
I've always heard them talk about it.

186
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,100
I wonder if the liquor here is the same as that in Snowfall Mountain Villa.

187
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,510
Snowfall Mountain Villa?

188
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,540
What place is that?

189
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,190
I don't know, either.

190
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,050
One of them says it was an elegant manor with snow falling in front of it and flowers flying at the back,

191
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,420
and the other says it was a shabby inn,

192
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,150
only just a little bigger than your tea shop.

193
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,760
Plus it was drafty all over and the roof leaked.

194
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,140
Waiter, I've reserved this tea shop for now.

195
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,930
Come back in four hours.

196
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,640
Sir, what do you mean by this?

197
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,870
Did you forget what I just said?

198
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,630
I'm here... to kill someone.

199
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,990
Leave now before it's too late.

200
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,230
Tang Lian?

201
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,070
Do you know what the real Heart Sword is?

202
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,030
The real power of it is to be able to command ten thousand swords.

203
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,770
All of your swords are afraid of me.

204
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,360
So, of course you're no match for me.

205
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,230
All right.

206
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,440
I've shown all my cards already.

207
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,020
Isn't it time for you to show your cards too?

208
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,660
I've been looking forward to your Wushuang Sword Box.

209
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,300
Master.

210
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,360
Half-step Carefree Phase.

211
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,890
Half-step Sword Deity?

212
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,390
What are you doing here?

213
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,850
Have you no shame?

214
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,160
You brat, mind your mouth!

215
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,180
Maybe you shouldn't be called Wushuang City anymore.

216
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,420
You should change it to Shameless City instead!

217
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,700
In the beginning, it was a dozen of you against one of me.

218
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,280
I was outnumbered!

219
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,310
I can let that slide.

220
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,980
But even your former city lord is here now?

221
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,480
You're bullying a child. Do you have no shame?

222
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,520
City Lord Song, you're a few years older than my master.

223
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,320
And you... want to draw your sword on me?

224
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,870
The way of swordsmanship is practiced inside the sword hut,

225
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,130
only outside can life and death be found.

226
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,110
I've stayed in my hut for too long.

227
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,590
I haven't made any improvements.

228
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,660
That's why I left my city and came here today.

229
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,250
Are you saying... that you want to forge your path with my blood?

230
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,460
My surname is Lei, Lei of the Lei Fortress.

231
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,140
You know us Leis are powerful.

232
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,960
We don't get intimidated easily.

233
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,960
I heard that... when you were young,

234
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,470
you struck your sword toward the sky.

235
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,040
A sword strike so beautiful that even the migrating swallows turned back

236
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,950
and flew around the residual sword energy, circling above it.

237
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,620
That's why you're called Song Yanhui. 
  (T/N: means the return of the swallows)

238
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,160
But after what I saw today, I really am disappointed!

239
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,500
You!

240
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,520
When a swordsman forgets the reason for drawing his sword,

241
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,720
he loses the heart of the sword.

242
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,900
How can a person who has lost the heart of a sword become a sword deity?

243
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,070
City Lord Song, do you remember your reason for drawing your sword?

244
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,230
The reason for drawing my sword?

245
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,520
Back then, you swung your sword at me.

246
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,830
You made me realize that the reason I draw my sword is to protect.

247
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,800
Today, I shall return that sword strike.

248
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
If you want to become a sword deity,

249
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,870
you may have to start learning from drawing the sword.

250
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,770
Just one strike to determine victory.

251
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,530
You're too arrogant.

252
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,870
I'm still young!

253
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,670
I can afford to be arrogant.

254
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,440
Master!

255
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,570
When one practices sword techniques only for the sake of practicing,

256
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,680
he loses the soul of the sword.

257
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,740
 Your disciple, Song Yanhui, is leaving the city today.

258
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,820
 Why must you leave the city?

259
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,330
 To practice sword techniques.

260
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,520
 You can't practice sword techniques in Wushuang City?

261
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,450
 Why do you have to go outside the city?

262
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,720
 Because there is injustice outside the city.

263
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,100
 I will draw my sword for injustice,

264
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,030
 draw it for all the people of the world,

265
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,560
 and draw it for all the people who are suffering.

266
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,130
You're right.

267
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,440
All these years...

268
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,930
I've only drawn my sword because I wanted to beat Xueyue City.

269
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,840
I had forgotten about everything else.

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,470
Master, should we go after him?

271
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,350
No.

272
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,240
We can't catch up with him anymore.

273
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,488

274
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,450

275
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,810
How many do you want to kill?

276
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,070
300? 500?

277
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,490
Or 1,000?

278
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,240
I don't want to kill anyone,

279
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,140
but if you still won't withdraw your troops,

280
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,270
then I will kill as many as come.

281
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,600
You truly are quite strong,

282
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,500
but you've underestimated the strength of the Luo City Army!

283
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,190
Today, the Luo City Army shall fight you to the end here!

284
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,430
It's the Ye Battalion!

285
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,230
 Attack!

286
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,130
 Kill!

287
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,440
Oh, no. They're going to break our formation!

288
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,160
Defense formation!

289
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,650
Attack!

290
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,170
Will many more die in the future?

291
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,420
Yes.

292
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,070
This is what war is.

293
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,300
The faster and quicker you win, the fewer people will die.

294
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,310
It's not about killing the enemy,

295
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,630
the most important thing is to win the war!

296
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,690
All right. Let's win it quickly, then!

297
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,890
You really like Chuhe, don't you?

298
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,610
His name is Xiao Se.

299
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,980
You again.

300
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,470
I thought there would be a large troop here to stop me,

301
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,550
but I didn't think it would just be you.

302
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,430
I heard in the past few years,

303
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,950
although you couldn't use your inner force anymore,

304
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,430
you never stopped practicing staff skills.

305
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,800
I've been waiting for this day.

306
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,780
This day?

307
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,130
The day I get to fight you again.

308
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,590
You don't need to bluff with me.

309
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,880
Your meridians have only just been reshaped.

310
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,040
Your power is at the Carefree Phase at most.

311
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,190
How are you going to fight me?

312
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,440
There will be no one to save you today.

313
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,130
I don't need others to save me.

314
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,500
You think you can do this when you're just only in the Hard Phase?

315
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,110
Not bad.

316
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,340
All these years of honing your skills,

317
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,410
you're indeed much stronger than back then.

318
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,650
You're good enough to fight with me.

319
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,850
You may wonder why you hadn't encountered any obstacles this whole way.

320
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,430
That's because someone stopped them for you,

321
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,930
but they couldn't stop me!

322
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,820
It's just a pity... I don't want to kill you yet,

323
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,250
because my disciple wants to have a fair duel with you.

324
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,140
I look forward to the day when you become a true master.

325
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,510
When that day comes,

326
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,260
I will come back to kill you!

327
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,800
As the eldest senior disciple of Xueyue City,

328
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,400
you live up to your reputation.

329
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,760
Black Tortoise of Tianqi's Four Guardians, the guardian of the North,

330
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,400
that's the identity I came here with.

331
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,440
I hear that despite your young age,

332
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,030
you've already mastered the best hidden weapon technique of the Tang Clan,

333
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,050
Fatal Flying Blossoms.

334
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,420
It would be an honor if I could see it today.

335
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,940
Although I'm from the Tang family,

336
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,470
I'm here for the Xiao family today.

337
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,600
I didn't bring any hidden weapons.

338
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
All I have...

339
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,530
are my fists

340
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,530
and these seven cups of liquor.

341
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,380
Dubhe, Merak, Phecda,

342
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,400
Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid. 
  (T/N: The seven stars that make up the big dipper)

343
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,300
The Seven Starry Nights Wine?

344
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,230
Carefree Phase!

345
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,900
This is good liquor.

346
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,950
This is the real Hanging Heaven and Distant Seas.

347
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,920
It was just child's play earlier.

348
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,880
I traveled around the world when I was younger.

349
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,870
I've seen the spectacles of the world.

350
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,450
I've sung all the mortal songs of the world

351
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,330
and met that man who had no regrets.

352
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,500
I also had a dream of ten years

353
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,110
and saw blood and bones in the Martial Arts World.

354
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,850
Heroes drew their swords and shouted!

355
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,580
All right.

356
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,675

357
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,900
Chuhe.

358
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,240
Imperial Uncle.

359
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,620
You're back.

360
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,770
I haven't seen the city yet.

361
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,390
Make way for him!

362
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,880
He's still the same as back then,

363
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,080
like an untamed wild horse.

364
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,350
Only now the pony has grown up.

365
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,900
I don't think anyone can control him anymore.

366
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,240
Your Highness, a group is approaching.

367
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,910
How many are there?

368
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,830
Sounds like a few hundred people.

369
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,900
Why would so many people be here?

370
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,310
- How much further? 
 - Less than a li.

371
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,210
Have all troops be on alert. Prepare to face the enemy!

372
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,750
Stay alert!

373
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,950
Your Highness.

374
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,750
Like father, like daughter indeed, Miss Ye.

375
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,690
I've always heard that your body was weak

376
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,220
that you can't even stand for long.

377
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,660
I didn't expect to see you to be as imposing as your father when riding a horse.

378
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,180
You flatter me, Your Highness.

379
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,870
I left Tianqi without permission this time, please forgive me.

380
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,860
It's all right.

381
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,370
You and Chuhe are close friends who grew up together.

382
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,690
I trust you.

383
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,130
Then are you implying that you don't trust my father?

384
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,440
Your Ye Battalion is called the Tiger and Wolf Battalion,

385
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,930
and your father is the head of the Tiger and Wolf.

386
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,550
It's a pity that we can work together to conquer the world,

387
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,360
but we can't completely trust each other.

388
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,940
I think we're here for the same person.

389
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,070
Your father and I made a deal to see who could get him after a year.

390
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,560
Your Highness is still thinking about that?

391
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,580
Looks like this girl from Xueyue City has been through a great battle.

392
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,240
What happened? Did you run into an enemy?

393
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
The insignificant Luo City Army can't really be considered an enemy.

394
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,520
You're quite arrogant.

395
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,440
You all have fended off a group of enemies for him.

396
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,310
On our way here from Tianqi, we haven't really done anything.

397
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,030
We're in no position to compete over him with you.

398
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,750
I suppose you understand this, right, Miss Ye?

399
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,830
Yes, I understand.

400
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,470
None of us can get him, because he won't listen to us.

401
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,560
But we can support him,

402
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,840
just like what we are doing now.

403
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
We're chasing after him.

404
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,190
Come on. Let's go back to Tianqi.

405
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,270
Young Lady, should we go after them?

406
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,900
- We'll follow them until the gate of Tianqi City, then, you all can turn back. 
 - Yes, Young Lady.

407
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,170
Sister Ye, we can't trust Marquis Lanyue?

408
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,640
Qianluo, you can't easily trust people from Tianqi City.

409
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,250
Especially those from the imperial family. Not a single one can be trusted.

410
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,030
Miss Ruoyi, are you going to Tianqi?

411
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,080
Of course.

412
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,260
What a coincidence!

413
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,130
I'm going to Tianqi too. How about we travel together?

414
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,470
Well, well, Lei Wujie, didn't you see me here?

415
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,940
You only remember to say hello to your Sister Ye.

416
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,260
Senior Sister Qianluo, I only just escaped from Wushuang City's men.

417
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,910
Please cut me some slack.

418
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,170
Wushuang City?

419
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,790
Prince Bai made a move too?

420
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,380
Yes he did, but they probably only wanted to stop him.

421
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,140
They had no intention of killing him.

422
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,610
Everyone has arrived.

423
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,730
Tang Lian should've departed too.

424
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,840
I wonder where he is.

425
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,180
He's the last one you need to worry about.

426
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,680
With him around, every problem can be solved.

427
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,620
We just need to wait for him in Tianqi.

428
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,290
Sister Qianluo has a very good point.

429
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,250
Everyone knows how reliable the eldest senior disciple of Xueyue City is.

430
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,970
We'll see him in Tianqi City.

431
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,630
You have two cups of liquor left.

432
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,350
But there's only one of you left.

433
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,960
I can tell that you have no strength left.

434
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,080
You have one last cup left, but I don't think you'll drink it.

435
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,470
Won't I?

436
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,840
This is the first time I've seen such incredible liquor,

437
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,260
but I know if you drink another cup, you'll die.

438
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,260
But if I don't drink, how can I continue living?

439
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,390
You can go your own way, and I'll go mine.

440
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,680
Some of you are dead, and some are maimed.

441
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,060
They are incompetent.

442
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,060
As assassins, they failed to kill and were killed by others instead.

443
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,800
They have nothing to complain about.

444
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,740
You people from Dark River can be really coldhearted.

445
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,790
But what makes you think...

446
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,410
you can negotiate terms with Xueyue City?

447
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:08,227
♫   Don't fear, the roaring of the tiger or thousands of thunder claps  ♫

448

450

451
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,000
Fatal Flying Blossoms!

♫   Riding the winds, singing songs  ♫

466
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,970
 Xiao Lian, your mother and I are going away today.

467
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,940
 Take good care of yourself in the Tang Clan.

468
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,790
 Father, where are you two going?

469
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,440
 A place far away, but we'll be back in a year.

470
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,200
 I understand.

471
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:24,660
 Father, Mother, why aren't you back yet?

472
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,530
 I can't hang in there anymore.

473
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,770
 Is your name Tang Lian?

474
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,820
 Yes, my name is Tang Lian.

475
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,640
 Every year on this day, you're here waiting for someone.

476
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,420
 It's been three years already.

477
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,330
 My parents said they would be back in a year.

478
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,220
 Your parents... aren't coming back.

479
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,570
 You'll live with me from now on.

480
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:10,040
 I'm Tang Lianyue, and I'm your master from now on.

481
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,780
 Father, Mother...

482
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,280
 were you also like me back then,

483
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,180
 lying there dying somewhere no one knew about?

484
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,590
 Would you like a cup of liquor to warm you up?

485
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,750
 Lying here in the rain, you must be freezing.

486
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,970
 Want a drink?

487
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,260
 Why don't you want to drink it?

488
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,940
 If you came to humiliate me, I'd advise you to give up.

489
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,430
 You're just like Tang Lianyue described, a rock.

490
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,300
 You'll have one more master from now on.

491
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,570
 I'm Baili Dongjun.

492
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,810
 You're Baili Dongjun?

493
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,640
 Yes.

494
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,080
 I'm Baili Dongjun, who is even stronger than Tang Lianyue.

495
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,180
 Lian... once you leave,

496
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,940
 how long will it be before we see each other again?

497
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,050
 I...

498
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,290
 We only see each other when there's an assignment.

499
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,610
 When there isn't, it's as if I don't exist!

500
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,710
 Is it that in your heart, I don't matter at all?

501
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,390
 That's not it.

502
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,230
 It's just that I...

503
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,410
 In front of others, you are the senior brother who carries a lot of responsibilities.

504
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,760
 Why is it that you stutter whenever you speak to me?

505
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
 Are you afraid that I'll swallow you?

506
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:46,430
 Master Lianyue told me to wait for someone in Xueyue City.

507
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,300
 And that I'll protect this person when they try to finish a very important mission.

508
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,430
 It's just that this mission will be very dangerous.

509
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,050
 I'm afraid...

510
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,220
 - I'm afraid that I would drag you into it. 
 - But I'm not afraid of that!

511
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,930
 Rui... I will definitely come back to you.

512
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:19,940
 By then, I won't be here as Xueyue City's eldest senior disciple or a Tang Clan disciple.

513
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,040
 I will only come to you as Tang Lian.

514
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,610
 When?

515
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,570
 When I complete the mission assigned by my master.

516
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,220
I really wish I could drink... Master's liquor again.

517
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:10,020

518
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,825
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

519
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:21,255
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

520
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:24,325
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

521
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:28,955
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

♫  Waiting for the ride to the highest heaven  ♫

526

♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

527
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:51,975
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

528
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:54,975
♫  I face the sun  ♫

529

♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫
