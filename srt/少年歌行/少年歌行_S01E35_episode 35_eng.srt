2
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,900
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,380
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,580
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,580
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,820
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,900
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,980
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,000
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,820
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,300
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,460
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,460
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,400
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,620
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,800
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,880
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,025

23
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,945

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,000
But now, half the people in Tianqi City are all watching us.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,940
We have more enemies than before now.

26
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,620
It's not just us who are interested in this list of names.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm sure there are many people watching Xiao Yu as well.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,380
Our enemies are naturally their enemies.

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,940
Your Highness, we've been drinking tea for an hour now.

30
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,540
Are you asking me to leave, Eunuch Jade Deity?

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,480
I wouldn't dare.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,790
I just think that you have more important things to do.

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,840
The investigation should be your priority.

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,000
What if the person I'm looking for is right here?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,030
A felon is hiding in the imperial palace?

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,470
Your Highness' joke is a little bold, isn't it?

37
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,560
But often, the most dangerous place is also the safest one.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
If you don't believe me, you may search the place.

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,870
No need.

40
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,190
If you see him, please tell him that if he wants to live,

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm his best choice.

42
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,140
I'll see you off, Your Highness.

43
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,775

44
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,260
You all are... the legendary ones from Bai Xiao Sect, in charge of the secrets of the world,

45
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,460
Six Iron Masks?

46
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,590
What an honor.

47
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,160
To meet such mysterious figures today.

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,070
Stop being so talkative.

49
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,220
You've met the Sect Master already.

50
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,720
The Iron Masks are nothing to concern yourself with.

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
The joint petition from the officials you hold is the most important piece of intelligence in the world.

52
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,230
Name your price.

53
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,080
You want the seller to make an offer?

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,100
That's too cunning.

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,560
I want to know what you're offering.

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,630
The Bai Xiao Sect always offers fair prices and always gives the best value for money.

57
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm asking for help for my junior brother.

58
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,350
It's simple.

59
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,320
I want to protect his life.

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,570
Can you offer that?

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,580
Prince Bai has received an order from Emperor Mingde

62
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,370
to personally lead the Court of Justice in investigating this case.

63
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,690
Early this morning, they went to Hongqing Hall.

64
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,640
Director Jin Xuan went as well.

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,660
Thirty-seven officials of all statuses in Tianqi City have sent their assassins to find Jin Yan.

66
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,080
Given the current situation, if he wants to leave the city right now,

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,520
even if Bai Xiao Sect mobilizes all forces, we only have 70 percent confidence to keep him alive.

68
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,750
Seventy percent? It's not enough.

69
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,550
Seventy percent is the most we can offer.

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,880
If Bai Xiao Sect can offer 70 percent and another party can offer 90 percent,

71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,250
can I choose them instead?

72
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,280
Are you saying that you want to convene Bai Xiao Sect's Three-Party Meeting?

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,890
Yes.

74
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,960
Find two more parties, plus Bai Xiao Sect,

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,220
and we'll all lay our cards on the table and discuss it.

76
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,970
Three-Party Meeting, the one who comes doesn't ask, and the one who goes doesn't care.

77
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,730
We agree.

78
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,280
But other than the list, Jin Yan needs to tell us all the information he has without asking for more.

79
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,550
What if I... won't?

80
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,170
The door is right there. You can walk out right now.

81
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,710
Bai Xiao Sect won't do anything to stop you,

82
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,450
but in an hour's time, you'll be the prey for all of Tianqi City.

83
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,660
Eunuch Jade Deity is a wise man.

84
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,030
Jin Yan, say the names of the people you want to see.

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,470
Prince Bai, Xiao Chong, and Prince Chi, Xiao Yu.

86
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,750
Interesting.

87
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,150
Why not Prince Yong'an?

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,460
I don't think Prince Yong'an has any reason to help me.

89
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,580
If he sees me now, he'll probably kill me right away.

90
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,350

91
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,090
Your Highness, what's written on it?

92
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,020
Bai Xiao Sect has invited me to a Three-Party Meeting.

93
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,710
Participants of the Three-Party Meeting can't reveal any part of the negotiations,

94
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,490
nor can they reveal the other participants.

95
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,280
If the rules are broken, Bai Xiao Sect will make things difficult for those who break the rules.

96
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,060
To be targeted by the Bai Xiao Sect means a lot of trouble.

97
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,230
But I'm very interested in this Three-Party Meeting.

98
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,830
Why?

99
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,230
I'll be able to get the list without any cost.

100
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,730
This is the best outcome.

101
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,220
Besides, I've already figured out the identity of the other participant.

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,430
I don't think Eunuch Jade Deity would choose him.

103
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,280

104
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,110
Using an imperial felon to do business.

105
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,700
Bai Xiao Sect has a lot of guts.

106
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,800
Since it's a Three-Party Meeting, they would invite three people then.

107
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,260
I'm guessing that besides me,

108
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,620
the other two are Xiao Chong and Xiao Chuhe.

109
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,270

110
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,560
We're not invited?

111
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,860
No, you're not. Jin Yan said you would never spare him.

112
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,150
Jin Yan isn't all that great.

113
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,610
Looking at that confident look on your face,

114
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,630
what bad idea is it now?

115
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,830
Ruoyi, come with me somewhere early tomorrow morning.

116
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,220
All right.

117
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,980
These people really are funny.

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,530
When they want to do something big, they choose to do it in this gambling house.

119
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,180
Qianjin Gambling House is well located.

120
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,170
It is surrounded by streets, even small ones.

121
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,980
The streets are narrow and crowded.

122
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,620
If they try to mobilize soldiers to conduct a siege, it'll inevitably cause chaos.

123
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,490
No one would want to do that.

124
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,450
That's why Bai Xiao Sect chose this place.

125
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,130
A felon is being offered for sale in the gambling house,

126
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,660
while everyone out there is trying to catch him.

127
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,170
Bai Xiao Sect only cares about the progress of the Three-Party Meeting.

128
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,080
He'll choose whomever

129
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,680
has prepared a perfect plan to save his life.

130
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,120
That person's perfect preparation must have one thing, that is, he can leave Qianjin Gambling House safely.

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,610
Second Brother, you're here.

132
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,070
I guessed right.

133
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,300
You're here too.

134
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,480
You look so calm.

135
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,320
You must have confidence that you can beat me.

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,460
Prince Chi, please.

137
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,980
Second Brother,

138
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll go first then.

139
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,400
I had already guessed that you were behind this,

140
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,520
but I didn't expect that you would be here in person, Eunuch Jade Deity.

141
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,830
Even though it's Bai Xiao Sect's Three-Party Meeting

142
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,580
and everyone's attendance will be kept confidential,

143
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,410
you've still got a lot of nerve.

144
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,030
I never intended to hide my identity.

145
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,400
After this, if Jin Yan is safe,

146
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,020
I'll naturally ask His Majesty to punish me.

147
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,580
I'll resign from all official positions and go to guard the mausoleum.

148
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,110
Even if His Majesty wants to execute me, I won't say a word of complaint.

149
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,360
You really are a loyal eunuch.

150
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,710
There's no need for small talk.

151
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,230
My junior brother just wants to stay alive.

152
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,030
He'll trade the list he possesses for protection of his life.

153
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you protect him, Your Highness?

154
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,200
He only wants to stay alive?

155
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,820
You don't want to go to the mausoleum and guard it until you're old.

156
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,730
You can't let go of the power you have today.

157
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,130
If you become a commoner,

158
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,630
you could still be powerful in the Marital Arts World.

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,380
Those powerful people will still kneel at your feet to flatter you.

160
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,690
You're the Bearer of the Seal.

161
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,090
You could have more.

162
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,280
Why do you just want to stay alive?

163
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,910
It's not enough.

164
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,310
I can give you more.

165
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,320
As long as you give me the list,

166
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,460
I'll keep you alive for a year.

167
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Then... what happens after a year?

168
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,220
You'll get all your power back.

169
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

170
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,100
Please wait outside.

171
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,160
How sure are you of making this happen, Your Highness?

172
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,280
Ninety percent.

173
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,700
What about the other ten percent?

174
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,110
Eunuchs, you both made the wrong choice.

175
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,880
There are no absolutes in the world.

176
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,260
Jin Yan, you've told so many lies.

177
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,810
How can you not tell when people are lying to you?

178
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,430
Miss Ji, please ask Prince Bai to come in.

179
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,580
Farewell.

180
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,510
Prince Bai,

181
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,320
my junior brother committed a crime and deserves to be executed,

182
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,970
but I'm a little selfish.

183
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,590
I want to help him stay alive.

184
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,410
I can grant that.

185
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,400
Do you have any other questions?

186
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,860
I'd like to know how you will keep him alive.

187
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,510
First, he needs to hand over the list.

188
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,940
Then, we'll take away all his martial arts skills, and he'll be thrown into the Heavenly Prison.

189
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,350
I promise you that he won't be abused in prison.

190
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,280
He'll be served two meals a day and won't need to do any work.

191
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,930
However, he can't leave his cell.

192
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,580
He won't have cellmates.

193
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,120
The guards won't talk to him either.

194
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,000
Although his life will be a bit boring, there is also something to look forward to.

195
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,060
If there is a new emperor's wedding or a natural disaster, an amnesty will be announced.

196
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,760
Since he's a traitor, he isn't within the scope of the amnesty,

197
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,430
but he turned himself in.

198
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,240
Besides, he offered to hand in the list to help me investigate the case.

199
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,280
I will convince my father.

200
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:22,220
This... is how you'll keep me alive?

201
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,810
As long as it is stated in their written judgment,

202
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,040
the prisoners in the Heavenly Prison will remain alive.

203
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,860
How sure are you of making this happen?

204
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,550
Nearly 100 percent.

205
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,150
Why nearly?

206
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,140
You should know that there is no absolute in the world.

207
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,000
If someone tells you he's 100 percent sure, he must be lying then.

208
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,000
If you believe him, you'll all die.

209
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,370
I see.

210
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

211
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,660
I have one last thing to say to you, Eunuch Jade Deity.

212
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,040
If you choose someone else, then I'm 100 percent sure that I will kill Jin Yan.

213
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,630
I'm leading the Court of Justice in investigating the case.

214
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,170
The Court of Justice never lets any prisoner get away.

215
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,170
Even if they flee to the corners of the earth, we'll hunt them down to the end.

216
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,130
I have no doubt that someone has the ability to take Jin Yan away from Tianqi.

217
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:52,300
However, for the rest of his life, Jin Yan will be hunted by the Court of Justice.

218
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,660
Second Brother, you're done.

219
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,120
How did it go?

220
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,450
You seem to have a lot of confidence.

221
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,190
Since it's a case you're investigating, you have more leverage than me.

222
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,480
However, I've known Jin Yan longer.

223
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,410
I know him better than you do.

224
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,450
Choose Prince Bai.

225
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,590
I... I don't want to go to the Heavenly Prison.

226
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,480
You'll only lose your martial arts skills and a few years of freedom.

227
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,110
When you come out of the Heavenly Prison, you can still live freely.

228
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,610
They won't try to kill you again.

229
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,300
And I can keep you safe.

230
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,160
But...

231
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,930
 Why do you just want to stay alive?

232
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,480
 You could have more.

233
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,630
 You're the Bearer of the Seal.

234
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,080
 Staying alive isn't enough.

235
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,820
No buts.

236
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,320
You absolutely can't choose Prince Chi, Xiao Yu.

237
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,540
The reason you ended up like this today is that you're too greedy and too obsessed.

238
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,630
You can't make the same mistake again.

239
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,920
I know. I know, but...

240
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,310
But...

241
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't want to go to the Heavenly Prison.

242
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,770
Heavenly Prison.

243
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,040
This is the only ending you can offer him.

244
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,510
He knows that place better than most people.

245
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,560
It's bright and clear out.

246
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,450
You two seem free and comfortable.

247
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,440
What are you doing in a gambling house when you're supposed to be working?

248
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,720
Xiao Chuhe, what are you doing here?

249
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,560
Since I came to the gambling house, I'm going to join the game, of course.

250
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,300
One of you threatened him, the other tempted him,

251
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,110
while I'm different.

252
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,140
How are you different?

253
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,860
I'm going to flip the table first.

254
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,230
Calm down, Eunuch Jade Deity.

255
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,020
It's me.

256
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,620
I don't think we had Prince Yong'an's name on our list.

257
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,040
But your list includes Bai Xiao Sect.

258
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,060
And Bai Xiao Sect can be represented by Prince Yong'an.

259
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,860
That's right.

260
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,590
A felon like you is meeting with a prince and the acting minister of the Court of Justice.

261
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,830
You sure are bold.

262
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,940
But I get it.

263
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,990
You have got nothing to lose now.

264
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,900
Only a few people can help you.

265
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,680
There is only one thing you want now, and that is, to live, right?

266
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,520
Your Highness, what do you propose?

267
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,030
You don't have to go to the Heavenly Prison.

268
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,220
And you won't be hunted by the Court of Justice anymore.

269
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,750
You can live your life happily.

270
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,560
Can you make that happen, Your Highness?

271
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,090
Of course not.

272
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,400
Why don't you just cut to the chase, Your Highness?

273
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,620
You're very smart indeed, Eunuch Jade Deity.

274
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,110
I can't make that happen, but that can.

275
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,240
What is this?

276
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,950
This is the edict that exonerates you.

277
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,630
Take a good look at it.

278
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400

279
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,270
Looks like... His Majesty sent you here.

280
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,570
Jin Yan is the Bearer of the Seal.

281
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,880
You should know the seal on it best, right?

282
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,880

283
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,900
I want you to see His Majesty with me.

284
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,000
Bring your most precious thing that everyone outside wants.

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,750
Looks like they were all wrong.

286
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,000
There really is someone in this world who can give Jin Yan 100 percent of hope,

287
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,790
and he's not lying.

288
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,510
They just didn't expect him to come forward.

289
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,440
Eunuch Jade Deity, are you making a decision?

290
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,630
That's good too.

291
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,060
I love scenes like this the most.

292
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:55,190
Once in the game, I'll make sure to leave the other players with no choice.

293
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,790
We choose you.

294
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,400
As expected of you, Eunuch Jade Deity, you've never disappointed me.

295
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,480
Then let's depart right now.

296
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,060
Can you get us into the palace safely, Your Highness?

297
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,870
Behind me, I have a talented young swordsman

298
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,890
and a future female spear deity.

299
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,120
Tiger Soldiers are waiting by the door.

300
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,320
Plus Bai Xiao Sect's guards.

301
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,240
Is this not enough?

302
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

303
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,640
Don't mention it.

304
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,220
Everyone, I've won, admit that you've lost.

305
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,790
Concede.

306
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,560
Everyone, Jin Yan has chosen Prince Yong'an.

307
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,370
As promised before, please leave Qianjin Gambling House for now.

308
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,730
Don't come near here again for a day.

309
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,410
- Xiao Chuhe! 
 - Hey.

310
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,900
Don't yell out my name.

311
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,260
What did you offer them?

312
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,440
Would you believe me if I said I had given him the edict of exoneration?

313
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,750
I have to admit... that you always think one step ahead of me.

314
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,770
You're better than I am on this.

315
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,720
 I've assigned the case to Second Brother already.

316
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,410
 You assigned the case to Second Brother

317
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,250
 because you need to do this to appease the Imperial Court and commoners.

318
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,470
 But what if Second Brother really finds him and presents the list?

319
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,800
 How will you deal with it then?

320
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,640
 Are you going to read out the names in front of the officials and punish them?

321
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,850
 What do you need?

322
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,420
 I need a secret edict.

323
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,200
 A secret edict that can exempt Jin Yan from execution.

324
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,300
Xiao Se, why didn't His Majesty just give the exoneration edict to Prince Bai?

325
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,720
Prince Bai is the acting minister of the Court of Justice right now.

326
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,010
His every move is being watched.

327
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,950
If imperial father had given it to him directly, it would've been like revealing his selfish concern.

328
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,850
And an emperor's selfish concern must not be known by others.

329
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,920
I get it now.

330
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,310
To avoid criticism,

331
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,850
His Majesty has to assign someone to investigate the matter openly,

332
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,750
but he also wants to get the petition in secret first.

333
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,460
So, you went to him and asked for that secret edict.

334
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,700
I'm the only one in the world who dares to speculate the emperor's mind.

335
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,370
And I'm the only one who dares to say it to him.

336
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,740
Like father, like son, you're both cunning foxes.

337
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,870
So have we achieved our goal?

338
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,160
One more step to go.

339
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,500
I believe that person is about to lose his patience and make a move.

340
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,330
This time, I'll make sure Xiao Yu lose one of his right-hand men.

341
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,180
Eunuchs, you're still as cautious as ever.

342
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,070
I've offered so much help, yet you still want to travel at night.

343
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,200
You misunderstood me, Your Highness.

344
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,210
I'm just used to traveling at night.

345
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,020
Are you coming with us too, Eunuch Jade Deity?

346
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,290
I don't have much talent.

347
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,740
I just want to give you one more helping hand.

348
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,950
Thank you for your help then.

349
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,750
Songyu Street is right up front.

350
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:48,990
I can feel that the aura here can be described with these words,

351
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,820
demons and spirits.

352
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,750
Eunuch Jade Deity described it appropriately.

353
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,890
Why do you two make it sound so scary?

354
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,760
Is it scary?

355
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,990
You've killed a lot of people in your life.

356
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,740
Do you know how much fear these people felt before they died?

357
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,770
At this point, stop lecturing me!

358
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,720
I know I've committed great sins.

359
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,490
I'm sinful, but I still want to live.

360
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,060
Someone has dispersed knockout gas.

361
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,940
- Who are you? 
 - Someone who wants you dead.

362
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,280
I recognize you.

363
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,300
You're Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu's guard.

364
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,360
Is the Grand Preceptor on the list too?

365
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,220
Damn it.

366
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,460
I will leave the rest to you, Lord Yong'an.

367
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,200
Be careful.

368
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,550
Bearer of Seal, are you honored to be escorted into the city by me?

369
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,140
Your Highness, thank you for your hard work.

370
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:19,050
Your martial arts skills have improved a lot compared to the past, Your Highness.

371
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,510
If you hadn't destroyed my hidden meridians back then,

372
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,710
I wouldn't have improved so much.

373
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,840
Sounds like you owe me a thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,630
To repay the favor, I'll destroy your hidden meridian today, then.

375
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,490
Jin Xuan!

376
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,190
Go now.

377
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,730
The Art of Detachment?

378
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,870
You killed Jin Yu?

379
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,480
- So what if I did? 
 - You!

380
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,590
An edict from His Majesty!

381
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,250
Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe, is summoned to the palace.

382
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,430
Greetings, Imperial Father.

383
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,060
Your Majesty.

384
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,990
I deserve to die.

385
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,500
Jin Yan, you didn't want to guard the mausoleum,

386
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,600
so you led the Langya Army into the capital.

387
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,980
That was already a capital offense.

388
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:00,370
But you also tried to use a treasonous list in your hands

389
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,530
to make my sons fight against each other.

390
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,790
How should I punish you for this crime?

391
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,250
Death by...

392
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,970
a thousand cuts.

393
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes,  death by a thousand cuts.

394
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,560
But since Chuhe has already told you that I won't kill you,

395
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,230
I'll keep my word.

396
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:33,680
And I won't send you to the Court of Justice.

397
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:42,290
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty. I am grateful for your mercy, Your Majesty!

398
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,700
Hand over the petition.

399
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,950
You must really want to know the names on this.

400
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,950
I don't want to.

401
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,430
If it was in my hands, of course I would want to know.

402
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,600
But it's in your hands now, Imperial Father.

403
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,830
This secret should only be known by one person.

404
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,640
If you want to read the names, then go on.

405
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,350
I can guess whose names are on this without looking.

406
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,440
The first name must be... Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu.

407
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,390
Imperial Father!

408
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,810
Actually,

409
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,780
most of the people on the list didn't really want to rebel.

410
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,250
They just believed

411
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,450
that I couldn't go on anymore.

412
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,720
Beili belongs to the Xiaos,

413
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,290
but it doesn't have to be mine.

414
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,110
Some of you want to arrest the people on the list.

415
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,190
If you had really caught them,

416
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm afraid it would be the end of the Imperial Court then.

417
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,440
But after this,

418
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,470
no one will want a new heir from the Xiao family

419
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,950
to inherit the throne again.

420
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,400
 Thank you, Imperial Father.

421
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,930
My days are numbered.

422
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,550
There's not much I can do to help you all anymore.

423
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,170
You need to learn to help yourselves.

424
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,420
When an emperor rules a nation,

425
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,890
he must win the hearts of the people first.

426
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,460
People's hearts are fickle.

427
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,050
Even if they are grateful for your mercy this time,

428
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,150
what will happen if they want to rebel again?

429
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,980
Kill them then.

430
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,580
All of them.

431
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,870
- Summon Jin Xian. 
 - Summon Jin Xian!

432
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,150
Your Majesty.

433
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,290
If I release Jin Yan into the Martial Arts World,

434
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,040
he'll naturally be taken advantage of and hunted.

435
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,230
If I send him to the Heavenly Prison,

436
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,060
I suppose he'll resent me.

437
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,590
I'll leave him to you then.

438
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,550
Jin Yan, Jin Xian, do you have a problem with my decision?

439
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,480
I wouldn't dare.

440
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

441
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,200
I wouldn't dare.

442
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,050
Such a slave.

443
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,050
Jin Xian, take Jin Yan away.

444
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,220
Chong'er.

446
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,120
Yes, Imperial Father.

447
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,190
About the destruction of this list,

448
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:02,780
find a way to let all of Tianqi City know about it today.

449
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,960
Understood.

450
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,520
Imperial Father, I have something I need to report.

451
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,100
Go ahead.

452
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,670
When the Tiger Soldiers were escorting Jin Yan,

453
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,600
Eunuch Jin Xuan disobeyed your order and tried to stop us.

454
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,800
Please judge this fairly, Imperial Father.

455
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,590
Jin Xuan!

456
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,910
Get in here!

457
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,700
Your Majesty.

458
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,700
Were Chuhe's words just now true?

459
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,040
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

460
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,590
I was trying to save Jin Yan before he entered the palace.

461
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,020
How...

462
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,450
How... How dare you!

463
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,130
Your Majesty, I entered the palace with Jin Yan when we were little.

464
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,070
We're not brothers, but we're closer than real brothers.

465
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,790
His mistake this time is irredeemable.

466
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,990
I did have selfish intentions.

467
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,920
I wanted to save Jin Yan.

468
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,080
But I would still hand over the list to you, Your Majesty.

469
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:31,240
Director Jin Xuan, don't you think you sounded ridiculous when you said that?

470
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:37,550
Royal Father, Jin Xuan's actions can't be justified by his own selfish intentions.

471
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,910
Please give a fair judgment, Imperial Father.

472
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,650
Jin Xuan, starting today,

473
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,980
you're confined to Pingxin Hall.

474
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,250
You aren't allowed to step foot outside without my permission!

475
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,770
Chong'er.

476
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,670
Imperial Father.

477
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,350
You'll investigate the case of Jin Xuan leaving the palace without permission and trying to take the list.

478
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,650
I shall obey.

479
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,680
Eunuch Jin Xuan was Father's studying companion.

480
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,340
They grew up together.

481
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,840
You want father to kill him.

482
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,830
It won't be that easy.

483
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,390
I know.

484
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,560
I didn't intend to kill him today.

485
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,720
I'm content enough that father has confined him.

486
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,050
As for what to do next, I'll have to count on you.

487
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,810
This is a hot potato.

488
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,090
However, compared to Director Jin Xuan, Eunuch Jin Xian seems to be more trustworthy.

489
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,690
I never thought he would go this far for Jin Yan.

490
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,090
He's just a stupid man.

491
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,570
He has the ability and power, yet all he wanted was to save a martial brother from a different clan.

492
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,920
That's why we've taken very different paths.

493
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,360
How are you two taking the same path then?

494
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,190
Eunuch Jin Xian and I have nothing in common either.

495
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,860
In terms of willpower, I'm not as strong-willed as him.

496
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,110
What about you two, then?

497
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,140
Are you now on the same page because of the small favors you did for each other?

498
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,360
Some ideas we have are the same,

499
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,940
but the paths we take are completely different.

500
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,450
Sixth Brother, looks like we have nothing in common either.

501
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,290
True.

502
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,950
We're on two different paths,

503
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,220
but our paths occasionally cross,

504
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,940
and we walk together for a while.

505
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,420
We'll eventually have to go our separate ways.

506
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,390
Second Brother, the path ahead will only be more challenging.

507
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,460
Father's physical condition...

508
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,830
All diseases are curable,

509
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,030
but it's not easy to treat the illness of the heart.

510
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,620
Your Majesty, do you have a deep friendship with Director Jin Xuan?

511
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,720
Yes.

512
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:31,720
Jin Xuan was my studying companion.

513
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,920
He grew up with me.

514
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,090
That explains why you only locked him up despite the grave crime he committed.

515
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,350
Being in Tianqi,

516
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,150
especially in high positions,

517
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,740
it's inevitable to make some silly mistakes.

518
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:01,610
Look at those people I was with back then

519
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,170
one by one.

520
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,060
Some are dead,

521
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,020
some have left Tianqi,

522
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,310
and only Jin Xuan is still here.

523
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,390
I really don't want to kill him.

524
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,400
Your Majesty, you're a nostalgic man.

525
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,270
Hua Jin,

526
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,900
how long do I have to live?

527
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,910
Your Majesty, don't think about things like this.

528
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,140
You just need to trust me.

529
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,460
Of course, I trust you.

530
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,540
It's just that I...

531
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,920
have a favor to ask of you.

532
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,290
What is it?

533
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:53,090
Extend my life for a few more days with your medical skills.

534
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:13,920
