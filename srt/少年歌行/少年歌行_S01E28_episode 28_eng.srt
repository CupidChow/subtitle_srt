2
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,900
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,380
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,300
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,500
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,680
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,580
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,820
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,900
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,980
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,900
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,520
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,300
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,460
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,460
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,500
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,680
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,800
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
♫  To do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,880
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,960

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,080

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,920
They must think that we are silly.

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,260
Yes.

26
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,560
Exhausting ourselves of all favors to invite the State Preceptor,

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,970
the pillar of the country.

28
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,240
rganizing such a grand banquet

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,610
and still turning it into a funeral in the end.

30
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,450
This could've been a good opportunity for negotiation.

31
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,740
We could've used the attendance of the three individuals,

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,180
and used it as a chance to talk to the rich and powerful.

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Who knows, that might have thrown a wrench in Prince Bai and Prince Chi's plans.

34
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,280
You're right.

35
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,700
Do you think I'm stupid too?

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,640
If you had done that, it would have turned you into another Prince Bai and Prince Chi.

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,000
But you're Xiao Chuhe.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,120
In your heart, gathering everyone in Tianqi City to commemorate senior brother

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,500
at this moment is the most important thing to do.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,640
That person must be at his limit.

41
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,790
This is the only way to draw out the shadow lurking in the dark.

42
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,960
And only that way...

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,300
can senior brother rest in peace now.

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,820

45
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,880
What was that?

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
What just happened?

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,060
Wasn't he sick?

48
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,300
Wasn't he about to die?

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,610
So why was he there?

50
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,920
Please calm down, Your Highness.

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,340
There could be spies.

52
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,240
Longxie. Send word to that person.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,180
I want to see him.

54
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,500
Your Highness. I failed to do a good job.

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,870
I deserve to be punished.

56
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,740
It wasn't your fault.

57
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,870
He has always been Tianqi City's favored son.

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,130
His banquet is supposed to be like that.

59
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,270
It's just that we had thought that after being away for so long,

60
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,320
his glorious days would've come to an end.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,060
His Majesty's appearance today...

62
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,600
Imperial Father was letting everyone know that although he has crippled Chuhe,

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,460
and even though he refuses to stay in the royal residence,

64
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,320
he...

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,150
he is still imperial father's favorite son.

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,010
Imperial father's love for him...

67
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,290
is something my seventh brother and I never received all these years.

68
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,380
The news we received from the palace

69
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,180
said that His Majesty was in an unconscious state all this while.

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,690
No one expected him to be able to leave the palace.

71
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,380
I guess that Divine Healer really is talented.

72
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,020
Then shouldn't we ask the Divine Healer to take a look at Your Highness' eyes?

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,140
I heard she's pretty close to Chuhe.

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm afraid...

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,280
I personally think their relationship is merely that of a physician and a patient.

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,420
All that Divine Healer thinks about is how to treat illnesses.

77
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,240
We could ask Your Highness' second master, the Director of Record, to invite her.

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,010
Yes.

79
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,680
We could ask my second master to help.

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,130
Okay.

81
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,380
Your Highness. This is a good opportunity for us.

82
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,790
We must make good use of it.

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,770
Right.

84
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,580
It could also... be my last chance.

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,570

(T/N: meaning majestic words can lead to overwhelming momentum)

86
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm sure you're all aware.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,350
Merchants of Qingzhou aren't fond of visiting Tianqi

88
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,720
because it has too many rules.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,700
As for Qingzhou, it has never cared about rules.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,580
So what's your reason for coming?

91
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,660
I have a friend.

92
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,260
He has something he wants to do.

93
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,000
But you all could... be a hindrance.

94
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,670
So, I'd like to ask you to make way.

95
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,200
You said it yourself.

96
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,030
Tianqi City has a lot of rules.

97
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,480
Wanting us, the hosts, to make way...

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,950
Isn't that a little inappropriate?

99
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,980
I've made it clear, haven't I?

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,760
I...

101
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,960
have never cared about rules.

102
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,700
But if you insist on going by the rules,

103
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,560
then you can all... prepare to go broke

104
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,380
and lose everything.

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,540
Whatever the Mu family wants of you,

106
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,980
is as easy as... turning our hand over.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,600
That's all I have to say.

108
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,190
Good day.

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
- What? 
 - He...

110
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,120
Butler Liang. How was my performance just now?

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,210
You exuded the Mu family's elegance!

112
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,740
Next, I'm about to do something even more elegant.

113
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,810
What would that be, Young Master?

114
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,600
You really are as fine as can be.

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,970
Is there really a person with such amazing talent on the island?

116
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,890
Not a person, but an... immortal.

117
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,350
Either way, it's hard to describe.

118
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,180
Congrats, you have one less thing to worry about.

119
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,960
In a moment, you'll probably have something to be concerned about.

120
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,510
So you're Hua Jin,

121
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,060
the Divine Healer?

122
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,520
An apprentice of the Medicine King?

123
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,010
Who are you?

124
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,860
Is there a problem?

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Tread lightly, Young Master Mu.

126
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,310
You might get pricked.

127
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,960
Divine Healer. Please accept my bow.

128
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,300
I am the third son of the Mu family of Qingzhou's Yunjian City, Mu Chunfeng.

129
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,980
I wonder if I could have the honor to be accepted as your disciple.

130
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,590
You don't.

131
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,380
I have a sprig of Qianxin Herb.

132
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,680
I could gift it to you, how about that?

133
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,060
I also have a manor in Tianqi, the Autumn Cottage.

134
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,600
Dozens of precious medicinal herbs are grown there.

135
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,580
Such as?

136
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,940
Oh, not much.

137
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,280
Things like dutchman's pipe, lianxian,

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,350
the blood of qilin, and immortal crane stone.

139
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,060
Oh and heart-reviving herb, king dragon leaf.

140
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,080
Five, six, seven...

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,360
eight-hundred-year-old lingzhi.

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,800
Listen to him brag.

143
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,810
That's how all rich people like to talk.

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,770
If you're interested, I could take you on a tour of the cottage.

145
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,290
You could give me an answer then.

146
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,260
How about that?

147
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,770
Sounds good.

148
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,310
Master, please accept my bow!

149
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,130
I haven't agreed to take you as a disciple yet.

150
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,160
Master, I'm a businessman.

151
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,180
I have a good eye when it comes to people.

152
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,240
Once you go with me, you'll definitely take me in.

153
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,770
Well then, I shall take my leave, Master!

154
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,420
Young Master Chunfeng, how could you simply give away the Autumn Cottage like that?

155
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,200
That is the most important business the Mu family runs in Tianqi City.

156
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,660
Steward Liang. I gifted the Autumn Cottage to my master.

157
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,510
Master will later pass it down to me.

158
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,790
In the end, the Autumn Cottage will still belong to us, right?

159
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,710
You always think of everything.

160
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,750
Say no more. Say no more.

161
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,130
Divine Healer.

162
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,030
Marquis Lanyue.

163
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,060
Don't you know what time it is?

164
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,850
You should return to the palace.

165
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,310
Got it. It's not like I'm your daughter.

166
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,160
Daughter?

167
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,670
Chuhe. Am I that old?

168
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,290
Save it, Imperial Uncle.

169
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,910
I even address you as "Imperial Uncle."

170
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,500
What else do you expect her to call you?

171
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,190
Blame it on the seniority in the family.

172
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,130
All right, I'll take you back to the palace.

173
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,940

174
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,910
Imperial father has already recovered.

175
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,000
He fell asleep after getting back,

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,300
but he hasn't woken up since.

177
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,400
However, I heard that the ban in the city has been lifted.

178
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,990
It has.

179
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,940
The moment His Majesty showed up, it put an end to many of the rumors.

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,710
The Imperial Medical Academy made a public statement, announcing that His Majesty has recovered.

181
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,150
He only needs to rest a bit more.

182
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,230
But in truth, His Majesty's illness still persists.

183
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,130
That's to say, Father forced himself to attend the banquet.

184
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,530
Now all of Tianqi City is talking about the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House.

185
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,720
Talking about Xiao Chuhe.

186
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:44,890
They are saying the name on the Dragon Seal Scroll will surely be his.

187
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,700
Your Highness. Everyone looks out for themselves.

188
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,910
Particularly in Tianqi City.

189
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,850
Then I'll make sure no one dares to seek their own benefit in this matter.

190
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,880
What is Your Highness's plan?

191
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,450
Who are you?

192
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,230
I'm going to remind everyone.

193
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,710
In Tianqi City, whoever dares to help Xiao Chuhe should better be prepared to lose their lives.

194
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,230
Two sword wounds. One in the front, the other in the back.

195
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,530
The one in the back pierced his lower back.

196
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,230
The one in the front pierced his heart.

197
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,520
I had seen Master Jiu fight.

198
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,370
It's true he wasn't that skilled in single combat.

199
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,710
But it was good enough to keep himself alive.

200
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,400
There's poison in his body.

201
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,810
This means that someone drugged his liquor.

202
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,010
The final posture before he died was the "Taking off of the Flying Swallow."

203
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,130
It shows that he was trying to run away.

204
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,480
But the person who killed him only needed one strike.

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,010
It was swift and deadly. The work of a professional assassin.

206
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,650
So was it them.

207
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,610
Dark River again.

208
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,430
What? The Dark River is in Tianqi City?

209
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,330
I'm ashamed of what happened to Master Jiu.

210
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,100
Master Jiu was a capable martial artist in his own right.

211
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,430
I would never imagine the killer would resort to such a despicable method just to kill him!

212
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,700
First, it's revenge for senior brother, my sister, and my brother-in-law.

213
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,280
Now, it's Master Jiu. We'll make them pay once and for all.

214
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm going to eradicate them!

215
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,730
Trust me. It will happen soon.

216
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,440

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
I heard Jiu Jiudao is dead.

218
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,700
That's right.

219
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,780
I suppose everyone thinks I'm the one who killed him.

220
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,380
After all, I did visit Dark River before.

221
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,430
But we're pretty certain that this was a plot by Dark River and Prince Chi.

222
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,540
Pointing the finger elsewhere is what that prince does best.

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,830
Do you have any good solutions?

224
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,560
Your Highness could wait for the right time to extend your goodwill to Prince Yong'an.

225
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,420
And let it be a reminder to Prince Chi.

226
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,460
If he dares to challenge us again, we could very well ally ourselves with Prince Yong'an.

227
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,330
The problem is that Prince Yong'an might not accept our goodwill.

228
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,610
Longxie... an insignificant thug in Tianqi City died.

229
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,580
Is this enough chaos?

230
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,350
With Jiu Jiudao's death, those people will sense the danger.

231
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,760
Their support for Xiao Chuhe will waver.

232
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,260
It'll affect his standing in Tianqi City.

233
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,800
It's not enough.

234
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,740
Just that isn't enough to meet my requirements.

235
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,430
I want chaos in Tianqi. Only if Tianqi is in chaos will the world be in chaos.

236
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:20,680
What kind of person needs to die in order to create chaos in the world?

237
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,440
Well...

238
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,570
Rest assured. I'm not after the emperor.

239
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,440
Get the Dark River to send their best assassin.

240
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,590
The person I want dead is...

241
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,550
That's...

242
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,750
That's how you turn the world upside down.

243
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,860

244
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,260
It's cold outside. Hold this.

245
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,970
You keep it.

246
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,530
Your hands are red from the cold already.

247
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,130
I doubt you've experienced such cold winters in the south.

248
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,730
Yeah. Thankfully, Uncle Xu keeps the hearth fire burning. It's quite warm.

249
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,730
Go inside and keep warm.

250
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,330
Xiao Se. The sun is out today.

251
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,560
Why don't you go for a walk with me?

252
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,280
Xiao Se. I know what you're thinking.

253
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,490
What?

254
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,640
Who will be next?

255
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,710
We don't know who's behind Dark River.

256
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,160
But if the mastermind is plotting against me,

257
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Jiu Jiudao won't be the only victim.

258
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,290
After all, a person in the martial arts world won't cause any waves in the Imperial Court.

259
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,320
If they wish to deter the support from the big names,

260
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,040
I'm afraid they'll take out someone important in the Imperial Court.

261
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,260
The civil and military officials who attended the banquet that day were mostly just following their superiors.

262
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,660
They had to come.

263
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,200
So the ones in the greatest danger should be those who willingly support you.

264
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,040
When did you start to think about these matters?

265
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm the Young Lady of Xueyue City.

266
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,820
Did you really think I only spoke with my fists?

267
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,020
I didn't bother with these matters before because first off, I didn't like them.

268
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,660
Second, it was because senior brother was there.

269
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,200
Senior brother was a much better strategist than I am.

270
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,900
I was used to relying on him.

271
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,340
Now that he's gone,

272
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,380
Either way, I should prove my mettle as the Guardian Vermilion Bird, right?

273
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,000
All right. Qianluo. You'll have to go somewhere tonight.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Where?

275
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,720
I want to verify the assumption.

276
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,120
Grand Preceptor. Tianqi City hasn't been really safe lately.

277
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,100
I think you should take it easy with your habit of taking a stroll late at night.

278
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,800
When the mind is troubled, it's hard to fall asleep.

279
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,780
Taking a walk outside helps to calm the mind.

280
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,440
His Majesty is gravely ill. The princes are busy fighting for power.

281
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,320
There are wolves on all sides in the Imperial Court.

282
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,740
In the South, Nanjue is like a tiger, eyeing us.

283
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,340
There is no situation worse than this.

284
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,500
But you aren't the only one tasked to manage the nation, Grand Preceptor.

285
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,040
- Marquis Lanyue... 
 - Marquis Lanyue?

286
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,540
It's not that Marquis Lanyue doesn't want to take the helm.

287
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,460
It's just that his identity is special. It could cause misunderstandings.

288
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,800
Grand Preceptor.

289
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,620
No need to send another signal.

290
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,100
The fact that he's standing here means that the secret bodyguards have been dispatched.

291
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,220
Those men were pretty skilled.

292
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,540
It took me some effort.

293
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,820
Who sent you?

294
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,940
My apologies, Grand Preceptor.

295
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,400
So you're the real secret bodyguard.

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,200
You are the head of Dark River's Su family, Su Muyu.

297
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm guessing you're not just a nobody.

298
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,940
He's not only famous.

299
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,840
In fact, he's too famous.

300
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,940
You flatter me, Grand Preceptor.

301
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,640
There's no need to be so humble.

302
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,860
The Annihilator, Li Tian.

303
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,460
Back then, on Mount Qilei, you were surrounded by dozens of elite fighters.

304
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,380
You managed to escape with grave injuries.

305
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,240
I never thought I'd see you here.

306
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,220
Umbrella-Wielding Demon.

307
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:42,600
It looks like the regret of not being able to fight you before will be remedied today.

308
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,840
Li Tian. You're getting too far from me.

309
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm Mu Yumo. It's a pleasure to meet you, Grand Preceptor Dong.

310
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,720
Who do you think you are?

311
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
- Guxu... 
 - Save it.

312
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,640
My father is the Spear Deity who broke through the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts' Guxu Formation.

313
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,140
You dare show off your pathetic version of the Guxu Formation?

314
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,380
That was pretty exhilarating.

315
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
The Dark River is becoming too brazen.

316
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,260
Dark River isn't the one who's brazen.

317
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,320
- Li Tian. 
 - Yes.

318
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,200
Now that Miss Qianluo is here,

319
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,500
that must mean Prince Yong'an

320
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,520
has found out who the mastermind behind Dark River is.

321
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,180
Everyone knows that Grand Preceptor Dong is non-partisan.

322
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,960
He has never supported any of the princes.

323
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,680
It was like that when father ascended the throne. And it remains the same now.

324
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,160
Killing him won't affect the name written on the scroll.

325
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,640
But it will impact the Imperial Court and the world in a big way.

326
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,720
According to what you just learned, Prince Bai had gone to the Dark River before.

327
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,780
Both Xiao Jingxia and Prince Bai went to the Dark River.

328
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,620
It corresponds with Dark River's reappearance and working together with the Tang Clan.

329
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,320
I don't think Dark River's appearance was planned by my second brother. He was most likely set up.

330
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,900
Why are you so sure?

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,600
When we were young, we studied at a government-run academy.

332
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,700
The chancellor at the time was the Scholar Sword Deity, Xie Xuan.

333
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,220
He asked the three of us to choose the Ways of the King and Emperor.

334
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,520
Second Brother chose the Way of the Monarch,

335
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,720
prioritizing virtue, benevolence, and winning people over with righteousness.

336
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,560
Seventh Brother chose the Way of the Dictator. A dictator is a ruler of chaos.

337
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,260
Subduing people by force and governing with the blade.

338
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,800
He said it himself. Every dynasty is chaotic.

339
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,480
Those words are considered treason,

340
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,460
but Xie Xuan didn't rebuke him.

341
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,400
Thinking back,

342
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,980
even if my second brother kept trying to stop me from entering the capital for the sake of the throne,

343
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,420
he would never go against the Way of the Monarch.

344
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,260
He would never attempt to kill the Grand Preceptor.

345
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,720
What way did you choose then?

346
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,000
Me?

347
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,700
I chose the Way of the Ranger.

348
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,200
Way of the Ranger? What's that?

349
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,740
Swashbuckling across the lands and getting drunk in high towers.

350
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,080
I was ten at that time. It's what I wanted to do the most.

351
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,260
That sounds more like something Lei Wujie would say.

352
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,760
I heard someone calling my name!

353
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,720
Miss Ye. Why did you call me?

354
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,920
Xiao Se was talking about his childhood. It reminded me of you.

355
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,600
Him? How could a feeble old man like him be like me?

356
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,740
Feeble old man?

357
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,500
How are you not? You're always so sluggish and weak. As if you were frozen.

358
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,240
If you're not feeble, who is?

359
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,360
Airhead.

360
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,360
Young Master, there's a message from the palace.

361
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,130

362
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,000
What is it, Xiao Se?

363
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,640
It's from Marquis Lanyue.

364
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,080
He said that my second brother sent a request early today to ask imperial father to look into the Dark River's assassination attempt.

365
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,040
He's taking advantage of the situation.

366
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,000
With this, Prince Bai not only made a clean break with the Dark River,

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,860
but also gave a warning to the real mastermind.

368
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,620
- This way. 
 - If old Mr. Mu of Qingzhou saw how Mu Chunfeng was behaving right now,

369
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,900
would he still pass the position of head of the family to him?

370
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,360
Not so loud.

371
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
It's been a while, Divine Healer Hua.

372
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,280
Please sit, Divine Healer.

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,700
Thank you.

374
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,260
But why did it sound like you were calling an old man?

375
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,120
Next time, just call my master the Divine Healer.

376
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,340
Is she already your master?

377
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,860
I took my master to visit the Autumn Cottage. She was very pleased.

378
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,020
I really do pity Steward Liang.

379
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,160
You did well, my dear disciple.

380
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,920
Thank you for the compliment, Master.

381
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,880
When I met you on the boat, I thought you were so suave.

382
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,520
Seeing you today, it seems like you've also got the gift of kissing up!

383
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,460
Thanks for the compliment.

384
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,420
Did you come here because of my father's condition?

385
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,260
That's right. I've cured your father's ailment.

386
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,080
Although his heart condition is due to his heart disease, a recurrence is inevitable.

387
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,880
But it's abnormal for him to remain unconscious for so long.

388
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,760
I suspect there is another Divine Healer in the palace.

389
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,420
His Majesty's repeated flare-ups could be blamed on him.

390
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,700
Someone is drugging him?

391
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,800
That could be the case. But if it was simply poisoning, I would have easily noticed.

392
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,580
It's something rather subtle. Something I don't quite understand myself.

393
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,960
I discovered something off in the food a few days ago. While yesterday, I found an odd drug in the incense.

394
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,020
Looks like there's somewhere I have to go.

395
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,720
Where?

396
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,020
You'll be coming with me.

397
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,600
Sister Ye, did you two often come here before?

398
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,620
Not just me. There's also Prince Bai, Xiao Chong.

399
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,440
The three of us used to play together all the time.

400
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,940
There's something I've been wanting to ask.

401
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,460
How did you and Xiao Se... meet?

402
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,480
I've been waiting for you to ask me. I've waited so long that I thought you didn't care anymore.

403
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,750
That's a story from when I was really young.

404
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,720
I was sickly back then. So I couldn't really go outside and play.

405
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,000
I would often daydream in this courtyard by myself.

406
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,700
 Who are you?

407
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,380
 Am I disturbing you?

408
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,400
 Why are you in my house?

409
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,400
 I'm Xiao Chuhe. I came with my uncle to see General Ye.

410
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,720
 Why are you sitting in this chair?

411
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,880
 I'm not well.

412
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,460
 Although master said I should walk more

413
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,200
 in order to strengthen my body,

414
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,420
 I can only manage a few steps before I start to feel the pain.

415
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,560
 That's why father made this chair for me.

416
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,800
 Come, stand up.

417
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,400
 I know it hurts. But if it's you, you'll surely be able to do it.

418
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,120
I was seven at the time. Xiao Chuhe was nine. That's how we met.

419
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,860
 I know it hurts.

420
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,460
 But if it's you, you'll surely be able to do it. Hang in there.

421
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,860
No wonder.

422
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,240
Sister Ye. So are you and Xiao Se...

423
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,900
That's already in the past. The future is more important.

424
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,860
So this is Baixiao Sect?

425
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,640
Xiao Chuhe. I'm surprised to see you again.

426
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,400
Greetings to the Six Iron Masks.

427
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,920
You've only met four of the Iron Masks.

428
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,120
You should know that we have a lot to do in a day. And few can live to a ripe old age.

429
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,320
Even after so long, the Iron Mask is still so self-deprecating.

430
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,340
Xiao Chuhe. We're all busy people. What information do you want?

431
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,820
None of you here can give me the information I want.

432
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,040
Xiao Se. Regardless, we're on their turf. Shouldn't we be more courteous?

433
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,440
It's fine.

434
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,660
Xiao Chuhe. Are you really so naive to think that just because His Majesty reinstated your position,

435
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,800
that people would start treating you like a prince?

436
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,460
Xiao Se. Didn't you say they work for your master? Don't tell me they've all defected.

437
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,380
Ji Ruofeng has been missing for a year already.

438
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,140
Who said Baixiao Sect was still under his control?

439
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,200
Xiao Se. The staff he's wielding looks just like your Wuji Staff.

440
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,500
It's naturally because I'm also a member of the Baixiao Sect.

441
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,940
You're a woman?

442
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,240
She's my master's daughter.

443
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,360
- Ji Xue. Where is Master? 
 -  He's dead.

444
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,020
What?

445
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm joking. But he's as good as dead.

446
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,480
When my father saved you back then, he sustained grave injuries.

447
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
Over the years, he's always been recuperating in Medicine Valley.

448
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
But it's undeniable that he's concerned about you.

449
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,960
When you left Snowfall Villa, he personally inquired about you.

450
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,760
Now that you're back, he asked me to hurry back to help you.

451
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,080
- Help me? 
 - That's right.

452
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,780

453
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,680
That's all of them!

454
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,000
The White Tiger stands in the west.

455
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,660
Since Master passed Bai Xiaosheng's position and token on to me, then congratulations.

456
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,640
Next time I come to acquire information here, I won't have to pay.

457
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,140
We'll owe you.

458
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,400
So what about the matter I had asked master to look into?

459
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,860
Regarding who hurt you, according to the information we got,

460
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,140
it was a very subdued inner force that obstructed your meridians.

461
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,680
I checked all the known martial art manuals and did find a martial art that had the ability to do this.

462
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
Which martial art?

463
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,860
The Art of Detachment.

464
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,600
Director Zhuoqing.

465
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,960
That's right.

466
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,960
The master of the current Five Eunuchs, the former Director Zhuoqing.

467
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,700
The Art of Detachment that he practices is the world's most sinister and subdued martial art.

468
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,160
Not to mention powerful.

469
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,840
But it's too bad. None of his five pupils could master the art.

470
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,600
So that was the end of the lead.

471
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,340
The end? Why?

472
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,060
Because Zhuoqing is already dead.

473
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Got it.

474
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,020
Xiao Chuhe. You should've come looking for us the moment you returned.

475
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,840
You know that Baixiao Sect would be the most help to you. But you just wouldn't come.

476
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,660
And we couldn't go to you, lest we interfere with your plan.

477
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,480
Actually, there really isn't a plan. I just thought the time wasn't right yet.

478
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,980
And what? Has the right time come now?

479
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,620
I have three things that require answers from you.

480
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,560
Three things right off the bat. You really are demanding.

481
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,500
What is it? Do you wish to know who is behind Dark River?

482
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,960
No. I already have an answer regarding that matter.

483
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,720
So there's no need to have Baixiao Sect investigate further.

484
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,760
The Dark River will pay for their actions.

485
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,500
So will the mastermind behind it.

486
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,080
But the first thing I'd like to ask is about the scroll.

487
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
So that's what you still want after all.

488
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
What exactly are you trying to find out?

489
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,600
Does the scroll actually exist?

490
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,360
What is written on the scroll?

491
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Or, where exactly is the scroll?

492
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,260
Everything. I want to know everything about the scroll.

493
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,060
That is certainly a lion-sized ask. What else?

494
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,100
I want you to find any toxin experts that came to Tianqi

495
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,340
within the year and haven't left yet.

496
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,180
I want a name list.

497
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,800
That's not difficult. But I'll need some time.

498
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,300
As for the third request.

499
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,040
I have a friend.

500
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,260
He should've arrived in Tianqi City much earlier than I did.

501
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,560
But up to now he still hasn't come to see me.

502
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,080
I'd like to know where he is right now.

503
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,980
- Perhaps he's already left. 
 - Not possible.

504
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,100
If he were to leave, he would definitely have met up with me first.

505
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,420
Oh? Who is he exactly?

506
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,460
He's a... troublesome friend.

507
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,840
Congrats on coming out of seclusion.

508
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,920
Good day, Eunuch Jade Deity.

509
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,260
You seem to be in much better spirits since the last time we met.

510
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,180
You still dare bring that up?

511
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,480
You almost scared me to death the last time.

512
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,280
That was my fault.

513
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,820
I wasn't able to give you a heads-up before I entered your sedan chair.

514
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,600
Now, can you tell me why you went to Beili?

515
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,960
And then why did you show up in the imperial city?

516
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,400
Don't try to lie to me.

517
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,000
Or else, I'll haul you off to His Majesty right away.

518
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,100
I guess I really have to oblige when I'm the guest.

519
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,920
All right then. I'll tell you.

520
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,220
Actually, I'm here to see my birth mother. Consort Xuan.

521
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,380
As predicted. That's what I thought.

522
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,460
Because you miss her?

523
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,400
- Because I'm curious. 
 - Curious?

524
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,300
Don't give me that look. I'm truly curious.

525
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,180
Back in Tian Wai Tian,

526
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,720
I heard a lot from the White-Haired Deity regarding my father, Ye Dingzhi's many meritorious deeds.

527
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,620
In those stories, there is no shortage of matters concerning Consort Xuan.

528
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,840
After hearing all that, I couldn't help

529
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,120
but think that there was more to Consort Xuan.

530
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,260
Especially the part where she uttered one phrase to my father,

531
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,180
and it made my father turn his blade on himself.

532
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,480
I'm even more curious about what she said exactly.

533
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,460
All for one phrase. Is it worth it?

534
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,640
Would you rather I ask her why she abandoned me?

535
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,080
Anyway, I checked your wound.

536
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,720
You were injured by the director.

537
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,300
I didn't think there would be someone so formidable in the imperial city.

538
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,520
Then you've underestimated Tianqi.

539
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,840
I advise you to leave here immediately once you've recovered.

540
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,000
This isn't a place for you to hide out in.

541
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,640
Understood.

542
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,360
By the way, has Xiao Se returned to Tianqi?

543
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,160
Not only has he returned, but he's also caused an uproar.

544
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,660
It's just a pity...

545
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,880
you didn't personally get to see him.

546
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,320
What? Do you want to see him?

547
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,400
Shouldn't I see him?

548
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,560
But I thought I would've finished what I set out to do before meeting with him.

549
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,200
You haven't come to the palace in a while.

550
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,600
So why have you come to see me today?

551
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,000
Can I not come and talk with my mother when I want to?

552
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,420
What is it that you wish to talk about? Go on.

553
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,220
Xiao Chuhe is back.

554
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,840
Have you heard?

555
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,680
I've lived in Jingtai Palace for a long time.

556
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,700
I stay away from outside affairs.

557
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,740
I didn't know.

558
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,720
Everyone in Tianqi knows the impact of his return on me.

559
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,840
All except my birth mother, who can't be bothered.

560
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,120
The Eight Treasures Tea I brought back from the outer region last time.

561
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,660
How come you're not drinking it?

562
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,620
I tried it. I couldn't get used to it,

563
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,700
so I put it away.

564
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,800
Since you don't like it, just throw it away then.

565
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,720
I have one more question to ask you, Mother.

566
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,680
Go ahead.

567
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,140
If it's a matter regarding your other son,

568
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,720
do you want to hear about it

569
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,480
or not?

570
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,140
What did you say?

571
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,280
I was just joking.

572
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,720
He's already gone back to Tian Wai Tian.

573
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,380
And he won't ever return.

574
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,060

575
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,220
Your Majesty. Is something troubling you?

576
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,620
Why?

577
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,580
If you're troubled, you could throw or smash something.

578
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,480
Or maybe shout it out. Don't keep it inside.

579
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,280
I thought you were concerned about me.

580
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,000
I didn't imagine that it was me affecting you.

581
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,060
I'm not affected. I'm worried about you.

582
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,480
Your blood circulation isn't good.

583
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,060
If you don't adjust yourself, no amount of acupuncture will do any good.

584
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,520
I prefer not to be troubled, either.

585
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,580
However, I can't help but think about it.

586
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,580
Chuhe...

587
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,660
would tell me everything when he was younger.

588
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:42,260
Since when did he start to become so distant toward me?

589
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,700
Perhaps he thinks he's achieved a tacit understanding with Your Majesty.

590
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,440
So some things need not be said out loud.

591
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,840
I like that explanation.

592
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,100
Not bad.

593
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,920
I'm Chuhe's father.

594
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,060
As father and son, we should have a tacit understanding. Right?

595
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,380

596
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:14,320
Master. Should we first go to Diaolou Parlor to eat or get medicine at Autumn Cottage first?

597
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,680
Divine Healer.

598
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,960
You are...

599
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,420
Nowadays, Divine Healer Hua's skills are well known in the court.

600
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,500
Getting requests is to be expected.

601
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,920
If you're not willing to help, you can just say no.

602
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,620
Who was that person?

603
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,220
- He said his name is Jinyu. 
 - Bearer of Records?

604
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,860
He's not the one who's sick. He asked me to help him treat someone.

605
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,420
I wasn't sure if I should agree, so I asked Marquis Lanyue.

606
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,520
He said to come get your opinion.

607
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,920
- Who does he want you to treat? 
 - He said it was someone blind.

608
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,240
When he was young, he ate a snack he got from someone.

609
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,280
Then later lost his sight after that. It's been 20 years now.

610
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm not sure if it can be cured.

611
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,140
Are you able to treat it?

612
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:24,970

613
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,340
