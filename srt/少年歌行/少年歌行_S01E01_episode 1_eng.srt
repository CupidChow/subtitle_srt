22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,072

24
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,340
 Emperor Tianwu, Xiao Yi, rose amidst chaos through his sword

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,280
 and founded the Kingdom of Beili.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,604
 The kingdom prospered for two centuries,

27
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,540
 and during the reign of Emperor Mingde,

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,880
 it was so powerful that many nations came to pay tribute.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,612
 Emperor Mingde had a son called Xiao Chuhe.

30
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:16,784
 Ranked sixth among his brothers, he was a genius

31
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,628
 and originally poised to become the Crown Prince.

32
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,540
 Yet four years ago,

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,860
 the younger brother of Emperor Mingde, Prince Langya,

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,180
 was accused of treason and had to be beheaded.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,160
 In public, Xiao Chuhe defended Prince Langya, angering his father.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,180
 He was subsequently stripped of his title and exiled to Qingzhou.

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,520
 The Crown Prince position remained vacant.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,580
 The other princes continued to fight amongst themselves,

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,660
 and the court became turbulent

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,796
 and peace was broken.

41
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:48,940
 While the exiled Xiao Chuhe went missing

42
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,848
 and for many years, no one has seen him.

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,176

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,830

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,804

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,100
 Autumn of the 20th year of Emperor Mingde's reign,

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,416
 Abbot Wang You of Hanshui Temple passed away.

48
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,720
 And so began the Golden Coffin incident

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,620
 that turned the martial arts world upside down.

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,160

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,056

52
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,020
Sir. Look.

53
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,720
We've run this mountain villa for almost five years now.

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,620
Even the guest chambers can't keep the wind out anymore.

55
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,500
Do you think we should spend some money to repair the inn a bit?

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,540
- This way... 
 - What do you know?

57
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,456
My inn is all about the ambiance.

58
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,920
 Our Snowfall Mountain Villa backs up against a mountain

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,220
and has water flowing in front of us.

60
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,950
 A slightly run-down chamber will give it more atmosphere.

61
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,652
That's the feeling a traveler is passionately seeking.

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,228
What kind of feeling is that?

63
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,512
Needless to say, they seek a journey.

64
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,528
A journey...

65
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,432
What does that mean?

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,340
Wait.

67
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,044
He's not thinking of selling the inn is he?

68
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:56,580
This snow has carried on for several months already

69
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,320
and we haven't had a single customer.

70
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,956
Soon, we won't even get paid anymore.

71
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:04,140
And once the inn is sold, we'll be penniless and homeless,

72
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,600
are we going to sleep on the street then?

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Come on, come on.

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,700
You're overthinking this.

75
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,820
Even if we were to give this inn away for free, people would think it's too dilapidated.

76
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,244
Besides, is our boss' state of mind something us common people can understand?

77
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,696
Look at the heavy snow.

78
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,660
All we see is a white blanket.

79
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,460
But he can see the meaning behind it.

80
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,444
That's what you call a grand poet.

81
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,060
Look.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
He's about to recite a poem now.

83
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,528
 Business is bad.

84
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,900
 Should I sell the inn?

85
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,020
We have a guest.

86
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,580
He can't even afford a cotton jacket.

87
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,460
He doesn't look like he has the money to stay at an inn.

88
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,616
Look closely.

89
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:06,672
The red on his clothing is very unique.

90
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,220
For material like this...

91
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,620
Unless you're a huge shop like the Yuxiu Shop in Tianqi City,

92
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,476
a bolt of this fabric would cost an entire shop.

93
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,840
- Go welcome him. 
  - Sure thing!

94
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,520
Sir. Are you eating or looking to stay?

95
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,120
This is it right here.

96
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,640

97
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,220
 This guy looks annoying.

98
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,620
 He has no manners whatsoever.

99
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,600
 But judging by the way he dresses,

100
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,800
 he must be from a prestigious martial arts family venturing out to gain experience.

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,116
 He must have a lot of money.

102
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,660
Sir. What would you like?

103
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,544
 People like him love to show off.

104
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:18,020
 Time to earn a fortune off him.

105
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,448
One bowl of plain noodles and one plain liquor, please.

106
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,420
What is it?

107
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Would you like to order anything else?

108
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
Our pork shoulders and peach blossom wine

109
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,540
are our signature dishes.

110
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,684
Pork shoulder?

111
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,228
One order of pork shoulder... is too much.

112
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,400
Can you put a slice of it in the plain noodles?

113
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,840
A bowl of plain noodles. One plain liquor.

114
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,460
Six copper coins, please.

115
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,820
Did you hear?

116
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,180
Someone is delivering a treasure from Hanshui Temple to the Nine Dragon Sect.

117
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,740
I know. Everyone in the martial arts world is talking about it.

118
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,260
Apparently, if you obtain the item, you can rule the world.

119
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,320
How come I heard that treasure is a powerful technique?

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,220
No way. I heard it's a beautiful lady.

121
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,380
Give me a break. A beautiful lady from Hanshui Temple?

122
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,052
The boss said that.

123
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,020
Come in, gentlemen.

124
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,300
Move aside!

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,860
 Another group of rude customers with no money.

126
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,360
Sir.

127
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,040
Sir...

128
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,000
Bring us the best liquor and the most expensive meat you have.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,864
Sir, your noodles and liquor.

130
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,980
Enjoy.

131
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,020
What's the matter?!

132
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,000
You...

133
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,380
Gentlemen.

134
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,820
Our rule here is you pay first and then we serve the food.

135
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,180
Therefore, it's best to say how much meat and liquor you want ahead of time.

136
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,680
Who are you?

137
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,504
I'm Xiao Se.

138
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:14,116
The owner of Snowfall Mountain Villa.

139
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:15,940
I don't have any money.

140
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,916
But you... definitely do!

141
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,240
Truth be told, this inn has had no customers for a month already.

142
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,420
- I can hardly even pay my workers. 
 - I don't care.

143
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,560
Even if you don't have the money, your fur coat is worth more than a hundred silver taels.

144
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,060
Nonsense!

145
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,440
An expensive steed and a costly fur coat.

146
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,932
My coat was made by Yuxiu Shops in Tianqi City.

147
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:54,220
It took three months to make it and another month to deliver it to me.

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,304
A hundred silver taels?

149
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,340
That's not even enough to buy one of the sleeves.

150
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,640
You...

151
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,948
Boy, do you get my message now?

152
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,140
Two silver taels.

153
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,420
What two silver taels?

154
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,368
This table costs two silver taels.

155
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,780
You... I'm here to rob you today!

156
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,136
Not to eat!

157
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,680
Give me the best liquor and the best meat!

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
Then, hand me whatever is worth money!

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,980
Otherwise, I'll kill your people and burn your inn!

160
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,580
A robbery?

161
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,056
I have to intervene then.

162
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,280
- Who are you? 
 - Lei Wujie!

163
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,500
Lei Wujie?

164
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

165
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,436
- Who's Lei Wujie? 
 - No idea.

166
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:43,460
- Who is Lei Wujie? 
 - Never heard of him.

167
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,300
Does that name exist in the martial arts world?

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,740
I just started to travel the martial arts world,

169
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,044
so naturally, you don't know my name.

170
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,788
However, it's all right.

171
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:55,540
Soon enough, my name will...

172
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,580
Just a nameless brat.

173
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,080
Attack him!

174
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,256
The weaponless.

175
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,620
Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect? The Lei Clan?

176
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm Lei Wujie of the Lei family!

177
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,020
Chop him up!

178
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,420
That was my Formless Fist.

179
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,036
Of course, I have something more impressive.

180
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,620
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

181
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,880
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,780
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

183
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,640
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

184
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,980
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

185
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,120
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

186
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,200
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

187
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,984
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

188
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,000
How was that?  Now do you know who I am?

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,780
Get lost now!

190
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,320
Let's go!

191
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,092
Come on. Let's go!

192
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,860
A great kindness doesn't need a word of thanks.

193
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,060
Seeing injustice, I had to draw my sword and help.

194
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,760
It's my duty. So no need to thank me.

195
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,340
I have to go now. May we meet again.

196
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,052
No need to thank you?

197
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:43,760
You have to intervene?

198
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,180
Of course.

199
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,180
If it weren't for me, those bandits would have trashed your inn.

200
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,020
You might have lost your life too!

201
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,100
Isn't that a great kindness I did?

202
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,604
Look at my inn.

203
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,604
What's the difference from being trashed?

204
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,072
- Well... 
 - One hundred silver taels.

205
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,272
I don't have money.

206
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,780
But...

207
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,940
Either way, I at least saved your lives.

208
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,364
- You're just... 
 - Do I look like I need your help?

209
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,176
This technique...

210
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,060
One hundred silver taels.

211
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,300
I really don't have money.

212
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,540
- You don't? 
 - B-But I will have money soon!

213
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
I just have to go to a place.

214
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,752
Then, I'll have money when I get there.

215
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,880
What place?

216
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,660
Xueyue City.

217
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,632
Xueyue City?

218
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,160
 Xueyue City.

219
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,540
 The biggest city in the martial arts world.

220
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,520
 It houses the alliance formed by several prestigious clans.

221
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,140
 Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect is one of them.

222
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,220
 To reclaim what is mine,

223
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,260
 I have to visit that city too.

224
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,060
 If this young man is visiting the city too,

225
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,040
 knowing his identity,

226
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,360
 he can easily procure 100 silver taels for me.

227
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,732
 And he doesn't look like he's lying either.

228
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,292
 No matter how you look at him,

229
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:23,256
 he's clearly an idiot.

230
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,000
Sure.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,080
If you're visiting Xueyue City, then I'll go with you.

232
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
No problem at all.

233
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,780
Also, as for the interest rate, let's make it 500 silver taels.

234
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,560
Five hundred taels?

235
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,540
 I haven't been out for many years already.

236
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,440
 The meeting with the Xueyue City lords is long overdue too.

237
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,100
 Time to revisit what happened that year.

238
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,640
The freshly fermented wine is sprinkled with green foam while the red clay pot slowly burns.

239
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,832
A snowfall is impending.

240
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:15,100
Would you care to have a drink?

241
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,380
Brother, you're in a good mood,

242
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,108
I would gladly drink with you.

243
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,780
However, the things inside the horse carriage will stay here.

244
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,768
Do you know what this horse carriage contains?

245
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,340
What else but gold, silver, and treasures?

246
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,720
You are not wrong per se.

247
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,680
Enough nonsense!

248
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,920
Hand it over now. Otherwise...

249
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,500
You followed me in this heavy snow.

250
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,680
I feel bad you did all that work.

251
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,428
But your endeavor is destined to fail.

252
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:58,000
I think you should drink with me first and...

253
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,236
Fingertip Blade!

254
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,416
Perhaps, the person who sent you didn't tell you who I am.

255
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,540
This payload isn't something, you small players,

256
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,480
can touch.

257
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,136
You're from the Tang Sect from Shu?

258
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,160
I wonder...

259
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,720
what Master asked me to deliver this time.

260
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,420
It has attracted so many skilled people the whole way here..

261
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,280
Who's there?

262
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,384
Tang Lian...

263
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,484
of Xueyue City.

264
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,336
You know my name.

265
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,948
We will meet again.

266
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,720
Stop right there!

267
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,320
What an eccentric person.

268
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,700
A white-haired man with a jade sword and exceptional lightness techniques.

269
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,308
Why haven't I heard Master ever mention him before?

270
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,892
This snow is too heavy!

271
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:22,104
When will it stop?

272
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,700
Fortunately, my horse is a one-of-a-kind steed.

273
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,449
Otherwise, we would've been buried under the snow.

274
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,300
No, wait. You keep telling me how great your horse is.

275
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,080
Do you sell horses?

276
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,660
Cut the crap. Go inside and start a fire.

277
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,236
Pretentious.

278
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,420
Someone made a fire here before.

279
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,820
Great! That makes it more convenient!

280
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,928
I was worried that the firewood would be too wet to light.

281
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,640
 Just two ordinary travelers?

282
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,420
Hurry up.

283
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,060
Lei Wujie. You said you would bring me to Xueyue City.

284
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,201
But you have taken two wrong turns already.

285
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,260
Are you sure we're heading in the right direction now?

286
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,376
A-Actually, it's my first time visiting Xueyue City.

287
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,580
But I swear this time I definitely got it right!

288
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,100
 His last name is Lei.

289
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,720
 Is he from the Lei family of the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect?

290
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
 But the name Lei Wujie... I've never heard of him.

291
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Is dog your Chinese zodiac sign?

292
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,220
What are you sniffing?

293
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,640
Did you smell something?

294
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,440
What smell?

295
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,840
A floral scent.

296
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,784
Baby roses.

297
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,220
Baby rose?

298
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,100
Would there be baby roses in this weather?

299
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
It's a scent of baby rose dew.

300
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,580
Baby rose dew. From Taziks, Champa, and Java.

301
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,744
Only Baihua Perfumery in Tianqi City sells it.

302
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:39,360
Why would it be here?

303
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,448
I didn't expect to come across

304
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:45,360
a man of fine taste in this secluded wilderness.

305
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,620
I implored the owner of Baihua Perfumery for many days

306
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,592
before she sold me this one bottle.

307
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,940
And you detected it right away.

308
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,420
It's breezy and chilly.

309
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,740
Do you want to come in, Miss?

310
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,240
No need.

311
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,840
This is...

312
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,020
Yue Ji smiles and sends a message and Ming Hou kills in anger?

313
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,820

314
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,520
That's right. That's right!

315
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,920
What's right?

316
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,900
These two are Yue Ji and Ming Hou.

317
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,300
Ranked ninth in the League of Assassins!

318
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,300
The first eight places are occupied by members of Dark River.

319
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,980
So they are the strongest killing duo in the martial arts world at the moment.

320
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,864
According to what you said, they sent us a message,

321
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,656
- so they're going to...
- They are going to kill us!

322
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,980
What are you so excited about?

323
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,580
Actually, that was to greet another friend inside.

324
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,468
However, our rule is that whoever accepts the message will have to die.

325
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,404
So tonight, the two of you will have to leave your lives here.

326
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,660
I accepted your card once,

327
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,596
but I didn't die.

328
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,952
Dare I ask this brother is...

329
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:10,380
Tang Lian. That's why we're here to kill you, isn't it?

330
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,860
Tang Lian?

331
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,380
You're Tang Lian?

332
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,360
The most outstanding disciple of Xueyue City, Tang Lian?

333
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,972
In that case, you're my senior brother!

334
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:22,660
I'm Lei Wujie!

335
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,504
From the Lei Fortress of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

336
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm also from Xueyue City!

337
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
Careful.

338
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,596
Ming Hou naturally doesn't like to talk much.

339
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,180
So he hates people who talk too much.

340
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,288
Such a huge blade!

341
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,752
You're injured.

342
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,452
And your Baixiang poison hasn't been completely detoxified.

343
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:05,540
Otherwise, the slash just now...

344
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,572
You won't be able to block the next hit.

345
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,092
Then I will!

346
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,500
My senior brother blocked one for me.

347
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,680
So it's my turn now to block one for him!

348
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,208
Little brother is also from Xueyue City too?

349
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,972
Then I can kill you won't be in vain.

350
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,300
However, Ming Hou doesn't use his claymore on just anyone.

351
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,940
So have a taste of my sword first.

352
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,592
Belt Sword?

353
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,264
Those two weapons certainly match well.

354
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:36,920
Belt Sword and the Golden Claymore.

355
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,876
Not many get to meet both these weapons in one night.

356
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:43,920
Watch closely now, young man.

357
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,612
They say the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect has the best firearms in the world.

358
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,940
But your inner force isn't too bad either.

359
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,980
You were able to catch my sword with your bare hands.

360
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,432
I've seen your sword, but you haven't seen my fist yet.

361
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,220
The Formless First of the Lei Clan.

362
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,960
The strike arrives before the fist does.

363
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,508
This kid has some moves.

364
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Lunar Shadow Strike, Shadow Disguise.

365
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,780
They are all strong techniques for assassination.

366
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,480
But no matter how good they are, what good are they if they can't eliminate the target?

367
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,800
I lost!

368
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,420
You won that round just now.

369
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,456
You must be joking.

370
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,940
For an assassin, there's no winning or losing, only living and dying.

371
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,060
Who knew that just as I entered the martial arts world I'd encounter an opponent like you?

372
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,236
How lucky am I?

373
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,384
- This is... 
- Fire Infusion from the Lei family.

374
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:45,948
 No wonder his hair turns red.

375
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,580
Yue Ji, let's go.

376
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,400
You're leaving already?

377
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
How odd. They had the upper hand.

378
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,660
Why did they leave?

379
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,481
You dare charge any attack that comes at you. How many lives do you have to play with?

380
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,140
You know martial arts too.

381
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,600
Why didn't you fight?

382
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,440
When did I say I could fight?

383
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,200
No wait, you waved your hand in your inn

384
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,380
and all windows and doors shut on their own.

385
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,080
Idiot.

386
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,580
Other than martial arts, there's also something called a mechanism.

387
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,000
 Do I look like I need your help?

388
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,664
That works too?

389
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,460
Mister, did you hide something in the backyard?

390
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,724
Someone just snuck in there.

391
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,484
I think Ming Hou and Yue Ji knew they were being used as bait.

392
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,600
Let's go.

393
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,040
Why?

394
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,540
Aren't we going to Xueyue City?

395
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,920
The First Disciple of Xueyue City is right in front of us.

396
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,012
I'd rather follow him than roam about with you.

397
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,300
That's right!

398
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,900
Only cowards would pull a dirty trick like this.

399
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,700
I beg your pardon, Tang Lian?

400
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,500
Who is the coward here?

401
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,640
Protect my senior brother!

402
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,980
Qianluo? Does Third Master know you're here?

403
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,380
Don't tell me you snuck out again.

404
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,580
Who said so?

405
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,584
I'm on an adventure and I merely passed by here.

406
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:26,340
What's going on?

407
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,036
Looks like you snuck out.

408
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,860
I have a mission and can't get away.

409
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,112
I'll write to Third Master and ask him to take you back.

410
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:35,400
Don't you dare, Tang Lian!

411
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,824
Senior Brother!

412
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,940
I don't want to play with you anymore!

413
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,500
We'll settle this in the future!

414
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,760
Tang Lian, just you wait!

415
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,244
She was...

416
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:10,000
Sikong Qianluo.

417
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,988
Sikong...

418
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,640
The daughter of the Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng?

419
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,420
Yes, she's my Third Master's daughter.

420
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,520
Also the Young Lady of Xueyue City.

421
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,492
That really was unexpected.

422
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,880
Qianluo...

423
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,840
went overboard this time.

424
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,920
What are you doing?

425
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,116
The sound doesn't lie.

426
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:55,248
It's pure gold.

427
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:56,640
Pure gold?

428
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,292
So what if it's pure gold?

429
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,900
It's worth a lot of money.

430
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,708
We just met and you trust us already?

431
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,892
I don't trust you.

432
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,788
I trust him.

433
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,680
Well, we share that same opinion.

434
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,120
When it comes to him, he's skilled,

435
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,692
but doesn't have a brain.

436
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:31,472
He's incapable of lying.

437
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,560
- And you? 
 - Me?

438
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,240
I gave you my two best Yebei horses to pull the carriage.

439
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,780
And you still don't trust me?

440
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,900
Senior Brother, ignore him.

441
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,480
He's just a horse merchant.

442
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,580
The whole way here, he kept talking about how great his horses were and nothing else.

443
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,780
Brother Lei. You haven't become a disciple of a sect yet,

444
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,764
so please refrain from using those two words, Senior Brother.

445
00:33:57,764 --> 00:33:59,760
Sure thing, Senior Brother.

446
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,156
So you really don't know what the coffin contains?

447
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,080
Master didn't tell me.

448
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,532
He just told me to escort it to the Nine Dragon Sect of Biluo City.

449
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,820
Aside from that, he told me one other thing.

450
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,360
Told you what?

451
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,264
Do not ever open this coffin.

452
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,360
Now that you've said that. I'm even more curious about he coffin.

453
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,480
Don't even try being curious about it.

454
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,420
I have run into more than ten groups of assassins.

455
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,188
So many people are coveting its contents.

456
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:38,448
Possessing it brings incredible danger.

457
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:41,000
So all your wounds came from those assassins.

458
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,140
 It's only from Yue Ji and Ming Hou.

459
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,400
 The others are just...

460
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,720
I have heard the rumors around the Golden Coffin.

461
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,488
What have you heard?

462
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:57,900
Don't look at me like that.

463
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,732
These rumors have already spread all over the martial arts world.

464
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,360
There are all sorts of rumors.

465
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,160
But in general,

466
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,760
someone is delivering the Golden Coffin from Hanshui Temple to the border.

467
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,540
The coffin contains untold wealth

468
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,632
and powerful martial arts secrets to rule the world.

469
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,380
- Do you believe it? 
 - I didn't at first.

470
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:27,520
But when I learned the First Disciple of Xueyue City, Tang Lian, is escorting the Golden Coffin...

471
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,620
So what?

472
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,044
Actually, in order to circulate this rumor widely,

473
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:41,748
someone has to make an effort.

474
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,300
But assassins like Ming Hou and Yue Ji can't achieve that.

475
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,080
I'm sure you also heard

476
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,596
about what happened to Abbot Wang You of Hanshui Temple several months ago.

477
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,916
I'm 80% sure that what's in the coffin is his body.

478
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,332
But why do so many people want it?

479
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,396
Who exactly are you?

480
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,324
I'm just...

481
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,352
a well-informed innkeeper.

482
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,080
So where are we going exactly?

483
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,872
Straight to Nine Dragon Sect?

484
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,756
Sangu City, Belle Manor.

485
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,140
 Three gazes of the beauty.

486
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,820
 The first gaze makes a city fall.

487
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,580
 The second gaze brings the nation to its knees.

488
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,236
 The third gaze steals the heart.

489
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,720
 To go to Biluo City, we'll definitely pass Sangu City.

490
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,020
 Every year, a large number of merchants pass through.

491
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,140
 Many of which are huge spenders.

492
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,600
 While Belle Manor is the biggest gambling den in the city.

493
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,044

494
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,656
 It's not only a brothel,

495
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,772
 but one of Beili's best...

496
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:56,320
Gambling dens.

497
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,140
What a pity, Lei Wujie is guarding the horse carriage.

498
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,104
Otherwise, we should have brought him here to see more of the world.

499
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,420
Belle Manor is the biggest brothel in Sangu City.

500
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,636
Its patrons are the rich among the rich.

501
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:16,480
They gamble with such astronomical figures that normal chips won't cut it.

502
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,900
So they gamble with boxes of pearls.

503
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,640
Since we're already here. Should we make some bets?

504
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,060
I don't have money.

505
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,176
Really?

506
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,480
We have a coffin made of pure gold.

507
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,780
Shut up!

508
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,660
I'm warning you. Don't even think that thought.

509
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,300
I'm here to find my connection.

510
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,572
So avoid unnecessary attention.

511
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,600
It's Fairy Lady Rui!

512
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,440

513
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,996
Well. Isn't this Lian?

514
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,157
Didn't you say we should avoid unnecessary attention?

515
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,288
But now look, all eyes in Belle Manor are on us.

516
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,700
Rui.

517
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,220
Lian. It's been 16 months

518
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,644
and 7 days since your last visit.

519
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,100
Do you really not miss certain people?

520
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,616
Rui and Lian. 
  (T/N: Rui means the stamen/pistil of a flower, Lian is lotus)

521
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,020
It really does sound like an old couple.

522
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,188
What a handsome young man.

523
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,720
I heard you said you wanted a round.

524
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,880
And tonight, there's a rare game going on at Belle Manor.

525
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,580
Do you want to play together?

526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,900
- I don't have money. 
 - No. You must have a lot of money.

527
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,992
Why are you so sure about that, Miss?

528
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,640
A commoner, when walking into such a huge gambling den would be wide-eyed.

529
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,316
And seeing a beauty like me... would've lost their mind.

530
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:33,960
But you... look so disinterested.

531
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,020
As if the overwhelming beauty and riches here

532
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,700
are nothing but common occurrences to you.

533
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,924
So, tell me, you must be rich right?

534
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,800
Rui. We don't have time for this.

535
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,044
Your connection hasn't arrived yet,

536
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:56,324
but everything is ready.

537
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:57,840
You must be careful.

538
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,000
Many top assassins have come into Sangu City because of that thing.

539
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,456
Some of them can be quite tricky to handle.

540
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,192
Young Master, do you still fancy a game?

541
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,808
I own a mountain villa called Snowfall.

542
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:18,076
It's probably worth 10 boxes of pearls.

543
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,760
Miss, would you be willing to lend me some first?

544
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,260
Easy enough.

545
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,400
This gentleman has reserved the entire Belle Manor tonight.

546
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
If you want to gamble, stay.

547
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,940
If you don't want to gamble, please leave.

548
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,420
You must be joking, Fairy Lady.

549
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,800
Two pearl boxes are enough to reserve all of Belle manor?

550
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,424
This young master looks like a first-timer, so he probably doesn't know the rules here.

551
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:49,668
How could you get confused, Fairy Lady?

552
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:51,300
Confused?

553
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,720
- What mistake did I commit? 
 - All right.

554
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,660
I just wanted to scare you a bit.

555
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,372
As for why?

556
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:28,268
Because I want everyone here to know

557
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:31,980
that the stakes for this round isn't just money.

558
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,576
Could you mean... life and death?

559
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,740
Yes.

560
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,370
 Gambling with your life...

561
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,080
What does she mean by life and death?

562
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,840
I'm sure you can guess from the name.

563
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,904
The loser will not only lose money but their life too.

564
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,856
When did I agree to that?

565
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:55,936
Little girl, I know you're trying to protect your lover.

566
00:41:55,936 --> 00:42:00,860
But you should know that in Sangu's Belle Manor,

567
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,888
this won't be enough.

568
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,420
It's you.

569
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,748
We meet again,

570
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:08,460
Tang Lian.

571
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,296
But she's right.

572
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,960
If you want to play, you stay.

573
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,768
If not,

574
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,708
leave.

575
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,880
- Let's go now.
 - Go, go!

576
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,700
Hand over it now. Now!

577
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,880
Interesting.

578
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,920
These people don't even know what the Golden Coffin contains.

579
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,160
Hand it over!

580
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,780
And they dare meddle in this.

581
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,840
- Hurry up now! 
 - Quick!

582
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,440
So noisy.

583
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:51,970

584
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,520
