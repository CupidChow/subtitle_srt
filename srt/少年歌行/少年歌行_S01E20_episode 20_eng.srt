24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,740
Ye Xiaoying, the Slayer?

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,370
General Ye, what brings you here from Tianqi?

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,820
Brother He, do you think I wanted to visit the Lei Fortress?

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm not willing to be involved with you guys.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,150
However, I think my daughter is with you guys.

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,680
Tell me then. Should I come or not?

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Father?

31
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,960
My daughter, are you hurt?

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,990
That's great to hear.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,440
She's the daughter of Ye Xiaoying?

34
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,490
You... Do you like her?

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,440
Daughter, how's the person you mentioned in Xueyue City doing?

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
Chuhe is seriously wounded. He's being treated right now.

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,780
Today's a crucial day for his survival.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,990
Were you guys pursued all the way?

40
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,270
The information I sent to the General's Residence was leaked. I was too careless.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,910
You don't need to blame yourself.

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,130
Let's go.

43
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,510
Kid, I was just testing you.

44
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,040
After all, you're the son of my old friend.

45
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,560
You didn't disappoint me at all.

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,440
Speaking of which, I even carried you when you were born.

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,110
Greetings, Uncle.

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,170
Good. Let's go.

49
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,840
Ye Xiaoying didn't come here just to see his daughter.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
He's here for the sake of the one lying in there.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Martial Uncle, you mean...

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,050
He brought many men with him.

53
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,230
When he gives the order, they can rush into Lei Fortress and take him away.

54
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,610
We would have no way to stop him.

55
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,020
I can stop him.

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,700
Xiao Se?

57
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,880
Xiao Se!

58
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,210
Until I open the door, no one is allowed to enter

59
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,540
Lei Wujie, are you all right?

60
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm fine.

61
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,470
I just want to see if Xiao Se is all right.

62
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,000
This is the first time Wu Xin is treating me like this.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,990
What exactly is going on in there?

64
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,350
This is what you call last flicker of light.

65
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,790
Even his powers have grown significantly.

66
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,140
This should be the price of taking the Three-Day Pill.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,110
The power in his body will surge within an instant.

68
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,110
With this power, he can remain invincible for an hour.

69
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,040
However, he will be vulnerable after an hour.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,170
We don't have much time now.

71
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,870
We should suppress him first.

72
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,980
Thereafter, we'll clear his hidden pulse and remove his zhenqi.

73
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,740
Afterward, he will never be able to practice martial arts again. He might not even be able to walk properly.

74
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,440
This is the only way to save him.

75
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,830
Never be able to practice martial arts?

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,940
I hope he won't blame me for this.

77
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,540
Forget it.

78
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,170
I once lost all of my powers too. However, I obtained Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist.

79
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,800
Continue.

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,810
Halt!

81
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,580
Move aside.

82
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,200
Are you the young divine healer?

83
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,620
I've seen Tang Lian's Fatal Flying Blossoms. But he's nothing compared to you.

84
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,950
Snow Chickweed? That's an extremely rare herb.

85
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,730
Do you two have any powers?

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Barely.

87
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,140
Not bad, I guess.

88
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,560
I need an absolute answer. Please answer me again.

89
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,670
Top ten in Beili Kingdom.

90
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,470
Top one outside of Beili Kingdom.

91
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,030
Great. I want you guys to assist me in forcing his internal energy into his hidden pulse.

92
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,060
That's what we did before.

93
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,820
But when we suppressed his internal energy, it would bounce back.

94
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,920
This time, I will seal off his hidden pulse.

95
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,780
What you guys need to do is to force his zhenqi back into the hidden pulse.

96
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,100
I still have nine silver needles. That's enough.

97
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,860
All right. Let's try again.

98
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,900
Excuse me. Sir, may I ask you if you are from Sword Heart Tomb?

99
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,160
No. I'm just a passerby.

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I met the lady who was rushing coincidentally. And her horse was out of stamina.

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,340
That's why I sent her here.

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,640
I see. If that's the case, you can be considered our benefactor.

103
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,820
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

104
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,260
Don't mention it.

105
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,660
Marquis, I'm still here. Drop the act, please.

106
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,570
General Ye.

107
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,940
This must be your daughter. She's all grown up. She does resemble her mother.

108
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,000
Greetings, Marquis Lanyue.

109
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,150
The Golden Marquis Lanyue?

110
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,930
Do you know him?

111
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,330
I've only heard of his name before.

112
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,740
He's His Majesty's youngest brother.

113
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,860
General, what are you doing here?

114
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,800
My daughter is disobedient.

115
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,540
Although she's weak, she loves to explore dangerous places.

116
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,220
I had no choice but to catch her myself.

117
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,090
I understand now.

118
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,800
General, you're here to catch your daughter.

119
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,970
However, I don't think you need the mighty Ye Battalion for this.

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,900
Excuse me. Let me interrupt for a second.

121
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,980
I don't understand the conversation

122
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,800
between a marquis and a general like you guys.

123
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,080
Seems like this young man still doesn't know who's lying inside, huh?

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,880
I know who he is. He's my friend, Xiao Se.

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,250
Xiao Se? He's Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,180
 Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe?

127
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,030
This is... This is... Are you referring to the Prince Yong'an who stood up for Prince Langya?

128
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,170
Are you referring to the 17-year-old prodigy who reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven?

129
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,810
S-Senior Sister, they say Xiao Se is Prince Yong'an. What...

130
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,260
 So, that's what Father meant when he told me to protect him.

131
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,560
Xiao Se is Xiao Chuhe.

132
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,860
Xiao Se is Prince Yong'an. Prince Yong'an is Xiao Se?

133
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,870
Senior Sister? Senior Sister?

134
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,000
Xiao Se is Prince Yong'an. Aren't you excited?

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,280
Young man, why are you so excited?

136
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,890
He's a legendary character. Of course, I'm excited.

137
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,540
Senior Sister, hurry and tell Senior Brother about this thrilling news! Go now.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,680
Senior Brother.

139
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,690
Senior Brother, why didn't you come over when you were awake?

140
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,140
Tang Clan was the cause of everything, after all.

141
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,280
As a disciple of the Tang Clan, I truly feel guilty.

142
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,950
Let's forget about that for now. Senior, Xiao Se is actually Xiao Chuhe, the Sixth Prince.

143
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,270
I never expected that to be true.

144
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,340
You knew about it?

145
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,700
It was just my speculation.

146
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,400
And now, a general and even a marquis are here.

147
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,970
Seems like they're going to take him away.

148
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,550
Marquis?

149
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,500
Let's go.

150
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,590
Wu Xin, do you know that Xiao Se is Prince Yong'an?

151
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,660
Why are you frowning at me?

152
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,640
Are you upset because I'm better-looking than you?

153
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,940
You're a dashing young man indeed.

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,430
You do look like one of my old friends.

155
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,100
Do you know my father, Ye Dingzhi?

156
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,610
Ye Dingzhi?

157
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,250
I've heard a lot about him.

158
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,770
However, I've never seen him before.

159
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,440
Wu Xin, how's Xiao Se?

160
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,110
You all got yourself a gem here.

161
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,780
That young lady is truly a divine healer.

162
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,650
She saved Xiao Se's life with just a few needles.

163
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,580
However, she doesn't have a great temper.

164
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,730
You all have to be careful when you talk to her.

165
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,130
That is good.

166
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,510
I'll go and take a look.

167
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,590
I want to visit my nephew too.

168
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,620
My sword will slay those who pass.

169
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,420
I forgot to ask this young man for his identity.

170
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,000
Who are you?

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
Why are you stopping us?

172
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,390
I'm the Azure Dragon, one of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

173
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,360
I guard the East.

174
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,350
Azure Dragon?

175
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,230
Who are you to Li Xinyue?

176
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,450
My father is Lei Mengsha, my mother is Li Xinyue, and my sister is Li Hanyi.

177
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,990
I see.

178
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,710
Lei Wujie, they just want to check on Xiao Se's injury.

179
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,750
- If there's anything, when Xiao Se awakes... 
 - Miss Ruoyi,

180
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,530
pardon me, but I cannot do so.

181
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,970
Good Nephew, you're the son of my superior.

182
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,250
Naturally, I will protect you from any harm.

183
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,630
However, the person inside has a unique identity.

184
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,180
I have to take him with me.

185
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,600
Ye Xiaoying, are you trying to defy His Majesty's decree?

186
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,500
His Majesty's decree?

187
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,540
If that's the case, Marquis, I assume you have His Majesty's decree with you.

188
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,810
Please let me read it then.

189
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,850
Ye Xiaoying! How dare you!

190
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,170
People call me the Slayer!

191
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,270
Do you think I'm timid?

192
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,100
Senior Broter.

193
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,700
- Who might you be? 
 - I'm the Black Tortoise.

194
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,020
One of Tianqi's Four Guardians. I guard the North.

195
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,470
You're a disciple of Tang Lianyue?

196
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,250
I'm a disciple of Tang Lianyue and Baili Dongjun of Xueyue City, Tang Lian.

197
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,790
Greetings, Marquis Lanyue.

198
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,500
And you, Miss? Which guardian are you then?

199
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,080
Must I be one of the guardians?

200
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,920
If it concerns Xiao Se, it is reason enough for me to be here.

201
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,240
Are you the daughter of the Spear Deity?

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,870
I'm the Vermilion Bird, one of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

203
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,540
I guard the South.

204
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,370
If so, you can count me in.

205
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,090
You all stood in front of me that day.

206
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,680
Today, it's my turn to protect you guys.

207
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,180
That's great.

208
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,330
That's brave of you.

209
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,600
It's been years since I witnessed this.

210
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,740
I have to take the person inside with me, as it's my task.

211
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,010
Stop.

212
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,500
You all want to take away my patient when he hasn't recovered yet?

213
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,960
Fine. You all can go ahead.

214
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,650
You can go for it.

215
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,740
Do you believe that he'll die within three days on the road?

216
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,030
That's easy handle. I just need to bring you along.

217
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,450
That's pointless. I can't cure him.

218
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,900
What?

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
Divine Healer, please be more specific.

220
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,250
Just now, you've suppressed his injury.

221
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,000
Did something else happen?

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
Xiao Se's condition has stabilized.

223
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,270
However, that's the only thing I can do.

224
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,030
If so, how can we make sure he recovers completely?

225
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,840
The celestial mountain called Penglai Island, the reclusive deities,

226
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,680
and the Soul-Amending Skill.

227
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,270
Mr. Xie, I'm afraid these are just nonsense written in books.

228
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,090
Even if Penglai Island does exist, no one has been there before.

229
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,950
Chuhe can only stay alive if he returns to Tianqi with me.

230
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,610
Even my master can't treat his condition.

231
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,500
No one else can treat him.

232
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,330
The State Preceptor, Qi Tianchen.

233
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,590
Qi Tianchen might be able to do it.

234
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,850
But judging from Xiao Se's current condition,

235
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,760
stepping into Tianqi doesn't seem like a wise choice.

236
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,200
What do you mean by that?

237
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
Could it be that you want him to die here?

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,810
No one else in Tianqi can harm him when I'm here.

239
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,180
If that person could harm him back then, he can harm him this time, too.

240
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,800
The celestial mountain isn't just a myth.

241
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,830
Someone has been there before.

242
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,190
Who is it?

243
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,660
Baili Dongjun.

244
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,020
My master has been to the celestial mountain before?

245
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,900
He has.

246
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,140
He lost all of his powers after his second visit to the island.

247
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,630
But after his return, he fought Ye Dingzhi and repelled the Demon Sect.

248
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,950
Even if you're right, judging from his condition,

249
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,160
tell me how long he can last.

250
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,890
I'm going.

251
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,700
Xiao Se.

252
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,840
Why are you pretending to be tough?

253
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,630
Look at your current state.

254
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,480
Maybe you'll be dead before leaving the sea.

255
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,430
Royal Uncle, I want my hidden pulse to be cured.

256
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,370
What's the point in treating your hidden pulse but losing your life?

257
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,940
The State Preceptor cannot treat your hidden pulse.

258
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,620
However, he can make sure you have nothing to worry about for the rest of your life.

259
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,140
What happens after that?

260
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,330
Do I have to spend my entire life like a good-for-nothing?

261
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,260
I need to give it a try as long as there's a sliver of hope.

262
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,310
No one can stop me.

263
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,850
All right.

264
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,310
Since you've said so, I will keep you company.

265
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,580
We're just heading to an island, right?

266
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,950
If we depart from Dongji, we can reach Sanshe Island within half a month.

267
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,540
Uncle.

268
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,790
Yes?

269
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,420
General Ye.

270
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,080
Your Highness, do you have any instructions?

271
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,390
Please return to Tianqi now.

272
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,850
I came here under your royal father's order.

273
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,810
I have to bring you back.

274
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,320
If not, I cannot face His Majesty.

275
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,710
Royal Uncle, please look at my hand.

276
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,320
What do you mean by that?

277
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,690
I've slain countless enemies with my hands.

278
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,910
I've even pointed fingers at the Emperor himself.

279
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,270
But now, I don't even have the strength to grab a stick.

280
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,810
Royal Uncle, do you think the Xiao Chuhe you know will spend the rest of his life like this?

281
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,630
Chuhe, I wish to help you too.

282
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,700
- But I... 
 - One year.

283
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,930
After one year, at this time,

284
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,150
no matter if I've recovered or not,

285
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,710
no matter if I'm alive or not,

286
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,730
I will be in Xueyue City, waiting for you all.

287
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,810
No matter who it is, I will surely return with you.

288
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,890
Fine.

289
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,980
If it were someone else, I'd never compromise.

290
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,820
But I'm sure you will keep your word.

291
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,820
See you in Xueyue City after one year.

292
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,040
I will surely keep my promise.

293
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,240
Xiao Se?

294
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,610
That's a great name.

295
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,090
But I expect you to appear as Xiao Chuhe.

296
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,690
Chuhe, on that day, I will lead your father's 1,000 Tiger Soldiers

297
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,530
and raise the golden divine bird flag of the Xiao family.

298
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,050
We will call your name in Xueyue City.

299
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,930
Remember.

300
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,260
You're the Sixth Prince of the Xiao family and Prince Yong'an of Beili.

301
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,190
Tianqi will always be your home.

302
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,200
Your Highness, we'll wait for your return.

303
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,870
Take care, General Ye.

304
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
Ruoyi.

305
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,840
Since Third City Lord couldn't cure you even after so long,

306
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,800
I think we should seek help from the State Preceptor.

307
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,170
Let's go.

308
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,200
Ruoyi.

309
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,430
Be a good girl.

310
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,270
Ruo...

311
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,280
I think you stand a chance.

312
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,930
- Really? 
 - Really.

313
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,960
She looked at two people when she was leaving.

314
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,460
She looked at Xiao Se because they were old acquaintances.

315
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,430
The other person was you. You're her new friend.

316
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,100
You're a monk.

317
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,200
What do you know?

318
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,210
By the way, do you want to join us?

319
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,150
It's been so long since we traveled together.

320
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,610
My identity is special.

321
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,220
If I join you, people might think that I'm up to no good.

322
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm afraid we'll be stopped before we can depart from land even though I'm kind and just.

323
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,820
Kind and just?

324
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,060
I couldn't tell.

325
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,370
You're right. Of course you can't tell.

326
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,300
That's why you can't tell when people are interested in you.

327
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,250
All right. I'll go now.

328
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,100
We made a promise that we'd view the peak of Mount Kunlun,

329
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,460
the edge of the sea, and the edge of the world.

330
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,910
You must return safely.

331
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,070
You came back this time to settle some old scores, right?

332
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,270
No. I came here to check on you.

333
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,980
What a nonsense.

334
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,690
I could say the same.

335
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm leaving now.

336
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,970
I look forward to the day we meet again.

337
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,920
Why does he do that all the time?

338
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,420
He comes and goes whenever he feels like it.

339
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,050
Lei Wujie, protect him on the way to the celestial mountain.

340
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,640
Why did you only tell Lei Wujie that?

341
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,550
What about me?

342
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,490
How could you omit me from the Four Guardians of Tianqi?

343
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,910
Four Guardians of Tianqi?

344
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,480
They are just titles imposed by others onto you.

345
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,440
Just forget about me.

346
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,410
Do you think I'm doing this because of that title?

347
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,270
I just said it to make myself cooler.

348
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,880
I was trying to scare them away.

349
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,010
I'm helping you out because we're friends.

350
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,350
What kind of friends?

351
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,010
Naturally, we're friends who have gone through thick and thin together.

352
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,660
Xiao Se, you don't need to reject them.

353
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,330
Since you wish to return to your old self, you should accept our assistance.

354
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,310
Prince Xiao, are you done?

355
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,620
If so, we should continue our treatment.

356
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,210
You shouldn't talk too much when you're about to die.

357
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,810
 Zhao Yuzhen is dead. Li Hanyi went berserk.

358
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,020
After that, a huge fight erupted in Lei Fortress.

359
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,580
Lei Qianhu of the Lei Clan was murdered by Dark River.

360
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,310
Old Master Tang of the Tang Clan was murdered by Xiao Chuhe.

361
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,120
Lei Yunhe has made a comeback, and the Two Heroes of the Lei Clan have resurfaced.

362
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,300
That's all.

363
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,810
Has Chuhe got his power back?

364
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,480
It wasn't stated in the letter.

365
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,080
Even if he did get his power back, he wouldn't be able to kill Old Master Tang.

366
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,910
Judging by his personality,

367
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,300
he will never commit an act that will incite the hatred of the entire Tang Clan.

368
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,180
There's more to this than meets the eye.

369
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,030
- Investigate it thoroughly. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,390
Initially, I just wanted Old Master Tang to let Tang Ze show his skills during the heroes' gathering

371
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,830
so that we could suppress the Lei Fortress.

372
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:38,620
But the involvement of Dark River has landed us in an irredeemable situation.

373
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,070
This is good too.

374
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,940
Now, the Tang Clan and the Lei Clan are hostile to one another.

375
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,860
They turned against each other. It's a huge blow to Xueyue City.

376
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,450
What about that person?

377
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,380
We have no news of him yet.

378
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,060
Rage Sword Deity will come soon.

379
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,940
I believe he will have an answer.

380
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:02,080
But I keep feeling that there's a mastermind behind everything.

381
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,610
When I look at it,

382
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,590
it may seem like a waste now that Old Master Tang is dead,

383
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,410
but turning the Tang Clan against the Lei Clan has reduced Xueyue City's power.

384
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,440
This is a great deal for Xiao Chong, who has bet everything on Wushuang City.

385
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,360
Indeed. If two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.

386
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,950
Just let them fight.

387
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,840
If both of them perish, the whole world will be mine.

388
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,370
But this time, I've overestimated Xiao Chong.

389
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,890
He made a cowardly decision.

390
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,800
Rumor has it that Xiao Chuhe is only alive, all thanks to Ye Anshi.

391
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,390
I made one wrong move.

392
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,100
I thought Ye Dingzhi's child would be as ambitious as I am.

393
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,700
What shall we do next?

394
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,180
He should be returning to Tianqi City too.

395
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,780
We have to prepare ourselves before he arrives.

396
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,920
 Qianluo, listen to me.

397
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,640
No, I won't.

398
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,770
You are tricking me.

399
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,240
Too many things had happened here.

400
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,580
We cannot write all of them down in a letter.

401
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,870
Someone needs to return to Xueyue City and notify Third Master.

402
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,140
Senior Brother, you should go then.

403
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,570
Qianluo.

404
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,310
I'll be fine with Lei Wujie and Tang Lian by my side.

405
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,920
Report back to Xueyue City.

406
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,410
You can meet with us at the municipal hall in Dongji Harbor City by then.

407
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,940
We need to recuperate at Lei Fortress for several days anyway.

408
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,570
The timing will be just right.

409
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,060
Are you sure you're not deceiving me?

410
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,870
Marquis Lanyue said Xiao Chuhe is a man of his word.

411
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,910
Even he believes in him. Why don't you believe in him?

412
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,080
All right. I believe in you.

413
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,270
I won't waste any time. I'll depart right now.

414
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,870
Are you sure you want to bring Qianluo along?

415
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,480
I deceived her.

416
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,130
But you said you are a man of your word.

417
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,870
You should listen closely.

418
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,820
I said Xiao Chuhe is a man of his word.

419
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm Xiao Se. It has nothing to do with me.

420
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,200
You're a liar indeed.

421
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,040
I've asked you so many times if you were the person I was waiting for.

422
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,170
But you said no.

423
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,980
I don't know if you're the successor of the Black Tortoise Token.

424
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,110
But you know everything.

425
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,270
Do you think it's difficult for you?

426
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,110
Although I had no choice, Old Master Tang did die in front of me

427
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,490
and everyone there saw it.

428
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,540
Right now, the entire Tang Clan sees me as their sworn enemy.

429
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,360
Yet, as the eldest disciple of the Tang Clan, you swore to protect me.

430
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,475

431
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,040
It's because I uphold my principles.

432
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,920
I told you long ago. You shouldn't be too hard on yourself.

433
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,980
To be honest, I didn't kill Old Master Tang.

434
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,040
What?

435
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,970
With the internal force I had back then, I could never kill him even under their pressure.

436
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,070
I speculate that Su Changhe launched a sneak attack.

437
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,250
He's the true killer.

438
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,080
However, the Tang Clan will never believe in that.

439
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,690
I believe in you.

440
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,430
- You believe in me? 
 - Xiao Se!

441
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,360
Why do you shout my name every day?

442
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,610
What else should I call you then?

443
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,670
Should I call you Xiao Chuhe, Prince Yong'an?

444
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,480
Or should I call you Sixth Prince, Your Highness?

445
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,250
Are you itching for a beating?

446
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,600
I was just kidding.

447
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,720
It doesn't matter if you're Xiao Chuhe, Prince Yong'an, or Sixth Prince.

448
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,470
I only know that you're Xiao Se.

449
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,770
You're my best friend.

450
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,220
That's why you should let me show you around

451
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,280
since it's your first time coming to Lei Fortress.

452
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,000
You've grown up.

453
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,370
Sure.

454
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,420
Master, I've returned.

455
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,350
Junior Brother Wu Xin?

456
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,230
Why have you returned?

457
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,720
It's because you said before that Hanshui Temple would always be my home.

458
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,530
You said that I could come back anytime.

459
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,530
All monks in Hanshui Temple have left.

460
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,700
I'm the only person left.

461
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
Wu Xin, it would be great if you could come back.

462
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,970
It's a shame that I'm only staying here for a few days.

463
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,760
I can't stay here for long.

464
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,630
Senior Brother, I have a favor to ask of you.

465
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,050
His irises are scattered and dispersed.

466
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,480
Obviously, he has lost his mind.

467
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,100
Don't worry. I can save him.

468
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,970
Ming Hou, you shall stay here in the future.

469
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,990
You'll learn the Purification Chants from him.

470
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,270
"Learn it to repel demons and the inner demon."

471
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,720
Although Master said that before, it might take a long time.

472
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,830
That's fine. Ming Hou can stay here.

473
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,730
I need to look for someone.

474
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,510
Rumor has it that she was one of the people who caused my father's death.

475
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,630
Wu Xin, do you still harbor hatred against them?

476
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,200
When Baili Dongjun sparred with my father, he barely won.

477
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,750
My father managed to survive, even though he was seriously wounded.

478
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,370
In the end, he was intercepted and killed in Jiangnan.

479
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,580
Rumor has it that the leader of those who killed him was Li Hanyi.

480
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,720
I'm just curious as to what happened that day.

481
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,040
So, you'll head to Xueyue City and look for Li Hanyi?

482
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,930
No.

483
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,070
Li Hanyi showed herself at Lei Fortress that day.

484
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,060
She was harmed by Dark River's Leader.

485
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,080
Now, she has gone berserk.

486
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,120
Therefore, I need to look for her.

487
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,390
Even Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity, was harmed by Dark River.

488
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,830
Is the martial arts world going to facing a major change?

489
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,490
The entire Beili Kingdom will experience a major change.

490
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,350
Marquis, you rushed back to Tianqi.

491
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,260
However, you came to me instead of heading to the palace.

492
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,870
Have you encountered a difficult issue?

493
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,400
I heard from people that there's a celestial mountain on Penglai Island, right outside of Sanshe Island.

494
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,420
There's a deity on the island.

495
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,910
He can ride the wind, co-exist with Heaven and Earth,

496
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,000
and live as long as the sun and the moon.

497
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,300
State Preceptor, have you heard about him before?

498
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,310
Baili Dongjun mentioned his experience on the island to me before.

499
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,470
But I advised him not to return to that island.

500
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,890
But why?

501
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,830
This book records all kinds of peculiar things.

502
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,050
According to the books, there are three levels of power and five levels of celestial hood.

503
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,290
The five levels are Sky Deity, Divine Deity,

504
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,610
Earth Deity, Human Deity, and Ghost Deity.

505
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,470
State Preceptor, I know you're powerful.

506
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,910
But I'm not a cultivator.

507
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,270
I don't understand what you're saying.

508
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,160
Calm down.

509
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,490
Out of the five levels, there are certain skills that match your previous description.

510
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,690
There are all kinds of mystical skills in the world.

511
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,310
As long as you're sincere in cultivating your skills, you'll achieve immortality.

512
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:09,130
The deity you mentioned on Penglai Island might be the Earth Deity who really exists.

513
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,470
Could it be that deities truly exist?

514
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,140
Master, His Majesty is waiting in the side hall.

515
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,740
My brother is quite anxious.

516
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,370
- Greetings, Your Majesty. 
 - Greetings, Your Majesty.

517
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,440
Spare the formalities.

518
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,990
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

519
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:42,900
Lanyue. Why didn't you come to see me in Pingqing Palace after your return?

520
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,550
Why did you head to the Directorate of Astronomy?

521
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,290
I had some doubts,

522
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,230
and I wanted State Preceptor to resolve them for me before I came to see you, Royal Brother.

523
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,580
If so, has State Preceptor resolved your doubts?

524
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,630
State Preceptor is on another level.

525
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,710
It's as if he has answered my question and hasn't at the same time.

526
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:10,310
Lanyue, you just need to tell me

527
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,560
whether you met Chuhe or not.

528
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,440
I did meet him.

529
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,230
Why didn't you bring him back?

530
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,700
I wanted to bring him back too.

531
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,000
It's just that there were several people protecting him.

532
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,640
Who has such the audacity to hinder you?

533
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,360
The son of General Lei Mengsha.

534
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,570
There's another person called Tang Lian as well.

535
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,410
He's Tang Lianyue's only disciple.

536
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,190
Later he moved to Xueyue City.

537
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,270
He's also the disciple of Baili Dongjun.

538
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,960
Lei Fortress, Tang Clan, and Xueyue City.

539
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,790
Do they still intend to interfere with our family affairs?

540
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,290
Royal Brother, it's not just them.

541
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,370
Chuhe doesn't wish to return yet.

542
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,440
Does he still resent me?

543
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,850
No, it is not like that.

544
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,030
Actually, he's willing to return.

545
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,080
Chuhe's skills and power were stripped by someone when he left Tianqi.

546
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,570
And he sustained serious injuries in Lei Fortress when he fought against the assassins of Dark River.

547
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,370
Luckily, he was saved by the successor of the Medicine King. That's how he was able to survive.

548
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,310
But for him to be cured completely, he has to head to a celestial island.

549
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:41,450
Rumor has it that a deity over there can cure his meridians.

550
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,850
Although it's a perilous trip, Chuhe still wants to head there personally.

551
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,910
I thought he was still angry at me.

552
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,960
I never expected him to have gone through this.

553
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,560
It's no wonder you looked for State Preceptor.

554
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,850
It's related to celestial hood.

555
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,940
Your Majesty,

556
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,510
I've only heard about the deity on Penglai Island without seeing him for myself.

557
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:23,400
State Preceptor, can you cure Chuhe's condition?

558
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,530
I can at least make sure he survives.

559
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,030
Good. Since State Preceptor has said that,

560
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,810
I... can rest at ease now.

561
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:46,840
Lanyue, can you stop them if you rush from Tianqi to Dongji?

562
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,590
Royal Brother, but I've already given Chuhe my promise.

563
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,740
You dare to make your own decisions right now, huh?

564
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,610
I dare not do so.

565
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,660
Your Majesty.

566
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,330
Eunuch Jinwei can complete the task for you.

567
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,100
He's on his way to Dongji right now.

568
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,850

569
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,530
Hurry up!

570
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,770
Let's return together later. Lend me a hand.

571
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,550
We caught a lot today. Leave them here. Slowly.

572
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,340
Look.

573
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,820
Aren't we by the sea now?

574
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,460
Why can't I find the sea anywhere?

575
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,180
Young Master, the sea is in the east while we're in the west.

576
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,030
Of course you won't find it.

577
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,870
Thanks.

578
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,680
The east?

579
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,570
Why can't I tell directions no matter where I go?

580
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,750
It's getting late. Young Master, why do you wish to head to the sea?

581
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm heading there to buy some food.

582
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,150
The market over there closes in the afternoon.

583
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,450
You won't get to buy anything.

584
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,170
If so, where can I buy some food?

585
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,910
I want something fresh and cheap.

586
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,300
You should head to the fish market. It operates until a later hour.

587
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
The fish market?

588
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,030
Although my shells aren't valuable, I can exchange them for a few copper coins.

589
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,550
If so, can you bring me to the fish market?

590
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,840
Sure. Let's go.

591
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,510
Let's go.

592
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,310
By the way, Young Master, what's your name?

593
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,300
I'm Lei Wujie. Miss, what about you?

594
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm Zhenzhu.

595
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,780
Miss Zhenzhu, did you grow up here?

596
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,660
That's right.

597
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,980
Have you been to the sea before?

598
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,440
Everyone here has been to the sea before.

599
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,970
I'm heading to Sanshe Island.

600
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,430
Can the boats here fetch me to Sanshe Island?

601
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,670
Sanshe Island? 
  (T/N: three snakes)

602
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,820
A normal fisherman's boat cannot reach the island.

603
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,110
Why do you want to head there? To catch snakes?

604
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,300
I wish to check it out.

605
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,830
After all, that place is rumored to be the edge of the sea.

606
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,470
A huge ship just docked at our port recently.

607
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,370
Look. There is a huge flag on the ship.

608
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,020
It's a phoenix experiencing a rebirth.

609
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,080
They said it's called Cedar Longship.

610
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,280
My father said that Cedar Longship is the largest and fastest ship in Beili.

611
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,230
I think only the Cedar Longship can head toward the edge of the sea.

612
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,110
Why don't you check it out tomorrow?

613
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,530
I see.

614
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,330
- Senior Brother.
- I know what you're trying to say.

615
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,790
I'm hungry too. This brat is so unreliable.

616
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,840
It's been four hours, and he hasn't returned yet.

617
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,200
I wonder where he went.

618
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,010
Could it be that he's in trouble?

619
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,990
That won't happen.

620
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,100
I assume that brat is lost.

621
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,510
Senior Brother, Xiao Se, let's have some crabs.

622
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,860
You're finally back.

623
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,880
You brat. Why took you so long to buy some food?

624
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,710
It's a long story.

625
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,310
I went to their famous seafood market.

626
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,710
They sell tortoises this huge and green groupers this long.

627
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,570
If the tortoises are this huge and the green groupers are this long,

628
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,390
why did you only buy us crabs?

629
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,700
It's because they are cheap.

630
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,260
Look, it's a huge plate. I'm not lying here. It only costs ten copper coins.

631
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,250
Brother Lei isn't wrong. We need to ride a boat to get to the sea.

632
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,740
And we don't know how much we need to spend on it. Don't be angry.

633
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,870
What a joke. I'm the owner of Snowfall Mountain Villa.

634
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,090
I once won a city in Qianjin Gambling House.

635
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,630
Do you think I can't afford a boat ride? I can even buy you a boat.

636
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,350
Yes, you are right. Young Master Xiao is the wealthiest and mightiest.

637
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,780
So, Young Master Xiao, I assume you're not having these crabs, right?

638
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,280
Hands off.

639
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,650
Let's dig in then.

640
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,830
Where did you get these stupid shells?

641
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,740
Well, I bought them from a female local fisher.

642
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,210
I bought the shells from her, and she helped me find a boat.

643
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,060
Have you inquired about the boat for us?

644
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,880
Of course.

645
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,580
However, the boats here cannot travel that far.

646
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
The authorities don't allow them to do so, either.

647
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,490
However, there's a ship called Cedar Longship.

648
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,720
It can go to the furthest part of the sea.

649
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,700
Cedar longship?

650
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,280
There's even a dashing flag on the ship.

651
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,740
It depicts a phoenix experiencing a rebirth.

652
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,920
That's the Flying Phoenix. It's the symbol of the Mu family in Qingzhou.

653
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,850
The Mu family in Qingzhou?

654
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,980
Qingzhou is just a category.

655
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,320
The correct term should be the Nine Cities of Qingzhou.

656
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
They're business-based cities.

657
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,000
They occupy 80% of Beili's business industry.

658
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,240
It's also the largest economic center in Beili.

659
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,070
It represents the wealth of Tianqi.

660
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,150
If that's the case, the Nine Cities of Qingzhou is like your family's treasure vault.

661
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:56,630
You can put it that way. The Mu family is known as the richest family in the Nine Cities of Qingzhou.

662
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:15,060
