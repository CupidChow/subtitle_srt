00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:15,990

2
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,110
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,950
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,230
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,260
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,390
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,330
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,460
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,580
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,780
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,960
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,280
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,780
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,360
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,410
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,430
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,480
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,580
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,560
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,110
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,830
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,070

24
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,180

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,740
The Beauty of Four Seasons is indeed elegant.

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Over the twenty-four bridges, the bright moon glows,

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,100
no one knows where the dashing man is teaching the fair ladies how to play the flute.

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,440
The fan and flute carried by this man have a long history.

29
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,980
They're the treasures of Jiangnan's Duan family.

30
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,340
It should be the Young Master of the Duan family.

31
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,260
That's right.

32
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,400
He's the Young Master of the Duan family, Duan Xuanyi.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,660
His younger brother, Duan Xuanheng, entered Xueyue City to learn martial arts two years ago.

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,260
This time, I'm guessing he followed his brother here to join the Flora Spectacle.

35
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,500
It looks like the Duan family has high hopes for this Young Master.

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,720
He's young.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,160
But they've already passed on the fan and flute to him.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,140
His marital arts aren't bad.

39
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,500
He inherited the elegance of the Duan family.

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,320
There are many ladies who have fallen for him.

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,260
Elegance?

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,240
I think he's a womanizer.

43
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,820
Brother Xie.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,900
Brother Xie.

45
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,760
How do you feel about seeing him again after so many years?

46
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,320
He seems to have changed a lot.

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,120
A person fell into the abyss from such a high place.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,980
How could he not change?

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,700
But some people will never change no matter what

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,220
or how many years he's been through.

51
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,160
What kind of people are you talking about?

52
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,580
For example,

53
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,000
when I first met him,

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I thought that he was someone like this.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,060
By the way, Changfeng, why didn't I see your daughter?

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,100
Don't even get me started.

57
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,960
That brat is only interested in martial arts.

58
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,700
Let's not talk about her.

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,500
Brother Xie, are you satisfied with your trip to the Flora Spectacle?

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,120
It's indeed a rare grand view.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,560
Unfortunately, there's no beauty in this beautiful view.

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,440
What a shame.

63
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,480
There are many scholars, and the walls are filled with poems.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,900
Without beauties, the brew has become bland in taste.

65
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,640
Many descendants of noble families have gathered here today.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,720
Is there no one that captivates your sight?

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,160
There are very few people in the world who can qualify as beauties.

68
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,540
Xueyue City is huge,

69
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,540
but I only met two beauties before.

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,880
The first one loved gambling.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,740
The second one was bad-tempered.

72
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,460
Besides, they won't come to the Flora Spectacle.

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,220
Brother Xie, you should say this in front of them.

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,060
I dare not do it.

75
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,000
Why isn't Airhead here yet?

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
I didn't expect you to be concerned about his marriage.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,380
I'm also concerned about your marriage, Eldest Brother.

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,560
I wonder if the Fairy Rui has written to you lately?

79
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,180
Xuanheng, is that lady your martial sister?

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,640
I don't think I've seen her before.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I guess she's a disciple from a noble family who comes to join the fun.

82
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,200
When a beauty is crossed, the city may be turned upside down.

83
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,180
It's her?

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,240
You know her master as well. Qi Tianchen.

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Supervisor of Astronomy?

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,200
She is Ye Xiaoying's daughter.

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,720
You should've met each other before.

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,240
So it's her.

89
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,300
I'll go talk to her on your behalf.

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,260
Eldest Brother, you missed it.

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,000
Not a word.

92
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,140
The Invisible Water Technique of the Jiangnan's Duan family looks powerful.

93
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,420
Don't look at them.

94
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,260
Pretend that we didn't do it.

95
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,480
I wasn't the one who did it anyway.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,060
I think your first disciple has underestimated them.

97
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,880
This first disciple of ours used always have such a resentful look.

98
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,260
He went on a trip for several months awhile ago

99
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,820
and after he got back seems more human now.

100
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,640
It's only been a few days, and he's learned to fight over a girl?

101
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,020
Who are they?

102
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,640
One is the eldest martial brother, Tang Lian.

103
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,700
The other one is the new disciple of Third Master, Xiao Se.

104
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,040
Tang Lian?

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,400
I've heard of this name a long time ago.

106
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,840
Brother, don't do anything rash.

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,800
It's worth a fight if he's strong.

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,140
Hey, Senior Brother Tang Lian!

109
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,080
They say the Tang Clan has a secret weapon called Fairy Scattering Flowers.

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,240
I wonder if it's like this.

111
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,760
Do not attack my eldest senior brother!

112
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
Seriously.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,720
Whatever the master is like, the disciple's the same.

114
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,660
His appearance will ruin my Flora Spectacle!

115
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,240
Lei Wujie, stop!

116
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,360
Jiangnan's Duan family is no match to the Tang Clan or Lei Fortress.

117
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,560
But it's still considered a distinguished family.

118
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,620
It'll be bad if their eldest son dies here.

119
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,260
Whoever it is, they can't die in Xueyue City.

120
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,200
I can't control this sword's qi.

121
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,540
♫   Accompanying each other to the ends of the world  ♫

122
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,720
♫   With you by my side  ♫

123
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,580
♫   Making my magnificent youth worthwhile  ♫

124
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,200
♫   The sunset making your face glow  ♫

125
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,480
You've got a good sword.

126
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
Follow me.

127
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,920
♫   Hidden within is your tenacious faith  ♫

128
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
♫   A hero never sighs easily  ♫

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,460
♫   Only using this life to throw this fleeting moment in disarray  ♫

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,700
♫   So full of passion  ♫

133
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,660

134
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,480
♫   The flowers bloom and fall like rain  ♫

135
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
This is real elegance.

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,520
This is... the Ruoyi Sword Dance?

137
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,840
General Ye created this dance on the battlefield.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,300
This sword dance is divided into two parts.

139
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
The first part is the Cloud Gate.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,660
It's like moving clouds and flowing water, wandering in a court yard.

141
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,380
The second part is the Killing Array.

142
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,880
The killing intent permeates the area.

143
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,100
You can even sense it from afar.

144
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm guessing this must be Cloud Gate.

145
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,360
But there's no background music,

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,520
it's a shame.

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,160
What zither skills.

148
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Indeed.

149
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,620
Brother Sikong, I think I've found an answer.

150
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,840
I'll give you what you want.

151
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,200
Really?

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,900
Lend me your flute.

153
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,420
Scholar Sword Deity.

154
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,060
Xie Xuan?

155
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,060
Don't mind me.

156
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,980
It's a pleasure being able to watch the real Ruoyi Sword Dance once in my life.

157
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,500
 I wish to travel north with the wind,

158
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,260
 watch the snow sweeping across the land.

159
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,660
 I wish to travel east with the ship,

160
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,280
 seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.

161
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,000
 I wish to travel far with the clouds,

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,100
 even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

163
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,260
 I will bathe in sunlight on the top of Mount Kunlun.

164
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,820
I will witness lush mountains rise at the edge of the ocean.

165
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,160
 We shall reunite after a long journey.

166
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,500
But I won't go home unless I've seen the world.

167
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,960
 - Look over there. It's so pretty. 
 - It is!

168
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,540
 It's gorgeous.

169
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
What a coincidence.

170
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,660
We meet again.

171
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,960
Although I don't know what happened between them,

172
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,660
but isn't this a bad opening line?

173
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,420
It's infuriatingly bad.

174
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,400
Yes. We meet again.

175
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,200
A beauty is unforgettable.

176
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,020
One day apart makes one long for her.

177
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,040
An old friend is coming over.

178
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,740
Brother Xie, what are you waiting for?

179
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,960
Being able to meet the young disciples of Xueyue City,

180
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,560
it seems the reputation as top martial arts city is true.

181
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,440
I guess this is it.

182
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,560
I'll gift you several books.

183
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,400
This is for you.

184
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
This is...

185
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,740
The Ruoyi Sword Dance is a good dance, but it's filled with a sense of hostility.

186
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,000
You're in poor health, you can't do the dance too often.

187
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
This dance is astonishing.

188
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,340
It's like a swan soaring in the sky during the dance.

189
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,140
It's more gentle and has less hostility.

190
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,640
Thank you, Sir.

191
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,740
This is for you.

192
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,520
Senior, what is this?

193
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,960
Late Snow.

194
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
This is the work of Xie Feixuan, a gifted female scholar from Jiangnan.

195
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,560
It's very touching.

196
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,980
Rumor has it that even the concubines in the Imperial Harem cried while reading it.

197
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,560
Learn more from the main character.

198
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,520
When you meet her next time, don't say something so awkward.

199
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,580
I often listen to your master complaining,

200
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,900
he said he took in a prudish disciple.

201
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,000
However, when I heard you singing poems just now,

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,080
you've got the style of your master when he was young.

203
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,020
This book is for you.

204
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,680
When your master was young, he liked to read it too.

205
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,780
I've only learned martial arts from my master.

206
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,320
I didn't learn how to make alcohol from him.

207
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,180
You should savor its taste yourself.

208
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,800
Thank you, Sir.

209
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,860
I'm guessing you don't want me to call you by that name.

210
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,460
But after all, you and I are acquaintances.

211
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,960
Sir Xie Xuan.

212
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,880
Seeing your laid-back appearance,

213
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,500
I almost forgot that unrestrained young man from the classroom.

214
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,820
Appearances can be deceiving.

215
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,860
But zither music can't.

216
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,120
I can sense your spirit in your zither music.

217
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm relieved.

218
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,280
I don't understand what you mean, Sir.

219
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,400
You don't have to.

220
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm just happy that I'm not wrong about you.

221
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,880
This book is for you.

222
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,320
I wrote it myself.

223
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,360
But I haven't named it.

224
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
If you come up with a better name after reading it,

225
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,200
you can write it down on it.

226
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,680
Brother Changfeng, some people will never change in this lifetime.

227
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,700
Many thanks, Brother Xie.

228
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,940
All right, I'll get going now.

229
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,720
I just got here and you're leaving already?

230
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,660
Are you really that scared of me?

231
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,600
We might as well not see each other!

232
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
 We don't have to meet in person!

233
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 It's all in the heart!

234
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,440
Dead scholar.

235
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
 Fierce woman!

236
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,160
Master. Good evening.

237
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,200
When I was on Mount Cang just now,

238
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,960
I suddenly saw a sword qi over here.

239
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,780
The sword technique...

240
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,280
wasn't bad.

241
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,780
Master, you're complimenting me?

242
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,100
Having said that, who allowed you to go down the mountain?

243
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,780
Master, how come you never join the Flora Spectacle?

244
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,340
No matter how beautiful the flowers are, you'll get tired after seeing them for over ten years.

245
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,060
What's there to see?

246
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,680
Oh right, was that person Xie Xuan who got the title of Sword Deity by reading books?

247
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,100
He's just like the rumors, elegant and domineering.

248
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
Damn scholar.

249
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,660
He even gave me a book called... Late Snow.

250
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,300
But the books he gave the others are all quite special.

251
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,720
I heard that the book he gave me can be bought from Rustling Bamboo Book Pavilion.

252
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,200
Do you like the girl called Ye Ruoyi?

253
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,360
Why?

254
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,260
Because...

255
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,380
she's pretty.

256
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,640
Is that all?

257
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,500
I don't seem to have other reasons for it.

258
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,440
You're quite honest.

259
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,840
Master, I said she looks pretty but isn't it because I like all the pretty ladies in the world.

260
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,580
It's just that I felt a bit weird the moment I saw her.

261
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,020
But come to think of it, I don't really know about her past or her personality.

262
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,200
I don't even know what she likes or hates.

263
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,460
After much thought, maybe it's love at first sight.

264
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,100
Or maybe it's because...

265
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,020
She looks pretty.

266
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,300
But good-looking people... all like to cheat others.

267
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,860
Master, does this mean that you've been hurt by good-looking people?

268
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,360
 Master said good-looking people will always cheat others.

269
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,980
 It's indeed true.

270
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,080
I was wrong, Master!

271
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,100
 Head down the mountain with me when I come to Mount Wangcheng for the third time.

272
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,860
 I'll come again next year then.

273
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,860
I'll test your swordsmanship in two months.

274
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,440
You'll become a sword deity in three years.

275
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
This is the deal between us.

276
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,660
When did we make such a deal?

277
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,960
Mas—

278
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,540
Wait for me, Master!

279
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,240
Were you the one who asked Sir Xie Xuan to come?

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
I was.

281
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,700
I told him about you.

282
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,780
He said that lately, he's been practicing a kind of martial arts skill that's good for you.

283
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,880
So I invited him to Xueyue City to teach you this martial arts skill.

284
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,880
Thank you.

285
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,000
You don't have to thank me.

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,800
Xie Xuan is close to both of us.

287
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,820
But we can't ask him to teach you this martial skill solely on account of our friendship.

288
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,500
He'll only pass on his martial arts skills to those whom he deems worthy.

289
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,600
He made this decision right when you played the zither.

290
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,460
It looks like this book really can do wonders.

291
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,540
After reading a few lines, you can already understand some tricks from it.

292
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,860
The circulation of zhenqi can move everything through.

293
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,780
Sir Xie Xuan named this martial art, Circulation.

294
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,440
It looks like Xie Xuan didn't lie to me.

295
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,280
He said if you practice this skill for three years,

296
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,880
most of your power will slowly be restored.

297
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Combined with my medical skills,

298
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,540
you might even become stronger than you used to be.

299
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,820
But you must keep this in mind.

300
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,740
What is it?

301
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,500
He didn't mention it in the book,

302
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,540
but with your intelligence,

303
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,180
you'll soon discover that Circulation

304
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,140
will not only help you slowly restore your power,

305
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,760
it can also help you return to your most powerful state for a brief moment.

306
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,880
But if you do this, everything will be for naught.

307
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,520
Even your life will be in danger.

308
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
Return to the most powerful state for a brief moment?

309
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,260
Three years isn't that long.

310
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,480
Indeed.

311
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,860
 I've stayed at the inn for more than three years.

312
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,780
But the word magical power is written so that magic and power are reciprocal.

313
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,360
What is power?

314
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,080
Power means your heart.

315
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,760
Physical diseases are curable.

316
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,940
But what about psychological diseases?

317
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,400
I know. That incident brought you great harm,

318
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,100
but I really hope you can stay strong and get through it.

319
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,420
- Father. 
 -  Qianluo.

320
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,120
Father, why did you end the Flora Spectacle before I got back?

321
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,340
You brat.

322
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
You ignored me when I asked you to come.

323
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,320
Now that everyone has left, you blame us for ending it too soon.

324
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
Geez, you brat.

325
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,980
I heard that the Scholarly Sword Deity came too.

326
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,180
He even gave everyone a book as a gift.

327
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,260
Where's mine?

328
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
Yours?

329
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,780
Of course, you have one.

330
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,050
He asked me to give you this.

331
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,590

332
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,080
This brat said the spear techniques I passed on to her were too manly.

333
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,860
So she clamored for it. Look, look.

334
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,600
Father.

335
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,320
Yanhui, you've done well all these years.

336
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,980
Great Elder, please get to the point.

337
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,940
All these years, from the fall to the rise of Wushuang City,

338
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,880
it's all thanks to your contributions.

339
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,200
You have the talent to revive a country.

340
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,580
But what Wushuang City needs now is a person who can expand the territory.

341
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,380
An ambitious person?

342
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,860
Yes.

343
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,500
From now on, you don't have to worry about the affairs in the city.

344
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,020
Leave it to Songtao.

345
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,320
Brother, long time no see.

346
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,360
I was never interested in the position of the City Lord of Wushuang City.

347
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,740
But Songtao isn't qualified.

348
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,820
What did you say?!

349
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,260
Songtao's martial skills weren't as good as mine.

350
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,560
That's why he left Wushuang City.

351
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Now that you've asked him back, it's just because he's easier to control.

352
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,700
He'll obey your orders and do what he is told.

353
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,300
Yanhui, you've crossed the line.

354
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,940
I can quit being the City Lord.

355
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,640
But I'd like to recommend someone.

356
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,060
I should have this right, don't I?

357
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,460
Of course.

358
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,220
You mean this kid?

359
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,300
A brat like you wants to be the City Lord?

360
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,800
Come and test your sword with me first!

361
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,060
He's indeed a little kid.

362
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,940
Wushuang!

363
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,040
Coming, Master.

364
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,160
Wushuang Sword Box?

365
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,020
It's you, little brat?

366
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,260
Mister, who are you?

367
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm Ye Songtao!

368
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,320
I don't think you're that well-known.

369
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,520
- You... 
 - He's not well-known.

370
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,920
You're right this time.

371
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,220
Wushuang, next, you'll have to battle with your martial uncle.

372
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,900
If you win, you'll become the City Lord of Wushuang City.

373
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,980
All right, I understand.

374
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,580
Let's battle then.

375
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,640
How are we going to battle with you standing there?

376
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,580
Such a rube.

377
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,980
Cloud Shuttle, Light Frost, Desolate Wind, Thread, Jade Wish.

378
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,380
Have fun with this man.

379
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,860
Slaughter.

380
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,300
Your blade's name is Spirit Reaper.

381
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,580
This flying sword of mine is called Slaughter.

382
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,420
It's kind of a give-and-take.

383
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,240
It's Soul Reaper, not Spirit Reaper.

384
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,560
It's Ye Songzi's Soul Reaper Blade.

385
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,840
It's Ye Songtao.

386
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,500
I want to eat pine nuts now.
 (T/N: Songzi means pine nuts)

387
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,980
Yanhui, you've got a good disciple.

388
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,980
He can control six flying swords at the same time.

389
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,860
No one's seen such a talent in Wushuang City for a century now.

390
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,060
But still, it's very disrespectful of you to point a sword at your elder.

391
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,560
Disrespectful?

392
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,880
Young man, you've got great talent.

393
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
It's praiseworthy.

394
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,940
But you don't respect your elders.

395
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,540
Great Elder, you're quite good.

396
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,480
Why don't you be the City Lord?

397
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,720
I'm old.

398
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,180
I'm quite young.

399
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,420
Do you think I can be the City Lord?

400
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,940
Yanhui, you've raised an owner of the Wushuang Sword Box.

401
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,180
Yes.

402
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,160
We ought to choose a man who can lead Wushuang City

403
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,600
back to the time when it was unparalleled in the world.

404
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,520
Are you really going to put the destiny of a city in a child's hands?

405
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,720
Master, I'm forgetful, but I'm not a child.

406
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,060
I'm Wushuang.

407
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,420
The invincible Wushuang.

408
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,700
Wasn't I destined to take this position from the moment I got this name?

409
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,120
Step down, Master.

410
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,880
How dare you!

411
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,700
Even if you're the owner of Wushuang Sword Box,

412
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,920
without the consent of the Five Elders, you won't be able to take the seat!

413
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
I'm already sitting in the seat.

414
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,060
So what?

415
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,900
Great Elder, can I take this position?

416
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,920
- Greetings, City Lord. 
 - Greetings, City Lord.

417
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,000

418
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,160
Master, I'm here to fulfill my promise.

419
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,100
I've got three techniques.

420
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
Please test them.

421
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,160
All right.

422
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,760
The first technique...

423
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,640
was passed down by the Xueyue Sword Deity.

424
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,060
Beautiful Day.

425
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,520
In the end, Minghou risked his life to kill Sage Tianquan.

426
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,080
He was also severely injured and rescued by Yueji who rushed there.

427
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,760
Third Master, what's wrong?

428
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,280
That silly kid went down the mountain.

429
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,960
Went down the mountain?

430
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,380
Go on now.

431
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,620
Maybe you can still see his last technique.

432
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,780
Well done.

433
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,980
Lei Hong was not as good as you when he was your age.

434
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,320
Go!

435
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,020
Master, does this count as a successful defense?

436
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,500
You barely managed it.

437
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,780
But if this is all you can manage, you won't be able to take the other two strikes.

438
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,580
This is the only method I've got.

439
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,540
Return, Sword!

440
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,220

441
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,540
- What is that? 
 - What is it? It looks like a sword.

442
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,920
The sword is connected to him.

443
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,780
Being able to reach this state,

444
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,960
this junior brother of yours has achieved the Unrestrained Phase.

445
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,780
The second technique is the Two-handed Sword Technique.

446
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,060
The first move was passed down by the swordsman of the Lei Clan, Lei Hong.

447
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,020
The second move was passed on by Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

448
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,140
It's called Unpredictable Cloud and Mist.

449
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,920
Master, please test the second skill.

450
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
All right.

451
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,080
I'll show you a technique as well.

452
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,860
It also has a name.

453
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,280
It's called Astonishing Thunder.

454
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
Nice defense.

455
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,200
But I'm guessing this was meant to be the third technique you prepared.

456
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,440
If there's no other stronger move,

457
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,560
then, the test today...

458
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,300
You...

459
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,140
What is this?

460
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,260
This is my third technique.

461
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,440
It was passed down to me by my sister.

462
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,400
 Go, thrust your sword.

463
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,240
 Bend your right leg more.

464
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,500
 Eyes straight ahead.

465
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,860
 Good.

466
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,600
Sancai Sword Technique.

467
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,040
Flat thrust.

468
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,760
 Thurst.

469
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,620
 Sweep.

470
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,880
 Return to position.

471
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,900
You... already knew?

472
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,180
Sister.

473
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,680
A crybaby as always.

474
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,240
Xiao Jie, you've suffered

475
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,740
all these years.

476
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,380
Third Master, what's going on?

477
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,620
Just now, Second Master, she...

478
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,200
Hanyi entered the sect a month earlier than me.

479
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,140
But actually, she's four years younger than me.

480
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,340
Her mother is Li Xinyue, the heiress of Sword Tomb.

481
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,200
Her father is Lei Mengsha of the Lei Clan.

482
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,160
She didn't join the Lei Clan, so she took her mother's family name.

483
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,480
 Your Highness, please don't make things hard for us. His Majesty has given his order.

484
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,320
 If you insist on getting out of here, you'll be convicted of deceiving the Emperor.

485
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,300
 We can execute you before notifying His Majesty!

486
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,480
 You can't stop me.

487
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,380
 We know you're a martial arts expert.

488
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
 But we're fearless.

489
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,920
 If you want to leave, it'll have to be over our dead bodies.

490
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,380
 Then, try me.

491
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,200
 Wait, Your Highness!

492
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,900

493
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,240
 Your Highness, due to your special status, you can't go to the execution ground.

494
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,440
 Auntie Xinyue, why are you stopping me too?

495
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,740
 No.

496
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,180
 Leave this to me.

497
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,900
 I'll go get His Highness back.

498
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,620
 Trust me.

499
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,020
One of the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan, Lei Mengsha?

500
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,680
Xiao Se, why are you spacing out?

501
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,900
Some things...

502
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,380
really are predestined.

503
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,560
Sister, this is...

504
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,740
This is Mother's Azure Dragon Token.

505
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:00,320
Twenty years ago, Mother and Father attacked Pingqing Hall while protecting the Emperor.

506
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,800
Then, Father was appointed as one of the Eight Pillars

507
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,080
and served in the expedition against Nanjue.

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,720
He died on the battlefield.

509
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,620
Mother and the other three martial arts people who refused to be officials

510
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,480
were granted the vanity title of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

511
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,220
Mother was posted in the East.

512
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,620
Her code name was Azure Dragon.

513
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,600
Azure Dragon?

514
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,980
It sounds so strong.

515
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,740
I once really hated this token.

516
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,680
Because I thought it was this token that got our mother killed.

517
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,640
But it is Mother's relic, after all.

518
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,760
About mother, my master refuses to tell me any details.

519
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,480
I only heard it from others.

520
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,060
But I don't know why Mother would leave me all alone at Lei Fortress

521
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,240
when I was so young.

522
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,960
That's because Mother was tired of witnessing the conspiracy in Tianqi City.

523
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,920
She didn't want you to grow up in such an environment.

524
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,020
She wanted... you to return to the martial arts world

525
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,100
and grow up freely, staying away from disputes.

526
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,260
Was that so?

527
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,380
Or maybe mother could foresee

528
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,220
the coming of that day.

529
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,980
What happened exactly?

530
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,020
After mother was appointed as one of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

531
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,040
she had been working hard to protect the imperial city.

532
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,720
Until that year, Prince Langya's alleged treason shocked everyone in the country.

533
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
 Prince Langya used to be the backbone of the country.

534
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,340
 He helped Beili to repel the invasion of Nanjue many times.

535
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,760
 He was the big hero whom everyone admired.

536
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,280
But he was suddenly imprisoned.

537
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,120
The charge was treason.

538
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,540
Did he do it?

539
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,820
No one believed that it was true.

540
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,400
But ever since he was imprisoned, Prince Langya had remained silent.

541
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,420
He never said a word.

542
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,640
 He didn't admit to it or defend himself.

543
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,580
 Among Tianqi's Seven Censors who interrogated him, three of them thought he was innocent.

544
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,160
 But on the next day, they were found dead in their homes.

545
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,840
Emperor Mingde wanted him dead.

546
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,280
So no reason was needed.

547
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,880
It didn't even need evidence.

548
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,380
But that day when he was executed...

549
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,760
What happened?

550
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,160

551
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,090

552
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,340
Your Highness.

553
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,300

554
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,980
Who are you?!

555
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,960
Azure Dragon? Azure Dragon Guardian?

556
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,720
Li Xinyue?

557
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Mother showed up.

558
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:35,000

559
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,750
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

560
