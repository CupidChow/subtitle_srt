00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,160
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,860
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,520
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,520
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,490
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,610
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,040
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,970
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,400
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,380
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,610
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,840
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20

♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,700
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,184

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,184
 You didn't let me down.

25
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:16,860
 But that won't delay him for too long.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,960
After witnessing the Fatal Flying Blossoms, pretending to be asleep was worth it.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,860
Junior Brother Wu Xin.

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,976
Senior Brother, it's been a long time.

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
There's somewhere I want to go.

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,180
I wonder if this young friend would like to go with me.

31
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,760
No.

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,508
Hypocrite.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,020
What do you want?

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
What does that mean?

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,380
It looks like this young friend is also willing to travel together.

36
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,424
That's great.

37
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,600
Junior Brother!

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,592
Wang You, in the end, you eventually chose this path.

39
00:03:54,592 --> 00:04:01,812
Twelve years ago, I told you that sooner or later, you would face disaster because of that lad, Wu Xin.

40
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:05,876
Have you ever regretted the decision you made back then?

41
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,796
Of course, you won't regret it.

42
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:16,316
You said you wished to come back here and have a look before you die.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,100
I'll hold a memorial service for you here today.

44
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,156
I hope your soul will return to your home.

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,060

46
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,560

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,460
Xiao Se?

48
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,712
My dear disciple,

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,280
it's time for us to meet.

50
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,300
Xiao Se, why don't we grab this chance and run?

51
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,340
Sure, I wish you the best of luck.

52
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,876
Why aren't you coming?

53
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,060
Have you seen his lightness technique?

54
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,820
Do you think we can outrun him?

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,200
Then... Then we'll run after we knock him unconscious.

56
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,368
Sure, I wish you success.

57
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,140
We can't beat him or outrun him.

58
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,912
How can great men like us be held hostage here?

59
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,640
I never said we can't escape.

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
But we need to find a place we can survive after we escape from him.

61
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,960
This place is deserted with nothing here.

62
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,700
You're also heavily injured.

63
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,136
If we got lost, we could die.

64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,704
Look at you.

65
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:54,784
No one would expect you're Lei Hong's disciple.

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,300
Do you know my master?

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,100
Of course.

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,720
He was one of the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan back then.

69
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,580
He may be an external disciple.

70
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,380
But at a young age, he managed to restore the lost skills of Fire Infusion with an incomplete book.

71
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,220
When he was at his peak, his reputation was superior to the current sect leader, Lei Qianhu.

72
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,080
My master rarely talks about himself.

73
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,068
He prefers being alone.

74
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:24,468
He either stares at the sky or the flowers.

75
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,600
So how much do you know about my master?

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,700
Can you tell me?

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,520
It's said the ancestor of the Lei Clan once held the ceremony of hanging up their swords and blades.

78
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,100
They were determined to abandon the use of the two most commonly used weapons in the martial arts world.

79
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,080
They embarked on an entirely different path by focusing on developing explosive weapons,

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,280
which shocked the martial arts world.

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,060
But your master went against the ancestral teaching and practiced swordsmanship.

82
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,240
He combined it with the Lei Clan's explosive techniques and invented the Shabu Sword.

83
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,940
When the sword came into existence, the thunder roared and the flame was blazing.

84
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,560
He made a name for himself as he journeyed the martial arts world with the sword.

85
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,320
In the end, he was defeated by Li Hanyi, the Xueyue Sword Deity, and was nowhere to be found ever since.

86
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,460
Some said he returned to the Lei Fortress to go into seclusion

87
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,220
and claimed he wouldn't leave until he became a sword deity.

88
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,940
Some said the sect leader, Lei Qianhu, expelled him from the Lei Clan

89
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,760
because he went against the ancestral teaching.

90
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,912
Those are just rumors!

91
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,400
My master was never expelled from the Lei Clan!

92
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,692
He... he was just...

93
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,980
If you can't say it, don't say it.

94
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not interested in the Lei Clan's secrets.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,992
I'm glad to hear he was not expelled from the Lei Clan.

96
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,072
You sound like you know my master.

97
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,740
I don't know him.

98
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,770
Then why did you look relieved when you heard that he wasn't expelled from the Lei Clan?

99
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,840
If he were expelled from the Lei Clan, it doesn't matter if it's Xueyue City or the Lei Fortress,

100
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,900
who would help his foolish disciple, who lost the Shabu Sword, pay his debt?

101
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,104
After everything you said, it's all because of that 500 silver taels!

102
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,740
Hey, wait.

103
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,060
What did you just say?

104
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,140
Pay up.

105
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,440
No, before that.

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,500
The foolish disciple who lost the Shabu Sword.

107
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,420
Shabu Sword.

108
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,700
Oh, no. I'm so dead.

109
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,600
How could I lose the Shabu Sword?

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,960
Misfortune has befallen the Lei Clan.

111
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,980
How's your injury?

112
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,060
It's nothing serious.

113
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,680
It just hurts when I try to use my skills.

114
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,036
That White-Haired Deity's martial arts skills are unfathomable.

115
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:50,468
We were lucky to be able to survive.

116
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:52,040
You're right about that.

117
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,520
Speaking of which, it's all thanks to his help.

118
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,540
 They killed my father!

119
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,208
 I want to kill all of them!

120
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,868
 Amitabha.

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,340
 If this vicious cycle continues, when will it all end?

122
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,016
 Besides, he's still a child.

123
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,260
 Amitabha.

124
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,220
How many things have happened to you along the way?

125
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,480
You have so many injuries.

126
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,920
It's all right. I'm used to it.

127
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,300
Where's Master Wu Chan?

128
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,920
I need to ask him about Wu Xin.

129
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
Wait here.

130
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,408
I've read a book that said there are deities in the world.

131
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:32,100
They can stand on clouds and are dressed in white.

132
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,920
They can live without food,

133
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,108
travel far with the wind, and never grow old.

134
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:41,320
They're describing someone like him, right?

135
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,340
I've never met anyone who masters such incredible lightness technique.

136
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,528
It really felt like riding the wind.

137
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,220
It took us so long to get here.

138
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,500
But he doesn't look exhausted at all.

139
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,020
It's incredible.

140
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,028
As his hostages, here we are complimenting him.

141
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,300
How do you think he would feel if he heard us?

142
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,900
Both of you... aren't my hostages.

143
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,600
As I said earlier,

144
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,260
I want you to accompany me to a place.

145
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,540
There were so many of us in the carriage.

146
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,840
Why did you have to pick us?

147
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,620
You picked us because one of us doesn't know martial arts

148
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,960
and the other one is seriously injured.

149
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,324
Seriously injured?

150
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,600
I may not be skillful. But I'm willing to help.

151
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,420
You want to treat my injuries?

152
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,316
During this journey, I'll still need help from the two of you.

153
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:38,300
So of course, I'll help you treat your injuries.

154
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,412
I think I'll pass.

155
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,400
You were injured by the White-Haired Deity's true energy.

156
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,580
If you use your skills, two different energies will clash.

157
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,140
It will certainly make your injuries even worse.

158
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,250
I'll help you force out his true energy from your body.

159
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,440
 There truly is such mystical lightness technique in the world.

160
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,220
I can't swim.

161
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,020
What kind of martial arts skill

162
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,908
can let him stand on water?

163
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:52,872
It wasn't me.

164
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,280
He did it himself.

165
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,060
 Lei Wujie is doing it himself?

166
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,240
Old Wang You told me people with a conscience and flexibility can become one with nature.

167
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
Turns out he didn't lie to me.

168
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,920
Break!

169
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,100
It was a success. You can take him back.

170
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,520
How do you feel?

171
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,820
I feel a tingling and numbing sensation all over.

172
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,800
I feel better too.

173
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,140
The Lei Clan is a well-known family in the martial arts world.

174
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,050
How did they produce such an airhead?

175
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:11,372
That's not how you pronounce it.

176
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,780
Use the falling tone.

177
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,236
I'll pronounce it the way I want. Airhead.

178
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,980
Airhead.

179
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,860
- I'm serious. That's not how you pronounce it. 
 - I don't care.

180
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,080
- Airhead. 
 - Airhead.

181
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,260
- Why are you so stubborn? 
 - How nice.

182
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,100
So Wu Xin is the son of Ye Dingzhi, the Grand Master of the Tian Wai Tian Sect.

183
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,260
The one Tian Wai Tian sent to be held as a hostage in Beili?

184
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,220
Precisely.

185
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,960
Twelve years ago, the Demon Sect started a war to overthrow the imperial power of Beili.

186
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,840
That year, the Governor-General, Prince Langya,

187
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,580
led the Three Armies of Beili, together with Tianqi's Four Guardians,

188
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,300
joining forces with the power of the whole martial arts world to defeat the Demon Sect.

189
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,220
When Ye Dingzhi died, Wu Xin was only five years old.

190
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,580
Now, the 12-year armistice is almost up.

191
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,500
Tian Wai Tian Sect wants to bring their master, Wu Xin, back.

192
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,840
Afterall, Wu Xin is the son of the Demon Sect.

193
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,000
He even holds the 32 Secret Arts of the Rakshasa.

194
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we set him free, it'll bring disaster.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,420
It's reasonable for Master Da Jue to want to get rid of his martial arts skills

196
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,300
before letting him return to Tian Wai Tian.

197
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,800
I do hope that's what they really want to do.

198
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,220
Why did you help us?

199
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,496
Didn't I tell you I want to go to a place?

200
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,980
So I need both of you to accompany me.

201
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,840
Treating his injuries is just a small favor.

202
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,200
Abbot, your martial arts skills are exceptional.

203
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,500
You don't need our help to go anywhere you want.

204
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,288
Besides, you're someone Xueyue City wants to escort to the Nine Dragon Sect.

205
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,220
Behind me is a disciple from Xueyue City.

206
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,168
Aren't you afraid that we'll capture you?

207
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,592
May I be so bold to ask you a question?

208
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:22,920
When we were traveling in the carriage, didn't I save you both?

209
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,580
Now, I only ask for a small favor.

210
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,320
Can't you help me fulfill it?

211
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,452
I feel so disappointed.

212
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,980
I'll go with you.

213
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,276
I knew you'd say that.

214
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,200
You saved our lives. I'll lend you a hand this time.

215
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,940
But after you fulfill your wish, I still have to bring you back.

216
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,100
Sure. I'll wait for you to capture me. If you're capable.

217
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,460
Since you've decided to travel with me, we're companions, then.

218
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,656
So let's address each other by name.

219
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,440
What's your name?

220
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,220
Call me Lei Wujie.

221
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,540
I'm Xiao Se.

222
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,100
They're all good names.

223
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,240
Where do you want to go that you need us to go with you?

224
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,280
With your remarkable abilities, what kind of place is one where you can't go?

225
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,700
Excellent question!

226
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,320
Because I have no money.

227
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,080
If you have no money out here,

228
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,120
it'll be hard to go anywhere.

229
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
Then you found the right person.

230
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,740
Listen. Among the people in the carriage, he's the richest one.

231
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,556
The sleeves of this fur coat alone already cost 100 taels.

232
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,040
Shut up.

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,740
What if I refuse to give you money?

234
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,080
Are you going to steal it from me?

235
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,820

236
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,680
Your Majesty.

237
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,580
What is it?

238
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,600
Your Majesty.

239
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,820
Sangu City delivered a message,

240
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,440
saying the White-Haired Deity of Tian Wai Tian appeared in the Central Plains.

241
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,660
We have an agreement with the Tian Wai Tian Sect.

242
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,540
No one from the demon sect is allowed to enter the Central Plains without permission.

243
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,680
Why did the White-Haired Deity

244
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,900
violate the agreement for no reason?

245
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,040
Your Majesty, the 12-year agreement is almost up.

246
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,924
It's been 12 years already?

247
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,888
Is it time yet?

248
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,840
Even if there's one more day left,

249
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,460
the 12-year agreement is not due yet.

250
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,020
This devil dares to break the agreement and enter the Central Plains without permission.

251
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,440
He's pushing us around because we have no one capable.

252
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,312
I ask that Your Majesty order the capture of this devil.

253
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,480
I remember you were friends

254
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,420
with Wang You of Hanshui Temple.

255
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,520
Your Majesty,

256
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,720
Abbot Wang You gave me directions when I was traveling the martial arts world.

257
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,360
But it was only a direction.

258
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,600
I dare not claim that he was my friend.

259
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,960
Never mind.

260
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,420
Let the martial arts world take care of its issues.

261
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,800
Since those from Tian Wai Tian are here,

262
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,440
I want you to take care of them for me.

263
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,320
As you command.

264
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,800
Your Majesty, what about that hostage?

265
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,872
I'll leave it for you to decide.

266
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,420
 Does His Majesty want me to kill him or not?

268
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,520
 Forget it. I'll check things out first.

269
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,260
 I must not let Tian Wai Tian take him.

270
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,420

271
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,960
Xiao Se, stop hesitating already.

272
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,720
The weather is getting hot now.

273
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
This fur coat will only be your burden.

274
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,400
What do you know?

275
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,280
My expensive fur coat was custom-made in Yuxiu Boutique in Tianqi City.

276
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
It took three months to complete it.

277
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,260
- It's windproof and protects you from heat. 
- And comfortable to wear all year round, too.

278
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,820
I've heard it so many times already.

279
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,340
If we have no money, we can't eat, let alone rent a horse.

280
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,700
- Then can't you... 
 - He's right, Boss Xiao.

281
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,580
Money is worldly possession.

282
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,140
Stop hesitating already.

283
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,480
You should let go when it's time.

284
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,300
- Are you two ganging...
 - Come on. Let's go.

285
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,600
- Let go of me. 
 - Stop hesitating. The pawn shop is just ahead.

286
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,740

287
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,364

288
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,720
Excuse me, another serving of ham hock!

289
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,420
No!

290
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,320
We only have ten silver taels.

291
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,760
Money is just worldly possession.

292
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,260
Quiet.

293
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
We only have ten silver taels.

294
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,460
After this meal, we might have no money for our next meal.

295
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,200
Boss Xiao, we should enjoy ourselves while we can.

296
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
You too.

297
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,600
If we have no money after this, we can only count on you to beg for alms.

298
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,680
So, can I order one serving of pork shoulder?

299
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,620
Of course not.

300
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,548
But...

301
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,280
Boss Xiao, the journey is rough.

302
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,560
Brother Lei is the one who suffered the most.

303
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,760
You don't want him to starve until he's weak like just now, right?

304
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,560
Fine, one last dish.

305
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,060
All right.

306
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,060
I'll order at the counter.

307
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,440
Boss Xiao, do you want to ask me something?

308
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,200
My ten silver taels are with you.

309
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,420
After paying for this meal,

310
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,260
you should give me back the balance.

311
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,968
Boss Xiao, you sure are careful.

312
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,100
So why do you want to go to Great Fanyin Temple?

313
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,304
Of course, to see someone I want to meet.

314
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,864
Great Fanyin Temple is well known.

315
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:36,400
It's said the Head of the Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi, made a trip to Great Fanyin Temple

316
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,120
to inquire about Heaven's will before his expedition in the east.

317
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,576
Boss Xiao, you know very well.

318
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:48,780
It's not a secret in the Martial Arts World.

319
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,960
Don't tell me you're going to Great Fanyin Temple to ask for Heaven's will.

320
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,300
I just need to do one thing, that's all.

321
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,920
What is it?

322
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,040
No hurry. You'll know when the time comes.

323
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,740
You want to do something and go all that way to find someone.

324
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,884
It shows that this person has a close relationship with you.

325
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,320
You can say so.

326
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,400
Speaking of which, I should call him Uncle.

327
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,212
These are just grudges from the previous generation.

328
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,280
Xiao Se, why don't we rent a horse?

329
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,440
If we walk on foot, when are we going to find a place to stay?

330
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,280
You spent all the money on food. We don't have money to rent a horse.

331
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,604
Actually, I think the place where we ate was pretty good.

332
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:45,480
We can rent a room and make do with it.

333
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,620
That's right. Xiao Se, how about we go back there?

334
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,420
An inn like that charges three silver taels for their worst room.

335
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a room with no bed, no windows, and only straw as the bedding.

336
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,080
At night, it'll be hot and humid with mosquitoes biting you. Can you even sleep in that kind of environment?

337
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,900
- Actually—  
 - I'm in the lodging business.

338
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,860
I know about this business more than you do.

339
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,820
But...

340
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,780
Yes, money has been saved.

341
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,540
Long Arch Wing Chaser?

342
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,840
Night Parade of 100 Ghosts?

343
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,860

344
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,392

345
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,410
Where is this place?

346
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,260

347
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,160
 Long Arch? 100 Ghosts?

348
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
 I've never heard of them.

349
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,164
 What you used to hear are stories about heroes.

350
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,860
 But the Long Arch Wing Chaser and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts are different.

351
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,500
 They're mounted bandits.

352
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,320
 Mounted bandits?

353
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,140
 Wu Xin, you sure are something else. Even the mounted bandits are interested in you.

354
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
 There are so many of them.

355
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,780
 Well, I don't care about that. We'll decide after we fight!

356
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,504
 It looks like they don't plan to kill.

357
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,140
 What are you planning to do now?

358
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,940
 Of course, it's to...

359
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,720
 Xiao Se! Wu Xin!

360
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,620
 Hurry!...

361
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
 Run for your lives...

362
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,580
Those traitors.

363
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,820
A young hero should live well with liquor and dance.

364
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,916
But why are you moping around?

365
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,180
Liquor and dance?

366
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm already a prisoner of the mounted bandits.

367
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,300
Where can I get...

368
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,380
That smells good!

369
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,140
Are you drinking liquor?

370
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,760
So, you're drinking liquor.

371
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,820
Were you also captured by the mounted bandits?

372
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,720
Where did you get that liquor?

373
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,200
I have my ways.

374
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,308
Young Friend, since we're fated to be prisoners here,

375
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,900
let's drink this liquor together.

376
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,156
I won't be shy, then.

377
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,960
I thought I was going to spend my time alone drinking liquor on this long night.

378
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,052
But I didn't expect to run into you here.

379
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:51,816
You can say we're fated to meet.

380
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
The liquor is good.

381
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,680
But it's not strong enough. It's not as good as the plains liquor.

382
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,660
Can you tell me how you got caught by the mounted bandits?

383
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,884
My two unreliable friends sold me out.

384
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,208
Be careful.

385
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:19,120
We're now at the camp of the Long Arch Wing Chaser and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts.

386
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,708
If we're not careful enough, we'll get caught, let alone rescue Lei Wujie.

387
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,600
What's more, we don't know how many experts are here.

388
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,120
With only you and me here, how are you planning to save him when I don't know martial arts at all?

389
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,824
We'll plan as we go.

390
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,640
We'll find a way eventually.

391
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,084
But our priority is to capture someone.

392
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:44,824
So we can ask him where Lei Wujie is being locked up.

393
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,548
I had a good time.

394
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:49,920
Let's go star-gazing after filling our tummies.

395
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,620
All right.

396
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,040
Here he comes.

397
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,780
Forgive me for I'm going to sin.

398
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,160
When you're ready to answer my question, tell me.

399
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,980
I'll pull you up.

400
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,620
I thought you know how to use the Devil Eye.

401
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,420
Why aren't you using it?

402
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,820
It's tiring.

403
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,520
Did you really grow up in Hanshui Temple?

404
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,464
Where else would I be if not Hanshui Temple?

405
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,700
You have the Secret Arts of Rakshasa.

406
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,360
Those in the martial arts world will definitely keep a lookout for you.

407
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,160
But not to the extent of involving the powerful Wushuang City to get into fights.

408
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,940
Let alone the Tian Wai Tian Sect.

409
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,680
After Tian Wai Tian lost the battle 12 years ago,

410
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,796
they made a 12-year armistice with the major sects of the Central Plains.

411
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:51,444
In those 12 years, no one from Tian Wai Tian is allowed to enter Beili.

412
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:56,320
If I'm not mistaken, there was a five-year-old hostage at the time.

413
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,604
The truth isn't as complicated as imagined.

414
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:03,221
All of you think I'm someone important.

415
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:05,040
But...

416
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,500
I'm nothing more than a mischievous disciple from Hanshui Temple.

417
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,820
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

418
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,660
- Wu Xin. 
 -  Yes?

419
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,400
If you don't pull him up, he'll die.

420
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,940
Oh no!

421
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,880
Judging from what you said, these two friends of yours are very interesting.

422
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,760
If it weren't for them, would I be so unlucky and get caught here?

423
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,880
If I see them again next time, I'm going to teach them a lesson.

424
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,080
Now, you're locked up in here.

425
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,520
I'm afraid you don't have a chance

426
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,116
to get revenge on them.

427
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,540
Who says?

428
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,324
At that time, they indeed ran away.

429
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:58,380
But they did that because of urgency.

430
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,536
Why are you so sure?

431
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,020
Why?

432
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,540
I have a feeling. Well, it's hard to describe it.

433
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,596
Feeling?

434
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:17,368
Do you know what kind of person Wu Xin is?

435
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,600
Wu Xin?

436
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,448
Isn't he Abbot Wang You's disciple?

437
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,760
Even if he doesn't come, Xiao Se will come to save me.

438
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,436
After all, I still owe Xiao Se 500 silver taels.

439
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:33,224
We shall wait and see, then.

440
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,604
Enough about me. What about you?

441
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:41,040
Don't you have friends who can rescue you?

442
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,280
I've never had friends.

443
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,380
I don't need any, either.

444
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,229
Then why did you come here alone?

445
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,680
Me?

446
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,048
I came here

447
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,900
because I want to be the emperor!

448
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,620
You want to be the emperor?

449
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,896
Are you drunk?

450
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:13,100
If you become the emperor, then I'm the Sword Deity.

451
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,680
All right. If I become the emperor, I shall grant you that title!

452
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,424
It's not a title an emperor can grant.

453
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,848
You're pretty funny.

454
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:29,140
Don't worry. When my friends come and rescue me, we'll save you too.

455
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,340
Stop making so much noise!

456
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,160
Get out.

457
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,784
Where are you taking him?

458
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:45,096
Brother, don't be scared!

459
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:48,560
My friends will definitely come and save us!

460
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,540
Master, please spare me.

461
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,140
Hero, please spare me.

462
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,372
Enough begging. So tell me.

463
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:03,540
Where did you lock the man you caught this morning?

464
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,648
I really don't know.

465
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,580
Wait, I know.

466
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,120
I suddenly remember where he's being locked up.

467
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,160
All the hostages we kidnapped for ransom are in the dungeon.

468
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,880
How many experts are there among the Long Arch Wing Chaser and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts?

469
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,380
What phase are they at?

470
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,944
The one with the best martial arts skills is our boss.

471
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:28,500
But two days ago, someone came to our stronghold.

472
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,340
He looks like an expert, too.

473
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,384
The boss is very respectful of him and addresses him as Young Master.

474
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,980
Young Master?

475
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,280

476
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,904
He really is an inexperienced lad.

477
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:54,920
Young Master, will that person really come and break him out of the dungeon?

478
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,120
Break him out?

479
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,200
He's occupied with his own trouble and he can't even save himself.

480
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
How can he break him out?

481
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,340
If he really does come, I'd like to meet him.

482
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,020
 After all, I haven't seen him for a long time.

483
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,760
 The Young Master of Tian Wai Tian, Ye Anshi.

484
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,250

485
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,320

486
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,040
Lei Wujie.

487
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,540
Lei Wujie.

488
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,892
Xiao Se, I'm here.

489
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,680
Catch the keys.

490
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,500
I knew you'd come and save me.

491
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,180
Did you drink liquor?

492
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,680
Yes.

493
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,420
There was a man who was locked up next to my cell.

494
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,480
He was the one who gave me the liquor.

495
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,000
I even told him we'd save him. But he was taken away by the guards.

496
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,180
You sure enjoyed your time here.

497
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,280
You even had liquor in the dungeon.

498
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,380
 This is Qiulubai liquor from Diaolou Parlor in Tianqi City.

499
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,520
 Why would someone be drinking such expensive liquor at a place like this?

500
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,580
But where did he get the liquor?

501
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,800
Right.

502
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,040
Why did he have liquor?

503
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,920
 Could it be...

504
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,648
Well, enough about him.

505
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:56,293
Next, we'll start our real operation.

506
00:36:56,293 --> 00:37:02,720
I knew with your abilities, this foolish boy wouldn't get caught if you helped him during the day.

507
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,320
Yet, you let him get caught and then came to rescue him at night.

508
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,480
You must have other plans.

509
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,208
Tell me what it is.

510
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,404
The play was supposed to have ended.

511
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,480
What do you mean, Young Master?

512
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,720
Tian Wai Tian wants to welcome their young master back.

513
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,596
But some sects in the Central Plains don't want to let him leave.

514
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:30,100
Some of them are after the Secret Arts of Rakshasa.

515
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,440
That's why there are so many people fighting over the Golden Coffin.

516
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,680
But who would have thought the GO piece that people are after would leave the checkerboard?

517
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,776
A GO piece without discipline will become a variable no matter where he goes.

518
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:52,788
If he returns to Tian Wai Tian, we'll come into contact with him often in the future.

519
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:55,760
So it's better to know more about him.

520
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
You're right, Young Master.

521
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,920
But it won't be easy for him to leave the checkerboard.

522
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:09,072
No matter how skilled his lightness technique is, can he stop the major power from watching him...

523
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,060
Wait.

524
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,840
I was wrong.

525
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,230
He'll surely break that kid out of the dungeon!

526
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,820
What's going on?

527
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,320
 I'm Wu Xin of Hanshui Temple.

528
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,160
 I especially came to visit the Long Arch Wing Chaser and the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts.

529
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,020
Someone! Hurry!

530
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,920
- Fetch the water now! 
 - Coming!

531
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,560
- Move it! 
 - Hurry!

532
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,060
- Over here! 
 - This way!

533
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,880
Hurry!

534
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,600
Someone! Put out the fire!

535
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,160
- Call for help! 
 - Hurry!

536
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,360
- Fetch the water now! 
 - Stop them!

537
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,224
After them now!

538
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,800
- Put out the fire! 
 - Don't let them escape!

539
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,360
Stop them!

540
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,100
 It must be a coincidence.

541
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,660
 Why would he come to a place like this?

542
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,980
 Perhaps I'm overthinking it.

543
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
That's odd.

544
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,580
Yushi may not be big. But it also trades with Beili.

545
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,380
There may not be an endless stream of traveling traders. But it shouldn't be this quiet.

546
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,020
That's right. We've walked almost half a day now. But we haven't seen a single person here.

547
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,708
What's going on?

548
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,376
Don't tell me something happened to Yushi.

549
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:52,200
But I didn't hear anything about that.

550
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,660
Is it possible that they've changed the official route?

551
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,592
Airhead.

552
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:01,180
Do you think an official route is as easy to change as you please?

553
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,800
You pronounced it wrong again.

554
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,696
Enough. Let's stop walking.

555
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,040
We're obviously lost.

556
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Wu Xin, don't tell me you're bad at directions too.

557
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,300
I've seen the map.

558
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,648
There's only one official route to Yushi.

559
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:21,672
How can we get lost when we follow the route?

560
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,240
This isn't the official route.

561
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,840
This path is obviously made by people who traveled on foot.

562
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,180
Why would the map mark this route?

563
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,644
You brought us here.

564
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,060
It's hard for those who don't join cultivation in Nirvana to learn from each other.

565
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,360
Stop showing off your literary skills.

566
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,988
Ordinary people lose their way, and acting recklessly is an obsession.

567
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,660
There's an inn ahead!

568
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,040
We can just go and ask for directions.

569
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,960
 This is...

570
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,800
 Master?

571
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:45,040

572
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,180
