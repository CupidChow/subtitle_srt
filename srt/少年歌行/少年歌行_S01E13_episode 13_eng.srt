♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,880
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,390
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,320
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,594
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,150

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,014

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,940
Your Highness, please have some tea.

25
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,750
Have a seat.

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,480
It's been a long time since I last saw Your Highness.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,452
I didn't expect the next time I'd see you, that you'd have to see such an embarrassing situation.

28
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:23,050
It's all right.

29
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,560
No matter how embarrassing it is, I still can't see it.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,220
Sorry, I misspoke.

31
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,252
I was just joking with you.

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,450
The jokes you make are never funny.

33
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,378
I remember, whenever I saw you as a child,

34
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,770
you would always tell me not to be too hard on myself.

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,846
Be happy, smile more.

36
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:55,520
All these years and I still remember this.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,716
But now that we've met again,

38
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:00,762
you still think I'm not humorous.

39
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,790
That's not true.

40
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,730
You're more humorous... than before.

41
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,260
Forget it.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,620
Compared to the other princes,

43
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,366
because of my eyes,

44
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,190
I am indeed somewhat more pathetic.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,560
Thank you for your stepping in and helping today.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,690
Even if I didn't take action,

47
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,464
you would've been able to take care of it easily,

48
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,446
but just a little slower.

49
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,520
I have an urgent matter today, so I overstepped my authority.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,000
Then I wonder what urgent matter you're talking about.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,676
I have a decree to pass on.

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,380
Don't worry.

53
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,830
This decree isn't meant for the Vermilion Bird.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,296
I haven't been the Vermilion Bird for many years already.

55
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:04,336
I'm just a steward of Xueyue City.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,196
Then, I'll call you City Lord Sikong.

57
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,316
That sounds much better.

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,452
This decree is meant for that person.

59
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,288
Actually, before today,

60
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:25,524
I wasn't sure if he really was here. Until just now.

61
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,750
Although I couldn't see,

62
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,012
his habit of surprising

63
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:35,664
and scaring people hasn't changed over the years.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,100
This matter is between you two then.

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,522
This has nothing to do with Xueyue City.

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I heard he became your disciple.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,900
I'm the one who wanted to take him as my disciple.

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,812
He neither agreed, nor refused.

69
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,300
I understand now.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,770
City Lord Sikong is trying to make sure Xueyue City

71
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,590
stays out of this matter.

72
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,450
There are very few people in this world who dare refuse to accept His Majesty's decrees,

73
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,600
and even fewer who accept them and then disobey them.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,500
But he happens to be one of them.

75
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:23,702
So what's wrong with me wanting nothing to do with this matter?

76
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,960
I see.

77
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,070
It's all your fault!

78
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,730
Why didn't you fight a little longer?

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,170
You were in such a hurry to get down there,

80
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,070
because you were afraid that Qianluo would surrender and you'd have to marry her, right?

81
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,290
Lei Wujie, if you keep talking nonsense, I'll rip your mouth off!

82
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,310
Who would want to surrender first?

83
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,590
Who would want to marry this guy?

84
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,430
Qianluo, this time, Xiao Se was of great help.

85
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,520
If it weren't for him, things would have become much more complicated today.

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,980
As for Junior Brother Luo Mingxuan, you should go and visit him after he's recovered.

87
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,117
He could have beaten Duan Xuanheng for you if he hadn't been poisoned.

88
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,054
Xiao Se, thanks.

89
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,290
You're welcome.

90
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,838
I'll definitely pay what I owe.

91
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:21,830
If you ever need me to fight for you, I won't hesitate to return the favor.

92
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,540
There's no need.

93
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Aren't you usually warm hearted?

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,944
Why have you been pulling a long face all day?

95
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:32,990
Who's warm-hearted?

96
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,590
You.

97
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,510
Listen, I didn't even ask him to go up today, and he rushed up there on his own.

98
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,530
Really?

99
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,530
Of course!

100
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,390
I did it because that Duan fellow was really annoying and I just couldn't stand him.

101
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,480
That's fine too.

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,760
Anyway, I, Lei Wujie, approve of you today.

103
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,290
Do I need your approval?

104
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,590
But...

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,030
Enough, enough. Forget about all that.

106
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,700
The tournament is finally over.

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,580
Prince Bai can also prove the fairness of the tournament on the spot.

108
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,720
I don't think they would dare say anything else in the future.

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,220
That's right, Senior Brother!

110
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,318
That prince was so dashing.

111
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:17,778
Hundreds of people at the scene fell to their knees at once.

112
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:21,520
But why did the City Lord only do a half-kneel?

113
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,760
Third Master was once the Vermilion Bird, one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi City.

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,090
He can even do a half salute in front of the Emperor,

115
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,541
so naturally a prince isn't qualified to have him make a full salute.

116
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,900
It turns out that the City Lord was once the Vermilion Bird.

117
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,960
Wouldn't that make Qianluo the heiress to the Vermilion Bird Token?

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,900
Father told me about it before.

119
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,820
But I'm not interested.

120
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,856
I don't know that person, so why should I be a guardian?

121
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,530
Right, my father can do a half-kneel,

122
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,070
but why didn't you kneel, Xiao Se?

123
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,770
That's right.

124
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,080
I...

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,620
have weak legs.

126
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,800
What... Senior Brother, look, he's making things up again.

127
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,710
I have some ancestral glory that allows me to not kneel before the Emperor.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,500
Does this answer work?

129
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Really?

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,690
You're so stingy, but you actually come from a distinguished family?

131
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,410
Oh right, Senior Brother, why did a prince from Tianqi City come to Xueyue City?

132
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,770
He probably has something important to discuss with Third Master.

133
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,720
After all, Third Master was once the Vermilion Bird.

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,330
Third Master was credited with the ascension of His Majesty to the throne.

135
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,252
But the sudden arrival of a Prince of Tianqi City in Xueyue City gives me a feeling of unease.

136
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:44,532
My father long said that he hates the people in that city.

137
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:48,018
But I think Prince Bai is a good man.

138
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:52,684
However, there's something a bit wrong with his eyes.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
Because he can't see anything.

140
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,540
Can't see anything?

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,833
He took a piece of cake from someone's plate when he was little,

142
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,950
and he went blind after eating it.

143
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,180
All these years, Emperor Mingde has searched all over the world for competent physicians,

144
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,250
but he hasn't been cured.

145
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,566
What a poor man.

146
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,890
Xiao Se.

147
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:21,077
 Elder Yin.

148
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,470
Prince Bai is waiting for you in the backyard.

149
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,310
You go on first.

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,950
Elder Yin.

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,282
Well, what does Prince Bai want with Xiao Se?

152
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:42,096
They likely studied together at Tianqi Academy.

153
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,812
So they were classmates.

154
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,770
Classmates!

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,676

156
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,376
I am blind.

157
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:16,588
I can't see you,

158
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:19,094
but you can see me.

159
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,720
What's wrong?

160
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,386
Since you've seen me, aren't you going to greet me?

161
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,620
Greetings, Your Highness, Prince Bai.

162
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,200
Is that the way you address me?

163
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,444
I'm just a commoner.

164
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:42,870
How else can I address you, when I meet the Second Prince, Prince Bai?

165
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,970
After all, addressing you incorrectly will get me killed.

166
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,942
Do you know that not kneeling before me in the morning just now is punishable by death too?

167
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,550
My head is right here.

168
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,302
Take it if you like, Your Highness.

169
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,412
You don't speak as harshly as you used to.

170
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:11,354
You sound a bit weak.

171
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:16,212
But... you're still as cheeky as ever.

172
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,010
You might as well call me Second Brother.

173
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,370
I haven't heard that for years now.

174
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm Xiao Se.

175
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,175
I'm just the owner of an ordinary inn.

176
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:36,704
I have no right to address Prince Bai as Second Brother.

177
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:38,150
All right then.

178
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,820
Xiao Se of Snowfall Villa.

179
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,040
Yes, Your Highness.

180
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,820
Accept the decree.

181
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,340
- Accept the decree? 
 - Accept the decree.

182
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,550

183
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,350
By order of His Majesty,

184
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,834
the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe, is forgiven for all past sins

185
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,710
and restored to the status of a prince,

186
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,070
and will be given the title of Prince Yong'an.

187
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,190
Rewarded with ten thousand taels of gold and a hundred boxes of jewels.

188
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,092
You are to return to Tianqi City at once.

189
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,920
Aren't you going to thank the Emperor?

190
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,836
I reject this decree.

191
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,820
- You dare reject it? 
 - I reject it.

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,408
Why?

193
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:34,631
The Sixth Prince is forgiven for all past sins.

194
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,700
What did I do wrong in the past?

195
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,590
Even though I can't see, but I can guess what you look like at this moment.

196
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,410
Now that you've guessed it, please take this decree back with you, Your Highness.

197
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,540
You still won't call me Second Brother even after hearing the decree.

198
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,620
It seems you really don't want to go back.

199
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,047
Does Your Highness want me to return?

200
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,532
 When I left the city, a man came with a sword.

201
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,060
He was the Rage Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian, one of the Five Sword Deities.

202
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,020
As far as I know, he's also your master.

203
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,860
Believe it or not, I didn't send him there.

204
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,960
You didn't send him there?

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,638
Did you know before he left then?

206
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,758
Did you know and pretend not to?

207
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:44,722
So you think your injury was caused by Master Zhantian?

208
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,512
Even if he hadn't made the last move,

209
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:56,598
many things wouldn't have changed if he hadn't been there.

210
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,590
Forget it.

211
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,050
It's better to talk about these things back in Tianqi City.

212
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,896
I'll give you three days to think about whether you want to accept this decree

213
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,140
and come home with me.

214
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,840

215
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,970
Your Highness, I heard it all outside.

216
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,980
Xiao Chuhe is so outrageous.

217
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,580
We should report it to His Majesty and ask him to withdraw his order and then punish him severely.

218
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,990
Zang Ming.

219
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,486
You can only say this to me.

220
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,230
Why?

221
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,960
Remember this.

222
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,150
I don't hold a grudge against him.

223
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,450
But the cake was his...

224
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,430
Back then,

225
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
we were only kids.

226
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,890
Xueyue City has really been lively lately.

227
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,760
That's true.

228
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,110
First, someone made it to the top of Dengtian Tower and challenged the Xueyue Sword Deity.

229
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,920
Then, there was the Flora Spectacle.

230
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,410
The Scholarly Sword Deity showed up in person and gave away gifts.

231
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,250
In addition, the tournament of marriage even attracted the noble Prince Bai here.

232
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,100
- But you know that I'm a person who doesn't like liveliness. 
 - Oh really?

233
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,500
That's great then.

234
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,896
Just kick Prince Bai out of here right away on my behalf.

235
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,040
What's so difficult about that?

236
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,061
Back then, just with my sword, I could force his father to make a deal with me.

237
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,790
He's just a prince.

238
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,650
- I'll be right back. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

239
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,710
I was just kidding with you. Don't take it seriously.

240
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,310
Why do you always have to involve everyone in Xueyue City and put them in danger?

241
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,210
Prince Bai just wants to take one person away.

242
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,552
Word really does travel fast.

243
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:05,250
Since the Emperor wants him to return, his sins should have been forgiven.

244
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,320
This is a good thing.

245
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,314
Actually, Xiao Se doesn't want his sins to be pardoned,

246
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,104
but Prince Langya's.

247
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,950
That's impossible.

248
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,260
The case of Prince Langya was already a closed case back then.

249
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,820
Emperor Mingde won't be willing to make any compromises.

250
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,300
Yes. It's a...

251
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,560
dead end.

252
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,720
Miss Ye.

253
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,340
Miss Ye.

254
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,780
City Lord Sikong. Second City Lord.

255
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,469
Miss Ye, why do you have time to come to my place today?

256
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:51,260
I was on my way to the medical hall to pick up some herbs and stopped by to see you.

257
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,360
It would be great if my daughter was as sensible as you are.

258
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,180
How are you, Miss Ye? How's your recovery going?

259
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm much better than when I arrived.

260
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,932
I guess my medical skills are still a bit lacking.

261
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:09,960
Right, I've heard that Old Master Tang has a method that may cure your illness.

262
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,220
How about this? Ask Tang Lian to take you to the Tang Clan sometime.

263
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,940
I'm sorry to trouble you.

264
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,540
You may go now.

265
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,713
She'd been eavesdropping for quite some time already.

266
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,580
It's not something important anyway. Let her be.

267
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,609
She's the daughter of General Ye Xiaoying.

268
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,220
The more Ye Xiaoying knows, the more complicated things become.

269
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,185
But she used to be Xiao Se's good friend.

270
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,080
But I don't think the two of them have ever talked to each other since Xiao Se entered Xueyue City.

271
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,620
So, she is the one who knows Xiao Se best.

272
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,096
Right now, what Xiao Se doesn't want to do is talk about his past,

273
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:59,664
and Ye Ruoyi carries Xiao Se's past.

274
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,040
The fragrance of sunken light and valley.

275
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,820
It must be Miss Ruoyi.

276
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,736
It's been a long time since we last met, Your Highness.

277
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:34,120
If I hadn't smelled the unique sunken light and valley fragrance of the Ye family,

278
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,576
would you have intended to just walk past?

279
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,012
I haven't seen you in years, Your Highness.

280
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:44,120
I thought you looked familiar, but didn't dare confirm it.

281
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,008
I hear you've been recuperating here.

282
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,640
Are you feeling better?

283
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,300
City Lord Sikong is very skilled in medicine, my health is much better than before.

284
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,600
That's good.

285
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,020
You and Chuhe have been friends since childhood.

286
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,204
- It must be a pleasure for you to meet again in this city.
 - What?

287
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,548
Hasn't Brother Chuhe been missing for a long time?

288
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,160
You haven't seen him?

289
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,400
I've always lived alone in this house, and I don't usually associate with the people in the city.

290
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm here to pick up some herbs today.

291
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,820
He has been in this city for quite some time already.

292
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,956
I'm here to find him.

293
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,352
You came to find him, to catch and take him back?

294
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:30,980
Catch?

295
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,524
I'm here to take him back to Tianqi.

296
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,612
Imperial Father has already absolved him of all his sins.

297
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:46,016
He will still be the Sixth Prince of Beili, Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

298
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,320
Well... that's great, then.

299
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,940
But he has refused.

300
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,240
I've given him three days.

301
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,300
You've been friends with him since childhood.

302
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,100
Help me talk some sense into him.

303
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,584
With Brother Chuhe's temperament, it's hard for him to change his mind.

304
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:12,300
But you are one of the few people I know... who can persuade him.

305
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,096
I'll try then.

306
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,320
Thank you.

307
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,692

308
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,104
You already know that I sent someone to look for Chuhe?

309
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Your Majesty, you deliberately let me know about this, right?

310
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,580
Yes.

311
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,160
Chuhe was close to you back then.

312
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,640
I was thinking that if you knew the whereabouts of Chuhe,

313
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,456
you might... be able to help me.

314
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,840
After so many years, now that he's willing to show himself,

315
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,560
maybe he's willing to return to Tianqi.

316
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,252
Do you really think so, General Ye?

317
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,424
If I were you, I wouldn't issue any decrees.

318
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,036
I would just take the army and surround Xueyue City.

319
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,896
This is indeed your style.

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,440
But I'm afraid I'm pushing him too hard.

321
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,480
With that child's temperament, he's going to fight against me again.

322
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,060
These past few years, I can't help but think about the past,

323
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,260
and my guilt towards Chuhe grows.

324
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,340
This child is so stubborn.

325
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,408
When I didn't look for him, he disappeared without a trace for four years.

326
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,492
I'm afraid of missing this opportunity.

327
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:43,020
I'm afraid I won't be able to hide the fact that I want to bring Chuhe back to the palace for long.

328
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,520
I need you to take care of this for me, General Ye.

329
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Yes, Sir.

330
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,380
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

331
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,120
You may leave now.

332
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,532

333
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,124
What brings you here?

334
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:22,748
His Majesty sent Prince Bai to summon Xiao Chuhe back to Tianqi.

335
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,380
I already expected that.

336
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,560
Is that person really coming back?

337
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,068
Not necessarily.

338
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,860
Who are you choosing?

339
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,800
My choice is the one whose name is written in the Dragon Seal Scroll

340
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,680
on the tablet in Tai'an Hall.

341
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,780
But there is nothing written on that scroll.

342
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:53,640
While we can ultimately influence the name written

343
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,716
on the scroll.

344
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,960
Let me remind you.

345
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,736
The Five Eunuchs are acting on orders, so don't speak treacherously.

346
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,336
I only said influence, not designate.

347
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:17,320
Jade Deity, you're being too sensitive, aren't you?

348
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,408
Jin Yan is right.

349
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:23,600
In the past, we could have waited for His Majesty to make a decision.

350
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,824
But the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe, has shown up again.

351
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:29,120
Everything has changed.

352
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,500
I know that some of you are Prince Bai's teachers,

353
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,060
and some of you are loyal followers of Prince Chi.

354
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,084
Xiao Chuhe's presence is the greatest threat to you.

355
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,300
You shouldn't have told His Majesty the news without discussing it with us,

356
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,800
and more so, you shouldn't have reported it without knowing whether

357
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,216
that man really is Xiao Chuhe.

358
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,060
That's right.

359
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,560
Tell us what happened in the Kingdom of Yushi.

360
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,556
What are the chances of that person being Xiao Chuhe?

361
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,820
You aren't qualified for this.

362
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,780
You aren't permitted to discuss the affairs of the princes.

363
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,060
 Sir.

364
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,900
Dozens of groups of people have left Tianqi City in the past year.

365
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,476
Where have they all gone?

366
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,960
They have gone to Xueyue City, Wushuang City, Muliang City,

367
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,560
the Lei family of Jiangnan, the Tang Clan of Shu,

368
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,860
the Wen family of Lingnan, Mount Wangcheng, Mount Wudang,

369
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,060
Shaolin Temple, Yunlin Temple,

370
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,156
as well as the unreachable Tian Wai Tian,

371
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:47,012
and Dark River, that is nowhere to be found.

372
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes.

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Both Prince Bai and Prince Chi have sent men to nearly all the great martial arts sects.

374
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,300
Now that the disputes in the court have not yet ended,

375
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,696
the rivalry in the martial arts world has already begun.

376
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:02,020
That's right.

377
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,728
You're all right.

378
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Jin Yan, did you just say you wanted to influence the name on the scroll?

379
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,900
My dear Sir. Sir.

380
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,000
Sir. I have made a slip of the tongue.

381
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,980
As long as you know.

382
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,820
I know you each have your own thoughts.

383
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,416
But the Five Eunuchs shall be subject to His Majesty's will.

384
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:46,300
His Majesty's thoughts are unpredictable, and it's like being a companion to a tiger.

385
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,640
If you are satisfied, you won't be humiliated. If you know moderation, you won't be in danger.

386
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,520
In this way, you can live a long life.

387
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,692
If any of you don't understand this,

388
00:26:57,692 --> 00:27:01,772
you should quit being one of the Five Eunuchs before it's too late.

389
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,648
 We wouldn't dare, Sir.

390
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,860
Although you have never made a choice,

391
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,404
I know you have always liked the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe.

392
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,352
Why must we make a choice?

393
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,364
These princes were all good friends when they were little,

394
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:32,240
and it is only because of our own interests

395
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,716
that they've become what they are today.

396
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440

397
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,268

398
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,660
 My book!

399
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,500
 Second Brother, I'll get it.

400
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,408
 Chuhe, be careful.

401
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,348
 Second Brother, you should stop reading.

402
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,700
 Look, the book is all wet.

403
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,520
 Just play with me for a while.

404
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,860
 Chuhe, you've been scolded by the school teacher every day,

405
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,740
 but you want me to be scolded too?

406
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,940
 Second Brother, actually, I can recite the content of this book already.

407
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,780
 I just want to make that old man angry is all.

408
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,520
 Don't eat it!

409
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
 Look, your hands are so dirty.

410
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,340
 Go back and wash up before eating.

411
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,140
 All right, Second Brother.

412
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,680
 - Don't eat it!  
 - Don't eat it.

413
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,620
What shouldn't be eaten?

414
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,260
Why are you here?

415
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,320
I brought some snacks for you. Here.

416
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,420
Someone who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.

417
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,700
You have a favor to ask of me. Say it.

418
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,120
It's nothing, I just want to ask you something.

419
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,240
What does the Prince want from you?

420
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,348
Elder Yin said you were classmates.

421
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,960
We just caught up on old times. Nothing serious.

422
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,380
All right. It's okay if you have secrets to hide from us.

423
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,100
If you don't want to talk about it, I won't ask.

424
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,340
Well, the tournament of marriage is finally over for good.

425
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,340
A big problem has been settled.

426
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,020
Why don't we go for a stroll in the city to take a breather?

427
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,840
Get to the point.

428
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,740
I haven't seen Miss Ye for a long time.

429
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,880
I'd like you to come with me to visit her.

430
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,800
Coward. Go and see her yourself.

431
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,580
I'm too shy to do that!

432
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,960
She is a good friend of Sikong Qianluo.

433
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,200
- You should find Sikong Qianluo for help. 
 - I went to find Qianluo, but she wasn't around.

434
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,800
I get it now.

435
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,180
You only came to me when you got desperate, didn't you?

436
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,340
No.

437
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,500
Xiao Se, why don't you just accompany me there?

438
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,208
Where's your sassiness from yesterday?

439
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,616
- We'll talk after you've finished these. 
 - What?

440
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
Xiao Se!

441
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,844
The best taste of this Hongshan Zhuyan will be lost

442
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,276
if it's cooked a moment longer.

443
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

444
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,100
Zang Ming and I were taking a walk in the city and we suddenly smelled the scent of this tea.

445
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,300
I was wondering who in Xueyue City likes to drink tea from Tianqi City.

446
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,480
I didn't expect it would be you again.

447
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,540
I haven't been home for a long time, so I wanted to have a taste of home.

448
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,880
Your Highness, I'm sorry to have distracted you.

449
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,660
Aren't you going to invite me for some tea?

450
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,700
Your Highness, please have a seat.

451
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,340
Xiao Se.

452
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,720
Have you thought of a reason for dragging me to see Miss Ye in such a hurry?

453
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,420
What reason do I need?

454
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,640
We're just passing by and we're thirsty, so we want a drink!

455
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,260
If you just want a drink, then you're in luck.

456
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,300
What do you mean?

457
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:39,200
The finest Hongshan Zhuyan brewed with melted snow from Mount Cang,

458
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,184
- the taste... 
 - I don't get it, don't get it at all.

459
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,188
Right, it's like casting pearls before swine.

460
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,312
Great tea indeed.

461
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh right, Miss Ruoyi, did you see Chuhe yesterday?

462
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,300
I did.

463
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,276
But he seems a bit different from before.

464
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,940
How so?

465
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,816
He used to speak in a loud voice, beaming with joy,

466
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:19,100
as if he had absolute confidence in everything in this world.

467
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,456
But now, he has become much quieter and lazier.

468
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,240
Yes.

469
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,620
Chuhe has changed a lot.

470
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,476
Did he tell you where he has been all these years?

471
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:37,848
He said he opened an inn

472
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:41,824
in a place backed up against green hills, with clear water in front of it.

473
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,680
 Miss Ruoyi, Xiao Se and I were passing by and came to ask you for a cup of tea.

474
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,420
Miss... Miss Ruoyi, I'm sorry to bother you.

475
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,628
Young man, spare the formalities.

476
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,140
Sit down.

477
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,240
May I know your name?

478
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect,

479
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,060
and I've just been accepted as a disciple of the Xueyue Sword Deity.

480
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,240
So you're from the Lei Clan.

481
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,032
Why don't you just tell him your date of birth as well?

482
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,640
You're here too?

483
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,464
Just passing by, I came with this young man to ask for a cup of tea.

484
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:33,660
There's tea.

485
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,972
It's just that I'm a bit unskilled at brewing tea,

486
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:40,612
so I'm afraid I'm wasting this fine Hongshan Zhuyan.

487
00:33:40,612 --> 00:33:42,096
It's all right if it's spoiled!

488
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,340
I can't taste the difference anyway.

489
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,000
Brother Lei, aren't you afraid of getting burned?

490
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,180
I practice a technique called Fire Infusion.

491
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,600
The heat of this tea is nothing.

492
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Miss Ruoyi, one more please.

493
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,680
I should just pour you a cup of hot water,

494
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,280
so as not to waste this Hongshan Zhuyan.

495
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,300
Xiao Se. I finished it in one gulp because I was thirsty.

496
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,940
I know about tasting tea too.

497
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,060
Miss Ruoyi told me that she went to see you yesterday.

498
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,380
Miss Ruoyi went to see you yesterday?!

499
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,900
Me?

500
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,992
Yesterday, Miss Ruoyi also passed by my courtyard and came in to have a cup of tea.

501
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,152
She asked me about Tianqi.

502
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,040
That's good then.

503
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,529
Miss Ruoyi is alone in Xueyue City.

504
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:58,040
As a friend from Tianqi City, you should take care of her.

505
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020

506
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,500
 But... Why should I be the Vermilion Bird?

507
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,780
 It sounds so girly. I want to be the Azure Dragon!

508
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,540
 No, Azure Dragon is mine!

509
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,120
 All right, all right.

510
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,000
 It's just a code name. What's wrong with Vermilion Bird?

511
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,140
 Changfeng, look.

512
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,020
 Lianyue got a tortoise, and he doesn't complain.

513
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,780
 I want to beat you up.

514
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,400
Father.

515
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,960
- Father. You asked for me? 
 - Qianluo.

516
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,368
Come, sit down.

517
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:32,680
Xiao Se was of great help this time, did you thank him?

518
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,220
I did. I did.

519
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,816
As your daughter, I know what to do.

520
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:38,220
Good girl.

521
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,740
Qianluo, look, Xiao Se usually goes against you all the time,

522
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,900
but this time, in the tournament of marriage, he was so busy trying to help you out.

523
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,600
So I wonder if he's up to something.

524
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,480
What do you think of Xiao Se?

525
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,496
What do you mean?

526
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,440
You're blushing. You're blushing.

527
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,920
Father, what are you thinking about?

528
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,360
Qianluo, I'm your father.

529
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,156
Tell me what's on your mind, okay?

530
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,640

531
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,260
What an exquisite token.

532
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,540
Father, where did you get this?

533
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,764
Is it for me?

534
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,720
It's for you. Of course, you can have it.

535
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,880
However, once you take this token, you'll have to take on a great responsibility.

536
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,620
What responsibility?

537
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,572
It's a long story.

538
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,300
Miss Ruoyi, please help me with my request.

539
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,460
I'll remember to.

540
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,140
I won't bother you all catching up then.

541
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,500
Farewell.

542
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,424
Zang Ming, let's go.

543
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Xiao Se. Prince Bai's subordinate doesn't seem to like you.

544
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,260
Who knows?

545
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,220
Maybe we just don't get along.

546
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,800
Are you done? Let's go if you're done.

547
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,580
- Why don't you stay a little longer? 
 - Right!

548
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,844
Since Miss Ruoyi has said so, let's stay for a while then.

549
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,820
Oh right, I went to pick up my medicine from the medicine hall yesterday

550
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,540
and heard them talking about ascending the tower.

551
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,760
Why don't you tell me about it?

552
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,320
Speaking of Dengtian Tower,

553
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,520
I went straight to the 16th floor to challenge the Xueyue Sword Deity.

554
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,240
That's a pretty interesting story, indeed.

555
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,974
 The tower keeper of the 13th floor,

556
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:55,774
Luo Mingxuan, didn't want to compete with me in a martial arts match,

557
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,700
 but he wanted to make a bet with me.

558
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,880
And when I met my martial uncle,

559
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,644
 I used all the skills of the Lei Clan,

560
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:14,940
as well as the sword, Shabu, that my master gave me.

561
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,580
When I reached the 16th floor, I roared,

562
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,380
"Lei Wujie of Thunderbolt Sect would like to challenge the Xueyue Sword Deity!"

563
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,420
Wait a minute.

564
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,836
Is this story about you alone?

565
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:30,660
What about Brother Xiao Se? What was he doing?

566
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,740
Him?

567
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,384
He's playing hide-and-seek with Qianluo.

568
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:37,100
He also had his fortune told. Right.

569
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,780
Fortune-telling?

570
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,580
What fortune was told?

571
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,740
That's right, Xiao Se. What did the fortune-teller tell you?

572
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,600
I asked about one thing.

573
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,900
- What is it? 
 - Returning.

574
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,480
Returning?

575
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,620
What was the result?

576
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,320
There wasn't a result.

577
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,880
Because halfway through... I regretted it.

578
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,716
Since you went, why didn't you ask for the result?

579
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,200
Because then I realized

580
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,300
that I never cared about the thing I asked about.

581
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,240
So what do you care about?

582
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
He must care about money.

583
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,320
It's expensive to have a fortune told by the disciple of Mount Wangcheng's Master.

584
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,620
You're right.

585
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,400
It really is about the money?

586
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,220
You've finished your story about Dengtian Tower.

587
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,620
Let's go.

588
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,440
Seriously. You keep urging me to leave.

589
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,340
All right, fine.

590
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,220
Miss Ruoyi, we'll come and visit you another time.

591
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,820
You can come every day.

592
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,416
I'm lonely here, so if you two come, you can at least talk to me.

593
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,840
All right! I'll come again tomorrow!

594
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,300
No, I'll come again tomorrow morning!

595
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,280
Let's go.

596
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,800
See you.

597
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,700
Returning?

598
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,740
Back then, when the princes of Beili were competing with each other,

599
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,220
the whole of Tianqi City was in chaos.

600
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,860
Prince Langya had gathered four great masters

601
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,340
to form the Four Guardians of Tianqi to restore peace to the city.

602
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,900
And I was the Vermilion Bird.

603
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,564
We eventually succeeded.

604
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
I get it now.

605
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,172
It means that when you got this token,

606
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:31,473
you took on the responsibility of guarding Tianqi.

607
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:36,864
And now that Tianqi is at peace and the dynasties have changed.

608
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,900
All the guardians will have to find new successors.

609
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,620
And the new successors are supposed to protect

610
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,824
the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe.

611
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,680
Qianluo, can you take on this responsibility?

612
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,352
My daughter is so smart.

613
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:59,460
With only a few sentences, you understood everything so clearly.

614
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,144
Now, I decide that this token...

615
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,640
I won't.

616
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,056
I remember after I was born, you've never been to Tianqi City, right?

617
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:11,460
No, I have not.

618
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,924
Then, naturally, you don't know Xiao Chuhe.

619
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:17,220
But Xiao Chuhe is a man that Prince Langya values.

620
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,720
He...

621
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,748
I don't care who he values.

622
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:27,532
If I, Sikong Qianluo, is going to protect someone. It'll only be someone I respect.

623
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,000
You...

624
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,780
 I don't want to be some Medicine King.

625
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,610
 I want to be the one and only Spear Deity in the world.

626
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,100
Father, I remember a statement a great master once told me.

627
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,620
Youths must have their own martial arts world.

628
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:15,020

629
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,380
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

630
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,760
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

631
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,880
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

632
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,460
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

633
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,620
♫  The roaring fate  ♫

634
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,060
♫  Sweeping away the fog of time  ♫

635
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,180
♫  The past is desolate  ♫

636
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,880
♫  Waiting for the ride to the highest heaven  ♫

637
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,820
♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

638
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,460
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫
