00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,960
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,920
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,300
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,520
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,400
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,500
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,740
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17

♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,000
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,070

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,220
Your Highness, I thought this time we would be able to see those cunning old fellows in Wushuang City.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,640
I never expected to see a city lord as young as him.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,000
This new city lord who has a bad memory,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,700
is much harder to deal with than those five old guys.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,860
Your Highness, was that why you didn't involve them in our plan?

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,580
That's right.

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,620
When we play GO, we need to have room to maneuver.

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,440
Wushuang City is the maneuver.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,760
Then, Your Highness, where are we heading next?

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,220
To go meet Jingxia.

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,480
He said he has something important to discuss with me.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,220
The Ninth Prince?

36
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,780
The Ninth Prince is...

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,740
What are you mumbling about?

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,980
The Ninth Prince is...

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,400
What's wrong with Jingxia?

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,900
He went looking for the Dark River.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,600
What?

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,900
Who's there?

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,280
The Leader sent me here to receive you.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,360
The Leader, knows that I'm coming?

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,760
I heard from people that there's a river that cannot be seen.

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,220
You can only barely see it on the darkest of nights following the moonlight.

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,080
If I follow the river,

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,560
I can find Dark River, the number one assassin in the League of Assassins.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,860
I never expected it to be true.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,000
There are three families in Dark River.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,940
The weapons experts, the Su family.

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,980
The internal energy fist experts, the Xie family.

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,140
and the medical experts, the Mu family.

55
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,360
The three families are the masters for the sect,

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,940
and the Leader is their head.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,080
You must be... the head of the Su family.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,940
Su Muyu.

59
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,580
That's right. Su Muyu is the name.

60
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,040
I even heard that your name is related to your umbrella.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,300
Within your umbrella are 18 longswords.

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,180
When you release your killing intent, 18 of them will be discharged from your umbrella,

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,020
just like the evening rain  (muyu)

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,240
You understand us quite well.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,820
Of course, since I need to do business with you all.

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,460
Knowing us too well is a dangerous thing.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,400
Leader, I've brought him here.

68
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,520
Greetings, Leader.

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,660
Greetings, Xie Qidao, Head of the Xie family.

70
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,100
Greetings, Mu Yumo, Head of the Mu family.

71
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,040
Seems like you know us quite well.

72
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,140
No one dares step into the Falling Stars Pavilion

73
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,940
and do business with the Dark River without any knowledge of you all.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,220
Since you know who we are,

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,860
you should know that doing business with us is very dangerous.

76
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,040
The riskier certain things are, the more meaningful they are, am I right?

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,480
You're right.

78
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,700

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,680
Then... what kind of meaningful event have you brought to us today?

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,340
I want the Dark River to flow into Tianqi.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,960

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,440

83
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,860
 Muyu,

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,700
 how long has it been since you last fought together with her?

85
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,660
 It's been more than 12 years.

86
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,340
 Now that you're venturing into the martial arts world again, you and she will become enemies.

87
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,820
 I'm sure you're unwilling.

88
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,040
 I don't agree with dragging Dark River into such matters.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,120
 However, I know you have your reasons.

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,540
 I'm a member of the Su family. So I will follow the Leader's order.

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,200
 I've always been looking for the shore on the other side.

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,400
 I hope that we can clear our identities as assassins after getting ashore

93
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,160
 and be above board once again.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,780
 And this event will be our best chance at redeeming ourselves.

95
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,560
 However, many people will die.

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,100
 Death is the most common thing within Dark River.

97
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,000
Although you've already stated your identity in the letter,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,540
I wish to hear your introduction personally.

99
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm the Sixth Prince of the Beili Kingdom,

100
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,220
Xiao Chuhe.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm Lei Wujie from the Lei family of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

102
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm here to pay a visit.

103
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,220
I can't hear you.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,260
This is how you challenge Mount Wangcheng? Can you raise your voice a bit?

105
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,260
It's our first time here. Shouldn't we act courteously?

106
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,100
They didn't invite you to be their guest.

107
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,740
You're a disciple of Xueyue City and the younger brother of a sword deity.

108
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,700
You should be imposing.

109
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,080
That's right.

110
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm the disciple of Xueyue City and the younger brother of a sword deity.

111
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,620
What haven't I seen before?

112
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,960
What are you guys doing?

113
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,660

114
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,660
The Tingyu Sword?

115
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm Lei Wujie from the Lei family of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect, here to...

116
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,980
What are you doing here?

117
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,780
I was just imitating you in challenging Mount Wangcheng.

118
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,080
Are you trying to kill me here?

119
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,160
Who's there?

120
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,120
- Master. 
 - Grand Martial Uncle.

121
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,260
So, you're Zhao Yuzhen?

122
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,800
Tingyu?

123
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,700
How did that happen?

124
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,400
I felt Tingyu's sword intent just now.

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,580
I thought she had come.

126
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,180
Who are you?

127
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,480
Since you don't know who I am, I'll beat my name into your head!

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,620
He's out of his mind.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,340
Extinguish Thunder.

130
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,300
Judging from your technique, you must have come from the same sect as the one who rides a crane.

131
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,360
The Lei family is truly interesting.

132
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,040
Why do you always want to come to Mount Wangcheng?

133
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,980
Try this technique for size!

134
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,560
I inherited this sword art from a sword deity. It's called Beautiful Day.

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Zhao Yuzhen is protected by zhenqi.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,920
You won't be able to harm him no matter what you do.

137
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,340
You're her disciple indeed.

138
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,300
Did she tell you to come see me? How is she doing?

139
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,440
I was just trying to vent my sister's anger on her behalf!

140
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,940
You're her younger brother?

141
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,400
You have so many questions. Why don't you go ask her yourself?

142
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,640
She said... she wanted me to follow her down the mountain after her third visit.

143
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,340
I've been waiting for her for many years,

144
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,240
but she's never come.

145
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,780
She came!

146
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,580
She did? That's impossible.

147
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,540
I know everything there is to know on this mountain.

148
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,580
Especially if she had come.

149
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,520
Back then, you were cultivating in seclusion.

150
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,460
After that, Lei Yunhe came here to challenge you.

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,680
 You took one of his arms and chased him off the mountain.

152
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,620
 However, you were seriously wounded too.

153
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,920
 You almost went berserk.

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,340
You rested and recuperated with the support of all the celestial masters.

155
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,340
 During that period, Li Hanyi did come.

156
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,460
 All of Mount Wangcheng should know about it.

157
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,300

158
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,300
But... I truly had no idea.

159
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,320
Master, back then, I wasn't your disciple yet.

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,440
Back then, I wasn't born yet, Grand Martial Uncle.

161
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Yuzhen.

162
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,540
Martial Uncle Yin.

163
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,780
Martial Uncle Yin, what exactly is going on?

164
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,160
Do you remember the last day of your master's cultivation in seclusion?

165
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,080
 Yuzhen, you cannot leave the mountain your entire life.

166
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,080
 I've predicted your destiny.

167
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,520
 Master, I've never doubted your words.

168
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,880
 No one has ever won against the heavens.

169
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,020
 However, I wish to try and see if I can deceive the heavens.

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,840
 How?

171
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,520
 Try to reach the Mental Phase.

172
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
 The Mental Phase?

173
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,320
 Once you do so, even the heavens can no longer restrict you.

174
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,900
In order to help you achieve that phase,

175
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,620
the entire Mount Wangcheng was sealed off

176
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,380
and no one was allowed to enter the mountain.

177
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,560
But on that day, Lei Hong came and demanded a duel with you.

178
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,620
Our disciples couldn't stop him.

179
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,000
Just as he was about to enter the mountain, Li Hanyi came.

180
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,840
 I was too ignorant.

181
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,360
 You should return.

182
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,980
 I'll personally pay you a visit when you become a sword deity.

183
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,600
 However, you shall not enter Mount Wangcheng today.

184
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,840
 Sword deity?

185
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,380
 I will definitely become a sword deity.

186
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,380

187
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,200
 Is he doing better?

188
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,460
 He has regained consciousness with the help of the celestial masters.

189
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,180
 However, it'll take a long time for him to recover.

190
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,600
 That's good. Master Lu, please tell him that I was here.

191
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,900
You should know what happened next.

192
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,200
In the end, you couldn't win against the heavens.

193
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,060
Both you and Master Lu were hurt.

194
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,860
Master Lu passed away not long after that.

195
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,300
Since then, no one has spoken about it.

196
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,940
Why did no one say anything? My sister is a prideful person.

197
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,860
She couldn't take him away after three visits.

198
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,660
She might never come again.

199
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,640
Saint Zhao, we're heading to the hero banquet held by the Lei Clan.

200
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,860
The Xueyue Sword Deity will join us.

201
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,540
Will you join us?

202
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,980
And my master. He is Lei Hong. He's a member of the Lei Clan too.

203
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,120
Young man, what will happen if I don't leave the mountain?

204
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,840
My sister might meet my master.

205
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,120
And my master might not let her leave him again.

206
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,320
And what if I leave the mountain?

207
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,530
Everything will be under your control.

208
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,140
You're right.

209
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,920
So, are you leaving the mountain or not?

210
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,240
In the Peach Blossom Village, there is a peach blossom hut.

211
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,280
A peach blossom lover lives in the peach blossom hut.

212
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,460
From day to day half-drunk, half-sober he would appear.

213
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,780
The peach flowers blossom and fall from year to year.

214
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,560
You two should leave.

215
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,580
What...

216
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,520
Let's go then.

217
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,580
What's with him and his stupid poem?

218
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,360
Will Zhao Yuzhen leave the mountain or not?

219
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
No one can tell what my master is thinking.

220
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,320
If your master leaves the mountains will there really be a massive change?

221
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,120
Master hasn't really left the mountain before. So no one knows.

222
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,540
Maybe... my great master tricked him,

223
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,780
so that he would stay on Mount Wangcheng forever.

224
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,580
Great Master isn't as bored as you are.

225
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,740
Masters of the sect have their lives determined by the Heavens.

226
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,220
What Great Master had said really might be true.

227
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,880
Determined by the Heavens?

228
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,660
Enough already.

229
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,360
Whether Zhao Yuzhen comes or not depends on your sister and himself.

230
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,300
It has nothing to do with you.

231
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,600
You'd already said what you were supposed to say.

232
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,280
We should leave now.

233
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,240
No matter if it's Li Hanyi or Zhao Yuzhen,

234
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,660
with their powers that can help them travel 1,000 li per day,

235
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,880
to get to Lei Fortress isn't an issue at all.

236
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,720
But us? We'll be laughingstocks if we don't depart now.

237
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,800
- Let's go. 
 - You're right.

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
I don't know anything about the Heavens.

239
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,280
I only believe in one thing, where there's a will, there's a way.

240
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,680
- Farewell. 
 - Farewell.

241
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,660
I forgot to ask you something.

242
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,400
How did you convince your sister to meet Lei Hong together with you?

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,780
Judging from her personality, she would never agree to it.

244
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,420
Actually, I tricked my sister.

245
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,980
You know how to trick people?

246
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,200
I lied to her and said that my master is terminally ill.

247
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,700
I said he wanted to see her one more time, so he has no regrets before he dies.

248
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
So my sister agreed.

249
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,300
Does your master know that you jinxed him?

250
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,200
He won't care about anything I say, as long as he can see my sister.

251
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,000
Wouldn't have expected this of you, Lei Wujie.

252
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,140
You've turned cunning too.

253
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,180
When it comes to that, I need to call you Master.

254
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,360
Last question. Are you sure you know the way to Lei Fortress?

255
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,780
Don't worry. I've lived in Lei Fortress for over a decade.

256
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,360
I remember its scent. So I will never forget it.

257
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,820
Follow me.

258
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,940
You're already heading the wrong way. Get back here!

259
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,560
Look for yourself. Idiot.

260
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,660
That person isn't Xiao Chuhe.

261
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,800
Xiao Chuhe has disappeared for four years.

262
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,260
If he appeared again, he would definitely be different.

263
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,800
You've seen him before?

264
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,740
I once saw him from a long distance when I was in Tianqi City.

265
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,900
Back then, I received an order to kill him.

266
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,220
However, someone acted first.

267
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,840
I thought he was dead all these years.

268
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,500
Does the Leader know about this?

269
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,220
It doesn't matter if the Leader knows about this.

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,460
It doesn't matter if that Xiao Chuhe is the real deal or not.

271
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,640
Dark River just needs an opportunity to set foot in Tianqi City.

272
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,940
You're right.

273
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,740
We've been living in darkness for too long.

274
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,580
Are you going to kill those two youngsters?

275
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,740
With your strength, it might cause too much of a fuss.

276
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,220
I'll head southward to stop someone.

277
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,900
It seems like that person is heading to the Lei Clan too.

278
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,140
She's a variable in this operation.

279
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,260
What kind of person is she for you to be so cautious?

280
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,520
The Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

281
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,140
Who are you? Why are you blocking our path?

282
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,780
Lei Wujie, these people are different from the ones before.

283
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,540
You need to understand something.

284
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,000
They're really here to take lives.

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,560
- Who exactly are they? 
 - Dark River.

286
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,520
Dark River?

287
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,340
Do you mean the assassin syndicate that's occupied the top eight slots of the League of Assassins?

288
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,920
That's right, my surname is Su.

289
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,220
I'm Su Changli of the Su family.

290
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,820
It's my first time meeting assassins who would tell us their names.

291
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,020
I told you two my name, because you both will die soon.

292
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,340
 Su Changli. He's an expert with big swords.

293
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,920
 He has a dominant aura.

294
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,060
 Seems like he's the leader of the trio.

295
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,760
Xiao Se, this is interesting to say the least.

296
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,080
The first opponents we met on our adventure were assassins too.

297
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,280
But this time, Eldest Senior Brother isn't around.

298
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,220
We can only depend on ourselves.

299
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,360
You're wrong.

300
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,100
We can only depend on you.

301
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,540
Xiao Se!

302
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,800
 Master, is there anything I should take note of when I go on adventures in the future?

303
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
 Just remember this.

304
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,740
 Speed is of the essence.

305
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,300
 What if speed doesn't help against my opponents?

306
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,140
 Just remember this then.

307
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,980
 Run if you can't win.

308
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,460
Master, you have great foresight indeed.

309
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,680
However, even if Walking on Clouds doesn't consume any inner force, it's extremely exhausting.

310
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm in trouble.

311
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,700
 Initially, I wanted to distract some of them

312
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,560
 so that I could meet up with Lei Wujie after he defeated that one.

313
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,040
 But judging from the situation, I think I can no longer run.

314
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,180
 And Lei Wujie hasn't gotten rid of that other one yet.

315
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,680
Only I can go after a scoundrel like Xiao Se.

316
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,700
You two have no right.

317
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,420
Beware of them.

318
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,860
I know you can't defeat these bandits,

319
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,260
But I'm not as weak as you.

320
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,160
Are you okay?

321
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
That was dangerous, you know?

322
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,700
Aren't you afraid that you'll hit me by accident?

323
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,740
I'm not one of the Tang family. I had no choice but to try my luck.

324
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,980
Why do you have Eldest Senior Brother's weapon with you?

325
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,580
He lost them to me after a drinking game.

326
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,600
Enough. Let's hurry and find Lei Wujie.

327
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
He might be in danger.

328
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,280
That guy called Su Changli, I'm afraid I've underestimated him.

329
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,220
Not bad at all. You've survived this long under my sword.

330
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
You can be proud of yourself.

331
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,260
I'm not done yet.

332
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,660
Although you're no match for me, you had a chance to escape.

333
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,440
Why do you have to go all out to fight me?

334
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,380
What if you go after my friends after I leave?

335
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,580
Good. You're a loyal person. What a great man.

336
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,580
It's worth cutting your head off.

337
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,020
Senior Sister?

338
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,880
Xiao Se, are you okay?

339
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Those assassins can't do anything to me.

340
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,820
You two would've been dead if I hadn't gotten here in time.

341
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Cut the crap!

342
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,840
Let's take a break. Take a break.

343
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,500
Did we almost die just now?

344
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,800
That's right.

345
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,480
I thought Second Master was guarding over you two?

346
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,640
You have to ask this idiot why he had to take such a huge detour to Mount Wangcheng.

347
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,340
Senior Sister, how did you find us?

348
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,320
 I can't just tell them that I've been following them right after they left the city.

349
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,620
I'm going to complain about you two to Second Master.

350
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,280
She'll teach you two a lesson!

351
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Let's go.

352
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,920
Senior Sister.

353
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,700
Li Hanyi of Xueyue City.

354
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,100
Su Muyu of Dark River.

355
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,820
Do you remember that we once joined hands to fight against someone many years ago?

356
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,520
I still remember the scene as if it was yesterday.

357
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,540
But it looks like you're trying to kill me today.

358
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,200
You cannot kill me by yourself.

359
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm afraid no one in this world can kill the Xueyue Sword Deity.

360
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,580
What if I interfere?

361
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,080
So, the two family heads of Dark River are joining hands?

362
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,640
I've never heard of someone who's lucky enough to have such an honor.

363
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,340
However, this still isn't enough to kill me.

364
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,200
I have 18 swords with me.

365
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm willing to break all of them today.

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,320
Sword Deity, I just hope that you can return to Xueyue City.

367
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,220

368
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,220
Catch me if you can!

369
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,620
Take care.

370
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,300
Hurry up!

371
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,140
These lanterns are beautiful.

372
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,920
You should buy one.

373
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,880
Pick one.

374
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,700
- I lost it. 
 - You lost it?

375
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,840
We were chased by that guy with a huge sword for so many days.

376
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,620
Now, we've finally lost him.

377
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,000
But you're telling me you've lost all of our money?

378
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,420
T-That Su Changli's sword was so big!

379
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,300
I lost the money while I was fighting him!

380
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,580
You can't blame me for that!

381
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,120
Cut the crap.

382
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,060
- Qianluo... 
 - I don't have any money.

383
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,700
I snuck out.

384
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,320
Why did you sneak out again, Senior Sister?

385
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,900
And you didn't bring any money with you?

386
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,480
You...

387
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,320
Can't I just take a walk outside?

388
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,500
You should at least have some money with you.

389
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,680
And you don't need to come all the way to Xiao Se's side, right?

390
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,480
- A few days ago, you... 
 - You...

391
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,140
You brat.

392
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,900
Go and pawn your swords first.

393
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
That won't do!

394
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,460
If I pawn my two swords right now,

395
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,140
Su Changli will chop us up right after we leave the city.

396
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,340
Even if we manage to escape from him, my master and my sister will chop me up.

397
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,780
What should we do then?

398
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,260
Even if Su Changli doesn't kill us, we'll die of hunger in Jiuxiao City.

399
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,520
You two, wait here for me. I'll come up with a solution.

400
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,580
- What can you possibly come up with?
 - Hey!

401
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,980
What an airhead.

402
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,520
It's so crowded.

403
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,240
Look at those lanterns. They're beautiful.

404
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Where did that brat go?

405
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,680
- The night scenery is amazing. 
 - Miss. You're so pretty.

406
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,480
You should ask your husband to buy some flowers for you.

407
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,300
I don't like flowers.

408
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,380
I think the word "husband" is more concerning.

409
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,860
But look, everyone has flowers in their hands.

410
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,440
We're celebrating the Flower Deity Festival here now.

411
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,040
The ladies here have the habit of arranging flowers during this festival.

412
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,660
Do you like this?

413
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,720
We'll buy one then.

414
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
When visiting a foreign land, follow the customs of those who live in it.

415
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,180
Treat it as a blessing

416
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,220
from the Flower Deity.

417
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,880
You should buy one.

418
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,720
♫   The flowers bloom and fall like rain  ♫

419
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,260
They're lighting fireworks for the Flower Deity Festival!

420
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,240
It's so beautiful.

421
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,540
♫  That day I met you was in that same season  ♫

422
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,680
♫   Flipped through all the joys and sorrows of life  ♫

423
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,060
♫   Seeing all that flourishes from the beginning is like seeing everything for the first time  ♫

424
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:21,120
♫   From now on, the dream of riding a horse around the world is up to fate  ♫

425
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,480
What are you thinking?

426
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,660
I was reminded of the fireworks festival I would join every year during the Lantern Festival.

427
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,840
When I was little, my view was always blocked.

428
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,360
So my father would carry me on his shoulders.

429
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,020
What about you? What are you thinking about?

430
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,360
Me?

431
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,020
I was thinking that the Lei Clan would surely be furious if they knew

432
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,480
people were using their firearms like this.

433
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,660
♫   A toast to the Heavens  ♫

434
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,780
That's amazing!

435
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,820
It's a gunpowder show! A gunpowder show!

436
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,400
Ladies and gentlemen, come and take a look!

437
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,540
Come and take a look!

438
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm about to start performing!

439
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,260
Excellent!

440
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,380
- Excellent! 
 - Again!

441
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,900
♫   The water ripples faintly, giving life to the mist  ♫

442
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,500
- Amazing! 
 - All right!

443
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,880
Please support me if you have the money!

444
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,220
If you don't, then please applaud!

445
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,000
Thank you!

446
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,260
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

447
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,380
- The Lei Clan is unfortunate to have him. 
 - Thank you.

448
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,720
Thank you.

449
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,900
The smell of money.

450
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,740
- You brat. 
 - Xiao Se, we won't starve to death now!

451
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,400
Is that so?

452
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,920
If you keep this up, everyone from 100 li away will know

453
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,620
that there's a silly disciple of the Lei Clan here, using his explosives as fireworks.

454
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,760
By then, we'll die either way.

455
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,480
Let's drop the topic for now.

456
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,460
We should have a nice meal first.

457
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,540
Brother, I was distracted by the fireworks just now.

458
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,420
You haven't paid me yet.

459
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,820
Boss Xiao?

460
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,200
The stingy Boss Xiao actually bought Qianluo flowers?

461
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,020
Cut the crap. Pay for it.

462
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,280
Fine.

463
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,440
Here you go.

464
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,540
- Thank you, Brother. 
 - Go on now.

465
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,920
Let's go and have something nice to eat!

466
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,800
Let's go.

467
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520

468
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,540

469
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,160
- Master. 
 - You're back.

470
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,780
Ye Ruoyi greets Elder Tang Lianyue.

471
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,240
The daughter of General Ye Xiaoying?

472
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
That's right.

473
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,320
Master, didn't you tell me to bring her here

474
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,220
because you have a way to cure her disease?

475
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,560
Sikong Changfeng is the successor of the Medicine King.

476
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,140
Even he can't treat her disease.

477
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,220
What can Old Master do about it?

478
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,080
Moreover, Old Master has been cultivating in seclusion for months.

479
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,940
Even I haven't seen him yet.

480
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,240
Then who delivered the fake news to Xueyue City?

481
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,240
It was me.

482
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
As the music flows upon the moon reflected on the water's surface,

483
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,900
the breeze and the cloud are caught up.

484
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,860
I'm not here today to see the Elder of the Tang Clan.

485
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm here to one of Tianqi's Four Guardians, the Black Tortoise.

486
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,060
Did you come to see me because that person has appeared?

487
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,340
Back then, during the rebellion of Prince Langya,

488
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,700
Prince Langya was willing to entrust Xiao Chuhe, the Sixth Prince,

489
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,000
whom he had great expectations of, to his four good friends.

490
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
In other words the Four Guardians of Tianqi.

491
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,760
Now, Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird have already seen him.

492
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,700
It's time for Black Tortoise to make his appearance too.

493
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,260
The Four Guardians of Tianqi?

494
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,780
Master, could it be that the person you wanted me to wait for in Xueyue City was...

495
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,820
You want to gather the Four Guardians of Tianq again

496
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,980
and return to Tianqi City together with Xiao Chuhe?

497
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,620
Did General Ye Xiaoying bet everything on the Sixth Prince?

498
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,360
When I saw him as a little girl, I thought a person like him should inherit the throne.

499
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,960
I don't care who my father chooses.

500
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,260
Anyway, I've chosen him.

501
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,400
It's a pity, but you're too late.

502
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm too late?

503
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,980
Look outside.

504
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,000
Master, what's going on?

505
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,620
Xueyue City has always been supported by the Three Great Families.

506
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,360
The Tang Clan, Lei family, and Wen family.

507
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,760
The Tang Clan and the Lei family have always been at odds.

508
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,780
We formed an alliance with Xueyue City out of necessity.

509
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,120
That's also the reason I became friends with the three city lords.

510
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,080
But now, the situation has changed.

511
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,840
It seems like the old masters of the Tang Clan have new ideas.

512
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,520
New ideas?

513
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,900
Right now, the Spear Deity cannot deal with the old masters of the Tang Clan alone.

514
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,360
Someone's paid them a secret visit.

515
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,680
The offer he gave them was much higher than what Xueyue City could offer.

516
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,080
Who is he?

517
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,540
It's Prince Bai, the Second Prince of Beili, Xiao Chong.

518
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,220
Tang Lian, what techniques has Baili Dongjun taught you?

519
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,920
Master Baili taught me a set of neigong techniques  (internal skills)  called Hanging Heaven

520
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,060
and a set of fist techniques called Distant Seas.

521
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,700
He said I could use the former to strengthen my body and the latter to defend myself.

522
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,540
Usually, I utilize the Tang Clan's secret techniques for most of my fights.

523
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm guessing Baili Dongjun knows that you are a simple person.

524
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,700
That's why he taught you those two techniques.

525
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,420
The essence of these two techniques lies in their freedom.

526
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,760
But it seems like you haven't grasped the core.

527
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,360
Yes, Master. Please enlighten me.

528
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:20,360
I chose you out of all the disciples of the Tang Clan because you're simple.

529
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,680
However, you being simple will do you harm too.

530
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,700
In life, we have to make sacrifices.

531
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,480
This is the Black Tortoise Token.

532
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,720

533
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Miss Ye, back then, we promised Prince Langya that our successors would always keep the Sixth Prince safe.

534
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,200
Now, I've imparted the Black Tortoise Token to my best disciple.

535
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,220
I now entrust you with the task of protecting the Sixth Prince and escorting him to Tianqi City.

536
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,020
Master, I...

537
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,760
You don't need to worry.

538
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,460
I hereby impart the Black Tortoise Token to you.

539
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,800
You can choose yourself whether to accept it or not.

540
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,800
However, you need to do one thing for me.

541
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,920
Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm?

542
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,900
Do you believe that you all will be the ones who will die from it if you press it?

543
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,620
I believe it.

544
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,120
It's because you're Tang Lianyue, the best in Tang Clan.

545
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,340
However, you cannot leave here alive today.

546
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,620
Even if it means we both die here,

547
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,680
and all our brothers out there die today, we'll make sure you don't leave here.

548
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,640
I don't intend to leave.

549
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,760
However, you need to let these two people go.

550
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,620
Old Master Tang wants to see them.

551
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,400
I can't make the call here.

552
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,960
It depends on them whether they want to leave or not.

553
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,100
Tang Lian, take Miss Ye and go.

554
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,080
Yes, Master.

555
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,460
Let's go.

556
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,260

557
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,400
Old Master Tang?

558
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,080
Old Master. You're here too?

559
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,540

560
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,480
Long time no see. I'm here to check on you.

561
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,820
Tang Lian, I'll speak to Old Master in private.

562
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,180
You two can leave first.

563
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,340
Okay.

564
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,680
Let's go.

565
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,220
Old Master, seems like I've let you down again.

566
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,800
Here are your three bowls of plain noodles.

567
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,880
Thank you.

568
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,620
Enjoy your meal.

569
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,900
We have a long trip ahead.

570
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,540
And we don't have much to spare.

571
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,920
Let's save up as much as we can.

572
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,620
You do sound a little like Xiao Se now.

573
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,040
Xiao Se, I think the noodles you make in Snowfall Mountain Villa taste better.

574
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,800
Of course.

575
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,580
The cooks I hired are the best within a 100-li radius.

576
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,240
You're bragging again.

577
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,180
How is it bragging?

578
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,660
I ride the best horses, wear the best apparel,

579
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,920
and have the most loyal friends.

580
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,020
Senior Sister, was he referring to us just now?

581
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,160
I think so.

582
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,120
Xiao Se! I'm so touched!

583
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,200
It's my first time hearing you call me your friend.

584
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,800
Then... what did he call you before?

585
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,680
Fool.

586
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,180
No, wait, airhead.

587
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,020
Am I that rude?

588
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,740
Besides, I'm your friend.

589
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,360
But you owe me money. These are two different things.

590
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,540
Then...

591
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,940
Then, your bowl of noodles costs me 500 taels. And you've eaten it.

592
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,680
Fine. 500 taels it is then.

593
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,760
It's not like I can't afford it.

594
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,140
I'll take it as repayment for saving me on Mount Wangcheng.

595
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,740
If you had abandoned me back then, I would've been killed by Su Changli.

596
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,440
Then you should stop eating.

597
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,840
What are you doing?

598
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,200
I saved you because you're my friend.

599
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,260
Xiao Se, even if you were a penniless fool that entertained people for a living,

600
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,780
I will always save you as long as you're my friend.

601
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,320
But you're viewing our friendship in terms of silver taels.

602
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,360
Forget about 500 taels. I won't take it even if you offered me 50,000 taels.

603
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,100
So, you're saying... that you're willing to risk your life for a friend like me?

604
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,060
What will you do for a promise then?

605
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,020
For example, you once told me that you promised your mother that you would protect a certain person.

606
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,140
One of them is concerned with loyalty, while the other is responsibility.

607
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,540
What's the difference?

608
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,920
Loyalty is the thing I treasure the most in my adventures as a martial artist.

609
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,460
I can live for it and die for it.

610
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,900
That responsibility is something I had to bear when I was born.

611
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,720
It's a promise that I have to keep.

612
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,640
But what if the person you need to protect... is out to take my life?

613
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,240
What will you do then?

614
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,520
Then...

615
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,400
Then that means my mother and them were wrong.

616
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,660
That means that person isn't worth protecting.

617
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,540
I'll take you and escape.

618
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,620
If so, what if the person you need to protect is...

619
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,860
Junior Brother Lei, why are you tearing up at his words?

620
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,060
I'm not tearing up.

621
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,260
What's the matter?

622
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,040
It's Drunken Touch.

623
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,920
You know your stuff.

624
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,060
What's going on?

625
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,200
Xiao Se... we've been poisoned.

626
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,540
Take this.

627
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,500
An expert in Water Coagulation Technique who can use Drunken Touch at the same time?

628
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,720
You must be a member of Dark River's Mu family.

629
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,700
I'm Mu Ying of the Mu family.

630
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,440
Why are you all so relentless?

631
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,500
I assume you just took Penglai Pill.

632
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,280
That medicine can neutralize my Drunken Touch.

633
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,140
However, they've already been poisoned.

634
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,420
It's too late for them to take the medicine.

635
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,140
Shut up!

636
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,240
So, this is the legendary Stillwater Sword Technique of Xueyue Sword Deity?

637
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,340
I can't use my inner force.

638
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,200
Lei Wujie, Qianluo, don't use your zhenqi recklessly.

639
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,120
Surrender yourselves, and you all can die without any pain.

640
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,280
Seems like you're getting ahead of yourself.

641
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,320
Don't forget. I'm not affected by your Drunken Touch.

642
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,040
You're not a martial artist.

643
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,040
Xiao Se, Lei Wujie and I'll stall him.

644
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
You should run.

645
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,220
Your friends are going to die if they continue to use their zhenqi recklessly.

646
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,620
Shut up!

647
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,760
Mu Ying, you're calculated this pretty well.

648
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,580
But you still forgot something.

649
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,440
Although they can't use their inner force for now, I can.

650
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,480
Xiao Se, what are you doing?

651
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
My hidden pulse is damaged,

652
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,040
so I cannot use my inner force.

653
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,460
This is the Circulation Formation I've learned from the nameless book

654
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,300
that the Scholar Sword Deity gave to me.

655
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,160
I will lend you two my inner force.

656
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,220
If you had such a powerful technique, why didn't you use it earlier?

657
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,800
In your dreams.

658
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,880
I can only use this because your inner force is sealed away.

659
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,400
However, my inner force will dissipate in a short while.

660
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,220
We need to end this quickly.

661
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,060
Do you have any news about Xiao Se and them?

662
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,420
I don't have any news.

663
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,120
The Lei family hasn't written to us?

664
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,020
No.

665
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,200
I heard from Senior Brother Tang that it took Lei Wujie and the rest three months to reach Xueyue City

666
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
when one month was all they needed.

667
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,560
If that's the case...

668
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,200
I hope that I'm overthinking it.

669
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,560
It's rare for a person your age to reach this level!

670
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,380
Killing a pitiful person like you will be great!

671
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,840
I'm not afraid of water!

672
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,540
Fire Infusion, Level Eight, Heavenly Flame!

673
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,620
Lei Wujie, don't act recklessly.

674
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,400
Stand there and maintain your imposing manner.

675
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:20,020

676
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,060
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

677
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,400
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

678
