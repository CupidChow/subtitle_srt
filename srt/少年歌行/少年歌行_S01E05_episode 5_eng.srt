2
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,040
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,940
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,180
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,420
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,580
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,580
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,720
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,900
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,980
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,200
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,300
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,360
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,560
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,400
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,720
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,700
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,160
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,030
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,140

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,057

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,022
I haven't thought about that day for a long time now.

25
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,306
You're rather unfazed.

26
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,912
Have you heard of Mount Kunlun?

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,012
It's a very cold place.

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,386
It snows all year long

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,260
and won't melt even after a millennium.

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,726
I trained there for six years with the sword,

31
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,612
and my heart became as cold as the snow there a long time ago.

32
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:32,364
So your Devil Eye won't work on me.

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,940
Die now!

34
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,260
- Now it gets interesting. 
 - Enough of your nonsense.

35
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,104
Shattering Blade?

36
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,620
A couple of years ago, I would have been no match for you.

37
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,618
But now...

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,444
Oh, Little Wu Xin.

39
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:38,934
Wang Rensun has lost now as well.

40
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,829
Why don't you ask your two friends up there to help you?

41
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,088
Hiding away.

42
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:49,069
You think I wouldn't notice?

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,960
Xiao Se, have we been noticed?

44
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,400
Time to fight!

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,620
No!

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,700
The cold wind blows bitterly and pierces the skin,

47
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,868
the wanderer is cold and without clothing.

48
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,060
Let's go.

49
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,540
Little Wu Xin.

50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,940
People from the Nine Dragon Sect will come looking for you soon.

51
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,338
If you want to run, better do it now.

52
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,260
I can't.

53
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,820
True.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,858
You can run for your life,

55
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,628
but you can't run from your fate.

56
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,040
Lift the sedan.

57
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,980
What's wrong with you?

58
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,100
Fight, fight, fight. All you know how to do is fight.

59
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Do you know how dangerous that was?

60
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,980
If the Jade Deity had wanted to kill you, you would've died.

61
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,890
You... But I'm fine now.

62
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,640
Oh, right. What happened?

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,300
Why did they leave all of a sudden?

64
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,080
How am I supposed to know?

65
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,660
You are as sly as a fox.

66
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,820
I thought you knew everything.

67
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,540
Perhaps he saw your reckless punch and got scared.

68
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,941
He thought he couldn't take it and fled.

69
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,440
I sincerely hope this is the truth.

70
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,140
Master. Why are we leaving?

71
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,020
They clearly aren't a match for you.

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,540
What do you know?

73
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Wu Xin has mastered the 32 Secrets Arts of the Rakshasa.

74
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,417
He isn't as simple as you imagine.

75
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,036
And most importantly...

76
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,220
Lingjun. Prepare a horse.

77
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
I need to return to the palace and see His Majesty now.

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,720
Yes, Sir.

79
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,400
Come here.

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,460
What?

81
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,960
Stay here, don't move.

82
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,740
All the irrelevant ones are gone now.

83
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,254
Now... let's get down to business.

84
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,820
You're all grown up now.

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,520
Ridiculous.

86
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,700
It's been 12 years already.

87
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
Did you think I would stay five forever?

88
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,040
What do you remember from when you were five?

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,233
Many things.

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,900
I remember I used to ride on your shoulders and tug on your beard.

91
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,870
I remember

92
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,910
how mesmerized I was when you manipulated your Shattering Blade.

93
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,508
What else do I remember?

94
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,260
I remember

95
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,806
how you betrayed my father.

96
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,111
For 12 years, I've been wondering

97
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,488
if you would come to kill me.

98
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,060
I asked Abbot Wang You,

99
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,460
and he said everything in this world has karma.

100
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,462
He told me many things about Buddhism, but I'm not a monk,

101
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,700
nor am I capable of understanding it.

102
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,798
I just wondered

103
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,964
what I would be doing when you came to claim my life.

104
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,642
I suppose...

105
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,068
I would hand you the blade.

106
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,710

107
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,800
 That's him! He killed my father!

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,140
 I want you to kill him!

109
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,500
 Kill him right now!

110
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,270
 Kill him!

111
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,580
 Through fate it began.

112
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,584
 Through fate, it comes to an end.

113
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,220
 You will decide how you confront

114
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,310
 this unfinished business on your own once you grow up.

115
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,150
 Understood?

116
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,847
Old Wang You said to be merciful.

117
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't worry.

118
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,144
I won't kill you.

119
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,620
I was hoping you were here to kill me.

120
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,330
If you spare me,

121
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,720
it means something more troublesome awaits me.

122
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,140
There won't be trouble.

123
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,466
I just want you to perform a ritual for me.

124
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,630
A ritual?

125
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,522
I train at Great Fanyin Temple, but I'm not a monk.

126
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,525
Not you.

127
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,578
I want the entire Great Fanyin Temple to perform this ritual.

128
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,180
Senior Brother.

129
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,360
Senior Brother. Senior Brother!

130
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,718
He's asleep?

131
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,367
That's skill.

132
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,800
Senior Brother. I have a favor to ask.

133
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,540
Please perform a ritual for me.

134
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,826
We need 300 monks.

135
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,177
You're the only friend Old Wang You had left.

136
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,744
You can repay him for all the kindness

137
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:38,540
he has shown to you during the years with this gesture.

138
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,364
After three days, I'll come here to find you.

139
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,007
And then, when it's done?

140
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
And then...

141
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,108
we'll see if I'm still alive.

142
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,416
After the ritual, you should leave.

143
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,034
Twelve years ago, you were forced to get involved.

144
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,270
Twelve years later,

145
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,356
you shouldn't repeat the same mistake.

146
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,640
Lei Wujie, do you realize that he never takes us with him whenever he leaves?

147
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,620
It does seem like that.

148
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,900
Why do we keep following him as supposed hostages?

149
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,260
That's right.

150
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,834
Let's go find Senior Brother  (Tang Lian)  then.

151
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,732
Why aren't you two keeping up?

152
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,580
We're going somewhere very far away.

153
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,100
We need some horses!

154
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,956
But I don't have money!

155
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,701
This guy is really strange.

156
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,380
Wu Xin, what is this diet?

157
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,140
I've never seen it before.

158
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,326
As naive as always.

159
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,471
That's edible?

160
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,700
It's not bad.

161
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,220
What do you think?

162
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,912
It's not bad, isn't it?

163
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,560
It's delicious!

164
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,180
If there were some meat in there, it would be amazing.

165
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,081
Wu Xin, where did you learn how to cook?

166
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,424
Old Wang You taught me.

167
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,488
Abbot Wang You also studied this?

168
00:13:55,488 --> 00:14:00,036
He probably picked it up during his travels. I'm not sure where he learned it.

169
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:03,848
I heard his hometown was in the Yushi Kingdom.

170
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,660
Indeed.

171
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,740
To be precise, he was born in this temple.

172
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,460
Old Wang You had a knack for Buddhism.

173
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,220
At the age of six, he was able to debate with The Venerable One from Great Fanyin Temple.

174
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,336
Seeking enlightenment, he left Yushi and traveled around.

175
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:30,980
At the age of 40, he became an abbot at Hanshui Temple.

176
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,100
By then, he was already regarded as the greatest Zen master in the world.

177
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,368
And after 20 years, he adopted me.

178
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Brother Xiao, you're well-informed.

179
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,086
I'm sure you already know who I am.

180
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,455
If I'm not mistaken, your last name is Ye.

181
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:54,580
Ye is indeed my last name. I am Ye Anshi.

182
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,568
My father is Ye Dingzhi.

183
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,245
Ye Dingzhi?

184
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,580
The Head of the Demon Sect?

185
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,180
That's right.

186
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,292
My father was the Head of the Demon Sect.

187
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,680
Xiao Se, Tian Wai Tian is the Demon Sect, right?

188
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,740
The Demon Sect is the name for a group

189
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,540
 of several sects beyond the border.

190
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,476
 The largest of them is Tian Wai Tian.

191
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,360
 And the Head of the Demon Sect is the chief of Tian Wai Tian.

192
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,340
However, when the Demon Sect failed in their eastern expedition,

193
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,654
they signed an armistice with the Central Plains.

194
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,320
An important member of Tian Wai Tian was required to stay in Beili as a hostage

195
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,969
for 12 years.

196
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,076
And that person was you, right?

197
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,140
It was me.

198
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,080
That year I was five and followed my father on his expedition.

199
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,180
Later my father passed, and I was adopted by Wang You.

200
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,581
Wu Xin, you were held hostage here when you were five.

201
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,560
- But now... 
 - The twelve-year period is coming to an end.

202
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,360
By right, I should return to Tian Wai Tian.

203
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,320
But if you go back, no one knows if the Demon Sect will return or not.

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,245
So some want to cripple your martial arts skills.

205
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:12,780
Some want to imprison you.

206
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,154
And some want to kill you.

207
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:20,020
In the end, Da Jue of the Nine Dragon Sect came up with the Golden Coffin idea.

208
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:26,310
If I were you, I would find the fastest horse available and flee west.

209
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,940
If I wanted to flee, I would've left with the White-Haired Deity already.

210
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,260
You didn't leave with Tian Wai Tian.

211
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,660
Instead, you brought the two of us with you.

212
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,176
Is it truly just for this ritual?

213
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,842
Many people asked Old Wang You to hand me over.

214
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,328
He wanted to protect me,

215
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,700
but he couldn't dissuade the others either.

216
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,858
He could only worry helplessly.

217
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,324
And in the end...

218
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,780
 - Hand Wu Xin to us now! 
 - Hand him over!

219
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,642
 - Hand him over! 
 - Oh, Amitabha.

220
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,320
 - Hand him over now! 
 - Hurry up!

221
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,940
 - Now! 
 - Hand him over now!

222
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,700
 - We'll kill you if you don't. 
 - Stop!

223
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:08,915
 Amitabha.

224
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,041
 Wu Xin, this is none of your concern.

225
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,640
 Amitabha. Amitabha.

226
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,192
He died because of it.

227
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:22,940
So you're trying to repay his kindness?

228
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,720
You always rub people the wrong way.

229
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,478
Old Wang You always said he wanted to return here.

230
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,586
Since I happen to be passing by,

231
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,336
I'll guide back his soul.

232
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,540
It could be considered... a repayment of his kindness.

233
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,308
I still fail to understand one thing.

234
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,935
Why did you pick the two of us?

235
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,820
We had nothing to do with this.

236
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,260
That's right.

237
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,480
If you need help, why don't you find someone powerful from Tian Wai Tian?

238
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,296
Didn't I say it before? It's because I don't have money.

239
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:07,300
And one here was wearing an expensive fur coat and the other an expensive red fabric.

240
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,270
You looked rich.

241
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,740
- I... 
 - You have so many lies tucked inside your sleeves,

242
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,171
waiting to be unleashed.

243
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,140
You two are the same in that aspect.

244
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,840
Shut up.

245
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,044
I want to travel north with the wind,

246
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:39,596
watching the snow sweep across the land.

247
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:43,032
I wish to travel east by boat

248
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:46,964
to see the elegant fairy brave the wind.

249
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:49,624
I wish to travel thousands of miles with the clouds,

250
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:53,906
even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

251
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:56,380
I will bathe in sunlight on the top of Mount Kunlun.

252
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,340
I will witness lush mountains rise at the edge of the ocean.

253
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,923
We shall reunite after a long journey.

254
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:08,860
But I won't go home until I've seen the world.

255
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,249
Now you finally sound like a great master.

256
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,530
Whether I'm a great master or not doesn't matter.

257
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,780
Life is what matters.

258
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,388
Also, you guessed right.

259
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,210
I chose you two

260
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,146
for a reason.

261
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,380
What reason is that?

262
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,700
After I mastered the Devil Eye, Old Wang You told me

263
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,088
that only two kinds of people are immune to it.

264
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,400
One is someone with an innocent heart.

265
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,421
 - What does that mean?  
 - Unsullied by worldly things.

266
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,640
The other one...

267
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,800
is someone whose thoughts are buried too deep.

268
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,980
 I would like to visit a place.

269
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,747
 Would you...

270
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,980
 No.

271
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,020
They bury their thoughts in a bottomless abyss.

272
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,820
So that even they... don't know themselves anymore.

273
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I suppose the former refers to this airhead

274
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,100
and the latter refers to me.

275
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,880
What about Shen Jingzhou then?

276
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,243
Isn't he also immune to your Devil Eye?

277
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,980
Eunuch Jade Deity isn't immune to my Devil Eye.

278
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,498
He was obsessed with his inner demon,

279
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,672
but his will was strong enough.

280
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,312
It only fettered him for a moment.

281
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,300
But you two are different.

282
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,548
When I look into your eyes,

283
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:44,949
nothing happens.

284
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,020
What now then?

285
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Old Wang You destroyed the Rakshasa.

286
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,940
If I died, so would their martial arts skills.

287
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,040
Therefore, I want to teach you two one skill each.

288
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,487
What skill?

289
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:10,150
The one I want to teach you is the Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist.

290
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,880
Such a long name!

291
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,981
Such a random name.

292
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,700
Watch carefully!

293
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
Good.

294
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,220
You are gifted.

295
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,880
As expected from a disciple of the Lei family of the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

296
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,740
Pardon my ignorance, but what's so strong about this technique?

297
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,780
You fool. He's making fun of you.

298
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,160
What Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist?

299
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,340
It's clearly the Luohan Fist.

300
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,620
The rudimentary fist technique from Shaolin Temple.

301
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,060
Spend 20 wen at the foot of Mount Song and you can receive a secret manual.

302
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
Even my inn staff knows one trick or two.

303
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:16,380
Luohan Fist is just the first half.

304
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,620
The other half is called Fumo Fist.

305
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,520
Together, they form the Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist.

306
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,558
The second part is more difficult, so let me guide you step by step.

307
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,420
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

308
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,220
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

309
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,660
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

310
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,680
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

311
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,900
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

312
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,760
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

313
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,860
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

314
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,900
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

315
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,280
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

316
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,360
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

317
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,580
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

318
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,961
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

319
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,320
I led you through it three times. Have you memorized it?

320
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,880
Yes.

321
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
Good. Show me again.

322
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,520
Not bad.

323
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,123
You call that not bad?

324
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,300
And now it's your turn.

325
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
You found the wrong person then.

326
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,580
I can't do any martial arts.

327
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,340
Except for the lightness technique which I use to flee.

328
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,020
I can't fight with my fist at all.

329
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,060
But I quite fancy the ability to stand on water.

330
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,960
Can I pick that one?

331
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,620
You have too much on your mind.

332
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,360
So you won't be able to learn the Floating Wave Step.

333
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,316
Even if you pick it up,

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,100
you'll only fall in halfway through.

335
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,620
Floating Wave Step.

336
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,580
The techniques from the Rakshasa Sect all have such random names.

337
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,380
Well, no.

338
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,380
Someone smeared their names in the book, so I randomly assigned them names.

339
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,440
Still, I'm the wrong person.

340
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,450
If you want to teach someone skills, teach the airhead.

341
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,860
I didn't choose the wrong person.

342
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,660
The technique I'm about to teach you doesn't need a foundation.

343
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,588
Except for time. I can teach you today,

344
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:36,890
but it'll take a long while before you'll master it.

345
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,515
The technique I want to teach you is...  the Devil Eye.

346
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:52,680

347
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:02,580
Sect Leader, the guests from Xueyue City have arrived.

348
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,920
- Greetings, Senior Da Jue. 
 - Greetings, Senior Da Jue.

349
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,860
Please drop the formalities.

350
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,700
One is a disciple of City Lord Baili.

351
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,380
The other is the daughter of City Lord Sikong.

352
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,980
You two are really extraordinary.

353
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
You flatter us, Sir.

354
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,460
I failed the task given to me, and I've let you all down.

355
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,560
There's no need to blame yourself.

356
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,320
I just received news that Wu Xin is in Yushi.

357
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,730
I'm about to set off to capture him.

358
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,780
Would you care to join me, Hero Tang?

359
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,600
I failed to accomplish the task given to me.

360
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,500
This time... I'm willing to come with you.

361
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,440
Sect Leader, a letter arrived from Xueyue City.

362
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Show it to me.

363
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,100
The letter is for Tang Lian.

364
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,402
What a rare sight.

365
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:18,780
The ever so elusive city lord.

366
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,000
Why are you here instead of making your wine?

367
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,980
Stop mocking me.

368
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,620
Changfeng left this GO puzzle for me.

369
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Has Tang Lian reached the Nine Dragon Sect yet?

370
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,660
He has. But empty-handed.

371
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,480
So he failed.

372
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,960
Yes. Because an old friend appeared.

373
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,020
The White-Haired Deity.

374
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,420
 Although Tang Lian's martial arts have improved greatly,

375
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,900
 he is one of the leaders in this younger generation,

376
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,220
 and also has Qianluo to help him,

377
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,420
he is still not strong enough against a great master like that.

378
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,020
That girl almost ruined it this time.

379
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,780
Changfeng was panicking because he hadn't been able to find her.

380
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,800
So Wu Xin has already been taken away by Tian Wai Tian?

381
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,900
If only it was that simple. Wu Xin ran off.

382
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,100
My guess is that he went to Yushi.

383
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,060
His father's best friend, Wang Rensun, is there.

384
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,920
And it's also the hometown of his master, Abbot Wang You.

385
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,140
Oh, right. He also took along two of Tang Lian's companions.

386
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,140
Disciples of Xueyue City?

387
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,600
No. Tang Lian said one is a disciple of the Lei Clan.

388
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,788
 He was supposed to come to Xueyue City to become a disciple.

389
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,480
- A disciple from the Lei Clan? 
 - Seems it's also Lei Hong's disciple.

390
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,740
 The other person is even more intriguing.

391
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,732
 An innkeeper.

392
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,040
The Lei disciple owes him money, so the innkeeper tags along.

393
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,480
Tang Lian said he keeps many things to himself

394
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,920
and is very familiar with the secrets of the martial arts world.

395
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,448
An innkeeper?

396
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,970
He calls himself Xiao Se.

397
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,671
Any other news?

398
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,780
 Someone from the palace can't sit still anymore, either.

399
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,560
 The second strongest of the Five Eunuchs,

400
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,440
 Eunuch Jade Deity, the Incense Bearer,

401
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,860
secretly left Tianqi City several days ago.

402
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,440
He is headed in that direction.

403
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,086
Shen Jingzhou went too?

404
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:25,056
It seems like the one in the palace doesn't trust us yet.

405
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,080
One more thing, the Wushuang Sword Box made an appearance.

406
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,940
 A young lad called Wushuang.

407
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,020
 He fought with the White-Haired Deity too.

408
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,060
 He came out unscathed and is heading to Yushi too.

409
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,460
As for those other sects, they've all been blocked.

410
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,020
Blocked?

411
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,336
I have no idea who did that,

412
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:53,900
 but they did Tian Wai Tian a huge favor by doing that.

413
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,460
If it weren't for that, the White-Haired Deity wouldn't

414
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,880
have been able to even meet Wu Xin.

415
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,957
We should have gone ourselves.

416
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:09,600
Although Tang Lian is the best among all of Xueyue City's young disciples,

417
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,484
he cannot beat all those experts on his own.

418
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,880
We still have to give the young ones a chance to garner some experience, right?

419
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Experience? You're too easygoing.

420
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,660
Imagine. The entire martial arts world is afraid of a 17-year-old kid.

421
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,720
It's a 17-year-old kid who's learned all the Secret Arts of the Rakshasa.

422
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,060
 Who's only one step away from the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

423
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,220
 He's also the descendant of Tian Wai Tian's patriarch after all.

424
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,900
Can they afford not to be wary?

425
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,240
Twelve years ago, Xueyue City stopped the Demon Sect's eastern expedition.

426
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,380
Twelve years later, their young master is returning.

427
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,768
What's there to be afraid of?

428
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:57,180
If it's a problem for the younger generation, let them solve it.

429
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,335
If they can't, it's our turn.

430
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,420
I've already written to Tang Lian.

431
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,060
- Once he receives it, he'll know what to do. 
 - What did you tell him?

432
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,340
What Master wrote to us 12 years ago.

433
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,140
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

434
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,260
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

435
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,180
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

436
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,180
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

437
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,320
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

438
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,660
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

439
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,860
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

440
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,780
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

441
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,969
As reckless as always.

442
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,100

(T/N: The character resembles a funny face)

443
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,180
That's not how you play GO.

444
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,300
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

445
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,180
In Xueyue City, you train with your sword.

446
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,000
I make my wine.

447
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,320
GO is for Changfeng to play.

448
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,200

449
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,420
You haven't finished reading it yet?

450
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,778
What does it say exactly?

451
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,460
There are only four words.

452
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,684
What four words?

453
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:12,900
"Act with your heart."

454
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,120
That's easy enough.

455
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,039
Just do what you want to do.

456
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,260

457
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,440
Master Wu Chan, "Act with your heart."

458
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,380
What is the Buddhist view of it?

459
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,720
Buddha says, "Follow the guidance of your heart, your temper, and your fate."

460
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,004
Is that what I just said?

461
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,260
Master Wu Chan, what kind of person is Wu Xin in your opinion?

462
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,620
When I was little, I left Hanshui Temple with Master Da Jue.

463
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,220
I rarely saw Wu Xin after, so I don't know him that well.

464
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,946
But when we were young, there was this one thing that left a deep impression on me.

465
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,140
 Is this the Iron Hard Fumo Fist?

466
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,860

467
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,420
 Junior Brother Wu Xin.

468
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,940
 But between gods and demons,

469
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,714
 who decides which is which?

470
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,720
 I... I don't know.

471
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,040
 If Master says it's a demon, then I'll get rid of it.

472
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,420
 The scripture says to eliminate demons is to eliminate the source of worries.

473
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,320
 What should be eliminated is not the external threat, but the inner demon.

474
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:40,160
If you hadn't told me in person, I wouldn't have believed those words came from a five-year-old child.

475
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,556
I was born to the Tang Clan and I have to observe strict rules.

476
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:51,060
Before I was twelve, I learned the six schools of mindfulness and poison techniques.

477
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,264
At the age of sixteen, I mastered all 32 schools of hidden weaponry.

478
00:32:56,264 --> 00:33:01,540
When I turned seventeen, I went to Xueyue City to study under Master, and now, it's been six years.

479
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:08,180
The past 23 years feel like they've has been set, and I just follow them religiously.

480
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,086
"Act with your heart."

481
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,010
I don't quite get it.

482
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,800
What is there to ponder?

483
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,500
Senior Brother. Just keep thinking about it.

484
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,740
I'm going to go to bed now.

485
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,900
Master Wu Chan, we'll arrive in Yushi tomorrow.

486
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,225
If you see your junior brother, what will you do?

487
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,256
Act with my heart.

488
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,100
Take your time, Brother Tang.

489
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,992
I'll head to bed now too.

490
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,020
Act with your heart, or it is also fine to follow the lead of your heart, temper, or fate.

491
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:09,606
Your very first reaction when you see him will reflect your heart's desire.

492
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,800
I don't think Wu Xin is some great evil.

493
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,340
And what's more, on that carriage, he saved us.

494
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,260
You... are just overthinking it.

495
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,560
What young lad treads as carefully as you are right now.

496
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,316
If you can't figure it out, then don't think about it for now.

497
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,890
I will be returning to Sangu City tomorrow.

498
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,680
♫   The snow falls and colors the Mortal World   ♫

499
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,122
You must take care.

500
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,740
♫   All that time wasted, just waiting for one person  ♫

501
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,860
♫   If we hadn't met, there wouldn't be this pain  ♫

502
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,074

503
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,226

504
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,940
Wu Xin.

505
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,156
This is your last reminder.

506
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:54,989
This ritual will shake Yushi to its core.

507
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,380
Many powerful experts will come.

508
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,280
Are you confident about this?

509
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,020
So?

510
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,760
Old Wang You isn't here anymore.

511
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,015
No one can stop me.

512
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,180
Hey, Xiao Se. What is that?

513
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,946
Sarira, perhaps? 
  (T/N: term for a Buddhist relic)

514
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,720
Sarira?

515
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,639
After their death, some monks leave behind a pearl-like object that cannot be destroyed.

516
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,860
We call it a sarira. It's a Buddhist relic.

517
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,748
After Old Wang You passed away, his body turned to dust.

518
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,550
But amidst the dust laid a sarira.

519
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,295
So, I had wanted to bring it back to Yushi.

520
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,940
Old Wang You couldn't return when he was alive.

521
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,940
So after he died... I brought him back.

522
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,502
 Foolish child.

523
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,247
 Why did you come here?

524
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,702
M-Master.

525
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,190
 Weep no more.

526
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,119
 You need to return to your home.

527
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,980
My home is Hanshui Temple.

528
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,200

529
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,780
 This is Hanshui Temple.

530
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,854
 From now on, this is your home.

531
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,842
 Are you missing home again?

532
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,080
 Master.

533
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:20,200
 Will you leave me suddenly one day, like my parents did?

534
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,180
 Oh, Foolish Child.

535
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,520
 I will always be by your side.

536
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,727
 Such a foolish child.

537
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:33,240
 Hanshui Temple was but a temporary home.

538
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,080
 You're all grown up now.

539
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,794
 It's time to go back to your own home.

540
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,580
 Your home is a place of freedom.

541
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,580
 A place beyond the border, beyond the sky.

542
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:52,980
No.

543
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,780
Master.

544
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,296
I don't want to go anywhere.

545
00:39:57,296 --> 00:40:00,680
I just want to return to Hanshui Temple.

546
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,405
 Oh, my foolish child.

547
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,944
 Only they think you are capable of ruining the world.

548
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:18,920
Master, I seek your guidance.

549
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:39,950

550
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,420
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

551
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,700
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

552
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,920
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫
