2
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,050
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,890
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,370
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,300
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,600
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,820
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,900
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,000
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,020
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,420
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,300
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,350
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,470
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,420
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,590
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,800
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,150
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,170
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,440
Soon, everyone in the capital will know that there is a young master in town.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,160
He's not only handsome,

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,180
but also has an extraordinarily elegant demeanor.

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,270
He trounces those of high power and helps the weak.

28
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,400
He even contributed to disaster relief.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,530
Basically, a living deity.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,340
How's your calculation?

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,980
That pawn shop called Luoze House that we have in Bai City, Qingzhou has closed down.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,920
Steward Liang. Am I very extravagant?

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,380
Your extravagance... isn't quite enough.

34
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,580
Let alone your father, you can't even compare to that promiscuous brother of yours.

35
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,920
Back in the day, your brother's expenses at the brothel in just one night

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,690
could measure up to the value of two retail stores.

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,740
However, he brought shame to the family.

38
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,370
You, on the other hand, will definitely impress your father, Young Master Chunfeng.

39
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,460
Enough, enough.

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,270
Seems like I should try to spend more money.

41
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,780
Otherwise, the position of the family head will eventually end up being mine.

42
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,640
This...

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
Your Highness.

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
Almost there.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,500
Brother Lei, Miss Ye.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,670
- Mu Chunfeng? 
 - Mu Chunfeng?

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,820
Are you surprised for us to reunite in Tianqi City?

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,680
Surprise? This is a shock!

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,100
Brother Chunfeng. I didn't hear from Xiao Se that you'd be coming.

50
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,730
The moment I heard of Xiao Se's return to Tianqi, I thought to myself that I could definitely be of help somehow.

51
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,760
So I took the initiative to rush back without any delay very quickly.

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,480
How's that? i'm a great friend, aren't i?

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,840
If that's the case, has your eldest brother fully recovered?

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,780
More or less.

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,690
That's a relief. It was worth it for my senior brother...

56
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,900
for giving you the snake-baiting potion.

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,770
It's a good day. Let's not think about sad things today.

58
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,510
We have time ahead of us. Some debts will have to be paid back eventually.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,540
Understood. Xiao Se is waiting upstairs. Hurry and go inside.

60
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,460
Come. This way, please.

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,400
The third son of the Mu family from Yunjian City, Qingzhou, Mu Chunfeng, is here for the banquet.

62
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,420
Young Master Xiao. We meet again.

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,040
Mu Chunfeng. Why did you greet him first?

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,940
It was us who were friends first.

65
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,060
Young Master Xiao is the host today.

66
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,640
It's natural that I should greet the host first.

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,260
Nice to meet you too, Miss Sikong.

68
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,540
By the way, why are you here?

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,870
- It's because—  
 - I left them a note before leaving Qiushui Fishing City.

70
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,060
I said to meet again in Tianqi City.

71
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,360
Yes.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,700
Thank you, Young Master Mu.

73
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,140
No need to thank me.

74
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,140
As you know, there are three kinds of businesses that the Mu family would turn down.

75
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,150
What businesses?

76
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,370
Businesses that harm people, businesses that bring loss,

77
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,240
and businesses that are too unprofitable.

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,040
This is a big business, so I'm willing to take it.

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,580
Furthermore, my old man did not stop me anyway.

80
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,570
Seems like your eldest brother hasn't been cured.

81
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,960
Nonsense! There's no such thing.

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,910
Isn't the Mu family the richest in Beili?

83
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,210
Why did you come empty-handed?

84
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,380
Would Your Highness even need any more worldly things such as money?

85
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,280
Of course, I brought a better gift.

86
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,360
Over here, please come in.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Please come in here.

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,590
Please, come in. Please.

89
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,260
After you. Please.

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,390
This way, please.

91
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,360
The capital's salt merchant Li, Grand Entertainment House, Gongsun Pawn Shop, and Technicolor Clothing Parlor.

92
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,200
- The Four Great Merchants of Tianqi City and their dependents are all here. 
 - Here, please.

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,560
Young Master Xiao, do you like my gift?

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,700
I will be sure to help you in becoming the Divine Healer's apprentice.

95
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,760
That's what I was hoping to hear.

96
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,810
Xiao Se.

97
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,470
The Divine Healer that Young Master Mu mentioned can't be Hua Jin, right?

98
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,990
Of course, it is.

99
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,030
Hua Jin?

100
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,460
Your Highness. Where should he be seated?

101
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,940
The top seat on the second floor, of course.

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,400
But... It's against the rules.

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,220
Rules don't matter.

104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,510
When the head of the Mu family used to visit the palace, His Majesty welcomed him personally too.

105
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,880
Furthermore, Young Master Mu brought me a great gift today.

106
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,910
It's natural that he deserves a top seat at my banquet.

107
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,230
Over here, please, Young Master Mu.

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,160
Sure. Much obliged.

109
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,570
This banquet of ours is looking pretty good.

110
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,090
Look. Half the seats are already filled. Can we start yet?

111
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,220
Not yet. It's far from enough.

112
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,530
Still?

113
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,450
The most important people aren't here yet.

114
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,020
A bunch of useless beings! A mere third young master of the Mu family was enough to intimidate them.

115
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,790
After the banquet, I will meet them personally to get things straight.

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,610
Never mind.

117
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,420
These dishonest traders are way more cunning than we are.

118
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,460
Xiao Chuhe is good.

119
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,960
He is still the same man who can bring me surprises.

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,110
Look at the time. The banquet should start soon.

121
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,770
He wouldn't do that.

122
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,900
None of the guests that he's expecting is there yet.

123
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,240
All the Four Great Merchants have arrived.

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,230
Over the past two years, they've been under the protection of Prince Chi.

125
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,700
Unless given no other choice, they will never attend the banquet.

126
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,720
Prince Chi can help them reap the biggest benefits.

127
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,920
And the Mu family is able to take all of that away just overnight.

128
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,140
Your Highness. Would Prince Chi show up then?

129
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,560
No.

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,410
In Tianqi City, no matter how rich they are, merchants will only be merchants.

131
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,250
The true aristocrats don't even take them seriously.

132
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,020
Ministers of the Six Ministries. The Seven Censors of the Imperial Censorate.

133
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,990
The Court of Judicature. Longtu Pavilion.

134
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,110
The fact that they're unresponsive proves that Tianqi City

135
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,550
has yet to acknowledge the return of the prince.

136
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,300
Second Master Tu. It's almost time for the banquet to begin.

137
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,390
What's wrong? Is everyone getting anxious?

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,270
They might get the impression

139
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,740
that they may be too insignificant or too unimportant

140
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,500
for the Sixth Prince to start the banquet.

141
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,950
What do you think, Your Highness?

142
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,590
They're here.

143
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,510
Marquis Lanyue?

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,610
Nephew Lei, Miss Ye. Nice to meet you.

145
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,800
- Greetings, Marquis. 
 - Greetings, Marquis.

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,490
- Please come in, Marquis. 
 - Please.

147
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,690
Marquis Lanyue has arrived!

148
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,760
Marquis Lanyue is here? This Qianjin Gambling House of mine is so privileged!

149
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,530
This...

150
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,860
Seems like His Highness was not waiting for Marquis Lanyue.

151
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,830
Well...

152
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,320
Miss Ye. Since your father could not be present today,

153
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,800
I will go ahead and take the spotlight today, then.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,830
Guests should attend the banquet with a gift.

155
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,500
Are you planning to gift this good sword of yours to Xiao Se?

156
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm not a tasteless man.

157
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,490
The gift that I brought would be the most valuable gift of all.

158
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,460
Calling me a gift is rather disrespectful, don't you think?

159
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,320
This is... He's been an imperial official for 50 years and has remained upright and honest.

160
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,620
He's neither affiliated with any parties nor noblemen.

161
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,840
He found his foothold in the government with his righteousness and heart for the people.

162
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,740
The honest admire him, and the corrupt fear him.

163
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,840
During Imperial Court proceedings, His Majesty sits on the Dragon Throne while he has a Crane Seat.

164
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,480
He doesn't need to kneel or stand.

165
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,790
He's the role model for all scholars in the nation, the head of the government?

166
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,930
Your Highness. I'm really baffled. The Grand Preceptor, Dong Zhu.

167
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,520
To think that this gambling house of mine is housing the greatest scholar ever. How did you do that?

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,810
I have a sword called Blood Sight.

169
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,080
It was also Lord Langya's saber in battle.

170
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,080
Years ago, the Grand Preceptor went to war with the army.

171
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,360
At the moment of life and death, Prince Langya saved him with this sword.

172
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,700
A life-saving debt is the heaviest of all.

173
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,210
But you're exchanging it for a meal with the Grand Preceptor?

174
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,830
No.

175
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,860
It is not him that I'm aiming for.

176
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,660
I'm aiming for all civil and military officials.

177
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,630
- Welcome, Grand Preceptor. 
 - Welcome, Grand Preceptor.

178
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,290
You have the demeanor of your father back then.

179
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,110
You're flattering me, Grand Preceptor.

180
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,690
I used to hold you in my arms when you were little.

181
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,380
Grand Preceptor. I can't remember that very well.

182
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,780
Of course.

183
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,690
Back then, you were but an infant.

184
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,990
Grand Preceptor. Chuhe is waiting for us inside.

185
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,070
Let's go in.

186
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,030
Sure, let's go in.

187
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,320
Over here.

188
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,430
Welcoming our guest!

189
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,730
Beili's Director of Nation-cum-Grand Preceptor, Official Dong Zhu, has arrived.

190
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,250
- Grand Preceptor. 
 - Grand Preceptor.

191
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,460
- Grand Preceptor. 
 - You're back.

192
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,270
Yes, I have returned.

193
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,740
It's good to have you back.

194
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,800
Good to have you back.

195
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,720
After all, Tianqi City is your home.

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,850
But... you're better than before.

197
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,190
As expected, getting some experience out there was necessary.

198
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,840
Child.

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,980
You must learn to understand your father's painstaking intentions.

200
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,960
I will keep that in mind.

201
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,010
In the bleak autumn wind and chilling weather,

202
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,250
the dew turns into frost on plants.

203
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,360
This name of yours may sound a little melancholic,

204
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,940
but it's also very poetic.

205
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,250
Grand Preceptor. Let's take a seat.

206
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,820
Yes, let's be seated.

207
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,660
Have a seat, please.

208
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,290
Very well, very well.

209
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,790
Marquis Lanyue?

210
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,350
Father. Marquis Lanyue is the current Director of Nation.

211
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,030
If he's in attendance,

212
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,780
then we...

213
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,040
Marquis Lanyue may be the Director of Nation,

214
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,660
but he rarely interferes with imperial matters.

215
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,400
This is even more so after the case of Prince Langya's act of treason.

216
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,050
His Majesty has since abstained from granting authority to his brothers.

217
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,590
Let me think.

218
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,180
Your Excellency. Your Excellency!

219
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,310
Why the hurry?

220
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,650
What happened?

221
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,440
Something big happened indeed.

222
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,020
After Marquis Lanyue, someone else arrived too.

223
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,220
Who?

224
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,820
Grand Preceptor, Dong Zhu.

225
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,860
What? Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu? Get my palanquin ready, hurry!

226
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,580
- Please, everyone. 
 - Come on, come on.

227
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,830
Here.

228
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,980
- After you, please. 
 - Sure.

229
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,900
- Please. 
 - Let's go together. 
  - Sure, together.

230
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,550
Long time no see, Uncle Wang.

231
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,070
Minister of Revenue, Official Li Ruochong, has arrived!

232
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,320
Minister of Justice, Official Zhou De, has arrived!

233
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,670
Minister of War, Official Wu Jingcheng, has arrived!

234
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,430
Minister of Personnel, Official Xuan Dechong, has arrived!

235
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,290
Minister of Rites, Official Xu Weicheng, has arrived!

236
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,110
Xiao Se.

237
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,330
All civil and military officials are here.

238
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,370
When are the two princes coming?

239
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,950
Before, we didn't have much time.

240
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,290
Now, they are running out of time.

241
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,430
Why would the Grand Preceptor attend a banquet like that?

242
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,450
He'd even skip state banquets pretending to be sick.

243
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,510
This isn't merely about his attendance at a banquet.

244
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,770
This is all part of Chuhe's scheme.

245
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:58,390
He took advantage of the two Directors of Nation to spur all civil and military officials in the capital.

246
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,950
If they can cause a big scene, they can force us to give in.

247
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,010
Within two hours, the ministers of the Six Ministries,

248
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,960
the Four Great Merchants,

249
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,500
and even the Mu family of Qingzhou

250
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,350
as well as Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu came for him.

251
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,320
Prince Yong'an has too many tricks up his sleeves.

252
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,650
That's right.

253
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,380
Every time we think that we found his weakness,

254
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,800
he'd always find a way around it.

255
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,350
I expected Marquis Lanyue to show up,

256
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,030
but I didn't expect the Grand Preceptor to show up too.

257
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,680
These two individuals, who claim to be neutral, attend a banquet like this.

258
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,460
How intriguing.

259
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,920
But apparently, even now, Xiao Chuhe has not started the banquet yet.

260
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,970
Xiao Chuhe is still stubborn as ever.

261
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,900
What? Must Prince Chi and Prince Bai arrive before he finally starts the banquet?

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,750
Does he assume that Dong Zhu can force me to attend the banquet?

263
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,040
Ridiculous.

264
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,640
Your Highness.

265
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,430
Are we going then?

266
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Second brother must be more upset than I am.

267
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,620
After all, he has always been a filial child.

268
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,580
For Dong Zhu to be present and him to be absent,

269
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,680
that would be rude.

270
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,540
In my opinion, we shouldn't go.

271
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,800
Otherwise, it would be as if we're admitting defeat.

272
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,430
If we don't go, at least, it proves that we don't care.

273
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,620
Oh, Zang Ming.

274
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,780
The truth is...

275
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,600
We have already lost.

276
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,400
Then, Prince Bai has no reason not to show up.

277
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,630
No.

278
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,490
The best reason he has to be absent is my absence.

279
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,230
If I'm absent, he can choose to do the same.

280
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,580
So, we are...

281
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,050
Not going, of course.

282
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,210
I'm not afraid of crossing Dong Zhu.

283
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,730
Second brother would be the one suffering most right now.

284
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,980
I'd gladly watch him suffer.

285
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,680
Who else chose to be absent,

286
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,060
I will be sure to appoint them to higher positions.

287
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,830
Only the State Preceptor is absent.

288
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,740
The State Preceptor?

289
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,410
Chuhe.

290
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,850
No matter how good the tea at Qianjin Gambling House is,

291
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,250
it's not good to have too much of it.

292
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,180
Grand Preceptor isn't saying anything,

293
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,630
but people will accuse you of disrespecting the Grand Preceptor.

294
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,370
Just wait for a little longer.

295
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,560
How long?

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,220
When will we start?

297
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,130
About an hour later.

298
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,060
You're waiting for those two?

299
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,890
They're not coming.

300
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,060
They won't admit defeat so easily.

301
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,840
Forget it then.

302
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,460
- Second Master Tu. 
 - Your Highness.

303
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,080
Start the banquet.

304
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,630
The banquet...

305
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,100
Wait.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,860
I didn't say I was coming,

307
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,350
but I didn't say I won't be attending, either.

308
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,670
Why rush to start the banquet?

309
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,060
Can't you wait for me?

310
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,930
Your Highness.

311
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,830
- State Preceptor. 
 - Marquis.

312
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,220
I may not be interested in feasting and drinking,

313
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,140
but I suppose I should have a taste of Prince Yong'an's feast.

314
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,310
Oh, State Preceptor.

315
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,820
Grand Preceptor.

316
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,220
Grand Preceptor.

317
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,020
It's been a while since we last met.

318
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,090
Tell me about it.

319
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,090
State Preceptor. You're always absent from the Imperial Court.

320
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,610
You only showed up on occasions like festivals and state banquets.

321
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,200
Meanwhile, I attend the Imperial Court daily yet never show up to banquets.

322
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,230
Who would've expected our reunion

323
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,610
to happen in Tianqi City's biggest gambling house?

324
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,520
May I know why you have come?

325
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,570
Because of friendship.

326
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,960
Such a coincidence.

327
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,820
Coincidental, right?

328
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,160
 I'm Li Fansong, a disciple of Zhao Yuzhen of Mount Wangcheng.

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,340
 I'm Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng.

330
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,720
 - We pay our respects, State Preceptor. 
 - We pay our respects, State Preceptor.

331
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,370
 Please rise.

332
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,100
 Elder Yin wrote to say that you're coming

333
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,860
 to sit in at the Directorate of Astronomy.

334
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,790
 You two are the next generation leaders of Mount Wangcheng.

335
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,290
 It's an honor to have you at the Directorate of Astronomy.

336
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,170
 Thank you, State Preceptor.

337
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,300
 But before that, we have another favor to ask.

338
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,380
 What is it?

339
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,330
 The one holding the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House is a friend of Mount Wangcheng.

340
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,280
 We hope to ask you to attend the banquet.

341
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,400
 I could not rescue your master, and I feel guilty about my old friend.

342
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,780
 As such, I can fulfill Mount Wangcheng's request and let you sit in at the Directorate of Astronomy.

343
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,600
 However, for me to attend the banquet,

344
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,930
 you must give me a good reason to convince me.

345
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,420
 Because the friend who is hosting the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House

346
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,390
 is closely related to our master's wife.

347
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,340
 If she were in Tianqi, she would have come to invite you personally.

348
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,360
 Your master's wife?

349
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,670
State Preceptor, Grand Preceptor. Please have a seat.

350
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,590
Please, Your Highness.

351
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,210
- Marquis. 
 - Please, State Preceptor.

352
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,640
Grand Preceptor.

353
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,810
Now, you can wait for another hour.

354
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,160
No need.

355
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,310
The residences of the princes are not far.

356
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,690
I believe they would have heard the news

357
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,040
when State Preceptor was on his way here with the young Taoist.

358
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,360
Welcoming our guests!

359
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,480
His Highness, Prince Bai, has arrived!

360
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,640
His Highness, Prince Chi, has arrived!

361
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,900
Are you all starving?

362
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,580
Why are you so early?

363
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,740
Can't you wait for me a little?

364
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,040
- Greetings, Prince Bai. 
 - Greetings, Prince Bai.

365
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,500
- Greetings, Prince Chi. 
 - Greetings, Prince Chi.

366
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,280
Please rise.

367
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,790
You two.

368
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,860
Long time no see.

369
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,260
Long time no see, Sixth Brother.

370
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,340
Sixth Brother, you got tanned and lost weight.

371
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,790
Since you're home, don't leave anymore.

372
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,740
Rest up at home.

373
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,600
Don't worry.

374
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,390
Since I'm back,

375
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,430
I won't leave anytime soon.

376
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,910
That's great.

377
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,660
I initially thought that you wouldn't be coming today.

378
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,740
Something came up at home. Hence, there was some delay.

379
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,880
With you traveling out there for years and finally returning to the capital, as your brother, of course, I'd come.

380
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,030
Sixth Brother is quite influential.

381
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,260
The Four Great Merchants and all civil and military officials are here.

382
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,730
Even Grand Preceptor and State Preceptor are here too.

383
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,220
How can I not show up?

384
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,790
Regardless of your wishes, you're here now.

385
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,810
So be my guest.

386
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,800
Please have a seat.

387
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,940
Are we sitting at a table with you?

388
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,800
Of course not.

389
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,090
My seat is over there.

390
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,950
Start the banquet.

391
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,850
The banquet begins!

392
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,860
Here, Official Li. Come, come.

393
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,140
It's been a long time since we met.

394
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,800
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

395
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,180
Everyone, cheers.

396
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,260
Cheers.

397
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,840
Official Liu.

398
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,950
Here, Brother Zhao.

399
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,040
Such a rare occasion.

400
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,470
Here.

401
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,600
- Grand Preceptor. 
 - Let me fill your cup.

402
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,500
Come, come.

403
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,300
No need to be so formal.

404
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,230
You're being too formal.

405
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,100
Uncle.

406
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,860
Nephew.

407
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,750
Here.

408
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,130
Please, Sir.

409
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,210
Cheers to you.

410
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,740
Here.

411
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,700
Down it, down it!

412
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,320
Grand Preceptor. I think his intentions are very obvious.

413
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,940
In just a moment, he should be summoning the ones he wishes to speak with.

414
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:41,840
The topics of discussion and the deals made would be the greatest secret of this banquet.

415
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,480
But he loves to give surprises.

416
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:58,290
Grand Preceptor. What thoughts do you have after meeting him again?

417
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:04,210
He is like the untamed foal.

418
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,720
When we met, judging from his expressions, I thought he'd changed.

419
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:17,080
But it appears that the foal has just grown up.

420
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,690
Look at the two over there.

421
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,270
They had so many conflicts overtly and secretly.

422
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,480
But now, they're sitting together and having a meal.

423
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,400
That's right.

424
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,270
I remember that it's been a long time since we last ate together.

425
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,890
Did we ever sit together for a meal?

426
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,820
Yes, we did.

427
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:47,060
Back then, only you and Old Sixth among all our brothers didn't call me a blind man.

428
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,900
I remember.

429
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,840
I wonder if the one up there still remembers.

430
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,030
If he does, shouldn't he invite us for a drink up there?

431
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,710
If you want to, go ahead.

432
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,960
But if you raised a cup to him, he probably wouldn't even look.

433
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,760
How dare he?

434
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,900
Who is that?

435
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,010
Is she sixth brother's lover?

436
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,580
You're here.

437
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,290
Was it tiring to travel from Sangu City?

438
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,840
Yes.

439
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,510
Upon arrival, I see Your Highness's grand banquet.

440
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,280
Sorry.

441
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,090
What is your goal behind hosting this banquet?

442
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,410
To tell them that I'm back.

443
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,900
They can choose to follow

444
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,830
or defy me.

445
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,560
I will not rope in anyone here today.

446
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,420
It's all up to their own decisions.

447
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,050
You are the mighty Sixth Prince.

448
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,450
You can do that, but you must remember who paved the way for you.

449
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,190
I have not forgotten

450
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,280
and I never will.

451
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,150
Everyone!

452
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,640
Are you done with your drinks?

453
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,930
Yes!

454
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,040
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

455
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,100
Then let me raise my cup

456
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,440
to all of you.

457
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,070
Cheers!

458
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,520
- Cheers to Prince Yong'an. 
 - Cheers to Prince Yong'an.

459
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,490
Cheers to Prince Yong'an.

460
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,310
What...

461
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,030
His Highness... What's wrong?

462
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,660
What happened to His Highness?

463
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,700
What's wrong?

464
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,910
What happened?

465
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,410
His Highness is trying to...

466
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,390
This...

467
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,790
What's wrong, Zang Ming?

468
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,830
Prince Yong'an unveiled the stone wall at the top of the Qianjin Gambling House.

469
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,140
The word "libation" is engraved on the wall.

470
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,250

471
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,510

472
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,930
Drums.

473
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,390
Strings!

474
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,790
Lend me your sword.

475
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,280
 Dew on scallion leaves dries out easily in the sun.

476
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,620
 Yet tomorrow morning, it will fall on the scallion leaves again.

477
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,120
 And humans, once dead, will never return.

478
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,510
 To the land where souls gather,

479
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,940
 all, no matter whether virtuous or ignorant, will eventually return.

480
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,870
 Death urges on so hurriedly that human life cannot be extended.

481
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,810
Brother Tang.

482
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,140
 Hence, it makes no room for hesitance.

483
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,180
 Dew on scallion leaves dries out easily under the sun.

484
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,610
 Yet tomorrow morning, it will fall on the scallion leaves again.

485
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,150
 And humans, once dead, will never return.

486
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,900
 To the land where souls gather,

487
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,980
 all, no matter whether virtuous or ignorant, will eventually return.

488
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,130
 Death urges on so hurriedly that human life cannot be extended.

489
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,860
 Hence, it makes no room for hesitance.

490
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,720

491
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,290

492
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,330

493
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,250

494
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,900
Tang Lian.

495
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,180
Rest in peace.

496
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,940
This is Zhancui.

497
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,120
The highest kind of mourning dress among all Five Mourning Garments.

498
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,560
Your Highness. Let's leave for now.

499
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,430
All of Tianqi City's prestigious families and imperial officials are here.

500
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,200
He wouldn't act recklessly.

501
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,600
If you could see this sight for yourself, you'd know what it means to be reckless.

502
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,110
This is comparable to charging into Tai'an Hall with a sword.

503
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,460
Serve the last dish!

504
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,990
- Last dish? 
 - Last dish?

505
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,500
- Last dish? 
 - I have no idea either.

506
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,790
Yes...

507
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,620
According to royal banquet specifications, all the dishes have been served.

508
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,800
Why is there a last dish?

509
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,810
What... What is this?

510
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,070
I don't know.

511
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,740
I've never seen it before.

512
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,120
Tofu rice.

513
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,630
What's tofu rice?

514
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,300
It doesn't sound appetizing, Master.

515
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,360
At the place where my senior brother lived,

516
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:42,380
their family will prepare a tofu feast when someone dies.

517
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,140
They'd invite the friends of the deceased for a meal.

518
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,720
There will be no meat,

519
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,940
but a variety of dishes made from tofu.

520
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,200
And the most important dish of all

521
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,290
is what you see before you, tofu rice.

522
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,740
Tofu can bring longevity.

523
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,610
The deceased has passed on,

524
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,270
but those who are alive remain.

525
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,650
I hope that after you eat this tofu rice,

526
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,320
starting today,

527
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:26,210
you can all live a good life in Tianqi City.

528
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,070
In Qingzhou, if you are invited to a tofu feast,

529
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,520
you are not allowed to reject it.

530
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,420
After all, the deceased deserves our respect.

531
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,050
What do you all think?

532
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,120
Come.

533
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,030
 Let's eat.

534
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,570
 Come.

535
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,110
Grand Preceptor.

536
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,400
Marquis.

537
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,560
If I'm not mistaken, you're from the South, right?

538
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes.

539
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,840
In my hometown, after someone dies, we all eat a bowl of tofu rice.

540
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:44,960
But after coming to Tianqi, it's been years since I've had tofu rice like this.

541
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,080
When I die, I hope everyone can have a bowl of tofu rice as well.

542
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,780
 Come on.

543
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,040
 Let's eat, let's eat.

544
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,910
Zang Ming. Bring it to me.

545
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,740
You can eat all you want.

546
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,630
Longxie, we'll leave.

547
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,390
What are you trying to do?

548
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,950
Why aren't you eating the tofu rice?

549
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,450
What does your senior brother's death have to do with me?

550
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,420
You will soon find out what it has to do with you.

551
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,240
This is interesting.

552
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,160
Are you trying to kill me here?

553
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,870
Do you think I won't dare?

554
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,490
Fairy Lady Rui, please leave for now.

555
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,790
I will be sure to give you an explanation about senior brother.

556
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,980
Do as I say here.

557
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,340
Fine.

558
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,810
His Majesty has arrived!

559
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,850
- Welcome, Your Majesty. 
 - Welcome, Your Majesty.

560
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,870
You're back.

561
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,020
I'm back.

562
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,860
I heard that you have fully recovered.

563
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,230
Yes.

564
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,570
That's great.

565
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,040
Have you eaten?

566
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,340
We're about to end the banquet.

567
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,940
Do you have any food left?

568
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,040
I am hungry.

569
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,880
We only have tofu rice left.

570
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,020
Bring a bowl to me to taste it.

571
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:47,880
I've heard from Lanyue about his experiences during his travels.

572
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:54,260
So, Chuhe, did someone pass away?

573
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
My senior brother did.

574
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,310
You've grown up.

575
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,840
I will not lecture you anymore like I used to.

576
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,680
Just do whatever you wish to do.

577
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,990
All right.

578
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,020
Rise, all of you.

579
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,870
I did not intend to neglect you.

580
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:31,590
It just has been too long since I last met my son.

581
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,470
Therefore,

582
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,260
I do not want any distractions while we speak.

583
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,220
I hope you can all understand.

584
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,440
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

585
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,280
Let's leave.

586
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,310
Your Majesty.

587
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,790
Hua Jin. Would you like to stay?

588
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,690
Some of my friends are here, and I've not seen them in a while.

589
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,100
Fine, then.

590
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,970
Later, tell Yueli to escort you to the palace.

591
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

592
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,980
Depart!

593
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,980
- Our regards, Your Majesty. 
 - Our regards, Your Majesty.

594
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,680
You may all leave.

595
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:46,650
He is still the one and only favored son within Tianqi City.

596
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,320
He has always been.

597
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,500
Come rest for a moment at the Directorate of Astronomy.

598
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,280
My pleasure.

599
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,000
- Please, Grand Preceptor. 
 - Please, State Preceptor.

600
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,720
Back then, when I went to Xueyue City for you, you refused to leave.

601
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,350
Why are you back now?

602
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,720
I like to make my own choices.

603
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,620
I am aware of what happened to your senior brother.

604
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:25,520
Regardless, I will be sure to make the culprit pay for what he has done.

605
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,130
Good.

606
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,410
Zang Ming.

607
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,670
They must think that we are silly.

608
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,090
Yes.

609
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,400
Exhausting ourselves of all favors to invite the State Preceptor, the pillar of the country.

610
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:59,400
Organizing such a grand banquet and still turning it into a funeral in the end.

611
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000

612
