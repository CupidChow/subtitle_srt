22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,920

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,180

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,960
I thought you were a man of extraordinary stature to have this kind of cultivation,

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,560
but when faced with such a talented young man, City Lord Luo, why were you so determined to kill him?

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,270
I have my reasons.

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,270
But you can't kill this person today.

28
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,590
Second Brother, get Wushuang out of here.

29
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,300
- Thank you.
- I should thank you two.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,190
Go on now.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,810
So you're... Xiao Chuhe?

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,390
I heard that in three days, you'll take a person away and kill a person.

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,700
Am I the person you want to kill?

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,560
That's right.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,440
But not today.

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,650
I've given Tianqi three days to prepare for the sword fights.

37
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,620
But you're holding a staff.

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,160
You're not eligible to engage in this fight.

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,140
What about me then?

40
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,430
The Heart Sword?

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,080
You're the descendant of Li Xinyue?

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm the disciple of Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity of Xueyue City,

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,380
and Lei Hong, one of the Two Heroes of the Lei Clan of Lei Fortress,

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,060
the heir of the Sword Heart Tomb's Heart Sword, Lei Wujie. I'm here to challenge you.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,890
You fool.

46
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,150
Do you think the long title will impress him?

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,920
- Good. 
 - Wait!

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,100
Wait for what?

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,940
You've fought two battles successively already.

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,610
Besides, the two opponents are strong.

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,900
You look like you're fine right now,

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,740
but I'm sure your physical strength isn't the same as it was in the beginning.

53
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm fine.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,980
Stop! You want to go easy on me.

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,570
But I can't accept it. We swordsmen are sincere.

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,540
How can we mistreat our swords?

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,940
Didn't you just say you'll be in Tianqi City for a few more days?

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,840
Then three days later, after you rest up, we'll come here again for a sword battle.

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,790
- I... 
 - Senior, farewell!

60
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,860
See you in three days. Let's go! Hurry up!

61
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,870
Quickly!

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,380
Quick. Come on.

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,180
Lei Wujie, are you out of your mind?

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,040
How could you possibly fight him?

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Brother Lei, you look naive and ignorant.

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,220
But actually, you're quite smart.

67
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,580
How so? After the two exciting showdowns,

68
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,140
Lone Sword Deity's radiance is outstanding among the swordsmen.

69
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,190
Lone Sword Deity was on a roll and asked for a sword fight, but no one came forward.

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,950
Yet, Lei Wujie stepped forward and joked around.

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,650
He even made a three-day covenant with him. The moment was totally ruined.

72
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,430
It caused the Lone Sword Deity to fail in making it look like the master was seeking opponents.

73
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,320
Miss Ye knows me well.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,010
What about the fight three days later? Lei Wujie, what will you do?

75
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm no match for any of the three people who fought today.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Especially the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,600
- The difference between us is great. 
 - So you know this.

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,720
But he chopped Prince Yong'an's plaque in half with his sword.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,460
He was demonstrating his strength.

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,290
Whether we challenge him or not, he'll come to us eventually.

81
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,920
Rather than letting him start a fight, why don't we take the initiative?

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,340
At least we can...

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,140
Can what?

84
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,350
We can... make ourselves known.

85
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,730
You're such a peculiar man.

86
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,520

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,010
You're fine. There are no serious issues.

88
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,580
- Just get some rest. 
 - Thank you, Sir.

89
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,670
Sir Xie Xuan. Xiao Wushuang.

90
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,240
Xiao Wushuang. These are all the best tonics I got from Xiao Se's dispensary.

91
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,810
You know how petty he is. It wasn't easy to get these!

92
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,350
You're here to ask for advice. Cut the crap. Just get to the point.

93
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,040
Are you trying to ask about Luo Qingyang's sword?

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,790
Yes.

95
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,380
As the saying goes, know thy self, know thy enemy.

96
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,220
You know I can't get my sword technique stronger than his in such a short time.

97
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,160
But I have to look for his weakness in his sword technique.

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,370
So I can start with his weakness, launch a surprise attack, and defeat him in one hit.

99
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,800
Okay. Go ahead.

100
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,450
Here's my question.

101
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,940
From which direction did his final sword attack you?

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,860
It was from all directions.

103
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,340
Okay. Then, at that time,

104
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,400
which part of his sword qi was the strongest and which was the weakest?

105
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,250
It was everywhere.

106
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,100
There's nothing to say, then.

107
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,930
It really was how it felt.

108
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,200
Having a sword fight with Luo Qingyang is different from others.

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,260
We were standing there, in that open space,

110
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,750
but it felt like I was in a brand-new place.

111
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,950
That place belonged to Luo Qingyang.

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,850
No. It belonged to Luo Qingyang's Nine-Song Sword Technique.

113
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,230
The wind was desolate. It was a boundless field.

114
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,750
I vaguely heard someone singing nearby.

115
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,520
And for a moment, I really wanted to cry.

116
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,170
This is so-called the sword deity's sword tendency.

117
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,460
With one swing, he can create a brand new world.

118
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,890
In that place, he's the ruler.

119
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,660
Is there no way to break the sword deity's sword tendency then?

120
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,710
Every sword deity has its own sword tendency.

121
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,920
It's like a small world.

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,120
If you want to break this small world,

123
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,150
instead of doing what the sword wants,

124
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,360
you have to do the opposite.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,180
The sword tendency of Lone Sword Deity gives a sense of melancholy.

126
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,310
I got it.

127
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,880
You learn fast. You're quite smart.

128
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,570
What's the solution?

129
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,150
I'll scold him.

130
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,860
The sword tendency is the crucial part of the desolate sword.

131
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,460
Once the Martyr Sword is drawn, the desolate wind blows.

132
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
It's the time when the warriors sing!

133
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,170
This is when the tension rises. I'll go on a rampage and yell,

134
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,780
"Luo Qingyang, you old man!

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,990
Why did you come to Tianqi City for no reason?!

136
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,190
What has Tianqi City got to do with you?

137
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,430
Why have you chosen to come now, instead of any other time?

138
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,850
You even held sword fights in Tianqi. Did Tianqi City agree?

139
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,850
You even crashed the plaque. Do you know how expensive the plaque is?

140
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,030
Just get lost!"

141
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,550
Sir Xie Xuan. Tell me, if I yell at him like this,

142
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,320
do you think he'll still be able to create an aura of melancholy? Can he?

143
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,400
Actually, about what you said, I think it's got some reasonable points.

144
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,130
Sir Xie, you don't have to care about this fool's feelings.

145
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,640
Just speak directly.

146
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,510
I'm not comforting him.

147
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,590
If we do as Brother Lei said,

148
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,440
that desolate sword tendency will indeed be easily thwarted.

149
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,450
Of course. You can yell at him.

150
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,840
But scolding only plays a supporting role.

151
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,870
It's impossible to scold a sword deity into existence though.

152
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,770
Right?

153
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,360
By the way,

154
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,050
the Sword Heart Technique of your family is about honing the sword heart.

155
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,540
If you could cultivate in seclusion for two days and practice the technique with a pure sword heart.

156
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,420
You might have a window of opportunity.

157
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,740
You're right. I was thinking about that too.

158
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,200
Then we'll excuse ourselves first.

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,910
Sir, please come and watch the fight in three days.

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,710

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,280
Xiao Se, I'll name the sword technique of mine as Insulting Sword Technique, what do you think?

162
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,500
I defeat the sword deity while insulting him.

163
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Isn't it domineering?

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
But I don't think it's domineering enough.

165
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,470
You're a good writer, help me with it.

166
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,360
Do you have any idea what kind of an opponent you're facing?

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,740
He's the number one swordsman on the Top-Rank List,

168
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,250
the one-of-a-kind master who's as good as Baili Dongjun.

169
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,130
That's why I need two days to focus on cultivating my sword.

170
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,560
By the way, Xiao Se, yesterday, I only said I'd see him in three days.

171
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,280
But I didn't mention the time.

172
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,430
Forget it. I'll just go there in the evening,

173
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,590
this way I'll have more time to cultivate my sword.

174
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,900
Do you understand what I'm saying?

175
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,770
Don't worry, I haven't gone crazy.

176
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,360
I have my sword and my pride.

177
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,030
I'll go cultivate my sword heart. Watch me become famous this time.

178
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,580
- Go on. 
 - This way!

179
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,160
- He wants to obtain the sword heart? 
 - That's right.

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,970
Back then, Aunt Xinyue once cultivated the sword for seven days.

181
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,820
In the end, she made it to the execution ground alone with her sword.

182
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,380
What are the chances that he can win against Luo Qingyang in this way?

183
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,960
Ten percent.

184
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,970
- It's better than I thought. 
 - Isn't even obtainable.

185
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,940
Can't you finish the sentence all at once?

186
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,990
Xiao Se, you should talk Lei Wujie out of it.

187
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,640
Yesterday, Wushuang was nearly killed by the Lone Sword Deity.

188
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,060
If he knows about your relationship, I'm sure he'll strike even harder.

189
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,740
Lei Wujie is the brother of the Xueyue Sword Deity, after all.

190
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,640
There are different levels of closeness between the Five Sword Deities,

191
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,650
but they have compassion for one another.

192
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,140
In this regard, Luo Qingyang likely won't kill him.

193
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,230
This fool, he clearly knew that he would suffer.

194
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,860
Perhaps this fight... will do him good.

195
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,610
Sister Ruoyi, no matter how strong Luo Qingyang is, he's just a human.

196
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,240
Besides, is it really that easy to kill Xiao Se in Tianqi City?

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,020
Xiao Se doesn't want others to get hurt because of him.

198
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,660
Luo Qingyang is here for him.

199
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,730
Then, he should take the responsibility for this war.

200
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,970
This has been the choice he made since childhood.

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,010
But we... can also make our own choices.

202
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,350
Hanyi.

203
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,260
Why didn't you inform us that you came back from the Sword Heart Tomb?

204
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,470
How did I fall asleep?

205
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,870
Why did you turn around and ask me that?

206
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,260
It's getting cold. Beware of catching a cold.

207
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,540
How was it?

208
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,860
How was the progress of restoring your power at the Sword Heart Tomb?

209
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,360
I've got thirty percent of my power back. Don't worry.

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,830
I barely received any news at the Sword Heart Tomb.

211
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,910
I was worried. So I'd like to stay in Xueyue City for a while.

212
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,740
Did you dream of him?

213
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,310
If he were here now, maybe things would be easier for Tianqi City.

214
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,060
After all, he was the son-in-law of Xueyue City.

215
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,800
He should fight Luo Qingyang on our behalf.

216
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,900
I heard that... Luoxia left.

217
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,480
Luo Mingxuan suddenly confessed his love to his master.

218
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,530
She, as his master, didn't know what to do at that point.

219
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,960
So she chose to run off.

220
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,830
What about Luo Mingxuan?

221
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,170
He ran off to follow her.

222
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,850
She'll eventually accept him.

223
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,080
There's been love between a master and a disciple in the martial arts world.

224
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,630
But it's still hard to be accepted.

225
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,050
In a relationship, one side must be braver.

226
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,760
As long as one of them is willing to be brave, they'll eventually end up together.

227
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,710
He was the person who was braver than me.

228
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,140
Who are you referring to?

229
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,590
Luo Mingxuan or Zhao Yuzhen?

230
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,190
But if back then, the brave one had been me,

231
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,090
would things have ended up differently?

232
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,740
Hanyi, it's all in the past. So don't bring it up anymore.

233
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,890
How are things going on in Tianqi?

234
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,090
We can't help them fight Luo Qingyang this time.

235
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,670
What will happen to them then?

236
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,530
I have faith in Xiao Se.

237
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,700
When he returned from Penglai Island, I talked to him once.

238
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,590
He said he has a solution.

239
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,530
And it's something Luo Qingyang will never think of.

240
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,760
Xiao Se. There's news.

241
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
We got word from the military.

242
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,570
What kind of news would make you panic like this?

243
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,370
Nanjue invaded our border.

244
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,130
They've conquered three of our cities in one day.

245
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,660
What?

246
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,870
Now of all times?

247
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,390
Yes.

248
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,070
It happens now of all times.

249
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,660
Right now, the Lone Sword Deity is in Tianqi City asking for sword fights.

250
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,030
Nanjue has invaded the border.

251
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,270
It must be Xiao Yu who plotted all of this.

252
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,690
I don't care if it's a plot.

253
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,990
I've ordered the Langya Army to be on red alert.

254
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,840
They're preparing to head to the border overnight to fight the enemy.

255
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,760
Who would've imagined, the Langya Army that marched to Tianqi a while ago

256
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,250
is now going to guard the country on Beili's behalf.

257
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,120
I suppose the old soldiers will have complaints.

258
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,220
It's inevitable that there would be complaints.

259
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,570
But since Langya is carved on their armor, they have to carry out the will of Langya.

260
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,450
These days, I stayed in the military camp outside the city.

261
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,880
But I've heard about the matter with the Lone Sword Deity.

262
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,930
You don't have to worry about me. I have a solution.

263
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,540
Are you confident?

264
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,800
I heard that the Rage Sword Deity and the City Lord of Wushuang City were already defeated.

265
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,490
Yes.

266
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,360
So I'm going to the Directorate of Astronomy to ask him to open the Heavenly Sword Pavilion for me.

267
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,740
You're going to ask for a sword?

268
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,160
That's right.

269
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,520
The people think that since I'm Ji Ruofeng's disciple,

270
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,180
and inherited his Wuji Staff, then my skill is with the staff.

271
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,770
But actually, my sword technique is better than my staff technique.

272
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,290
But even my father couldn't break through that Sword Pavilion.

273
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,530
Someone must give it a try.

274
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,390
You'll guard the country.

275
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,770
I'll pacify Tianqi.

276
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,190
You want to open the Heavenly Sword Pavilion?

277
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,940
Yes. Sorry to trouble you.

278
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,670
Why didn't your friend, your Brother Lei, come today?

279
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,780
When it comes to the critical moment, someone must be here to protect you.

280
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,040
Are you not willing to protect me?

281
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm really sorry.

282
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,190
Since the fight at the celestial mountain, I've suffered a severe injury.

283
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,140
I see.

284
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,870
Let me do it.

285
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,260
Why are you here?

286
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,140
State Preceptor, I'll protect him when he enters the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

287
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,740
Alright.

288
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,820
What?

289
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,960
A few days ago you promised me that you would stay with me.

290
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,040
But now, you're acting alone.

291
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,260
You went back on your word.

292
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,260
Come on.

293
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,460
This way, please, Your Highness.

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,170
Why does this place look so familiar?

295
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,750
Miss Qianluo, have you been to the Sword Heart Tomb?

296
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,470
It looks exactly like that place.

297
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,990
No wonder.

298
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,970
The late owner of the Sword Heart Tomb once visited this place.

299
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,500
Then, he went back to the Sword Heart Tomb and built a sword pavilion that was identical.

300
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,120
Except that he didn't make that door.

301
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,050
Because even if he made the door,

302
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,860
he still couldn't make the thing inside that door.

303
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,570
I, Xiao Se, of the Xiao family, came to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion for a sword.

304
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,560
Please enlighten me.

305
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,750
That's it?

306
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,620
This was the sword of Princess Hualuo a hundred years ago, the Falling Flowers Sword.

307
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,810
Rumor has it that when Princess Hualuo was alive, she loved charming young men.

308
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,460
Therefore...

309
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,070
he can gain a lot of benefits with his appearance.

310
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,550
Xiao Se, I thought you only practiced the staff technique.

311
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,730
I didn't know you excelled in sword technique as well. What is this sword technique?

312
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,030
This is the Nation-Breaking Sword Technique, created by Xiao Yi, the first emperor of Beili.

313
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,720
It's only passed down to the imperial descendants.

314
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,620
It's bold and unconstrained. It's also domineering.

315
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,800
Those untalented can't practice this technique.

316
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,730
The Nation-Breaking Sword Technique contains four phases.

317
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,930
Life-Destroyer, Wind-Breaker, Dragon-Shocker, and Sky-Crusher.

318
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:48,520
Most people have spent their lives learning this but still can't reach the Life-Destroyer Phase.

319
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,840
In a hundred years, Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng, was the person with the highest achievement in this technique.

320
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,650
He reached the Wind-Breaker Phase.

321
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,750
Including Falling Flowers Sword, Your Highness has obtained nine swords in total.

322
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,130
Are you trying to empty my Heavenly Sword Pavilion?

323
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,690
These nine swords are just a sign of good luck.

324
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,100
What I really want, you should know better than anyone else.

325
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,880
Even Prince Langya couldn't open this door back then.

326
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,710
In terms of the sword technique, I'm stronger than Uncle Langya.

327
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,060
The Dragon-Shocker Technique?

328
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,540
Xiao Se, you go in first. I'll guard here.

329
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,620
Be careful. Wait for my return.

330
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,510
Imperial Father?

331
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,100
 It's strange, isn't it?

332
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,180
 Why would you see me in the Sword Pavilion?

333
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,560
The Sword Pavilion is mysterious.

334
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,670
I must've entered some sort of magic array.

335
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,950
You're as calm as always.

336
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,600
Judging from your healthy complexion and clear voice,

337
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,370
you're like the imperial father in my mind.

338
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
You're very smart.

339
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,300
Because I am only the father in your memory.

340
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,350
The father you once respected, but hated in the end.

341
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,610
No wonder.

342
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,570
When I entered the pavilion, it gave off the light fragrance of sandalwood.

343
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,490
It seems like I've fallen into Inner Demon Imaginary Array.

344
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,180
So my inner demon is actually you, Imperial Father.

345
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,480
The old case has been settled and the past is the past.

346
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,020
But has everything really ended?

347
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,230
You still can't let go of the past.

348
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,970
Why didn't you gather the courage,

349
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,500
barge onto the execution ground,

350
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,580
and fall out with me on that day?

351
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,010
I do blame myself because of this decision.

352
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,890
You hate me, both in the past and now in the present.

353
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,470
You'll continue to hate me in the future.

354
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,000
The old case has been settled.

355
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,890
It's just that Prince Langya will never come back again.

356
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,820
Those things you lost will never come back again either.

357
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,450
Kill me.

358
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,550
Kill me!

359
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,700
So you can end your resentment.

360
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,330
A life for a life.

361
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,430
This is what you've always thought.

362
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,480
This is also what was on your mind,

363
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,770
after you lost your martial arts and lay in the mud during a downpour.

364
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,720
No.

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,090
That's not true.

366
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,410
What's wrong?

367
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,190
Are you afraid?

368
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,100
Before, I indeed...

369
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,710
hated you so much.

370
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,680
Though you've made amends now, I still resent you.

371
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,110
I resent you for choosing to compromise back in the day.

372
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,540
The choices my imperial father and imperial uncle Langya made back then

373
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,060
were for the sake of the peace of the nation.

374
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,140
I just find it a pity

375
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,680
that my imperial father couldn't have been braver, overcome his inner demon

376
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,560
and save his brother.

377
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,490
What's done is done.

378
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,450
If I encounter the same problem in the future,

379
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,180
I'll leave

380
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,800
no regrets.

381
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,600
You're going to kill me?

382
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,840
It's not my father that I want to kill, but my inner demon.

383
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,170
Your friends died saving you.

384
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,400
How could you not have regrets?

385
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,090
Don't do this!

386
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,410
It really is Inner Demon Imaginary Array.

387
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,400
What a shame.

388
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,460
You broke the door with Dragon-Shocker and slayed the inner demon.

389
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,250
But Tianzhan Sword still rejected you.

390
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,680
Why?

391
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,390
When you put the inner demon to the sword, I saw ambition,

392
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,860
but afterward, you were trapped in comradeship.

393
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,430
How are you supposed to follow Heaven's will and pierce the sky?

394
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,130
This is what's restricting you.

395
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,530
What's restricting me.

396
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,990
The holder of Tianzhan can't be restricted like this.

397
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,940
If that really is the case,

398
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,670
then I'll reject Tianzhan as well.

399
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,600
Wait.

400
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,440
After all these years, you're the only one who has made it this far.

401
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,830
I'm willing to give you time to comprehend the sword phase.

402
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,820
The longer she holds on, the more time you'll have to comprehend it.

403
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,300
♫   Don't fear, the roaring of the tiger or thousands of thunder claps  ♫

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:21,820
♫   Don't fear, the stormy waves and winds  ♫

405
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,900
♫   You can't see the ends of the world without traveling  ♫

406
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,100
♫   It's not about winning or losing  ♫

407
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,780
♫   Or asking who it will be tomorrow  ♫

408
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,040
No one can come enter for the second time.

409
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,160
You have to think carefully.

410
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,670
♫   That lavish coat, can't compare to the lightness I carry  ♫

411
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,580
♫   Riding on a spear, singing songs  ♫

412
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,950
What a shame.

413
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,910
To an emperor, some precious things are insignificant.

414
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
Why are you here?

415
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,080
You're severely injured.

416
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,790
Did you get the thing you want?

417
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,480
Can we answer each other's questions first?

418
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,790
Did you... get hurt in there?

419
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,500
Look.

420
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,430
It's indeed a nice good luck charm.

421
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,270
I can rest assured

422
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,370
since it came out from there.

423
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,200
It was tough for Miss Qianluo.

424
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,300
With just a spear, she held out for six hours for your sake.

425
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,600
Six hours?

426
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,380
But it felt like I was only in there for half an hour.

427
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,270
I don't know why either.

428
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,270
It's just that Your Highness,

429
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,870
once the door is closed, it can never be opened again.

430
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,110
Since you failed to obtain the sword,

431
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,600
I'm afraid you'll lose your fight against Luo Qingyang.

432
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,720
This sword isn't meant to be mine.

433
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,370
What it thinks is restricting me, is everything that accompanied me along my way here.

434
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:43,100
It's completely different from what I believe in.

435
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm better off without it.

436
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:51,170
Besides, I don't think I can defeat Luo Qingyang in this way.

437
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,480
Since you can't defeat him,

438
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,560
you can also retreat.

439
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,670
Retreat?

440
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,280
I can retreat, but Tianqi can't.

441
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,670
I retreated once and it made me regret it ever since.

442
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,570
So I'll never retreat this time.

443
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,480
I not only won't retreat,

444
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,770
but I'll also be one step ahead of those friends of mine.

445
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,650

446
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,900

447
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,870
Master, didn't Lei Wujie say he come to have a sword fight here today?

448
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,910
Why isn't he here yet?

449
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,930
He's cultivating the sword heart.

450
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,500
The longer he simmers, the stronger his final move will be.

451
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,620
So now, even the time of a single breath is extremely precious to him.

452
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,310
It's no use stalling for time.

453
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,770
Once the time has come, my godfather will take the initiative to find Xiao Chuhe.

454
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,930
Besides, Xiao Chuhe isn't someone who would retreat.

455
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,500
Someone is here.

456
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,680
Xiao Se from Tianqi comes for a sword fight.

457
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,840
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique?

458
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,580
Xiao Se came with nine swords.

459
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,330
So it's to use Nation-Breaking Sword Technique.

460
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,390
The swords he chose are all the best.

461
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,740
But Sir Xie, do you think the nine swords are sufficient enough?

462
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,650
Well, it depends on which phase of Nation-Breaking Sword Technique he's reached.

463
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,330
It's you who came?

464
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,830
Where is your friend that holds the Heart Sword?

465
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,470
The Heart Sword should be used in the purest battle.

466
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,400
He doesn't have to come.

467
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,870
I'll fight you.

468
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,300
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique, the Wind-Breaker Phase?

469
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:13,130
I didn't expect to see the sword the imperial family used to win over the world again in my life.

470
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,680
It's an honor.

471
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,560
It knows where to go, a sword does it all.

472
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,130
Again!

473
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,890
The Nation-Breaking Sword Technique is indeed strong.

474
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,190
But with just the Wind-Breaker, it's still not enough.

475
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,470
Then, I'll show you the Dragon-Shocker.

476
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,390
What... What's going on?

477
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,490
Did Xiao Se also master the Flying Sword Technique of Wushuang City?

478
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,960
No.

479
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,710
This isn't the Flying Sword Technique.

480
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,000
Those six swords just yield to his sword tendency.

481
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,130
If I'm not wrong, this is...

482
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,160
The Dragon-Shocker Phase.

483
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,670
To return the favor on the Golden Stage, I guide my Jade Dragon to die for the Emperor.

484
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,180
Impressive.

485
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,930
The Dragon-Shocker Technique is indeed remarkable.

486
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,400
Since I've shown my technique, I'd like to see your Martyr Sword.

487
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,190
As you wish.

488
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,740
This is it. This is the sword that defeated Wushuang.

489
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,940
The heavens hate and are angry at authority,

490
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,290
kill with rigor and abandon the open plains!

491
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,190
You, old man, you've hidden at home for over a decade like a coward.

492
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,530
Then after mastering a self-proclaimed peerless technique, came to Tianqi City to pick a fight?

493
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,670
What does this have to do with you? Are you crazy?

494
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,390
You asked for sword fights in Tianqi. Did Tianqi agree to it?

495
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,630
You crashed the plaque of Tianqi City. Did the Xiao family agree to it?!

496
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,470
Isn't this Lei Wujie's Insulting Sword Technique?

497
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,800
A sad poem, my foot.

498
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,970
Are you the only one who's miserable, depressed and upset?

499
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,150
Who has it easy in this world?! Please!

500
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,840
You old man, just get lost!

501
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,340
Everyone knows who you're looking for!

502
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,830
- That martial sister of yours... 
 - That's enough!

503
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,450
The melancholy has been ruined.

504
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,880
You want me to stop? Not a chance!

505
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm going to call you out... call you a coward!

506
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,450
What does love have to do with the ranking of a person?

507
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,040
- Tell me! 
 - I said that's enough!

508
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,390
He has made my godfather mad.

509
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:31,170
But this is not melancholy but wrath.

510
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,220
I won, haven't I?

511
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,970
You're good.

512
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,420
After so many days, you're the first person who made me use this sword.

513
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,440
It's the Etiquette Soul. He finally stepped out of that city.

514
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,960
What is Etiquette Soul?

515
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,670
It's the strongest technique of the Desolate Sword.

516
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,970
If he's able to use the Etiquette Soul, it means Luo Qingyang has reached the Mental Phase&nbsp;of the Unknown.

517
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,700
Stop!

518
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,380
Sword's heart flares in a flash.

519
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,380
Xiao Se, why did you come alone without me?

520
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,340
Are you trying to steal my chance to become famous?

521
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,820
Cultivate the sword for three days, and the sword's heart flares in a flash.

522
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,200
This is a strong sword.

523
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,060
But do you have a second move?

524
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,720
Back off!

525
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:14,680
I, East of Tianqi's Four Guardians, Azure Dragon, Lei Wujie, won't back down!

526
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,640
I, West of Tianqi's Four Guardians, White Tiger, Ji Xue, won't back down!

527
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,660
I, North of Tianqi's Four Guardians, Tang Ze, won't back down!

528
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,660
I, South of Tianqi's Four Guardians, Vermilion Bird, Sikong Qianluo, won't back down!

529
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,540
You all...

530
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,300
Since you refuse to back down, go to your deaths then!
