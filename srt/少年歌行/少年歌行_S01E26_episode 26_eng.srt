♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,150

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,680
I really want to drink the liquor made by my master once more.

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,090
I feel uneasy about it.

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,600
These guys.

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,125

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,370
I'm back.

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,560
You haven't grown up to the point

30
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,520
of not needing your senior brother yet.

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,160

32
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,380
Are we still going to wait for senior brother?

33
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,060
We'll wait for him in Tianqi.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,450
Let's enter the city.

35
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,980

36
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,010
A bunch of useless beings!

37
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,130
Calm down, Your Highness.

38
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,480
The Dark River sent their best assassins to do the job, didn't they?

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,320
The army of Luo City claimed that they had 3,000 cavalries, didn't they?

40
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,230
But they still couldn't stop Xiao Chuhe?

41
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,000
Marquis Lanyue and the Ye Battalion have been deployed.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,800
If we continue to fight him, our identity will be exposed.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,770
Be patient, Your Highness.

44
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,250
After he enters Tianqi City, we'll have more opportunities to kill him.

45
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,130
Opportunities?

46
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,340
I don't need opportunities. I want results.

47
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,460
Master. He has already entered the city.

48
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,030
Chong'er. You are too soft-hearted.

49
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,720
Although he is back in Tianqi,

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,900
Tianqi is no longer the same as before.

51
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,230
I look forward to having a fight with him.

52
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,550
A fair fight.

53
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,640
Xiao Se. Your mansion is too luxurious.

54
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,870
You can buy a city with this land.

55
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,600
No. You can buy two with it.

56
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,930
That's an exaggeration. It's just a small house.

57
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,040
Xiao Se. Why do you name your royal residence "Snowfall Mountain Villa"?

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,500
I have falling snow in front and a tranquil lake at the back.

59
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,120
I have a villa named Snowfall Mountain Villa.

60
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,170
What an elegant name. Doesn't it sound nice?

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,270
Besides, this is not my royal residence.

62
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,980
I dislike living in a royal residence. I prefer this place.

63
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,760
Young Master. Young Master.

64
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,800
You are finally back.

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,310
You must have suffered a lot in the past few years.

66
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,000
No.

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,780
I think you have suffered even more, Uncle Xu.

68
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,160
Nonsense. No one in Tianqi City dares to bully us.

69
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,440
You are right.

70
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,510
No one dares to bully us in Tianqi City.

71
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,570
Who are they?

72
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,970
They are my friends. Sikong Qianluo and Lei Wujie.

73
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,070
Greetings, both of you.

74
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,600
- Uncle Xu. 
 - Uncle Xu.

75
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,430
Uncle Xu. Help them settle in.

76
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,170
Yes, Young Master.

77
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,000
This way, please.

78
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,770
You brat.

79
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,300
Imperial Uncle?

80
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,420
I thought that you would return to the palace first.

81
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,920
I've already sent someone to the Sword Heart Tomb to invite the Divine Healer.

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,520
I've already brought the Divine Healer back with me.

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,910
She's treating your father at Tai'an Hall as we speak.

84
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,040
According to her, your father will regain consciousness.

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,940
Don't worry.

86
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,940
Thank you, Imperial Uncle.

87
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,340
There's no need to thank me.

88
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,910
I'll take my leave now.

89
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,590
Farewell.

90
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,770
Did I wake you?

91
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,780
I've been awake for a long time.

92
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,900
Usually by this time I'll have already finished picking the medicinal herbs at Sword Tomb.

93
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,380
Why are you here so early?

94
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,700
His Majesty won't wake up today.

95
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,130
I know. I'm here to tell you that your patient has returned.

96
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,700
Xiao Se is back? Has he really recovered?

97
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,630
That's great. So, immortals really exist in this world.

98
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,430
If I have the chance, I want to become his disciple.

99
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,750
So, when you come back after learning at the celestial mountain,

100
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,920
I am not going to be able to hire you anymore?

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,440
I hope that you'll never have to hire me again.

102
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,230
You are right.

103
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,400
Imperial Brother, Chuhe is back.

104
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,460
It's time for you to wake up.

105
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,875

106
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,270
It has already been a day since they entered Tianqi City, right?

107
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,130
Many have requested to pay a visit to Snowfall Mountain Villa.

108
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,260
But they were stopped by the housekeeper.

109
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,780
The current Xiao Chuhe does not seem to really want to make connections in Tianqi City.

110
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,410
They are still waiting for someone.

111
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,850
One of their companions is not here yet.

112
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,100
He is the strongest among them.

113
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,570
Unfortunately, they will see him no more.

114
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,820
Young Lady. Young Master Xiao. Young Master Lei.

115
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,010
Do you have news about senior brother?

116
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,000
Senior brother... died fighting against the Dark River.

117
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,050
Nonsense!

118
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,940
Did you see him die? How could you say this?

119
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,770
His body has been sent back to the Tang Clan.

120
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,950
I saw it myself.

121
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,260
You must have been mistaken.

122
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,350
G-Get lost now.

123
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,540
Xiao Se. Send someone to the Tang Clan now to find out more about it.

124
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,160
Maybe he really was mistaken.

125
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,220
Our clan leader said that senior brother fulfilled his duty and hence died without any regrets.

126
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,170
So, don't be sad and focus on the big plan first.

127
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,120
How did he die?

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,530
He drank the Seven Starry Nights wine and died of exhaustion.

129
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,710
Who killed him?

130
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,640
The head of the Xie family, Xie Qidao, from the Dark River.

131
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,060
Together with 21 assassins.

132
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,300
He killed them all by himself and died with them.

133
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,180
That's impossible.

134
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,150
Something must have gone wrong. Something must have gone wrong!

135
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,990
The clan leader has confirmed his death.

136
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,340
I said, it's impossible!

137
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,360
Senior brother had always been able to escape death.

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,160
Why couldn't he do it this time?

139
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,860
This time, he didn't have us holding him back.

140
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,990
He didn't have us holding him back! How could he die?

141
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,880
The clan leader said that senior brother told him about Dark River being the culprit behind our old master's death.

142
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,910
Now, our enemy is the Dark River.

143
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,390
When it's time for us to seek revenge, the Tang Clan will do its best to take them down.

144
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,700
I will take my leave now.

145
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm going to annihilate Dark River to avenge senior brother's death!

146
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,180
Lei Wujie. Don't be blinded by hatred.

147
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,320
Senior brother died because of me.

148
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,560
I will avenge his death.

149
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,700

150
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,570
I didn't expect you to come here in person.

151
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,720
Baili is protecting Mo Yi in Penglai, so he doesn't know it.

152
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,710
Tang Lian was the First Disciple of Xueyue City.

153
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,880
He was also Qianluo's senior brother.

154
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,460
No matter the rhyme or reason, I should be here.

155
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,200
He's nothing but the child of the Tang Clan now.

156
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,580
Then, I'm here to pay respect to a child I knew.

157
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:29,300
Tang Lian. Although you had drunk this before many times,

158
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,370
after thinking about it, I still chose this for you.

159
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,360
Tang Lian. No matter how far you've gone,

160
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,960
don't ever forget the taste of the Beauty of Four Seasons.

161
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,590
I've sent Zhuwang to track down Su Changhe.

162
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,990
We'll have the required information soon.

163
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,120
Xiao Chuhe will do the same, right?

164
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,690
The headquarter of the Bai Xiao Sect is in Tianqi.

165
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,560
He'll do his own investigation.

166
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,070
If you've found the information, give it to him.

167
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,180
Lian'er trusted him, so the Tang Clan will too.

168
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,750
He's indeed a trustworthy person.

169
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,040
It's a pity that the White Tiger took him in before us.

170
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,970
That's different.

171
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,090
The White Tiger just wants him as a disciple.

172
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,520
But you, Vermilion Bird, want to be the father-in-law of the future Emperor.

173
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,480
Don't say that.

174
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,930
When we were young and talked about Azure Dragon, White Tiger,

175
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,960
Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise, we felt powerful and formidable.

176
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,430
But when we listen to the names again at this age, it feels somewhat...

177
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,450
Embarrassing.

178
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,780
Prince Langya was indeed an amazing person.

179
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,110
He managed to bring us all together.

180
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,800
Otherwise, it wouldn't be as fun in this martial arts world.

181
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,670
I miss him.

182
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,780
Lianyue. I've drunk so much with you, and I've made so many jokes.

183
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,940
But actually, I'm feeling quite sad.

184
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,780
Me too.

185
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,220
Tang Lian was an amazing senior brother.

186
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,600

187
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,230
Why are you not asleep yet?

188
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,780
You're not asleep yet either, are you?

189
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,870
I dreamed about senior brother.

190
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,730
What did he say?

191
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,920
He didn't say anything.

192
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,080
He just smiled at me.

193
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,620
I told him that all of us miss him, and we are waiting for him to come back.

194
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,340
He nodded and turned to leave.

195
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,690
Then, I woke up because I panicked.

196
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,690
Actually, as long as we continue to think of him,

197
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,120
he won't be gone.

198
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,020
He'll always be here with us.

199
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,870
Don't worry.

200
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,010
I will avenge his death.

201
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,960
This way, please.

202
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,930
Young Master. Miss Ye is here.

203
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,250
- You may leave us. 
 - Yes, Young Master.

204
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,040
I've heard about Tang Lian.

205
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,570
He took great care of me when he was in Xueyue City.

206
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,940
We'll avenge him together.

207
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,080
But what we need to do now is to not disappoint him.

208
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,030
You are here because of General Ye, right?

209
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,180
No.

210
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,890
I'm not here on behalf of my father.

211
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,680
He's in a difficult position.

212
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,430
If he takes part in this, there are many things that will be out of his hand.

213
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,600
So, I'm here by myself.

214
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,190
You've been away from Tianqi City for many years.

215
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,680
And I had been living here before I went to Xueyue City.

216
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,110
I have been waiting a long time for your return.

217
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,660
So, you are here to be my advisor.

218
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,370
Then, you've come at the right time.

219
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,390
I do need to do something, and I need your help with it.

220
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,190
I know what you need me to do.

221
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,420
Now that I've returned to Tianqi, I have to take this first step.

222
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:59,670
And that first step is to let everyone in Tianqi City know that I'm back.

223
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,580
I want to hold a banquet.

224
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,070
And I want to invite all the powerful men in Tianqi City to attend it.

225
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,880
But I've left Tianqi for quite some time.

226
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,330
I need a new name list.

227
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,050
I've already prepared it for you.

228
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,290
These people are either the imperial families of Tianqi City,

229
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,910
the powerful officials in the court, or the successful and rich merchants of Tianqi City.

230
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,350
The royalty is from the imperial family.

231
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,420
These powerful officials are from all the prestigious families in Tianqi City.

232
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,560
These rich people are controlling the whole economy in Tianqi City.

233
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,660
With some, we have to persuade them to support us. For the others, we have to show who's in power.

234
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,960
All these years, my friends have not worked for nothing.

235
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,660
They now know the social status of almost everyone in the imperial city.

236
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,680
But this banquet is not just to show that I'm back.

237
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,650
What else do you want to do?

238
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,780
I want to force our enemy in the dark to attack me again.

239
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,690
I want to expose their identity

240
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,610
to avenge Senior Brother by killing them myself.

241
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,840
Most of the names in this list are not familiar to me.

242
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,740
But I trust your judgment.

243
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,490
Ask Uncle Xu to draft the invitation letters and send them out.

244
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,750
What is the identity that you want to use?

245
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,870
Do you want to invite them in the name of the Sixth Prince or Prince Yong'an?

246
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,800
Xiao Se.

247
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,990
Just this.

248
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,370
All right.

249
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,010
As for the venue, Diaolou Parlor and Tianxia Pavilion are both good choices.

250
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,580
Diaolou Parlor.

251
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,670
Tianxia Pavilion.

252
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,170
They are too small.

253
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,510
Too small for my banquet.

254
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,320
There's only one place that I want.

255
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,150
The Qianjin Gambling House.

256
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,470
Come. No second thoughts.

257
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,390
- Big or small? 
 - Big!

258
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,390
No second thoughts.

259
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,390
Sixth...

260
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,440
Sixth Prince. You are back.

261
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,810
I knew that I would meet one of you first.

262
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,920
But I never thought that it would be you, Master Jiu.

263
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,810
You are too kind. There's no need to call me Master Jiu.

264
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,450
My buddies flattered me.

265
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,390
Stop teasing me, Sixth Prince.

266
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,910
Go up and tell them that we have an important guest. Go now.

267
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,550
Sixth Prince. Are they your friends?

268
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,840
Let me introduce them to you.

269
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,870
This is Lei Wujie, the Second City Lord of Xueyue City and Li Hanyi's disciple.

270
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,920
This is the daughter of Sikong Changfeng, the Third City Lord

271
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,900
Sikong Qianluo.

272
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,280
Amazing.

273
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,930
This man is called Jiu Jiudao

274
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,920
because he holds power over all the streets in Tianqi City.

275
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,170
So everyone calls him Master Jiu.

276
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,630
Young Lady, Young Master Lei.

277
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,790
Just call me Jiu Jiudao.

278
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,470
This is how Miss Ruoyi addresses me too.

279
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,160
You know Ruoyi?

280
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,490
Miss Ruoyi is in the top three of the Beauty List in our city.

281
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,370
Everyone knows her.

282
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,760
The Beauty List? Who made the list?

283
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,170
I made the list.

284
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,250
But don't worry, you'll be in the top three next time.

285
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,610
- Master Jiu. They are ready to serve our guests upstairs. 
 - All right. I got it.

286
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,830
Let's go upstairs, my noble guests.

287
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,530
This way, please.

288
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,860
This way, please.

289
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,730
Second Master Tu.

290
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,030
Thank you, Master Jiu.

291
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,780
My pleasure.

292
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,830
Sixth Prince. You still look as dashing as ever, even after so many years.

293
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,780
Second Master Tu, how have you been?

294
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,750
Did we interrupt you with our sudden visit?

295
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,600
I was just drinking tea. Nothing to interrupt. I was just thirsty.

296
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,820
Have a seat, everyone.

297
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,940
Sixth Prince. Please drink some tea.

298
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,470
Or should I call you Prince Yong'an, Your Highness?

299
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,760
Be at ease. You can just call me Xiao Se.

300
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,040
Good name. It sounds poetic.

301
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,510
From what they told me, both of you are powerful people as well.

302
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,030
Here.

303
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,970
Please drink some tea.

304
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,870
Qianluo, Lei Wujie. He is the owner of Qianjin Gambling House, Second Master Tu.

305
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,490
Second Master Tu?

306
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,700
Does it mean that there's a Master Tu?

307
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,500
Yes, there was.

308
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,470
But in the end, I killed him.

309
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,910
Enough. That's it for small talk.

310
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:24,590
To be honest, I'm here today because I have a favor to ask.

311
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,440
If you need my help, I'm sure it'll be trouble.

312
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,170
It won't be. I just want some food.

313
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,090
That's easy. Order what you want.

314
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,810
I have all kinds of delicacies here.

315
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,740
Good. This is the promise that I want from you.

316
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,540
Take it out.

317
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,300
Here.

318
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,570

319
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,020
This...

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,950
Do you know what's written on this?

321
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,510
A royal banquet.

322
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,340
This is a royal banquet for the most prestigious and noble guests.

323
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,070
Second Master Tu, don't misunderstand my intentions.

324
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,340
Those useless chefs in the imperial kitchen can't satisfy my palate.

325
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:22,320
But the chefs of Qianjin Gambling House are the best of the best in Tianqi.

326
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,300
Don't try to flatter me with compliments.

327
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,600
This is a gambling house, not a restaurant.

328
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,680
This banquet will take at least a day from noon to midnight.

329
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,300
I'll lose a lot of money if I don't open for a day.

330
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,370
I know that.

331
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,140
But I don't think it'll make a dent in your savings.

332
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,580
Make money or make Tianqi City tremble in awe.

333
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,420
What will you choose?

334
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,910
You have to give me some money then.

335
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,270
Food is not cheap.

336
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,960
How about I give my Snowfall Mountain Villa to you?

337
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,820
Are you really going to give it to me?

338
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,230
If you are willing to give it to me, I'll give you... ten more baskets of pearls.

339
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,870
- Xiao Se. If you give him the villa, where are we going to stay? 
 - That's right.

340
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,330
I'm not done yet.

341
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,190
But we still need to stay there in Tianqi City for a while.

342
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,830
I have another secluded villa in the Martial Arts World.

343
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,540
It has green mountains behind it with a crystal-clear lake in front.

344
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,790
It's an elegant place.

345
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,160
When the snow falls, it's like an other-worldly place.

346
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,880
It is also called the Snowfall Mountain Villa.

347
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,740
I can give that to you.

348
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,300
Deal!

349
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,100
Then it is settled.

350
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,690
Wait.

351
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,030
This banquet can't be handled by either Diaolou Parlor or Tianxia Pavilion.

352
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,490
Only the Qianjin Gambling House is grand enough for it.

353
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,390
But don't you think that the scale of this banquet is too grand?

354
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,380
Now that my father is seriously ill, he can't rule for the moment.

355
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,200
Is there anyone in Tianqi City who will dare to say that my banquet is too grand?

356
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,930
A banquet in Qianjin Gambling House?

357
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,310
Only he can come up with this idea.

358
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,050
Marquis. Not only those prestigious royal families have received an invitation,

359
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:24,510
but even those powerful people in Tianqi City who run the underworld were also invited.

360
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,370
This is indeed his way of doing things.

361
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,190
Xiao Se.

362
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,910
Looks like he really likes this name.

363
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,920

364
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,030
Your Highness.

365
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,650
Do you think we should attend this banquet or not?

366
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,740
What do you think?

367
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,700
If it was up to me... no.

368
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,090
Why?

369
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,930
We won't go, and we can't let others go.

370
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,450
Sixth Prince has invited many of the royal families, merchants, and rich people.

371
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,910
These people are close to you.

372
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,670
If you don't go, they won't dare to attend it either.

373
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,850
Have you sent them out?

374
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,300
Yes. Soon, those residences will receive the information.

375
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,850
Good. I won't let anyone attend his banquet.

376
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,770
I heard that after Prince Bai's manor received the invitation,

377
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,650
they sent their men to visit those who are close to them.

378
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,410
I think they have the same mindset as ours.

379
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,100
He made his own bed.

380
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,770
You've worked hard, Divine Healer.

381
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,850
The best way for you to thank me is to not disturb my patient.

382
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,970
I can't agree to that.

383
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,590
I have something very important to report today.

384
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,890
I need to tell His Majesty about it.

385
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,540
Fine. I know that this is a state affair.

386
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,970
His Majesty will be awake for a while after an hour.

387
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,230
- You can wait for him to wake up. 
 - All right.

388
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,130
How is he?

389
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,880
His Majesty has a heart disease.

390
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,590
I can treat his disease, but not his heart.

391
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,270
My master told me that the most difficult illness to treat is an illness of the heart.

392
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,460
It's not something that a physician can heal.

393
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,760
But there's something that I can promise you. He's not in fatal danger now.

394
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,900
You are indeed a divine healer.

395
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,620
Stop patting my head or else, I can't grow taller.

396
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,470
"If you are not willing to attend, I won't force you."

397
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,370
Nonsense. Who says that I don't want to attend it?

398
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,280
I haven't attended a banquet of this scale for many years.

399
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,290
He is trying to read my mind with his commoner's mindset.

400
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,220
Go.

401
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,330
Prepare a gift according to the letter

402
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,160
and deliver it to Snowfall Mountain Villa before noon tomorrow.

403
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
Yes, Master.

404
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,050
It'll be lively at Qianjin Gambling House tomorrow.

405
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,200
Unfortunately, His Highness has guessed it right.

406
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,090
I really don't want to attend it.

407
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,010
Master.

408
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,260
Why are you back?

409
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,730
You have guests from Mount Wangcheng.

410
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,840
- Invite them in. 
 - Yes, Master.

411
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,040
We've sent out the invitation letters.

412
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,340
Qianjin Gambling House has replied that we can proceed with the banquet tomorrow.

413
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,200
Xiao Se. Why do you still look so worried?

414
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,060
Xiao Se. Are you worried that someone will not attend the banquet tomorrow?

415
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,540
So what if they don't attend it?

416
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,680
Some will have more important things to do.

417
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,050
What if everyone has more important things to do?

418
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,470
No way? Will there be no one tomorrow?

419
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,480
It's possible.

420
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,470
After all, Tianqi City is different now.

421
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,930
But I'm sure something will remain the same, right?

422
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,690
If no one attends the banquet, it'll be highly awkward.

423
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,360
The thing that remains the same

424
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,570
is that they were no match for me back then.

425
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,840
And they are still not my equal now.

426
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,610
Young Master. This is the last one.

427
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,490
But Jiu Jiudao still can't find anyone who can accept this invitation letter.

428
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,170
He's supposed to have reached Tianqi City a long time ago.

429
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,930
Why can't he be found?

430
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,370
According to Jiu Jiudao, they had looked for him everywhere.

431
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,390
Can it be that he has already left?

432
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,050
Forget it.

433
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,860
It's a pity that he won't get to witness this interesting banquet.

434
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,390
Who are you talking about?

435
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,890
It'll be a surprise for you. You'll find out later.

436
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,020
By the way, where's Miss Ye?

437
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,590
Why isn't she here tonight?

438
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,390
Sister Ye has already returned to the General's Manor.

439
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,950
Father.

440
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,290
What is it?

441
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,640
Are you worried about tomorrow's banquet?

442
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,790
I'm worried that someone will do something

443
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:20,940
to stop at least half of the people on this list from attending the banquet tomorrow.

444
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,410
If only the restraining order was not in effect.

445
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,390
If I could attend it, everyone would attend it as well.

446
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:34,190
If they didn't participate, I would have the Ye Battalion run a few laps around their residences.

447
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,190
Father, you are joking.

448
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,240
Are you the one who made this list?

449
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,250
Not bad.

450
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,030
Everyone on this list holds power over this city.

451
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,490
As expected of my daughter.

452
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,650
I'm not as powerful as Lei Wujie and Qianluo.

453
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,510
They are the best martial artists among the young people of this age.

454
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,170
But even if I'm not good at martial arts,

455
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,000
I can still be Xiao Se's advisor in Tianqi City.

456
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:19,110
But someone is missing on this list.

457
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,400
Are you referring to...

458
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,640
Yes. That's him.

459
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,890
But I'm not confident that he will accept my invitation.

460
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,770
Yes.

461
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,060
No one is able to make him attend anything.

462
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,370
Even if it were me, I wouldn't be able to make much difference.

463
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,300
What if I ask Marquis Lanyue to help me with it?

464
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,790
Him?

465
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,650
Although he's the Director of Nation now,

466
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,090
he's not that influential yet.

467
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,870
I've been looking for this sword.

468
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,700
I never thought that you had it all along.

469
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,090
Prince Langya gave this sword to me

470
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,480
because he wanted me to travel the world with it.

471
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,950
Not bad.

472
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,370
Are you willing to part with it?

473
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,420
After all, this is from your uncle.

474
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,500
He's not here anymore.

475
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,760
If you keep this sword, you'll have a memento.

476
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,820
Why will I be unwilling to part with it?

477
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm not the kind of person who can't let go of something.

478
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,950
You are the kind of person who can't let go of anything.

479
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,150
Or else, you would've come back a long time ago.

480
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,460
Anyway, I'll have to trouble you to deliver this sword to that person.

481
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,780
Are you sure?

482
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,900
This sword represents an important friendship.

483
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,190
You want to exchange it for a banquet.

484
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,870
Is it worth it?

485
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,880
This sword is not just a symbol of friendship.

486
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,520
It also represents my purpose for coming back.

487
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,760
Even though I'm back now, I have not forgotten about what happened four years ago.

488
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,200
Hopefully, that person will appreciate your painstaking effort.

489
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,000

490
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,530
This...

491
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,000
According to the banquet rules of the prestigious and royal families,

492
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,670
the guests have to be there four hours before the official start of the banquet.

493
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,270
There are only two hours left before the start.

494
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,470
But no one is here yet.

495
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,500
Calm down.

496
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,740
I've just checked the time,

497
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,760
they have only two hours left before the start of the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House.

498
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,890
I've just received a piece of news that there's no one there yet.

499
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,770
Is it true that no one will come?

500
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,950
Maybe they are thinking about what to wear.

501
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,300
Miss Ruoyi. How about you go in and take a rest?

502
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,730
I'll stay here.

503
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,020
Your guests are here.

504
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,270
How can you leave before you welcome your guests?

505
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,880
You are that man with a very special name.

506
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,120
Jiu Jiudao.

507
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Yes. Jiu Jiudao.

508
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,020
Welcome, Master Jiu.

509
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,440
I knew that he would be the first to arrive.

510
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,840
The first to arrive will be remembered by the whole city of Tianqi.

511
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,970
It means that he's my closest friend.

512
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,100
Do you know what they call him now in Tianqi City?

513
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,600
Shopkeeper Jiu.

514
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,510
But when he was still known as the Lowly Jiu, it was you who saved him.

515
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,040
Even if he'll attract everyone's attention, he'll still want to be the first to arrive.

516
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,170
Miss Ruoyi, we meet again.

517
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,220
Shopkeeper Jiu. You are the first to arrive today.

518
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,300
It's because you are the one welcoming the guests today.

519
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,980
I can't bear to make you wait.

520
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,230
- Thank you. 
 - Uncle Jiu!

521
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,580
This way, please.

522
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,120
After you.

523
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,160
The head of Tianming Abode, Jiu Jiudao,

524
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,200
has arrived with his disciples from the three clans and nineteen residences.

525
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
Three clans and nineteen residences.

526
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,410
You addressed him as shopkeeper.

527
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,860
Is he a powerful person?

528
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,050
The three clans and nineteen residences are an underworld alliance in Tianqi City led by Tianming Abode.

529
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,530
They can handle things that the government of Tianqi City can't handle.

530
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,300
They can take part in the underworld industry that the major merchants can't.

531
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,560
They can find information that escapes even the Court of Judical Review.

532
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,250
In short, even the dragon in the sky can't kill them.

533
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,640
The three clans and nineteen residences?

534
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,260
Before this, I suspected that they were working for Prince Bai.

535
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,280
Now, it seems like they've been working for Xiao Chuhe all along.

536
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,460
These three clans don't look like much,

537
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,100
but we still have to be on our guard against them.

538
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,040
However, it's better for them to attend it rather than not.

539
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,010
Why is it better for them to attend it?

540
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,230
Chuhe will be considered capable to have connections with them.

541
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,830
But if these people are his only connections,

542
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:37,470
it means that this prince only has power over these lowly merchants.

543
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,360
And these people will only prove how powerless he is now.

544
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,700
It won't do good for his reputation.

545
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,370
Young Master. We've entered the city.

546
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,170
What should we do next?

547
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,360
Of course, we need to let the entire Tianqi know that we are here.

548
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,250
Look at his outfit. I can tell that he's royalty.

549
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,660
Yes. He has a commanding presence.

550
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,200
- Look at this nobleman. 
 - Which family is he from?

551
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,570
- He looks dashing. 
 - Yes.

552
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,160
He looks extraordinary.

553
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,420
- He's not a commoner. 
 - Yes.

554
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,720
He looks outstanding.

555
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,470
I heard that due to the heavy snow not long ago,

556
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,640
many of the farmers in the suburbs were affected by it.

557
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,040
So there are some refugees in the south of the city.

558
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,160
Donate a box of silver ingots to them to help them out.

559
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,650
Understood.

560
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:22,230
In the north of the city, a gambling house tricked its customers and caused them to go bankrupt.

561
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,860
They are even colluding with the officials.

562
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,580
And they have not received the punishment they deserve.

563
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,140
Steward Liang.

564
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,650
That gambling house is owned by the Li family, right?

565
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,350
Yes.

566
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,660
Since the Li family owes the Mu family 5,000 taels of silver,

567
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,460
they can pay off their debt with that gambling house.

568
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,520
Close it down.

569
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,150
All right.

570
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,380
 Just like that?

571
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,430
Next, my own Chunfeng Parlor in the west of the city is going to give out free food

572
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,970
to everyone in the city on behalf of Prince Yong'an.

573
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,420
Yes, sir.

574
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,380
 This is great!

575
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,450
 Yes.

576
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,450
As for the rest of you, go to the salt merchant Li's Residence,

577
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,180
the Grand Entertainment House, Gongsun Pawn Shop,

578
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,340
and the Technicolor Clothing Parlor

579
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,590
to tell them that the Mu family from Qingzhou is here.

580
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,860
I'm here to collect my rent.

581
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,140
Yes.

582
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,560
The Mu family from Yunjian City, Qingzhou?

583
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,270
What kind of person is he?

584
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,020
He is a young man in his twenties.

585
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,360
His outfit looks expensive and he's handsome.

586
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,110
The eldest son of the Mu family hasn't been feeling well in the past few years.

587
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,130
He won't be healthy enough to travel.

588
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,490
And their second son is born with a disability.

589
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,370
He won't leave the Mu's Residence.

590
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,610
Only the third son is around the same age.

591
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,110
Looks like he's the future master of the Mu family.

592
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,400
The richest man of Beili in the future.

593
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,540
This...

594
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,010
Your Highness.

595
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,570
He'll be here soon.

596
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:15,010

597
