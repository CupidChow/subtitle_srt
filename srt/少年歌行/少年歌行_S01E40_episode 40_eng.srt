00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,020
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,880
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,440
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,400
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,560
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,660
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,440
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,700

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,800
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,040

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,980

24
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,625

25
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,170
This time, I'm really leaving.

26
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,430
What's the hurry?

27
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,420
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,270
Everything is set in Tianqi City.

29
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,140
Prince Chi's Residence has been seized.

30
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,710
The Ghost Physician Night Crow has been executed as well.

31
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,500
I've healed Yueji too.

32
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,560
Later, send her to Hanshui Temple to unite with Minghou.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,260
I have nothing else to do here, so, I can go ahead and leave.

34
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,970
Are you returning to Tian Wai Tian immediately?

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,400
I will first send mother to Muliang City.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,840
After she calms down, I will return to Tian Wai Tian to handle some matters.

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,820
When everything is settled, I will come to you again.

38
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,620
Xiao Se. We'll wait for you over there.

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,790
Why don't you say anything?

40
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,970
I was thinking.

41
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,620
How can you manage to become the head of the extraterritorial clan?

42
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,550
Is this how you behave in front of them?

43
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,080
You can't imagine how I act as the head of the clan.

44
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,760
I, too, cannot imagine how you'd look as the Emperor.

45
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,320
But to be honest, you are only one step away from the throne.

46
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,200
I'd like to ask you.

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,390
Did you really think it through?

48
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,890
Honestly, I've thought about it a lot.

49
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,540
I don't have an answer.

50
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,450
Here's what you can do.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,830
What?

52
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,890
When that day finally comes, close the door and sit on that seat.

53
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,860
The thought that comes to you then will be your true thought.

54
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,230
Sounds logical. I'll try that.

55
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,210
Farewell.

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,380
Looking forward to meeting you all again!

57
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,430
Xiao Se. Will we ever see Wu Xin again?

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,380
Yes.

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,950

60
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,740
Greetings, Imperial Father.

61
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,590
You're here.

62
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,880
Imperial Father. Why did you release him?

63
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,240
Seventh Prince is dead.

64
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,510
As for Jin Xuan, soon, he will be sent to guard the mausoleum.

65
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,470
He watched me grow up.

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Consider it my request to spare him.

67
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,780
Who am I to be begged, Imperial Father?

68
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,540
The Divine Healer told me that I have two choices.

69
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,360
One is to live

70
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,020
for at least another year.

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,270
However, I will never leave my bed

72
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,800
and may never be fully awake, ever again.

73
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,590
The other would be that I can once again,

74
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,580
live a normal life,

75
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,890
but maybe for only six hours.

76
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,070
Guess. What did I choose?

77
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,600
How dare you, Hua Jin! How can you ask His Majesty to make choices like this?

78
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,790
Don't blame her.

79
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,780
This is the choice that I made.

80
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,900
I forced Hua Jin into it.

81
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,780
Hua Jin saved me in times of danger.

82
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,100
She is to be granted ten thousand taels of gold and two apothecaries in Tianqi,

83
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,540
and appointed as Vice Director of the Imperial Medical Academy.

84
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,890
If not summoned, she doesn't have to come to Tianqi City.

85
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

86
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,610
By the way.

87
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,400
The third son of the Mu family in Qingzhou, Mu Chunfeng, rescued my life.

88
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,670
He is to be granted a cedar ship,

89
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,590
named Chunfeng Cruise.

90
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,670
When I was younger,

92
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,890
I used to drink with your father.

93
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,000
Your father is very ambitious.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,530
He allowed you to come to Tianqi,

95
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,990
it definitely isn't only for the sake of studying medicine.

96
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,030
What does he want?

97
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm afraid one ship wouldn't be enough.

98
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,380
Would it be enough to let your friend become the Emperor?

99
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,810
Imperial Father.

100
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,310
Are you willing to be the Emperor?

101
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,740
Back then, my father asked me the same thing.

102
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,410
I told him this.

103
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,270
The Emperor is chosen by God, not by men.

104
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,320
There is no meaning to your will.

105
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,300
It only depends on whether you are ready to be responsible for the world.

106
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,840
I didn't become the Emperor

107
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,090
as I was chosen by God.

108
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,120
I came with a blade and snatched it over.

109
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,250
But you.

110
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,930
You are truly the chosen one.

111
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,760
I heard that even the Tianzhan Sword has appeared.

112
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,510
Don't you want to show it to everyone?

113
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,030
Imperial Father. I have not answered your question yet.

114
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,130
I'm not dead yet.

115
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,290
I... am still the Emperor.

116
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,570
My decisions require no answers.

117
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,860
But if I'm not satisfied with the name written on it, I will tear it up.

118
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,230
Then, the world will fall into chaos.

119
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,290
You don't want chaos,

120
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,680
and neither do I.

121
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,130
Are you satisfied with this name?

122
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,530
Jin Xuan, you keep this copy.

123
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,030
Do not open it.

124
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,330
After this, give it to the Directorate of Astronomy.

125
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,410
You may all leave.

127
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,740
Chuhe. Stay for a while.

128
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,060
When you were little, you were never afraid of the cold.

129
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Do you remember?

130
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,260
Once, there was heavy snow in Tianqi City.

131
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,710
It was hard to even walk.

132
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,510
But you wanted to ride in the snow.

133
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,540
So you went out with your horse and went around Tianqi City.

134
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,430
In the end,

135
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,860
you got lost.

136
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,420
You were only brought back by Marquis Lanyue when it turned dark.

137
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,300
When I went to see you,

138
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,570
your hands and ears were frostbitten.

139
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:47,950
But you continued to talk excitedly about how you'd repeat it the next day.

140
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,170
I remember.

141
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,340
In the end, I fell sick the next day.

142
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,860
I almost died from that too.

143
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,130
I also remember that you were by my side the whole time.

144
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,600
I was afraid.

145
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,550
Because of that, I blamed myself.

146
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,890
Why did I choose to read memorials instead of going with you?

147
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:27,610
Otherwise, you wouldn't have got lost or got frostbitten.

148
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,930
At that time, in between moments of consciousness,

149
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,660
I saw you with me and I felt very safe.

150
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,910
Really?

151
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,650
Yes.

152
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,030
Because to me, you are the only wise man.

153
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,910
All these years, I learned the art of war and practiced martial arts,

154
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,500
all in the hope that one day, I can protect you with the weapon I hold.

155
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,720
Chuhe.

156
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,190
Now, you are in your twenties.

157
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,550
Your brothers are all married.

158
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,660
What about you?

159
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,050
How is it going with Ye Ruoyi, the daughter of General Ye?

160
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,770
She's always been close to you since she was little.

161
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,560
As for Ye Xiaoying, he has retired,

162
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,040
but he still holds a military title.

163
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,910
I...

164
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,040
I have someone I like.

165
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,160
Whose daughter is she?

166
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,610
Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng's daughter, Sikong Qianluo.

167
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,910
The Vermilion Bird?

168
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,610
The Vermilion Bird is an interesting man.

169
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,240
His wife is beautiful.

170
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,660
I'm sure his daughter is beautiful too.

171
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,130
That's nice.

172
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,630
But people from the world of martial arts long for freedom.

173
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,640
They can't stay in one place for long.

174
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,990
Just like Consort Xuan.

175
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,400
Has Consort Xuan left?

176
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,080
She has.

177
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,600
Let her leave then.

178
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,120
And that friend of yours, Lei. How is he?

179
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,630
He's fine. He sustained some minor injuries.

180
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,710
Does he not want to work for the government?

181
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,910
No. He just wants to be a hero and be invincible.

182
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,430
He's smarter than his father.

183
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,370
Imperial Father, you seem to be in good mood.

184
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,840
Chuhe... Say...

185
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,600
If I had done everything I could

186
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,700
to let Ruofeng live,

187
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,680
how would things have turned out now?

188
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,840
Imperial Father.

189
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,380
There are crossroads in life.

190
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,800
Once we've decided to go down one path,

191
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,080
we'll be doomed to not see the scenery of the other.

192
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,370
Whether it's heaven or hell,

193
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,320
we will never know.

194
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,970
I'm tired.

195
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,870
It's time for me to rest.

196
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,730
Leave.

197
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,050
- Yes, Imperial Father. 
 - Go.

198
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,110
 Brother.

199
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,380
Ruofeng.

200
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,150
Imperial Father?

201
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,520
Imperial Father!

202
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,410
 In the winter of the 23rd year of Emperor Mingde's reign,

203
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:09,430
 Emperor Mingde passed away in his sleep at 57 years old.

204
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,580
 The same day, the Langya Army on the border has been defeated.

205
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,900
 Retreating past 19 cities.

206
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,110
Xiao Se. A large group of upper and lower armies has arrived just outside Tianqi City.

207
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,320
Miss Ye has left to welcome them.

208
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,730
You hold the power as the Director of the Nation and are reinforcing the borders.

209
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,710
They wouldn't dare disobey you.

210
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
So what if they defy me?

211
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,840
They can't watch Beili become subjugated.

212
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,800
They are ambitious, but they're not dumb.

213
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,510
You shouldn't leave.

214
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,210
A kingdom cannot be without its Emperor.

215
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,920
You should be enthroned immediately.

216
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,040
As for the battlefield, Imperial Uncle and I can go.

217
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,780
I should be enthroned?

218
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,710
You are the chosen one.

219
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,610
That sword can only be used by the founding Emperor.

220
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,570
It chose you.

221
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,460
Since you're saying that I'm the chosen one,

222
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,340
then I should be the one to guard Beili as well.

223
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,390
Well said, Brother Xiao. That should be the way.

224
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,100
Brother Mu and Divine Healer, you should be leaving Tianqi soon, right?

225
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,600
We will depart tomorrow.

226
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,600
Thank you for all this time.

227
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,020
Xiao Se. Are you really not bringing us along?

228
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,160
Killing enemies on the battlefield and roaming the Martial Arts World are very different.

229
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Wait here for me. I will definitely return in triumph.

230
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,430
Senior Sister, Xiao Se has been nagging us all night long.

231
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,370
Just do as he says this time.

232
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,730
Lei Wujie.

233
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,460
You once asked me if our encounter at Snowfall Mountain Villa

234
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,520
was a coincidence.

235
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,800
I can answer you now.

236
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,780
Our encounter was a coincidence.

237
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,180
But meeting each other is inevitable.

238
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,725

239
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:07,575

240
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:12,320
How come you have the time to visit me today, Director?

241
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,260
For the past few days, have you been waiting for me, Your Highness?

242
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,370
That's right. I have been waiting for you.

243
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,520
Right now, Xiao Se is gone

244
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,530
and the other Dragon Seal Scroll is in my possession.

245
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,020
Director, you haven't looked into the Dragon Seal Scroll?

246
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,000
The late Emperor Mingde said that this is just an extra copy.

247
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,310
It should not be opened.

248
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,020
However, I've seen the one that Xiao Se possesses.

249
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,300
I already know who will be ascending the throne.

250
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,480
Who is it?

251
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,070
Of course, it's you, Your Highness.

252
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,580
You aren't lying to me, right?

253
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Everyone is confident that my imperial father would have written down Chuhe's name.

254
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,700
Yet, I saw it with my own eyes.

255
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,060
Your name is written on the scroll.

256
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,540
Now, I possess the scroll, and you are the only prince within Tianqi City now.

257
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,570
If you are enthroned now, it's justifiable.

258
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,740
Even if Xiao Se returns after winning the battle, he has to acknowledge that everything is justifiable.

259
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,920
Otherwise, it would be treason.

260
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,360
However... If you wait for Xiao Se's return,

261
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,620
when he holds military power and military exploits,

262
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,160
he can totally destroy the two scrolls and be the Emperor himself.

263
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,430
You should understand what I mean by all of that.

264
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,860
Director Jin Xuan. Are you trying to form an alliance with me?

265
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,330
But I remember that you worked for Prince Chi.

266
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,220
I worked for His Majesty.

267
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,030
I was assigned to assist Prince Chi

268
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,270
just so I could find out who his partisans are

269
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,800
and have them removed for His Majesty's sake.

270
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,340
But why does it seem that ever since imperial father had been seriously ill,

271
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,460
you had been helping Prince Chi in becoming the Emperor?

272
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,300
You have the death-exemption plate and worked for my imperial father,

273
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,780
yet you were part of a faction fighting for power.

274
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,000
If that isn't the case, then you're doing way too much as someone who is just monitoring.

275
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,770
Your Highness. We are both at a dead end.

276
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,650
If Xiao Se returns after winning the battle, we will have no other way out.

277
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,320
With his prestige, he can ascend the throne of his own will,

278
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,200
disregarding this Dragon Seal Scroll.

279
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,440
By then, you would have no chance, Your Highness.

280
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,380
You're wrong.

281
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,040
If Xiao Se fails, only then will we have no way out.

282
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,050
Our nation will be doomed.

283
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,670
If we die, what other way out is there?

284
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,490
Director.

285
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,830
Seems like you do not intend to work with me, Your Highness.

286
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,430
But what I said was true.

287
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,970
I've been waiting for you.

288
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,160
What do you mean?

289
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,870
Before my imperial father passed, he summoned me

290
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,640
and told me that if Jin Xuan sought me, I should kill him.

291
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,510
Jin Xuan. It's time for everything to end.

292
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,850

293
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,020
Xiao Se! Xiao Se is back.

294
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,470
So majestic.

295
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,680
Why didn't he put on his armor even when at war?

296
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,110
Senior Sister, you have no idea.

297
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,260
It's cooler to conquer the battlefield in a suit gown.

298
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,300

299
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,750
Let's hurry to the Snowfall Mountain Villa to wait for him.

300
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,330
No rush.

301
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,310
Xiao Se returned in triumph. He must first go to the palace.

302
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,910
All the officials are waiting for him.

303
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,650
Imperial Uncle.

304
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,360
Back when Prince Langya returned, was it as grand as this?

305
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,560
More or less.

306
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,800
Today is the day he returns.

307
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,730
It should also be the day the new Emperor ascends the throne.

308
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,160
 - Welcome back, Prince Yong'an.
 - Welcome back, Prince Yong'an.

309
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,540
Keep kneeling for now.

310
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,030
There are more important things to be announced later anyway.

311
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,550
If you get up now, you have to kneel again.

312
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,760
Imperial Uncle.

313
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,140
Why do so many people yearn for this seat?

314
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,930
I've not sat on it before, so I don't know.

315
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,870
Let me try it.

316
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,290
 When that day finally comes, sit on that seat.

317
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:54,570
 The thought that comes to you then will be your true thoughts.

318
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,300
Boring.

319
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,420
Imperial Uncle.

320
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,390
I know the officials are all waiting for this.

321
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,560
It's best if you read it out.

322
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,250
Read it.

323
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,500
"I have been suffering from illness"

324
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,610
"and may pass on in a short time."

325
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:52,610
"My second son, Xiao Chong, is of good character, competence, and virtue,"

326
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:57,420
"hence able to inherit my will to build up Beili"

327
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,620
"and ascend the throne."

328
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,130
"I pass the throne to the Second Prince, Xiao Chong."

329
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,810
This...

330
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,850
Why is it not Prince Yong'an?

331
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,170
He wouldn't start a mutiny, would he?

332
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,910
How dare you!

333
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:23,105
Marquis Lanyue has read the decree.

334
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:31,335
Why are you officials not kowtowing to the new Emperor?

335
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:44,815
All hail the new Emperor!

336
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:55,645
 - All hail the new Emperor!
 - All hail the new Emperor!

337
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:07,165
All hail the new Emperor.

You may all rise.

343
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:31,595
- Thank you, Your Majesty. 
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

344
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,345
Second Brother.

345
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:47,555
I will leave the nation to you.

346
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:54,605
Take care.

347
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:59,225
I'm leaving, Imperial Uncle.

348

 Thank you to our Other Language Moderators

352
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:22,235
Is there really such an inimitable man in this world?

353
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:26,445
There are plenty of them in the Martial Arts World.

354
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:30,975
You government servants haven't seen much of the world.

355
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,860

356
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,145
Xiao Se. You're finally back.

357
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,205
Let's pack up and leave.

358
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:47,645
You're all so quick.

359
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,655
Can't I even get a cup of tea?

360
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:52,975
Senior Sister was even ready to wait for you outside the palace.

361
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,355
Young Master.

362
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,115
Young Master. This...

363
00:33:58,115 --> 00:33:59,975
Are you really leaving?

364
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:03,515
Don't worry, Uncle Xu. I won't be gone for that long.

365
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:07,585
Don't live at Snowfall Mountain Villa anymore. Stay at my residence.

366
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:10,825
I will come back from time to time. Take good care of it.

367
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:12,965
Yes, Young Master.

368
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:17,095
Your Highness, you actually remembered the promise.

369
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:23,075
I still don't like it when people call me Your Highness.

370
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:24,885
Just call me Young Master.

371
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:28,455
Then, I shall gladly accept the Snowfall Mountain Villa then.

372
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:30,325
Just take it.

373
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:35,265
Xiao Se. Are you really gifting Snowfall Mountain Villa to Second Master Tu?

374
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:37,875
I thought it was the one in the mountains.

375
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,245
You have another Snowfall Mountain Villa?

376
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,965
Yes.

377
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:45,595
I initially planned to give that one to you.

378
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:47,945
But now, I suddenly can't bear to.

379
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:51,180
I feel that the other one is better than this.

380
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,520
If so, I should continue to do business with you, Young Master.

381
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,360
That way, I can take over that Snowfall Mountain Villa as well.

382
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,560
You will have to give us a good offer.

383
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,300
Of course.

384
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,000
Mr. Xie Xuan, you helped us multiple times.

385
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,425
We haven't been able to thank you yet.

386
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:09,965
You're welcome.

387
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:13,935
We scholars are always talking about justice.

388
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:17,735
How can we be bystanders in times of trouble?

389
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:22,115
Xiao Se. I expected you to return and be the Emperor.

390
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:24,680
Fansong, you want me to be the Emperor?

391
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,220
Regardless, Feixuan is the future State Preceptor.

392
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,200
Since you're not the Emperor, he may feel a little lonely.

393
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,020
- Isn't that so, Feixuan? 
 - I wish to return to Mount Wangcheng too.

394
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,305
I don't want to stay here.

395
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:39,140
In the end, you made the same decision as Prince Langya.

396
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,820
The same?

397
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,740
I don't think so.

398
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,340
I'm not as strong-willed as Prince Langya.

399
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,175
But I am also more carefree than he was.

400
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:54,215
I am clear that I do not belong to the Imperial Court.

401
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,700
Why?

402
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,320
It's too small.

403
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,670
Everyone.

404
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,690
Rage Sword Deity?

405
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:13,385
Don't worry. I'm not here to stop you.

406
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:18,445
Chong'er asked me to pass this to you.

407
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,750

408
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,200
Father is so sly.

409
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,560
Everyone.

410
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,090
Farewell.

411
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,610
- Farewell. 
 - Farewell.

412
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,140
Let's go.

413

 In the 23rd year of Emperor Mingde's reign,

416
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,480
 the three-month period when the country was without an emperor has finally ended,

417
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,790
 the Second Prince, Xiao Chong, ascended the throne with the reign name, Chonghe.

418
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,660
 In the first year of Emperor Chonghe's reign, flowers bloomed in the warm spring.

419
