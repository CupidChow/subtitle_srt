2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,060
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,760
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,300
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,220
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,400
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,740
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,380
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,320
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,540
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,620
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,504
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,150

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,114

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Father, I remember a master once said to me.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,656
"Youths must have their own martial arts world."

26
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,500
Therefore,

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,288
I cannot accept this token.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
Father, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,320
So, you don't like it?

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,900
You think I want to give it to you?

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Goodness. Come on. Let's not talk about the token.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,740
Let's talk about Xiao Chuhe.

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,080
Where were we just now?

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,120
- That Xiao Chuhe... 
 - Father!

35
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,892
Didn't you just say that you are going to find someone

36
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,040
you acknowledge and protect him?

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,028
What do you think about Xiao Se?

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,492
Acknowledgment and protection?

39
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:54,184
I don't think such terms are meant for us.

40
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,192
You just don't want to admit it.

41
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:02,080
All right now. Go to Xiao Se and return the favor to him.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,188
Father!

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,520
I've known Miss Ruoyi for a long time.

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
But it was my first time chatting with her this long.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,780
Have you finished reading "Late Snow" given to you by Scholar Sword Deity?

46
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,396
That book is boring.

47
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,180
I was sleepy just after reading a few lines.

48
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,861
It's no fun. I don't like that book.

49
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:21,008
If so, what kind of book do you like?

50
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:25,560
Naturally, I like books about wanderers in the martial arts world and heroes on the battlefield.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,580
For example, the story of White Feather Sword Deity conquering Tianqi by himself.

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,540
I will never get tired of it.

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,124
The story of White Feather Sword Deity conquering Tianqi City?

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,020
Xiao Se, why do you have a weird expression whenever I mention Tianqi City?

55
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,876
If I'm not mistaken, your hometown should be Tianqi.

56
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,260
I don't have a hometown. You're mistaken.

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,368
Everyone has a hometown.

58
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:56,120
Don't tell me you were born from a rock?

59
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,324
So, what's hometown to you?

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,748
Isn't it obvious?

61
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:04,300
Hometown?

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,580
It's a place that you're destined to return to no matter

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,096
how far you go or how long you are away.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,940
A place that we're destined to return to?

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
You're right.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,920
My hometown is Tianqi City.

67
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,020
It's a place that I'm destined to return to.

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,144
Prince Bai said he is taking you with him under an imperial order.

69
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,524
However, judging from him still being here,

70
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,840
I think you've rejected him.

71
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,240
If so, Third City Lord, do you think I should reject him?

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,836
I don't know what he offered,

73
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,924
but judging from the way he looked,

74
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:12,340
there should be a condition that would leave many people in awe.

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,840
That's right.

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,476
However, there's also a reason that I must reject him.

77
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,300
Third City Lord, do you think I should return with him?

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,212
I understand your persistence.

79
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:29,880
However, in my opinion, if you return to Tianqi right now,

80
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,616
many issues will be simplified.

81
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:39,160
It's beneficial to you, to your imperial father, and to that incident in the past.

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,720
That's right.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,321
Imperial Father has already made a huge compromise.

84
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:48,020
With his personality, this is already the extent of his leniency.

85
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,748
I heard that Prince Bai gave you three days.

86
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,560
What's wrong?

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,924
Third City Lord, are you also going to persuade me on his behalf?

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,940
I, Sikong Changfeng, never persuade anyone on anyone's behalf.

89
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,704
I just think that this is a great time

90
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:09,048
for you to return to Tianqi.

91
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,740
Of course, I know that.

92
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,520
All right then.

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,668
I'll stop bothering you.

94
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,136
By the way, what do you think about my daughter?

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
She's proficient with a spear.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,980
She's inherited your skills.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,540
Who asked you about her spear skills?

98
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm talking about her looks.

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,500
Her looks?

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,540
She inherited her mother's looks.

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,280
What about her personality?

102
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,060
As for her personality, it makes her unique.

103
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,360
However, she's pretty special.

104
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,621
 If you return to Tianqi right now,

105
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:08,500
 many issues will be simplified.

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,060
 It's beneficial to you, to your imperial father,

107
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,392
 and to that incident in the past.

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,132
Three days?

109
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,380

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,800
Wu Xin, why are you always here whenever I feel troubled?

111
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,544
Boss Xiao, that means you still trust me.

112
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,856
When you're troubled, you will only feel at ease when you see your bosom friend.

113
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,920
You're still as narcissistic as always, even in my dreams.

114
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,280
Boss Xiao, may I know what is troubling you?

115
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,140
It's something I've pondered over and persevered for a long time.

116
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,760
Sometimes, it's unnecessary to persevere.

117
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,080
Maybe you'll go farther if you take another path.

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,020
That's what you think too?

119
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,240
But sometimes, it's different.

120
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,380
People in the world think that they must persevere even if it isn't worth it.

121
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,700
They think that they should persevere even if there's no hope

122
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,592
and that they should persevere until death.

123
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,352
This is quite rare,

124
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:58,132
but judging from your character, I'm sure you'll encounter things like these.

125
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,220
Wu Xin.

126
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,448
Have I resolved your doubts?

127
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,240
What a joke.

128
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,764
I said I was troubled.

129
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,140
I didn't say that I had any doubts.

130
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,860
Prince Bai, how long have you been staying in Xueyue City?

131
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,896
Counting the day I came, today's already the fourth day.

132
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,880
Prince Bai, is Xueyue City as interesting as what you've heard?

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,020
It's plainer than what I'd imagined.

134
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,880
Xueyue City is actually an ordinary city.

135
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,580
It's just that martial artists love to adorn it with their own special meanings.

136
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,292
However, it's also special due to how ordinary it is.

137
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:50,700
Xueyue City was built by several martial arts masters as a shelter from the world a century ago.

138
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,580
However, too many people are paying attention to it now.

139
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,016
It has gone against the initial goals of our predecessors.

140
00:09:57,016 --> 00:10:01,520
No one can avoid the world entirely if you live in the world.

141
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,760
Back then, when you were still the Vermilion Bird,

142
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,668
you razed half of Tianqi to the ground with your spear.

143
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,840
That was all in the past.

144
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,740
Since then, I think it's been around two decades since you returned to Tianqi.

145
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,644
Prince Bai, are you asking me

146
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:24,488
if I will support Xiao Se just like how I supported your imperial father back then.

147
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:26,100
I dare not say so.

148
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,752
Actually, I've never supported your imperial father before.

149
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,160
Prince Langya was the only person I supported.

150
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,220
What's wrong?

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,068
- Do I sound like a rebel to you? 
 - That's right.

152
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,720
But I've said it already.

153
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,480
You can complain to your imperial father.

154
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,460
He's not daring enough to make comments because that's the truth.

155
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,568
It's just like I have an answer to your previous question.

156
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,060
Yes.

157
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,844
I just didn't expect you to have such a resolute answer.

158
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:02,492
I've always been a decisive man.

159
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:06,341
Although I said I supported him, I wasn't saying that I would support him in robbing things of others.

160
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:09,200
I was saying that I would support every decision he made.

161
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
Just like how he's working as an accountant in Xueyue City right now.

162
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Even if he's going to do that for the rest of his life, I will support him.

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,660
After all, Xiao Se is unparalleled when it comes to accounting.

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,360
I understand now.

165
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,080

166
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,060
Chuhe, time's up.

167
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,105
Doesn't that mean you're returning tomorrow?

168
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:51,028
I will leave after getting your answer.

169
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,760
Restoring my status as a prince,

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,740
and I'll be given the title of Prince Yong'an?

171
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,496
Those conditions are tempting indeed.

172
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,060
You and I understand our imperial father's temper well.

173
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,680
He has already made a huge compromise by issuing such a decree.

174
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,252
As long as I return with you, I won't need to wander in the martial arts world again.

175
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:23,056
I can return to Tianqi City and the real Snowfall Mountain Villa.

176
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,920
I can drink at Diaolou Parlor every day,

177
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
gamble at Qianjin Gambling House,

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,580
admire the scenery at Bibo Lake,

179
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,140
and even have the best physician tend to my internal injuries

180
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,108
and provide me with the best herbs.

181
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,000
Certainly.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,108
I even have more chances to find out the truth behind the incident I've always wanted to know.

183
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,510
As long as you give me your answer,

184
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,360
you can decide what to do in Tianqi City after you head back.

185
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,020
Okay.

186
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,464
I'll give you my answer then.

187
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,460
I, Xiao Se, reject the decree.

188
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,940
Why?

189
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,408
You've already given many reasons to head back yourself.

190
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:21,680
But you still rejected me in the end.

191
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,020
Because if I return with you right now,

192
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,900
that means I'll be acknowledging that everything I did in the past was wrong.

193
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,664
Since I was wrong in everything I did,

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,040
that means the only person who could redress Uncle Langya's grievances has admitted defeat.

195
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,776
Do you know what that means?

196
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,720
Regarding Prince Langya's rebellion, the Imperial Censorate closed the case long ago.

197
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Prince Langya was executed as well.

198
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,128
That means Imperial Uncle Langya's innocence

199
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,928
and his last sliver of hope will vanish.

200
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,761
He will bear the heinous crime of plotting against the state,

201
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:14,064
be humiliated for the rest of his life in Beili Kingdom,

202
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:17,760
and be frowned upon forever by future generations.

203
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,840
What's the point of you persevering alone?

204
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:37,360
With my perseverance, at least there's someone in this world who dares to fight for him.

205
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,484
This way, Imperial Uncle Langya's courage and bravery on the battlefield will be known.

206
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:50,664
And his acts of saving the people will be meaningful.

207
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,480
That's right.

208
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,652
So what if I'm persevering alone?

209
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,520
Unless I am dead, I will never admit defeat.

210
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,460
You'll be executed for going against the imperial decree!

211
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,820
Do you dare to execute me then?

212
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,252
Do it now if you dare.

213
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,720
If you don't dare to do it, return to your father

214
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,916
and get a decree to execute me.

215
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
Your Highness.

216
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,280
- Take him away! 
 - Yes, Your Highness!

217
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,096
You didn't have to put on an act.

218
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,080
Again!

219
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,140
Xiao Se!

220
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,880
Let's go.

221
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,300

222
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,600
Your Highness, what did Xiao Chuhe mean by that?

223
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,124
I promised Imperial Father that I would surely accomplish this task before I departed.

224
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,432
But when I saw him,

225
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:24,628
I already knew that he would never leave.

226
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,340
Why is that the case?

227
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,184
Because his keenness is still there.

228
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,868
That's why I put on an act.

229
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,640
I waited for three days.

230
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,848
And just now, Chuhe cooperated with me to finish the act.

231
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:44,580
So, are you saying that he took the blow on purpose?

232
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,280
That's right.

233
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,320
If he resists with his life, I will have no reason to keep forcing him.

234
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,004
And I can also explain myself to Father.

235
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,600
Your Highness, you planned for that long ago?

236
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,356
No one truly wants Xiao Chuhe to return to Tianqi City.

237
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:06,360
In the past, all other princes served as his foil.

238
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,516
And now, I've finally acquired a chance.

239
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,780
I cannot miss out on it again.

240
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,812
I was reckless.

241
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,340
I don't know when it started,

242
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,180
but I started thinking about my personal gains.

243
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,736
Although Chuhe knew this before me,

244
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,136
he has never changed.

245
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,600
Prince Bai, you came in a hurry, and now, you're leaving in a hurry.

246
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Since I've accomplished my task, I shouldn't interrupt you.

247
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,892
Prince Bai, you're just like Prince Jingyu.

248
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:44,732
I dare not mention the title my imperial father used to have.

249
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:49,060
It's a shame that Xiao Se is nothing like Prince Langya.

250
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,660
Is that so?

251
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,180
I heard from many people that Chuhe was just like Prince Langya.

252
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,320
They're totally different.

253
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,120
Prince Langya was a gentleman.

254
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,760
He loved to reason things out.

255
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,260
And he always looked at the bigger picture.

256
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,980
What about Chuhe?

257
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,720
He never looks at the bigger picture!

258
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,380
Everything is fine as long as he's happy.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,020
I understand now.

260
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
- Farewell. 
 - Farewell.

261
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,748

262
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,680
Your Highness, I just received news from Shao Han.

263
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,240
Did everything go smoothly?

264
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,680
Shao Han told us to proceed with the plan.

265
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,280
Okay.

266
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,620
If so, we shall head to Wushuang City.

267
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,080
Head of Tian Wai Tian ,a rare guest from a distant place is paying you a visit.

268
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,860
How far did he come from?

269
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,940
Why is he here?

270
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,564
We came from 1,000 li away, the imperial city Tianqi.

271
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,832
We're here to see you, Sect Master.

272
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,380
You're here to see me?

273
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,076
You've seen me. You can leave now.

274
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,240
No. I haven't seen you.

275
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,920
As Buddha said, if the heart is born without a figure, the figure is born of the heart.

276
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,960
If the figure is born without a heart, the figure is unborn of the heart.

277
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,084
I've only seen your figure.

278
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,300
I haven't got to know your heart.

279
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,060
That's why we haven't seen each other yet.

280
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,220
You wish to know my heart?

281
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,140
Do you know my original name?

282
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,744
Wu Xin. 
 (T/N: no heart)

283
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880
Come inside.

284
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,844
I think I've met him before.

285
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:01,752
Yue Ji greets and Ming Hou kills.

286
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,916
This is Ming Hou. You guys are old acquaintances indeed.

287
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,140
However, it seems like he remembers nothing.

288
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,880
Is he your drug tester?

289
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,860
When I met him and Yue Ji, both of them were seriously wounded.

290
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,848
They were dying.

291
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:22,941
Although he didn't die, he became a drug tester that only listens to your order.

292
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:25,536
Everything has a price.

293
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:30,968
Since he wanted him and Yue Ji to be saved, he has to pay the price.

294
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,232
It's a shame that I cannot use that technique now.

295
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:40,500
I cannot help you again.

296
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,380
As for you, why are you here to see me?

297
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,456
My surname is Xiao.

298
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,120
So, you're Xiao Yu, also known as Prince Chi.

299
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
You're the seventh son of Emperor Mingde.

300
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,060
You look like you only indulge in worldly pleasures.

301
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,580
But all these years, your power is growing.

302
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,112
Even my return to Tian Wai Tian was part of your arrangement.

303
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,792
You did so because Tian Wai Tian was having civil unrest.

304
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,160
That's why you sent me back here

305
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,980
and used me as a puppet to control the scenes in secret.

306
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,720
In the end, not just Tian Wai Tian but even the entire martial arts world will be under your control.

307
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,860
That's right.

308
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,316
You're right.

309
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:34,628
However, your ability far exceeded what I could imagine.

310
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:38,240
You've taken over Tian Wai Tian in just a few months.

311
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,140
That's why I traveled over 1,000 li in hopes of establishing an alliance with you.

312
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,800
But why should I do so?

313
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,340
My surname is Xiao, but my mother's surname is Yi.

314
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,260
Back then, I was too young.

315
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,500
I could only remember her surname.

316
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,656
I forgot her name.

317
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,668
Yi Wenjun.

318
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,700
That name doesn't ring a bell.

319
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,928
I'm afraid it doesn't ring a bell to you, me,

320
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,864
or even herself.

321
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,600
What do people remember her as?

322
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,140
Consort Xuan.

323
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,660
So, you're my half-brother?

324
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,300
I was born when Ye Dingzhi abducted my imperial mother back then.

325
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm your elder brother.

326
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,220
And I'm two years older than you.

327
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,420
That means I'm disadvantaged here.

328
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,020
So?

329
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,760
What do you mean?

330
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,740
Although we're brothers, we have different fathers.

331
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,788
Our fathers are rivals too.

332
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:58,440
After all, back then, my father led the Demon Sect to conquer the east.

333
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,160
Everyone thought he did it because of his ambitions to rule the world.

334
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,860
However, he was motivated to do so clearly because Emperor Mingde abducted my mother.

335
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,600
My father died because of your father.

336
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,620
He even abducted my mother.

337
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,500
You're lucky that I'm not chopping you up.

338
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,976
How dare you ask me to assist you in stealing the Emperor's throne?

339
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
My father is old now.

340
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,640
He intends to select a crown prince.

341
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,880
Our family originally depended on Shadow Sect when we were in Tianqi.

342
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,740
But Prince Langya abolished them when he was still alive.

343
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,168
Now, our family has no say in Tianqi City at all.

344
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,640
And my imperial mother is detested by all due to that incident.

345
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,308
Other princes control the forces in Wushuang City and Xueyue City.

346
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,220
Don't make yourself sound so weak.

347
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,120
Back then, my mother had a senior brother who was deeply in love with her.

348
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
His name is Luo Qingyang.

349
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,452
In the end, he became the strongest one among the Five Sword Deities.

350
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:01,320
He's the City Lord of Muliang City, Lone Sword Deity.

351
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,900
Now, he's your foster father.

352
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,740
He's our foster father indeed.

353
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Our foster father?

354
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,192
Brother, you're deceptive with your words.

355
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:17,448
I just want imperial mother to lead a better life.

356
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:22,556
All these years, everyone detests Mother because of that incident with Ye Dingzhi.

357
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,800
They look down on me too.

358
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,560
But I want to become the most powerful person and make everyone regret their decision.

359
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,900
You intend to move me with kinship?

360
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,148
That's not a good choice.

361
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:39,980
After all, there's no pleasant memory between us.

362
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,260
However, taking over the world does seem pretty interesting.

363
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,460
I cannot be the Emperor.

364
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,420
However, helping someone to become the Emperor doesn't sound that bad.

365
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,240
Really?

366
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,660
Yes.

367
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,676
I assume you will die without my presence.

368
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,280
I don't have much kin left.

369
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,596
I hope that you two can stay alive.

370
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,820
Excellent.

371
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,000
Now, I have an emergency I need you to help me with.

372
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,520
You're assigning missions to me right after I agreed to your proposal?

373
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,900
Don't you think you're too hasty?

374
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,828
I'm in a rush.

375
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,680
Xiao Chong, also known as Prince Bai, has taken action.

376
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,580
They're tracking someone down.

377
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,040
That man is very important.

378
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,520
We mustn't let Xiao Chong get his way.

379
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,032
I need you to steal him or kill him.

380
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:48,440
Don't tell me that person has the surname Xiao too?

381
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,000
That's right.

382
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,304
Xiao Se?

383
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,260
I don't care what his name is.

384
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,640
Anyway, you're right.

385
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,280
It's that person you're thinking about.

386
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,244
Seems like you two are very close.

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,360
That's right. He's my friend.

388
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,120
I don't have many friends.

389
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,840
He's one of them.

390
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,740
But don't worry. I will agree to your request.

391
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,380
But there's only one thing.

392
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,580
What is it?

393
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,648
I will promise that Prince Bai, Xiao Chong, won't get his hands on him.

394
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,400
However, you won't get him either.

395
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,644
Xiao Se mustn't die.

396
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:29,780
That's my bottom line.

397
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,520
Fine. I promise.

398
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,460
Also, I need someone to accompany me on the journey.

399
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,940
You shall follow me.

400
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,624
You're taking him?

401
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,404
After all, we have seen each other before.

402
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:56,760
It's a shame that he ended up like this.

403
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,820
Why don't you entrust him to me?

404
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,840
You can take him away then.

405
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,640
After the deed is done, I will find you in Tianqi City.

406
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,632
Remember, Xiao Se mustn't die.

407
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,760
That's my bottom line.

408
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,660
He left?

409
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,440
He didn't even stop for a moment.

410
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,740
Maybe he's in a hurry to do something else.

411
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm glad that he's gone.

412
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,180
Did you send Miss Sikong here because you expected him to do so?

413
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,500
Sometimes, you need to shed blood to resolve certain issues.

414
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,100
It was inappropriate for me to show myself.

415
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,320
That's why I told Qianluo to do it for me.

416
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,704
Xiao Se, I heard from Qianluo that you're hurt.

417
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:01,060
It's just a minor injury. There's no need to overreact.

418
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,880
Tang Lian, Old Master Tang said he suddenly had an idea.

419
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,280
It might be able to cure Miss Ye's disease.

420
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,488
You should bring Miss Ye to the Tang Clan when you're free.

421
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:14,820
Yes.

422
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,520
Senior Brother, you're leaving?

423
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
Don't tell me you're leaving too?

424
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,720
Lei Fortress's hero banquet will start soon.

425
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,040
Besides, according to the promise, my sister made to me,

426
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,340
she has to follow me and see my master at least once.

427
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,600
I forgot about that.

428
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,900
This year's hero banquet is held by the Lei Clan.

429
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,860
So, Senior Brother, do you want to join me?

430
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,980
After I return to the Tang Clan, if I have nothing else to do,

431
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,180
I think I will join the banquet together with Old Master Tang.

432
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,168
That's great.

433
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,760
Listen. I heard that there's even a martial arts contest.

434
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,600
- Are you going to join it? 
 - Of course I will take the top spot.

435
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,840
Your senior brother was once a three-time winner of the contest.

436
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,541
Don't embarrass your eldest martial brother.

437
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,640
What about Xiao Se? Xiao Se, are you joining it?

438
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,800
You're more familiar with a martial arts contest than me.

439
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,880
Scram.

440
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,432
He can't go.

441
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:04,532
The accounts of Xueyue City are piling up.

442
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,540
I'm going.

443
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,080
You wish to go?

444
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,936
I want to see how this fool will embarrass himself.

445
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:17,440
That's impossible.

446
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,120
Listen. I'll definitely defeat everyone there.

447
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,684

448
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,185
Is this how Wushuang City treats their guests?

449
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:42,000
His Highness is already here, yet the City Lord of Wushuang City hasn't shown himself yet.

450
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,980
Don't tell me you want us to wait for him?

451
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,200
What?

452
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,940
I'm already sitting here, aren't I?

453
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,140
What?

454
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,180
A little boy like you is actually the City Lord of Wushuang City?

455
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,820
Zang Ming, what's wrong?

456
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,708
Your Highness, Song Yanhui isn't here.

457
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,800
That's a random boy over there.

458
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,260
Are they joking with us?

459
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,560
Such audacity!

460
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,740
I'm Wu Shuang, the new City Lord of Wushuang City.

461
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,140
Zang Ming.

462
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,476
So, you must be the Young Master Xiao that Mr. Ling had mentioned.

463
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,380
A pleasure to meet you. I'm Xiao Chong.

464
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,860
How dare you, Xiao Se.

465
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,940
No wonder I couldn't find you.

466
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,660
So, you are hiding up here, lazing.

467
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,480
I just finished doing the accounts.

468
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,240
I just came here to take a sip, and now, you're here.

469
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,940
How's your practice with the Yinyue Spear?

470
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,680
I've mastered the fourth level.

471
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,340
What? Do you wish to spar with me?

472
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Forget it. We can talk about it tomorrow.

473
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,104
Listen, you'd better don't offend me.

474
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:49,560
If you do, I'll wield Wuji Staff and beat you to the ground.

475
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,636
I've listened to that so many times. Fight me if you dare.

476
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:55,580
You're so childish.

477
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,760
Money-grubber.

478
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,700
Have you been to Tianqi before?

479
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,520
You mean the imperial capital?

480
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,760
No. How's the capital compared to Xueyue City?

481
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,680
It isn't as beautiful as Xueyue City.

482
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,520
However, it's huge.

483
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,720
It's about the size of seven or eight Xueyue Cities.

484
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,760
All kinds of people gather there.

485
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,860
It's interesting over there.

486
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,760
They will hold a grand bazaar at the middle and the end of the year.

487
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,097
You'll find all kinds of interesting trinkets over there.

488
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:36,012
Once, I saw a shard of crystal that was purely natural.

489
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,360
It was about the size of a liquor vat.

490
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,160
There's a place called Qianjin Gambling House.

491
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,556
I once gambled and won a city over there.

492
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,344
Bring me to Tianqi when you have the chance, will you?

493
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,280
Sure.

494
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,440
Go now. You've been in Mount Cang for too long anyway.

495
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,580
What about you?

496
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,360
Baili hasn't returned yet, and now, I'm leaving.

497
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
I'm the City Lord of Xueyue City.

498
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,444
Xueyue City is my martial arts world.

499
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,680
How's your disciple doing?

500
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,800
He's getting better, but he still cannot endure any hardships.

501
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,720
Even so, he insists on heading to Lei Fortress.

502
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,300
Why does he want to go to Lei Fortress?

503
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,380
He says he wants to witness Lei Wujie wins the contest personally.

504
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,480
What a ridiculous reason.

505
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,240
What's more ridiculous is that I actually said yes.

506
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,080
 Why did you say that you want to go to Lei Fortress?

507
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,060
 Just now, it was unsuitable for me to say so.

508
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,860
 But Xueyue City is definitely the best place for you to rest and recuperate.

509
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,760
 Your whereabouts have been exposed.

510
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,940
 If you leave Xueyue City right now, plenty of people will pursue you.

511
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,520
 I have Xueyue Sword Deity with me.

512
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,320
 With her around, no one can kill me.

513
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,300
 What's the reason then?

514
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,640
 I want to see Lei Wujie win the contest.

515
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,820
 What kind of excuse is that?

516
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:22,432
 It seems like he has accepted the Azure Dragon Token without knowing who I am.

517
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,476
 I'm curious as to how much Lei Wujie can grow if he keeps this up.

518
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:29,940
 That's all?

519
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,440
 Moreover, that silly kid wants to venture out into the martial arts world.

520
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,540
 He might get himself killed if I'm not with him.

521
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,388
 I'm still worried.

522
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:43,780
 But I know that you won't heed my words.

523
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,140
 When you tried to persuade me to return to Tianqi,

524
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,944
 I realized that it wasn't something you would say.

525
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
 I said so because I wanted to test you.

526
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,960
 Xie Xuan said some people would never change.

527
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,592
 Thus, I made a bet with him.

528
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,880
 - How did it turn out? 
 - I lost the bet.

529
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,156
 But I was happy about it.

530
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:09,820
 Great, then.

531
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
Fine.

532
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,620
Xie Xuan will head to Lei Fortress too.

533
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,300
They can see each other and talk about the secret of the Art of Roaming.

534
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:26,112
That might be one of the reasons I'm willing to let him go.

535
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:29,520
I'll join him. Don't worry.

536
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,960
Hanyi, it's been a long time since you left Xueyue City.

537
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,660
Don't you wish to head to somewhere you like for once?

538
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,910
No.

539
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,040
Don't be so absolute about it.

540
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,440
If you want to do so, I'll invite Senior Brother Baili back.

541
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,320
We will make the call for you. You can head to Mount Wangcheng.

542
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
No need for that.

543
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,060
I know what I'm doing.

544
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,740
Look at you. Forget it.

545
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,004

546
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,080
City Lord.

547
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,464
Have they left?

548
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:13,100
Yes.

549
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,680
This prince isn't someone ordinary.

550
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,164
Have we ever had a blind emperor before?

551
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:25,040
Isn't this the first time Wushuang City has a city lord with such a bad memory.

552
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,060
There's always a first time.

553
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,400
Have you remembered him then?

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,740
Xiao Chong, also known as Prince Bai.

555
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,100
He inherited his breathing technique from Jinyu, Bearer of Records.

556
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
He is a calm person.

557
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
He learned his sword skills from Yan Zhantian, the Rage Sword Deity.

558
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,780
He has a serious killing intent.

559
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,721
I have a bad memory because I only remember the people worth remembering.

560
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,800
However, you have to be careful in the future.

561
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Did he want anything from you?

562
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,400
He told me to wait for the right chance before entering Tianqi.

563
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,920
I shouldn't get myself involved in their power struggle before that.

564
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,060
If we see the world as a board of weiqi and Wushuang City as a pawn,

565
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,196
it's not our time yet.

566
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:10,860
I don't want to be anyone's pawn.

567
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,410
I want to be the GO player instead.

568
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,616
I've lived in Xueyue City for three months.

569
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:26,280
Now that we're parting ways, I don't know when we'll see each other again.

570
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,720
Everyone, the world remains unchanged.

571
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,836
See you all again.

572
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,640
You're bidding farewell, right?

573
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,880
You should do it in front of Xueyue City's gate.

574
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,960
Why are you doing it in front of Dengtian Tower?

575
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,788
I'm carrying it through the end.

576
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,992
We're about to leave.

577
00:36:52,992 --> 00:36:55,256
Why isn't Senior Brother here to see us off?

578
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:58,020
- Who are you badmouthing? 
 - Senior Brother.

579
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,720
Miss Ruoyi is here too.

580
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,220
We know that you are leaving today.

581
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,480
So we came here to see you off.

582
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,840
Xiao Se, are you sure you want to go?

583
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
- I... 
 - He?

584
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,860
He's just bored from doing accounts all the time.

585
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,160
That's why I'm bringing him to the hero banquet so that he can take a breather.

586
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,120
We'll return once we're done.

587
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,700
Great timing. I need to bring Miss Ye back to the Tang Clan too.

588
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,040
Miss Ruoyi, if the Tang Clan cannot cure you, you can come to Lei Clan.

589
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,428
My master is—

590
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,260
The eldest disciple of the Tang Clan is here.

591
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,080
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

592
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,820
That's not what I mean.

593
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,560
- I... 
 - It doesn't matter.

594
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,840
By the way, where's Second Master?

595
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,060
Isn't she heading there as well?

596
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,100
Sister said she could travel 1,000 li a day. She told us to depart first.

597
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,620
She would catch up to us later.

598
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,260
All right.

599
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,168
Senior Brother, we'll head to Lei Fortress first.

600
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,660
You guys must come, okay?

601
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,560
Don't worry. I'll be there to witness your victory.

602
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,820
All right. Farewell.

603
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,440
Miss Ye, what do you think about my junior brother?

604
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,880
He's full of vigor and youth.

605
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,380
Don't worry. He'll return.

606
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,808
You'll be standing by his side when he returns to Tianqi.

607
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,980
 Xiao Se.

608
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,460
Here, take this.

609
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,996
Are you sure the Lei Fortress is in this direction?

610
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:58,760
Of course not. We're heading to Mount Wangcheng.

611
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,240
Why are we heading to Mount Wangcheng?

612
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,660
Naturally, we're heading there to invite the deity.

613
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,268
Think about it.

614
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,960
Three old friends gathering in Lei Fortress.

615
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,100
I'm sure it'll be interesting.

616
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,060
What are you thinking?

617
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,740
I was just thinking that my master, my sister, and this person on Mount Wangcheng

618
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,680
have been trapping themselves all these years.

619
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,720
Actually, they're just waiting for each other to take the first step.

620
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,180
Since I've already left the mountain, it's time for the stalemate to be broken.

621
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,940
Zhao Yuzhen has never left the mountain all these years.

622
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,280
Do you really think he'll leave the mountain because of a silly kid like you?

623
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,800
If you never try, you'll never know.

624
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,500
Fine. What do you intend to do then?

625
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,480
Naturally, I'll spar with him.

626
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,128
Suit yourself.

627
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,188

628
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,360
You've left the mountain for one year.

629
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,200
Did you have enough fun?

630
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,108
I did.

631
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,560
Where did you go?

632
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,080
I went to admire the flowers in Chaisang City.

633
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,200
I also viewed the sea in Gu City.

634
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,720
I summoned tidal waves with a flick of my sword.

635
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,632
All those fishermen thought I was a deity.

636
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,460
Besides that, I also hiked Mount Kunlun.

637
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,388
There's actually a place where the snow never melts.

638
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:31,040
The world down there is so interesting.

639
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,848
Master, it's a pity that you cannot leave the mountain.

640
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,153
Did you forget about one more place?

641
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,440
Xueyue City wrote to me.

642
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,120
The one who wrote to me was Superintendent Xiao of Xueyue City.

643
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,040
He wants us to compensate him with 800,000 silver taels.

644
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,440
800,000...

645
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,420
Why is he requesting money from us?

646
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,620
In his letter, he said that a disciple of Mount Wangcheng called Li Fansong

647
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,620
razed the Dengtian Tower to the ground which had just been renovated.

648
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,820
Master, it was my fault.

649
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,200
I did go to Xueyue City and challenge the Dengtian Tower.

650
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,840
However, I wasn't the one who destroyed it. I...

651
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,280
Of course, I know it wasn't your doing.

652
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,420
If you were this strong,

653
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,360
I would've pawned my precious Qingxiao Sword to repay the debt for you.

654
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,840
However, Superintendent Xiao is so mean.

655
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,349
I think he intends to blackmail us using this opportunity.

656
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:28,390
Have you met Xueyue Sword Deity?

657
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,840
- I have. 
 - And then?

658
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,100
- I challenged her. 
 - What's her Sword Art?

659
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,128
Beautiful Day.

660
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,752
Beautiful Day?

661
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,760
You're just as lucky as me.

662
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,184
When I was your age, I had once witnessed the same beautiful sword art you witnessed.

663
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:53,608
 Beautiful Day.

664
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,850
 How beautiful.

665
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:19,950

666
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,520
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

667
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,900
