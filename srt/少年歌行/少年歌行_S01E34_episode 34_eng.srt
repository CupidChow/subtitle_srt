24
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,360
If I'm right, the war in Tianqi City should have started by now.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,800
Yes. I wonder how my crazy nephew is doing now.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
My guess is he's in front of the palace, being condemned and accused of being a traitor.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,170
Many people can't wait to tear him apart and gobble him up.

28
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,760
Looking at the bright side,

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,510
maybe he has already reunited with Xiao Lingchen and avenged Prince Langya.

30
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,920
Perhaps they're sharing the throne now.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,050
It seems like you still don't trust us.

32
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,830
Watch out!

33
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,800
Jinwei, what are you doing? Are you insane?

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,070
All of you have forgotten Master's wish back then.

35
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,910
But I still remember it.

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:02,100
I just didn't expect we would eventually count on a good-for-nothing!

37
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,810
A good-for-nothing?

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,670
Back then, for your own self-interests, you used my father's military prestige

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,970
and the public's confidence to push him to take the throne,

40
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,550
sowing discord among the emperor and officials and destabilizing the kingdom.

41
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,920
In the end, my father sacrificed himself for the greater good.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,120
Do you want me to repeat the same mistake?

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,330
Prince Langya's name was written on the scroll to begin with!

44
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,960
He was supposed to be the emperor!

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,590
It really is ridiculous.

46
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,430
I've heard of people who want to be the emperor,

47
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,410
but I didn't know that someone must be the emperor.

48
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,520
My father didn't like that position. He refused to take it.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,560
What can you do?

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm not interested either. How do you like me now?

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,300
Jin Wei, don't say any more.

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,310
Stop making it worse.

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,320
My sword technique is no match for you.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,320
If it wasn't for Master,

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,670
I would've died when I was five.

56
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,040
I just wanted to do something for him.

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,520
There's something I must tell you.

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,730
The person who killed Jin Yu,

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,300
wasn't me, and it wasn't Jin Yan either.

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,880
We aren't capable of doing that.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,390
Jin Wei!

62
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,360
General, what should we do now?

63
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,040
Attack!

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
Report!

65
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,890
Stop!

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,730
General, there's an army ahead.

67
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,580
An army?

68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,080
It's Chen Kui's lower army that came to meet up with us, right?

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,560
At his pace, they shouldn't have been here so soon.

70
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,380
It's not the lower army. It's the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers who guard Tianqi City.

71
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,300
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers?

72
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,110
Stay alert!

73
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,620
Watch out, General!

74
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,360
It really is the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,320
Why would they show up here?

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,060
Uncle Cheng, you must be confused, right?

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,790
Why is it that my father is attacking Tianqi City?

78
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,630
Yet, I've shown up here with the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers trying to stop the upper and lower armies.

79
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,020
Sometimes, when the lord is too talented, the counselor might seem to be redundant.

80
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,340
I was worried at first.

81
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,950
But seeing them cower in fear, it gives me more confidence now.

82
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,980
It seems like Xiao Se made the right bet to turn things around.

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,670
I'm Lei Wujie, the son of Lei Mengsha,

84
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,580
who was the late General of Beili's Eight Pillars,

85
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,840
the Silver-Shroud Marshal of the Langya Army!

86
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,760
All of you, please stand down!

87
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,330
♫  Staring at the endless abyss beneath my feet  ♫

88
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,490
I'm Prince Langya, Xiao Lingchen,

89
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,320
the son of Xiao Ruofeng, who was the former commander of the Langya Army cum Beili's Governor-in-Chief.

90
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,520
All of you, please back off!

91
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,920
♫  I move forward desperately against the world  ♫

92
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,920
♫  I can't resist the heartbeat  ♫

93
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,170
♫  That changes with my breathing  ♫

94
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,970
I'm Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe, the son of Emperor Mingde...

95
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,550
the student of Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng.

96
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,210
All of you, please stand down!

97
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,960
But they are all dead!

98
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,200
Beili's Governor-in-Chief

99
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,630
and the Silver-Shroud Marshal are all dead!

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,750
I, the Golden Armor General, am the only one left!

101
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,530
Chuhe.

102
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,290
Yes, Imperial Father.

103
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,020
Announce the decree.

104
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,990
What decree?

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,370
I'll read it and you announce it!

106
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,090
I will obey.

107
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,790
In the 16th year of Mingde, the mutiny of Prince Langya...

108
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,990
In the 16th year of Mingde, the mutiny of Prince Langya...

109
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,450
was wrongly judged.

110
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,880
Imperial Father, this is reproaching yourself!

111
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,870
Announce it.

112
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,270
Was wrongly judged!

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,380
Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng,

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,310
dedicated himself to the nation and the people.

115
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,640
Yet, he was framed by evildoers.

116
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,480
Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng, dedicated himself to the nation and the people.

117
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,180
Yet, he was framed by evildoers!

118
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,530
Now that the evildoers have been brought to justice,

119
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,640
he's exonerated

120
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,120
and granted the posthumous title of "Distinguished".

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,310
He's readmitted to the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

122
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,520
He'll be worshiped and honored forever.

123
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,890
Now that the evildoers have been brought to justice,

124
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,190
he's exonerated

125
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,650
and granted the posthumous title of "Distinguished".

126
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,880
He's readmitted to the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
He'll be worshiped and honored forever!

128
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,070
His son, Xiao Lingchen,

129
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,000
inherits the title of Prince Langya,

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,280
named General Xuanwu.

131
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,070
He's allowed to reassemble the former Langya Army.

132
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,020
It's independent of the Three Armies and directly under the emperor.

133
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,140
His son, Xiao Lingchen,

134
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,690
inherits the title of Prince Langya,

135
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,770
named General Xuanwu.

136
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,670
He's allowed to reassemble the former Langya Army.

137
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,440
It's independent of the Three Armies and directly under the emperor.

138
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,200
I... listened and trusted slander

139
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,280
and killed my beloved brother.

140
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,340
I deeply regret it.

141
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,790
I'll burn incense for him at the Imperial Ancestral Shrine

142
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,420
once every three days until I die.

143
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,120
I listened and trusted slander and killed my beloved brother.

144
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,130
I deeply regret it.

145
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,140
I'll burn incense for him at the Imperial Ancestral Shrine

146
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,670
once every three days until I die.

147
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

148
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,500
My father, Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya,

149
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,530
sent himself to jail to end the insurgency.

150
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,510
It was me and my father who plotted the chaos in Tianqi City that night.

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,600
For the stability of the kingdom, my father forwent his glory

152
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,870
and committed suicide at the execution ground to pacify the world!

153
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,870
You, as the subordinates of my father,

154
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,940
didn't obey the order of the general and marched to the imperial city, trying to revolt!

155
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,020
Do you deserve to be in the Langya Army?

156
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,640
General!

157
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,040
Why were you so reluctant to be the emperor?

158
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,360
- Your Majesty! 
 - Imperial Father!

159
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,890
Your Majesty!

160
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,730
Imperial Father!

161
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,340
Imperial Father.

162
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,820
Imperial Father. Imperial Father!

163
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,340
 In the 22nd year of Mingde, in Spring,

164
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,590
 Emperor Mingde admitted that the mutiny of Lord Langya was a misjudgment.

165
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,300
 He reproached himself and cleared Prince Langya's name.

166
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,700
 Ye Xiaoying, the Golden Armor General, led the troops to Tianqi.

167
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,210
 Zhuoxin and Jin Wei was executed.

168
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,520
 Jin Yan went missing.

169
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,270
 It was then known as the Langya Mutiny.

170
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,010
Father.

171
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,420
Enough.

172
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,690
Say no more.

173
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,320
I lost to those children this time.

174
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,000
Actually, true to my nature,

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,930
I couldn't wait to raze the palace to the ground and kill all of them at that time.

176
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,600
You're brave, but not brutal.

177
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Xiao Se had already seen through this.

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,610
Yes. I value military strength.

179
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,430
And that child reads people's hearts.

180
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,750
Causing 200,000 soldiers of mine

181
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,500
to be withdrawn by several brats

182
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,240
and some sort of ridiculous confession.

183
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,200
Xiao Se said if you hadn't withdrawn the troops,

184
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,420
Tianqi City would no longer been adorned by the divine bird flag of the imperial family,

185
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,430
but the army flag of the Ye Battalion.

186
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,500
Right.

187
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,200
When I was holding those blades at the time,

188
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,100
I thought if I should kill all those named Xiao

189
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,930
and take the throne myself.

190
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,440
However, I'm just good at fighting and battling.

191
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,390
I'm not fit to be an emperor.

192
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,840
So I gave up.

193
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:57,370
Besides, in the past, His Highness took his own life.

194
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,590
So there's no reason for me to hold it against them.

195
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,470
Father.

196
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,070
Daughter, I'm getting old.

197
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,040
Back in the day,

198
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,770
the friends who fought with me in Tianqi City

199
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,310
are all gone.

200
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,300
All these years,

201
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,530
I've fed on vengeance.

202
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,050
Now that is gone too.

203
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,510
It's over.

204
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,600
Enough, let's stop talking about this.

205
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Daughter, how do you feel?

206
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,540
I haven't had episodes in a long time now.

207
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,230
I've asked the State Preceptor.

208
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,010
He said the zhenqi  (true energy)  that the master on the celestial mountain left on me has protected my heart.

209
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,780
I'll be fine in the next ten years.

210
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,300
Ten years later, when the master wakes up, I'll go to the celestial mountain again.

211
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,870
That's good then.

212
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,020
Daughter, I'm guessing you aren't ready to leave Tianqi.

213
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,530
After all, you've got so many friends here. Am I right?

214
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,610
Do you want to be Xiao Se's princess?

215
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,540
Xiao Se and I are good friends who grew up together.

216
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,900
There's no love between us. You've misunderstood, Father.

217
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,210
So it's that child from the Lei family?

218
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,000
Let me tell you, he's different from his father.

219
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,250
Back in the day, Brother Lei was quite a ladies' man.

220
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,540
But that boy? Silly and foolish.

221
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,030
Father, what exactly are you trying to say?

222
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,100
Daughter, I'm just thinking about

223
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,470
who can take care of you after I leave.

224
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,550
Where are you going?

225
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,760
Silly girl,

226
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,730
after everything that happened, do you think I still can stay here?

227
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,730
Emperor Mingde didn't condemn me because he wouldn't dare to.

228
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,180
If I didn't admit mistakes and resign,

229
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,350
those people would always think that I still want to rebel.

230
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,490
If so, they won't be able to get any sleep.

231
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,660
How about this? You draft a memorial to the throne

232
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,550
and say that I'm going to retire.

233
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,510
Of course. There's no rush.

234
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,200
Let's wait another month.

235
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,230
So that those ill-intentioned people can't sleep well this month.

236
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,210
You're going to Mount Fengxi?

237
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,620
Yes.

238
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,450
Your mother is buried there.

239
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,590
- Greetings, Imperial Father. 
 - Greetings, Your Majesty.

240
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,750
You're both here.

241
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,290
Come.

242
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,870
Come closer.

243
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,160
Did you two

244
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,270
plan this together?

245
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,630
He gave me a riddle.

246
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,600
So I made a bet.

247
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,110
You and I grew up together. How could you not know?

248
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,040
It was obviously because of what I said that you made such a strange change in the troop movements.

249
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,180
You opened the city gate, welcomed the mutineers,

250
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,310
and sent the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers to stop the two army forces dispatched to save the emperor?

251
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,940
Only you could think of that.

252
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,100
If you said he wasn't an inside man of the Langya Army, I wouldn't believe it.

253
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,930
Imperial Father,

254
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,760
it was my own idea to stop the army forces from saving you.

255
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,650
Please don't blame Imperial Uncle for that.

256
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,580
I understand why you sent forces to stop them.

257
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,090
Now that I'm severely ill, and the country is in tumult,

258
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,910
it's inevitable that the army will become disloyal.

259
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,750
This behavior of yours has avoided multiple conflicts.

260
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,600
No soldiers in Beili were sacrificed.

261
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,330
Well done.

262
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,380
Impeiral Father, someone must've colluded with these two armies.

263
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,200
Please severely punish them.

264
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,930
All right. I'll ask Yueli to look into it.

265
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:12,360
Lingchen, what you said and did in front of the hall

266
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,890
has a lot of the same style as your father back then.

267
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,760
All I did was uphold my father's will.

268
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,050
If I did rebel and take the throne,

269
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,010
my father would whip me to death when I go see him in the afterlife.

270
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,620
Moreover, with my personality, I can't be an emperor.

271
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,260
Then, what kind of person is suitable to be an emperor?

272
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,830
Someone like you, Your Majesty.

273
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,600
Someone who has many thoughts, a stable character,

274
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,590
and who thinks through everything.

275
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,130
My father was too carefree.

276
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,510
It's all right to be a general.

277
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,160
But it's exhausting to be an emperor.

278
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,050
So he gave up the throne back then. I'm the same.

279
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,370
The emperor is the most powerful person in the world.

280
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,250
But at the same time, the most constrained.

281
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,730
Those eunuchs bet everything on me and my father.

282
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,470
They were wrong about us.

283
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,570
Back in the day, us two brothers were the emperor and the general.

284
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,160
We had thought that the fate of Beili was in our hands

285
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,130
and that we could make the country prosper.

286
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,350
Yet, I didn't expect that we would be used by others.

287
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:38,190
I've been blaming myself for what happened to your father all these years.

288
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,120
You should, Your Majesty.

289
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,390
Go on.

290
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,620
Now, I've got a clear picture of that matter.

291
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,610
My father established brilliant achievements in war. The people respected him.

292
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,740
Many people in the army, including General Ye Xiaoying, tried to push him to be the Emperor.

293
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,040
Especially that time when he returned from Nanjue victorious,

294
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,150
the streets were covered in flowers, and all the people were there to welcome him.

295
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,120
Many people in the army started to make moves already.

296
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,250
So the treacherous officials found that scroll and tried to make an issue of it.

297
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,850
It was said that many generals in the army were already secretly talking.

298
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,650
A chance was all they needed to push my father to become emperor.

299
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,810
In the end, my father would rather kill himself and ruin his own reputation to pacify the world.

300
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,740
But why did Your Majesty

301
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,130
remain silent all this time?

302
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,330
I understand that this was a tacit agreement between you two.

303
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,640
You were aware of his plan. He knew your intentions.

304
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,250
But actually, there was another solution at that time.

305
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,830
You could've found all those officials who tried to revolt and killed them.

306
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,750
You could've worked with my father and told the world,

307
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,560
"Yes, the name on the scroll is Xiao Ruofeng, so what?

308
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,930
I, Xiao Ruojin, am still the Emperor. Xiao Ruofeng is still Prince Langya."

309
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,770
This was the choice you two made!

310
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,240
No one could change it, not the Dragon Seal Scroll, nor the people!

311
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,450
But why couldn't you do that?

312
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,610
Because it was risky to do that.

313
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,010
If you had done that, it would've endangered the stability of your throne

314
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,700
and deeply affected the safety and peace in Tianqi City.

315
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,020
Those princes who lost fighting for the throne would march to Tianqi at any time.

316
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,400
The officials who were against you would take a chance to make a move.

317
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,170
Your Majesty, am I right?

318
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,260
Yes... you're completely right.

319
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,400
That's why I've been feeling guilty all these years.

320
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,810
I can lie to myself and say this was Ruofeng's choice.

321
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:29,420
I can also tell myself that one day,

322
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,950
I'll exonerate Ruofeng

323
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,800
and readmit him to the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

324
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,730
But until the moment

325
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,870
you all set foot in the palace,

326
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,140
I still hadn't done this.

327
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,660
My father always remembered his promise to you

328
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,360
when you were young.

329
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,900
But later,

330
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,180
you forgot about it.

331
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,480
I don't know why you asked me to come here today.

332
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,160
But this is all I wanted to say.

333
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,550
And I don't wish to listen to some sort of repentance.

334
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,500
If there's nothing else you want to say, I'll excuse myself.

335
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,430
I understand why my father did that.

336
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,520
But it doesn't mean I can forgive what happened.

337
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,660
I lost the person closest to me.

338
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,920
Whatever the reason is, it's unforgivable.

339
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:50,990
Be it the kingdom or the nation, there's nothing special about the throne.

340
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,450
I didn't come here to catch up with you or to claim credit.

341
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,840
I just want to say out loud the words that I've kept inside all these years!

342
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,190
I can't tell people about it.

343
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,380
I can only say it to you, Your Majesty.

344
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,390
I hope you can understand.

345
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,310
I do.

346
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,490
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

347
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,620
How should

348
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,100
I make the decision this time?

349
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,660
Your Majesty, it's actually very simple.

350
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,560
Which son do you hate the most? Just reserve the throne for him.

351
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,930
The emperor is doomed to be alone.

352
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,070
He'll never achieve happiness.

353
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,900
I didn't expect for him to give me an answer like this.

354
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,110
You've heard what Lingchen said.

355
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,870
What happened in the past is just like he said.

356
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,900
I understand.

357
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:21,700
Back then, I was afraid those treacherous officials would lay a hand on you again.

358
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,180
So I cruelly evicted you out of Tianqi.

359
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,250
Don't blame me for that.

360
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,990
It's thanks to this that I've met a lot of friends.

361
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:45,000
These are the friends that you can truly rely on.

362
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,980
Just like how I relied on Ruofeng back then.

363
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,230
Over the years, I've always been thinking

364
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,600
about the way Ruofeng looked at me on the execution ground.

365
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,290
Guess what I saw.

366
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,290
I wasn't there that day.

367
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:13,150
But I'm guessing you saw the disappointment in his eyes.

368
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:18,070
To the people, he was like a deity.

369
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,190
To the officials, he was a saint.

370
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,580
But at the moment when I gave the command to execute him,

371
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:34,160
he must've been very disappointed in me, his brother.

372
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,300
Imperial Father.

373
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,830
Yes?

374
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,440
I've also got a question to ask.

375
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,430
But you might feel upset after hearing it.

376
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,280
Just say it.

377
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,610
I asked you both to come over today

378
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,480
because I wanted to talk about what happened back then.

379
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,070
Just say it.

380
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:06,500
I was thinking, was the situation back then really that urgent?

381
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,630
The period between Prince Langya being framed and imprisoned

382
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,690
until his execution was too short.

383
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,080
Would it really have caused a rebellion if you hadn't executed him?

384
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,800
Would a rebellion break out that easily?

385
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,550
If that really was the case, how could the people allow him to be executed?

386
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:35,110
You said something Lingchen dared not to say.

387
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,250
Chuhe, well done.

388
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,620
All these years, you haven't changed a bit!

389
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,900
Yes.

390
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,600
I killed him so quickly because I was afraid.

391
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,010
Actually, it wasn't that complicated.

392
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,920
It was because I was tied

393
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,420
to the throne at that time. You know?

394
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,410
Thank you for sorting out my confusion.

395
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,070
I'll excuse myself.

396
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,820
I...

397
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,520
am disappointed in myself as well.

398
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:42,750

399
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:50,320
I've failed completely this time. Thoroughly.

400
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,380
Your Highness.

401
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,360
I had thought...

402
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,680
the world would be in chaos and both sides would lose.

403
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,290
We would only have to sit back and reap the benefits.

404
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,510
But in the end, be it Tianqi City or Langya Army, they're all safe and sound.

405
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,320
It's absurd. Ridiculous.

406
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,990
I miscalculated.

407
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,120
No. It wasn't because of Xiao Lingchen,

408
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,440
but because of Xiao Chuhe.

409
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,500
He let the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers leave Tianqi City

410
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,760
to stop the two army forces from protecting the emperor.

411
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,050
I just received a letter from Luo City Army.

412
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,060
He said the leader of the soldiers was in green, it was Ye Ruoyi, Ye Xiaoying's daughter.

413
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,010
They had thought Ye Ruoyi was sent over by Ye Xiaoying.

414
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,030
This step that Xiao Chuhe took

415
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:58,060
ruined all of my plans.

416
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,090
Your Highness, just forget about it.

417
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,660
But, after this dispute,

418
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,150
there was still something left behind.

419
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,190
Are you referring to the joint petition from the officials?

420
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,350

421
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,260
I had thought this matter had finally come to an end.

422
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,180
But after hearing everything, there's still one important thing missing.

423
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,490
The list of names that Jin Yan had?

424
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,670
Eunuch Jin Yan has a list of names of all the officials that participated in the Langya Mutiny.

425
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,970
But this is also why Xiao Lingchen could successfully lead 200,000 soldiers to charge Tianqi.

426
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,090
With this list of names, we can have those officials by their throats.

427
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,150
Why don't we try to snatch it?

428
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,230
You seem to be in a good mood recently.

429
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,520
You've even learned to tell jokes.

430
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,440
A load has been lifted off my mind after all.

431
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,520
But this matter isn't a joke.

432
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,880
If Xiao Yu were to get this list of names, he'd surely stir up trouble again,

433
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,140
and use it to threaten those officials to work for him.

434
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,270
We absolutely can't let him get ahold of it.

435
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,900
Now that Tianqi City is heavily guarded, Jin Yan can't get out.

436
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,790
He has to find somewhere to hide.

437
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,900
Where do you think he'll hide?

438
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,560
Could it be...

439
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:26,930
He'll go to the only person who cares about his life in Tianqi City.

440
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,320
 There's something I must tell you.

441
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,290
 The person who killed Jin Yu

442
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,540
 wasn't me,

443
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,510
  and it wasn't Jin Yan either.

444
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,430
 We aren't capable of doing that.

445
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,800
Are you... copying and reciting the scripture?

446
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,720
Is it for Jin Yu? It's very kind of you.

447
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,190
Why are there two copies?

448
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,240
The other one is for Jin Wei.

449
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,750
Jin Wei and us were brothers.

450
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,490
It's the least we can do.

451
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,830
When we were young, we didn't get together often.

452
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,070
Jin Yan was always with Eunuch Zhuoxin.

453
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,580
Actually, it was you, Jin Yu, and Jin Wei

454
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,360
who grew up together.

455
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,830
So I must avenge them!

456
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,290
Indeed, something is strange about Jin Yu's death.

457
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,340
You can seek revenge for him.

458
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,310
But Jin Wei died in the rebellion.

459
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,750
Who can you take revenge on?

460
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:57,000
I would guess the Langya Army wouldn't have expected that it would be so easy to enter Tianqi City.

461
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,290
I've always had this feeling that someone behind the scenes

462
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,800
is pushing the development of everything.

463
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,460
While Jin Wei and the others were just pawns.

464
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,430
Jin Wei wasn't an ambitious person.

465
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,750
He just wanted to fulfill Master's wish.

466
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,770
But there's one person

467
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,430
that I'm sure is not our brother.

468
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,750
You mean Jin Yan?

469
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,360
Yes.

470
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,470
He must die.

471
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,810
If he comes looking for you, keep him here and inform me.

472
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:50,100
But if you don't do as I say, there'll only be one person left in the Five Eunuchs.

473
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,500
Are you threatening me?

474
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,660
No, I'm not threatening you.

475
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,290
I'm just worried you'll do something foolish.

476
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,260
Director.

477
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:10,500
You were involved in this rebellion and you supported Prince Chi.

478
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,780
So what?

479
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,340
But the Five Eunuchs should be loyal to Emperor Mingde only.

480
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,100
Do you know why our master and they remained silent when Prince Langya tore the scroll apart?

481
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:31,400
They had long yielded to the rule of the new emperor.

482
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,940
Will you... kill me as he said?

483
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,120
I will.

484
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,000
Unless you give me the list of names you have.

485
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,980
No one will kill me as long as I have that list.

486
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,060
If I hand it over,

487
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,790
even you would kill me, right?

488
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,830
Then, why did you come to me?

489
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,580
I made the wrong choice once.

490
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,450
I'd like...

491
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,570
to choose again.

492
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,240
Master, His Highness Prince Bai is here.

493
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:58,210
In Tianqi City, I would guess there's no better tea than the ones you have.

494
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,930
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

495
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,150
But I'm guessing you're not here just to enjoy tea.

496
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,410
That day, at the front of Tai'an Hall,

497
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,730
Zhuoxin, Jin Yan, and Jin Wei used the forged Dragon Seal Scroll to initiate an insurrection.

498
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,990
The Dragon Seal Scroll was ruined,

499
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,660
but there's another scroll in Jin Yan's hands.

500
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,930
The signatures of hundreds of officials are on that scroll.

501
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:33,360
Since everyone said it was a forged Dragon Seal Scroll,

502
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,800
the signatures can be forged as well.

503
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,610
But everyone heard of it, and it has gotten around already.

504
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,660
Everyone in the city cares a lot about this.

505
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,880
So, you're also interested in this list of names?

506
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,960
Imperial Father has already issued a verbal edict.

507
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,280
From this day forward, I'll be the acting minister of the Court of Justice,

508
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,710
and I'm in charge of this case.

509
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,150
Prince Bai actually went to Hongqing Hall.

510
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,130
So everybody has figured out that Eunuch Jade Deity is the last refuge for Eunuch Jin Yan.

511
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,380
It's just that Eunuch Jade Deity is a hard man to deal with.

512
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,630
Second Brother has the verbal edict from His Majesty.

513
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,080
It'll be easy for him to deal with everyone in Tianqi.

514
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,850
After all, no one wants to go to the Heavenly Prison.

515
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,600
There's one thing I don't understand.

516
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,130
Why did His Majesty leave this to Prince Bai?

517
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,530
Second Brother is prudent.

518
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,080
It's convincing to put him in charge of it.

519
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,630
What about us?

520
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,430
We were the ones who settled the mutiny.

521
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,470
Us?

522
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,030
To them, we're with the Langya Army.

523
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,140
If we were in charge of it,

524
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:47,370
I'm afraid those officials in Tianqi City would be restless.

525
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,920
What should we do, then?

526
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Since Prince Bai is in charge of this already, it's hard for us to interfere.

527
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,370
We can't possibly just take it from him.

528
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,510
There was a special guest who just visited Bai Xiao Sect.

529
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,070
Jade Deity's man?

530
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,660
As you're so smart, it makes me appear stupid.

531
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,800
Say it.

532
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,850
Eunuch Jade Deity has already contacted us.

533
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,230
He said he'll send Jin Yan to Bai Xiao Sect, and he asked us to protect him.

534
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,280
That's great!

535
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,820
When Jin Yan is sent to Bai Xiao Sect, we can arrest him.

536
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,120
Then the list of names is ours, isn't it?

537
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,000
Ji Xue is our friend,

538
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,550
but we can't ruin Bai Xiao Sect's years of reputation.

539
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,870
Connection and business are two different things.

540
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,740
What do we do then?

541
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,900
We have to wait for Eunuch Jade Deity's terms.

542
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,760
We can't just wait like this.

543
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,660
I've already guessed what Eunuch Jade Deity needs.

544
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,860
We have to be prepared for this.

545
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,080
Ruoyi, what's the situation out there?

546
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,580
There are more people watching us out there.

547
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,810
The street has been surrounded by spies.

548
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,700
Before, it was only Prince Bai and Prince Chi's men keeping an eye on us.

549
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,410
But now, half the people in Tianqi City are all watching us.

550
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,060
We have more enemies than before now.

551
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,000
It's not just us who are interested in this list of names.

552
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,760
I'm sure there are many people watching Xiao Yu as well.

553
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,680
Our enemies are naturally their enemies.

554
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:29,900

555
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,200
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

556
