24
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,520
Miss Sikong, I'm surprised that your martial arts skills has greatly improved

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,260
after not meeting for a while.

26
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,940
Of course.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,100
You've become prettier, too.

28
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,420

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,580
He passed the 14th floor. He passed the 14th floor!

30
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,280
- The 14th floor! 
 - He actually passed the 14th floor!

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,460
That means that he has one more floor to clear.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

33
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,340
Let's continue where we left off.

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,640
Xiao Se, they are...

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,500
Judging from their clothes, you must be from Mount Wangcheng.

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,740
We met by accident.

37
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,000
I asked them to perform a divination for me.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,420
I'm Li Fansong of Mount Wangcheng.

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,360
Greetings, Miss Sikong.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,680
I wonder what brings you two to Xueyue City.

41
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,700
Well... We...

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,180
We're here for sightseeing.

43
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes, for sightseeing.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,360
Shall we begin, then?

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,660
Take this.

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,260
What's this?

47
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,020
This medicine is called Iced Pure Water.

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,240
If an ordinary person consumes it, the blood in the body will freeze instantly.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,060
But it works differently for you.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Your Fire Infusion has reached the Garuda Phase,

51
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,640
but your physical body can't take it.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
If you use the skill too long, it'll harm your body.

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,660
And this Iced Pure Water can protect your heart meridian

54
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,860
and extend the time to use Fire Infusion.

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,600
Thank you, Senior Brother.

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,780
By the way, do you have any advice on how to pass the 15th floor?

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,000
I suggest you come again tomorrow.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
Tomorrow?

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,260
The different floors of Dengtian Tower are handled by different students in turn.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,080
Only the Elder Keeper of the Tower will remain on the same floor for ten years.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,400
You must be tired today.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Go back and get some rest. Come back tomorrow.

63
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,460
All right.

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,740
Senior Brother Lian, can you tell me who's the Elder Keeper of the Tower defending the 15th floor?

65
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,120
If you meet him, you'll find him amiable.

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,440
Incense Bearer, you actually took the time to visit the Directorate of Astronomy.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
This is really uncommon.

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,800
Have some tea.

69
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,720
There are so many dignitaries in the court who wish to visit the Astronomy Department

70
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,680
But they never get to meet you, State Preceptor.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
I was afraid to lose face as you might turn me away.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's why I never came before this.

73
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,100
Incense Bearer, you must be joking.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,680
State Preceptor, so this must be the Xingyue Pavilion of the Astronomy Department.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,300
It's said that all the supervisors of past dynasties have watched stars here

76
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,480
to unravel the world's major events.

77
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,600
I wonder what you have unraveled.

78
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,680
Tomorrow...

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,500
it'll rain.

80
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,240
Is that all?

81
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,100
It'll continue to rain until the day after tomorrow.

82
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,740
There will be a west wind.

83
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,280
It will be sunny after three days.

84
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
But it's still not certain yet.

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,460
I've always thought that you are a reticent man who doesn't tell jokes.

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,880
I didn't expect you to have such a leisurely mood.

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,440
I wasn't joking.

88
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,600
Don't you believe me?

89
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,400
Naturally, I'll believe you.

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,140
But you should know

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm not asking about tomorrow's weather,

92
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,980
but...

93
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,580
the future of this dynasty.

94
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,180
The future of this dynasty is Heaven's will.

95
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,880
Heaven's will can't simply be predicted.

96
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,960
Because when you know Heaven's will,

97
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,200
 it has already begun to change.

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,720
 It's only a possibility,

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,420
 not a definite answer.

100
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,700
 But what people want to know is an answer.

101
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,780
 So the heaven's will that you asked about

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,580
 doesn't exist.

103
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,820
Why?

104
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,320
There are two outcomes of this divination.

105
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,120
Can you tell me what it means if it shows peach blossom again?

106
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,340
If it's peach blossom, then this divination shows Yongjiu,

107
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,420
which means "people without a leader."

108
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,000
Is it auspicious or ominous?

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,960
It's highly auspicious. A harmonious world without a leader in a host of dragons.

110
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,420
As soon as the time is right, it'll transform into a dragon and fly to the highest heaven.

111
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,300
What if it's a peach wood sword?

112
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,260
Extremely ominous.

113
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,380
The dragon will die in desolation with heavy bleeding.

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,200
I see.

115
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,220
I never believed in Heaven's will.

116
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,500
I only believe in myself.

117
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,640
I just have a little hesitation in my heart.

118
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,600
I was thinking about whether I should make a decision.

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,620
But I wasn't brave enough.

120
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,120
That's why I asked for Heaven's will timidly,

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,560
but I suddenly understood.

122
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,980
So it doesn't matter if this divination was performed.

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,640
Thank you.

124
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
You're welcome.

125
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,840
I wasn't doing it for you.

126
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,720
After all, if I really destroyed eight-tenths of Mount Wangcheng's way of Heaven,

127
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,260
I'm really afraid Zhao Yuzhen will come after my head with his sword.

128
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,320
Xiao Se!

129
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,360
- Sister Qianluo. 
 - Why did you come back down again?

130
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,060
I just finished my fight with Senior Brother.

131
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,820
He told me to get some rest and go back again tomorrow.

132
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,500
Sounds like you've won.

133
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,720
Well, thank you.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,980
Lei Wujie, how can you win against Senior Brother with that mediocre skill of yours?

135
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,300
I'm sure he lost on purpose.

136
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,640
He did no such thing.

137
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,200
Senior Brother said he went all out.

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,980
I'll let you go this time.

139
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,260
After you officially join us, we'll have a spar.

140
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,900
Well, that's all. I'll get going, then.

141
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,340
Fine, we'll spar.

142
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,320
Enough. Just do what your senior brother said.

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm tired too. I'll take you out for a drink tonight.

144
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,840
All right.

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460

146
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,540
Why did you stop?

147
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,020
- We're here. 
 - We're here?

148
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,900
This place?

149
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,900
But... I don't have money on me.

150
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,560
Don't worry.

151
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,820
We won't need to pay for tonight's liquor.

152
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,540
We'll pay with fate.

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,420
"Pay with fate"?

154
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,500
We're paying liquor with fate?

155
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Returning to the east.

156
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,500
The gentleman in the east is waiting for guests.

157
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,080
What are you muttering about?

158
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,300
I don't see the tavern's owner anywhere.

159
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,360
Isn't he over there sleeping on the roof?

160
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,940
That's the tavern's owner?

161
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,020
I've never seen a tavern owner getting drunk from drinking.

162
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,880
It's just some liquor.

163
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
He even ended up drinking on the roof.

164
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,020
It's nothing but to lighten up the mood.

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,760
You can't even stand properly. How is that not considered drunk?

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,020
It's the person who wants to get drunk, not the liquor.

167
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,260
My friend here wants to drink a cup of liquor.

168
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,460
I wonder if he's lucky to drink it.

169
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,060
Being drunk all year long.

170
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,300
Fate has brought this liquor and you together.

171
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,520
Since fate brought us together, I ask for a drink now.

172
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,240
Be patient.

173
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,220
Just one last touch of the moonlight.

174
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,100
"I want to dance with Chang'e in the Moon Palace in my drunken dreams."

175
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,200
"So I invite her as I lift the unfiltered liquor to the sky."

176
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,220
"Anyone who likes the moon tonight"

177
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,420
"can come up and play the flute."

178
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,240
Have a drink.

179
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,500
This is the best Beauty of Four Seasons.

180
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,380
What do you think?

181
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,800
"Soothing as the breeze."

182
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,580
"Graceful as the flower."

183
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,700
"Still as the snow."

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,680
"Cold as the moon."

185
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,260
A good liquor has one taste.

186
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,840
Diaolou Parlor claims Qiulubai has three tastes.

187
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,400
Do you think my liquor has four tastes?

188
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,820
In my opinion, all the tastes in the world are nothing more than this.

189
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,320
"Still as the snow."

190
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,860
"Cold as the moon"?

191
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,280
You made this liquor sound like it's not strong enough.

192
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,320
I don't like it.

193
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,140
I prefer fiery liquor.

194
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,460
But I'll try it since you poured it.

195
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,800
This liquor...

196
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,340
What's going on?

197
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,520
How do you feel?

198
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,980
Who are you?

199
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,900
What kind of liquor is this?

200
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm the owner of this tavern.

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,240
This is my Beauty of Four Seasons.

202
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,420
Tell me if you want

203
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,260
to drink the second bowl.

204
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,580
♫  Staring at the endless abyss beneath my feet  ♫

205
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,380
♫  It entices the purity of the world  ♫

206
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,360
Do you dare to drink the third bowl?

207
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,120
♫  The freezing rain blurred my vision  ♫

208
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,500
♫  I move forward desperately against the world  ♫

209
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,620
♫  I can't resist the heartbeat  ♫

210
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,000
♫  That changes with my breathing  ♫

211
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,600
♫  It bursts into flames  ♫

212
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,700
♫  And brightens up the dark night  ♫

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,900
♫  Our success depends on whether you believe in yourself  ♫

214
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,340
♫  With a sharp sword in my hand  ♫

215
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,520
Do you still want to drink the fourth bowl?

216
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,720
You'll die if you drink this.

217
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,920
If you die, you can go straight to Heaven instead of Dengtian Tower.

218
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,500
♫  My journey begins to change with my thoughts  ♫

219
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,140
Give it to me.

220
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,180
You...

221
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,600
You're drunk. Get some sleep.

222
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,900
That lad had reached the 14th floor.

223
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,120
He must be here for you.

224
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,620
Don't you want to see him?

225
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,260
Maybe the Lei family sent him here to find Lei Yunhe.

226
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,920
If the Lei Clan sent him here,

227
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,980
he would have come to me with his visiting card instead of going through Dengtian Tower's trials.

228
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,940
I've met that child.

229
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,140
He's clad in red, just like his mother back then.

230
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,480
But he takes after his father's silly personality and your...

231
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,600
I heard the one you're waiting for has entered the city.

232
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,180
Why didn't you go and meet him?

233
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,220
Why should I feel anxious when you're not?

234
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,220
Where's my senior brother?

235
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,100
Why didn't he come with you?

236
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,140
Him?

237
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,240
To decoct his Oblivion Broth

238
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,720
he traveled to the Celestial Mountain in search of the last medicinal herb.

239
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,100
Oblivion Broth?

240
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,220
Does he really want to forget the past that badly?

241
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,700
He only wants to forget one thing.

242
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,420
We were talking about Lei Wujie.

243
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,000
Why did you change the subject to your senior brother?

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,940
Be honest with me, do you really not want to see him?

245
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,240
When are you going to be less stubborn?

246
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,720
You really need to change it.

247
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,440
He's your...

248
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,320
Never mind.

249
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,620
We'll stop talking about Lei Wujie.

250
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,680
Apart from Lei Wujie, your old friend's disciple is also here.

251
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,120
Old friend?

252
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,040
Zhao Yuzhen of Mount Wangcheng.

253
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,940
His Fire Infusion has broken through the third phase.

254
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,820
If he had to break through these phases himself, it would have taken him at least three years.

255
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,200
Now, it only took him three bowls of liquor.

256
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,460
Tang Lian would never let Lei Wujie rest for no reason.

257
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm guessing this is also what you want.

258
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,940
You're the Liquor Deity Baili Dongjun, the Principal City Lord of Xueyue City.

259
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,960
With this lad's ability, he can only reach the 14th floor at most.

260
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,940
He can't beat the one on the 15th floor.

261
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,960
It should be the Elder Keeper of the Tower defending the 15th floor, an elder of Xueyue City.

262
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,820
Why do you have to guess?

263
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,780
You'll know who it is tomorrow.

264
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,720
That's true.

265
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,200
I give this tavern to you.

266
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
I'll leave now.

267
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,260
Where are you going?

268
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,120
To look for a new liquor recipe.

269
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,480
You manage to make an incomparable liquor like the Beauty of Four Seasons.

270
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,280
Do you still need a new recipe?

271
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,920
It's a recipe for Oblivion Broth.

272
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,740
"Oblivion Broth"?

273
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,380
You only need one bowl to forget everything that has happened.

274
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,980
When you wake up, it'll be a new life.

275
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,580
That would be nice.

276
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,440
It's too bad I haven't been able to make it.

277
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,440
If I did manage to make it, I'm sure you would also want one, right?

278
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,520
- Xiao Chu—  
 - I'm Xiao Se.

279
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm just the owner of an inn.

280
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,260
Then I'm not Baili Dongjun.

281
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm just the owner of a tavern.

282
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,480
 When you point your sword, make sure it's parallel to the ground.

283
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
 Wield!

284
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,820
 Back.

285
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,460
 Wield!

286
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,720
 Withdraw!

287
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,260
 Sister, I don't want to practice anymore.

288
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,400
 I want to stop practicing.

289
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,240
 - I don't want to practice anymore. 
 - Xiao Jie, get up.

290
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,220
 Xiao Jie, you're a good boy.

291
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,080
 There, there. Don't cry.

292
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,040
 Let's continue practicing, all right?

293
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,640
 Let's stand up and continue practicing. Is that all right?

294
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,280
 That's a good boy.

295
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,460
It's been 15 years.

296
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,020
I truly fail as an older sister.

297
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,400
You're awake?

298
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,460
Xiao Se.

299
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,000
Where's the owner?

300
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,780
He has already left. Went to search for a new recipe for liquor.

301
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,720
Search for a new recipe for liquor?

302
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,600
Who is he anyway?

303
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,300
Why do you care?

304
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,880
He helped you break through three phases of Fire Infusion.

305
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,860
You only need to remember that he's an expert and also a good person.

306
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,320
You're right.

307
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,420
Time to go to Dengtian Tower.

308
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,900
Go after having breakfast.

309
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,460
You're right. I'll have the strength after I ate.

310
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,140
Let's go. Time to have some breakfast.

311
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,300
We're going to go our separate ways soon.

312
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,780
I'll buy you the last breakfast.

313
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,960
Xiao Se, you sounded somber when you said that.

314
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
Not at all.

315
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,120
It's just going to be another long journey back.

316
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,220
When I think about it carefully, it's only for a mere 800 silver taels.

317
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,100
Here you go again.

318
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,960
I'll head to the tower first.

319
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,600
 Lei Yunhe?

320
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,240
 My martial uncle, Lei Yunhe?

321
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,320
 Why would he be in Xueyue City and become the Elder Keeper of the Tower?

322
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,520
 This is...

323
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,680
 Your clan leader, Lei Qianhu, knows about this as well.

324
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,900
 Many times did he send his men to bring him back home.

325
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,660
 But Elder Lei refused to see anyone from the Lei family.

326
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,040
 As for the reason, you'll know when you meet him.

327
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,300

328
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,460
Martial Uncle.

329
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm sure you're carrying the Shabu Sword.

330
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,480
You're Lei Hong's disciple.

331
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,760
I, Lei Wujie, greet Martial Uncle.

332
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,460
Did Lei Hong send you here to see me?

333
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,360
Tell him to stop wasting his time.

334
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,560
Martial Uncle, I did not come to Xueyue City to see you.

335
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,900
So you're here to upset me?

336
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,340
No, I...

337
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,720
I get it.

338
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,860
You're here to see that person.

339
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,740
All right.

340
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,600
I hope you can help me fulfill my wish.

341
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,480
If you want to see that person, you only need to defeat me.

342
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,080
Then, Martial Uncle,

343
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,200
forgive me for offending you.

344
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,840
You can't get past my 15th floor with your Fire Infusion.

345
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,000
Use your sword and let me see

346
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,400
what kind of swordsmanship Lei Hong practiced at the cost of violating the ancestral teaching.

347
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,700
Martial Uncle, watch carefully!

348
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,180
Thunderclap Finger?

349
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,840
You lost.

350
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,940
Get down.

351
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,760
I face the trials with the determination to win.

352
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,180
I ask that you don't hold back.

353
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,000
Shall we?

354
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,400
 This lad only reached the Hard Phase of Mortals.

355
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,500
 Yet, he's so hard to get rid of.

356
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
 Brother Hong, have you heard about the Top-Rank List?

357
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
 Are you talking about the list by Baixiao Sect?

358
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,180
 In the future, my name will be listed on that Top-Rank List.

359
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,340
 My name will be before yours.

360
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,020
 We shall see. I'll make a name for myself in this world!

361
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,740
Lad, don't push your luck.

362
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Maybe you're a genius among the young generation of the Lei Clan.

363
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,460
But after you enter the martial arts world, there are many people who can kill you instantly.

364
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,940
Don't be too arrogant.

365
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,760
I already know that.

366
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,680
On my journey to Xueyue City, I met countless experts,

367
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,620
seniors of the martial arts world,

368
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,280
mysterious people whose names I don't know,

369
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,180
and also the real genius of my peers that I'm far inferior to.

370
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,380
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

371
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,280
I, Lei Wujie, was defeated all the way here,

372
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,180
but I can afford to lose.

373
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,700
I believe as long as I'm alive,

374
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,920
I will win one day!

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,325
♫  Trekking millions of miles across the woodlands  ♫ 
 ♫  Dancing among the waves  ♫

376
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:23,460
♫  Melodious youth  ♫

377
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,878
♫  Dependent on the sword  ♫

378
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,534
♫  As devoted friends with strong bonds  ♫

379
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:31,220
♫  No dream is small  ♫

380
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,642
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

381
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:38,700
♫  Youths ought to be fearless  ♫

382
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,080
I hit him.

383
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,700
I hit him!

384
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,620
Good strike.

385
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,540
Thank you.

386
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,120
Martial Uncle, does that mean I...

387
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,820
Move aside.

388
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,119
♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

389
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,020
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

390
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,788
♫  I face the sun  ♫

391
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,880
♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫

392
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,173
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

393
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,460
So that's how it is.

394
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,320
My phase degraded not because of my serious injury,

395
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,480
but just because of a dispirited heart.

396
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,560
This reminds me of the youthful spirit.

397
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,220
This reminds me of that power.

398
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm the Nine Heavens Thunder

399
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,300
who shocked Heaven and Earth!

400
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,580
Who would have thought the keeper of the 15th floor was Lei Yunhe?

401
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,840
Lei Yunhe?

402
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,400
He's still alive?

403
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,040
Martial Uncle, is Lei Yunhe very famous?

404
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,160
I've never heard the elders talk about him before.

405
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,500
People from Mount Wangcheng naturally aren't willing to talk about him.

406
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,960
Lei Yunhe used to be known as the Nine Heavens Thunder,

407
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
who shocked heaven and earth.

408
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,980
Together with Lei Mengsha, Lei Qianhu, and Lei Hong, they were called the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan.

409
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,180
The most famous battle of that year was at Mount Wangcheng.

410
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,700
After Lei Yunhe ascended the mountain, he wanted to challenge Zhao Yuzhen to a fight.

411
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,580
 He first cut off the mountain path

412
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,180
 and overturned the Qiankun Hall in his second attack.

413
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,220
 As for his third attack, it went up against Zhao Yuzhen's Qingxiao Sword.

414
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,580
 But he had one arm chopped off by the sword.

415
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,220
He disappeared without a trace and never appeared in the martial arts world again.

416
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,860
It's said he died from serious injuries.

417
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,080
I didn't expect him to be hiding in Xueyue City.

418
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,740
As the Elder Keeper of the Tower in Xueyue City, given his capabilities,

419
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,620
it'll be even more difficult for a sword deity to defeat him.

420
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,980
Elder Lei was heavily wounded back then.

421
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,720
He may have survived.

422
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,220
But the phase of his martial arts has degraded.

423
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,240
At present, he's only in the Unrestrained Phase of Earth.

424
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,300
I see.

425
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,700
But it looks like he has got his phase back.

426
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,140
If that's the case, your best friend will be in trouble.

427
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,380
Brother Yunhe, congratulations on reentering the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

428
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,580
But we spent a lot of money to build the Dengtian Tower.

429
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,020
I ask you to hold back.

430
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,780
If you strike a bolt of lightning, Dengtian Tower can't take the damage.

431
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,780
So what if I split the Dengtian Tower?

432
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,500
Please.

433
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,120
Lad, you're not bad.

434
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,580
Martial Uncle, I don't deserve the praise.

435
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,000
Are you planning to go up the tower and bring that person to meet your master?

436
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,300
All right. I'll go with you when that happens.

437
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,000
A'Li!

438
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,980
Brother Yunhe, since you've restored your power, are you returning to the Lei family?

439
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,280
I'm too ashamed to return.

440
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,180
Why the same speech again?

441
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,480
I should pick up where I fell off.

442
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,680
Only then, I'll consider going home.

443
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,260
I split Mount Cang at the first strike and overturned Qiankun Hall at the second.

444
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,640
Instead of breaking Qingxiao Sword with my third strike, I ended up losing an arm.

445
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,120
Now that I'm back in the Carefree Phase of Heaven, how about I face the Qingxiao Sword again?

446
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,420
Are you planning to go to Mount Wangcheng?

447
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,800
A'Li, let's go!

448
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:26,280
In those days, when I formed a spear with the storm on top of this tower...

449
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,060
Did I have such a graceful demeanor?

450
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,580
Not even half.

451
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,080
So I lost.

452
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,120
The world calls me Spear Deity.

453
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
But I don't have the imposing manner where I can command the sky and ride a crane.

454
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,580
Elder Spear Deity.

455
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,160
Lei Wujie, are you going up the tower now?

456
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,980
I, Lei Wujie, came to Xueyue City to meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

457
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,220
I hope you'll fulfill my request.

458
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,740
All right.

459
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,360
Take this.

460
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,980
You'd better don't let her beat you down in a flash.

461
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,260
It won't happen.

462
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,320
 Why did Third City Lord and Mr. Tang come down?

463
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,600
 That's right.

464
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,220
Father! Senior Brother!

465
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,680
Why did they?

466
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,640
What's going on?

467
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,660
- Why are they here? 
 - No idea.

468
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,160
Why did you come down here?

469
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,380
I thought Lei Wujie was going up the tower.

470
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,700
He's here to meet someone.

471
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,980
He challenged the tower to meet someone?

472
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,580
Could that person be...

473
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,380
We'll just watch. It'll be interesting.

474
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,760
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong from the Lei Fortress,

475
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,360
wishes to challenge Xueyue City and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

476
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,340
He wants to meet Li Hanyi?

477
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,520
Is he for real?

478
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,260
 Is the Xueyue Sword Deity someone he can just meet?

479
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,980
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong from the Lei Fortress,

480
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,860
wishes to challenge Xueyue City and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

481
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,040
Father.

482
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,180
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong from the Lei Fortress,

483
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,680
wishes to challenge Xueyue City and meet Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi!

484
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,420
 That's embarrassing enough! Come down!

485
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,540
 Just come down!

486
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,120
 I've called out to her many times,

487
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,360
 but she doesn't even show up.

488
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,740
- Stop shouting! She's ignoring you! 
 -  It's quite embarrassing.

489
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,380
 Just get down here!

490
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,560
 Screw it!

491
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,080
 It wasn't easy to come up here.

492
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,240
 I must see her!

493
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,400
- Lei Wujie... 
 - Stop shouting!

494
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,100
You're so noisy!

495
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,040
Challenge Xueyue City?

496
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,860
With that butcher's sword in your hand?

497
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,540
It's Shabu Sword.

498
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,420
So here I am.

499
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,100
Draw your sword.

500
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,620
Let me see

501
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,500
what made you so confident about challenging Xueyue City.

502
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,000
All right.

503
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,340
I can't believe you're making a spectacle of oneself with these sideshows.

504
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,000
You learned your sword techniques from Lei Hong.

505
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,700
The moves are bold and unconstrained. They are indeed powerful.

506
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,400
You really need more solid basic skills.

507
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,660
Or else, they will be full of flaws.

508
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,680
I heard you learned the Formless Fist of the Lei family,

509
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,300
and you've also learned a set of fist techniques from Tian Wai Tian's Young Master.

510
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,520
With Fire Infusion, two fist techniques, and one secret art,

511
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,660
how much can you focus on practicing your sword?

512
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Is this how that scoundrel Lei Hong taught you?

513
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,500
Master said it's better to learn more skills as we journey the martial arts world.

514
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,880
Nonsense!

515
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,280
When you travel the martial arts world, it's already enough to master one skill.

516
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,820
Watch closely!

517
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,820
My Dengtian Tower!

518
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,940
Li Hanyi, you scoundrel!

519
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,980
Scoundrel!

520
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
Go!

521
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,920
So this is the power of Sword Deity's one strike.

522
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,540
Are you all right?

523
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm good.

524
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,940
- You are...? 
 - My name is Li Fansong.

525
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,020
I'm here to challenge the Dengtian Tower too.

526
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,600
Nice meeting you.

527
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,120
So this is the power of the Sword Deity.

528
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
It really gives me goosebumps.

529
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,820
I really want to take this blow for myself.

530
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,880
You'll have the chance.

531
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,020
I'll be going off now!

532
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,460
I ask Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity, for a challenge!

533
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,880
But I'm the one challenging the tower now.

534
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,840
If you want to challenge the Sword Deity, you need to start from the first floor!

535
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,120
Li Fansong, the disciple of Zhao Yuzhen, came from Mount Wangcheng to Xueyue City

536
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,700
to challenge Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity.

537
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,320
Please grant me guidance, the Xueyue Sword Deity.

538
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Ruthless Sword.

539
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,960
It's Infinite Sword!

540
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,460
Get down!

541
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,900
- Li Hanyi, I'm going to get you for this! 
 - Father!

542
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,920
- Third Master. 
 - Don't stop me!

543
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,560
- Father 
 - Li Hanyi!

544
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,740
My Dengtian Tower!

545
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,060
Go!

546
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,160
Li Hanyi, pay me back my Dengtian Tower!

547
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,380
I'll make you pay for it!

548
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,400
My Dengtian Tower, Qianluo.

549
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,180
Li Hanyi, wait there!

550
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,020
I'll get you for this!

551
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,340
Are you all right?

552
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,220
It hurts.

553
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,500
I can't beat her.

554
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,440
You're right about that.

555
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
How about

556
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,480
we fight her together?

557
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,100
Sure, we'll fight her together.

558
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,920
Lei Wujie, the disciple of Lei Hong from the Lei Fortress, asks to challenge Xueyue City.

559
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,780
Li Fansong, the disciple of Zhao Yuzhen, is also here to challenge Xueyue Sword Deity.

♫  The freezing rain blurred my vision  ♫

562
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,060
Sword Deity, please wait.

563
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,020
I still have a technique.

564
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,360
I ask you to accept it.

565
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,600
I have one technique too.

566
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,580

567
