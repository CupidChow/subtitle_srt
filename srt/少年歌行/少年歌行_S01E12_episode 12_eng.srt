22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,050

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,070

24
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,470
 Your Highness.

25
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,360
 Who are you?

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,380
 The Azure Dragon?

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,480
 Li Xinyue, is this a mutiny?

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,710
 It was never my intention,

29
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,030
 but Your Majesty forced me.

30
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,080
 - You're crazy. 
 - Take her down!

31
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,990
 Your Highness, Ye Xiaoying has gathered 30,000 Langya Army.

32
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,330
 One order from you and they will draw their swords.

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,550
 Your Highness.

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,760
 The 800,000 Langya Army in Beili is waiting for your order.

35
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,340
 Azure Dragon, after training in solitude,

36
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,110
 I see you have mastered Sword Heart Technique.

37
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,960
 Powerful as that technique might be,

38
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,080
 it is naive of you to think

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,710
 that you can rescue him alone.

40
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,450
 State Preceptor, what did you see?

41
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,270
 I saw a sword qi.

42
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,420
 Sword qi?

43
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,330
 It can destroy ten thousand cities.

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,920
 What kind of sword can destroy ten thousand cities?

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,130
 I am the Emperor.

46
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,240
 I will not surrender to a mortal's sword.

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,600
 The sword of a sword deity can destroy ten thousand cities.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
 Sword deity?

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,400
 She is here. Your Majesty, be careful!

50
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,410
 - Who are you? 
 - Li Hanyi, how dare you!

51
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,160
 Just because you are a sword deity now doesn't mean you are invincible.

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,640
 The Second City Lord of Xueyue City.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,470
 The daughter of Azure Dragon.

54
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,120
 Speak. What do you want?

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,640
 I want to take them with me.

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,260
 Sure. But only one of them.

57
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,200
 Xinyue. Do not sacrifice in vain.

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,310
 Live your life.

59
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,930
 I count on you to take care of the rest.

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,340
 My dear brother...

61
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,700
 Your Highness!

62
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,030
That's all?

63
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Although it's unfair, Prince Langya did die in that conflict.

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,830
My mother was badly injured,

65
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,660
and she passed away

66
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,240
shortly after she left with me.

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,860
So among the imperial family, no one defended Prince Langya at all?

68
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,510
There was someone.

69
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,250
 The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe.

70
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,700
 Prince Langya groomed him personally.

71
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,330
 And at a young age, he attained the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

72
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,690
 Many people thought he was the best candidate to inherit the throne.

73
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,320
After Prince Langya was imprisoned, Xiao Chuhe alone fought for his cause.

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,200
He pointed out the 13 inconsistencies in Prince Langya's mutiny accusation.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,490
 His speech was passionate and moving.

76
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,830
 Some senior ministers even shed tears.

77
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,050
After Prince Langya passed away, the Sixth Prince still worked hard to clear his name.

78
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,590
But that angered His Majesty and the Prince was demoted to a commoner.

79
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,180
He was then exiled to Qingzhou.

80
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,400
Perhaps Prince Langya already knew what was coming.

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,040
 So one month before his death,

82
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,660
he asked Tianqi's Four Guardians to promise him something.

83
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,340
What is it?

84
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,410
He asked the keepers of the Four Guardians' Tokens

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,260
to continue their duty,

86
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,460
to protect the one who holds the future of the dynasty.

87
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,030
The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe?

88
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,500
Yes.

89
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,120
Mother's passing filled me with so much pain,

90
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,430
so I didn't take this seriously.

91
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,460
But I saw you unsheathe Tingyu Sword.

92
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,270
And I knew you're like my mother.

93
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,310
You draw your sword to protect.

94
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,770
Of course, you have the right to refuse to take this token.

95
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,870
If that is our mother's last wish, I will do it.

96
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,280
Besides, the Sixth Prince is a virtuous man.

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,830
- I respect him. 
 - Good.

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,830
From today onward, you are the East of Tianqi's Four Guardians, the Azure Dragon.

99
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,100
I won't let our mother down.

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,950
Oh, Sister. You said he was exiled.

101
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,820
Where should I go to seek the Sixth Prince?

102
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,440
You don't know?

103
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,490
Should I know?

104
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,390
He is not much older than you.

105
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,400
After he was deposed,

106
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,700
he was ambushed by his enemy and he lost his martial prowess.

107
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,760
After that, he went missing.

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,750
Missing?

109
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,950
Then, I have to look everywhere.

110
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,240
It's all right. No need to know all that.

111
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,570
Perhaps following the current path will lead to the best outcome.

112
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,010
Sister, what are you saying?

113
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,040
Nothing.

114
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,680
No need to find him. Trust me.

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,990
When he is in real danger, you will be by his side.

116
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,340
That dummy...

117
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,740
I hope Li Hanyi did not pass the Azure Dragon Token to him.

118
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,440
Greetings, Imperial Father.

119
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,260
Chong'er, you're here.

120
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,630
Come on. Have a seat.

121
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,400
Thanks, Imperial Father.

122
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,970
Chong'er.

123
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,360
Among my sons, you are the most reliable one.

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,500
Have some tea.

125
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,260
And I trust you the most.

126
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,500
Keep it up.

127
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,490
But I am worried about your eyesight.

128
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,740
Did those imperial physicians find you better treatment?

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,480
Imperial Father, I have been taking herbal broth.

130
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,570
For years, I can only see shadows.

131
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,470
I will ask them to look for more competent physicians.

132
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,860
Chong'er. One day, your eyesight will return.

133
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,440
Thank you, Imperial Father.

134
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,930
Oh, Imperial Father.

135
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,990
May I know why you asked for my presence?

136
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,530
I heard the hostage from Tian Wai Tian went back.

137
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,370
It's been 12 years.

138
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,280
By right, he should head back.

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,830
Imperial Father, wasn't this handled by Eunuch Jade Deity?

140
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,600
If he agreed to let him leave,

141
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,400
he must have thought that the hostage no longer poses a threat to Beili.

142
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,900
He's just a kid.

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,000
He can't possibly cook up a big storm.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
That's not my concern.

145
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,900
But I received news

146
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,400
that he was accompanied by someone.

147
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,400
And it looks like this someone is Chuhe.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Chuhe?

149
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,000
It must be a lie.

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Chuhe will not collude with the son of the Demon Sect.

151
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,870
That's not my concern either.

152
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,700
Father, I don't get it.

153
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,000
I searched for Chuhe for many years to no avail.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,700
And now, there is someone who's similar to him.

155
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,200
It doesn't matter who his companion is.

156
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,500
Jade Deity said the heir of the Demon Sect is elegant.

157
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,400
Not unlike Old Six.

158
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,930
It's not hard to imagine that they become friends.

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,900
You mean you want me to verify its veracity?

160
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,630
Yes.

161
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,010
Chong'er.

162
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,870
Will you help me?

163
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
I will.

164
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,510
If the rumor is proven true, I will do my best to bring Old Six back.

165
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,900
Okay.

166
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,200
Chong'er. Carry this message, too.

167
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
Tell him that as long as he comes back,

168
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,200
I can pardon him.

169
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,300
I will reinstate him as a prince.

170
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,900
I can even give his princeship back.

171
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,800
When he returns, he'll be Prince Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

172
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,510
Noted.

173
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,025

174
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Why don't you have any reaction?

175
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,000
It's only been a day. Why did you run away again?

176
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,100
After I blocked three slashes from my sister, I no longer need to train on Mount Cang.

177
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,000
She said I only need to train for a few hours every day,

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
I can roam freely in Xueyue City afterward.

179
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,000
After she took off her mask and you two reunited, she starts pampering you.

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Older sisters never change, do they?

181
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Even the Xueyue Sword Deity is still bound by mortal desires.

182
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Why aren't you surprised by the fact that my sister is the Xueyue Sword Deity?

183
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Why should I? You're from the Lei Clan.

184
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Li Hanyi is the daughter of Lei Mengsha.

185
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,200
You two should be relatives, to begin with.

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
I just don't know how close or how distant.

187
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,400
Rumor has it that Li Xinyue, the heiress of Heart Sword Tomb, is one of the Four Beauties and is very smart.

188
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,980
How did she give birth to an idiot like you?

189
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,300
Well, I guess it's all thanks to my father.

190
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,600
How is he?

191
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,900
In war, he donned silver armor and rode a fine steed.

192
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,060
He inspired fear.

193
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,390
And in his daily life?

194
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,100
Talkative and bratty.

195
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,800
For Lord Langya, he was a pain in the bum.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
So I am my father.

197
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
No. I took after my father.

198
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,500
Hanyi took after my mother.

199
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
So why did you come here?

200
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,800
Oh, right.

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,500
You weren't surprised by the fact that my sister is Xueyue Sword Deity.

202
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,600
But this thing will definitely blow your mind.

203
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Really? I know many things,

204
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,900
so I don't get surprised easily.

205
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,000
Sister Qianluo is getting married.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,800
See? Surprised?

207
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
Who said that?

208
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,100
My sister, of course.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,700
So Qianluo has been busy looking for suitors?

210
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
What suitors?

211
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,300
She is busy practicing martial arts.

212
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,200
Lei Wujie, I am not used to the conversational dynamics now.

213
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,100
It feels like we swapped positions.

214
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,600
You are supposed to be the idiot.

215
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,950
I just didn't want to steal your thunder.

216
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Anyway, let me finish this.

217
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,100
It began three years ago.

218
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,900
When Sister Qianluo reached adulthood, the Young Master of Jiangnan's Duan family came to propose.

219
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
The leaders from ten sects,

220
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,000
the entire Duan family, and three horse carriages worth of bride price came to Xueyue City.

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,600
The Third City Lord did not like that Duan kid, of course.

222
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,830
And so, he came out with a plan to buy some time.

223
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,300
A tournament?

224
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,700
I thought you didn't know.

225
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
I can deduce with my brain.

226
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,300
You're right.

227
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,800
It's a tournament that would take place in three days.

228
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,800
If it's a tournament, why is Sikong Qianluo practicing martial arts?

229
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,900
Because she added a rule.

230
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Her husband has to be able to defeat her.

231
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,900
The Duan family wasn't too happy.

232
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,400
They said a woman should be soft-spoken and graceful.

233
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,300
She shouldn't be obsessed with swords and spears.

234
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,000
And so, the rule was slightly modified.

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,900
If a disciple of Xueyue City wins the tournament, he has to defeat Senior Sister too.

236
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,810
I see now.

237
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,800
She doesn't want to marry anyone at all.

238
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,600
She wants the disciples of Xueyue City to win first before defeating them herself.

239
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes. Exactly.

240
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
All of you always slack on your training.

241
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,400
You crumble down when you need to fight.

242
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,300
Not only does Senior Sister train very hard,

243
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,800
but she helps others in their training too.

244
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,700
She can easily defeat that Duan fellow.

245
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I saw him fight that day.

246
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,000
His final hidden weapon gave Tang Lian a hard time,

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but that was because Tang Lian didn't want to hurt him.

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
So he went easy on him.

249
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,800
In terms of skillfulness, Tang Lian is way better than him.

250
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Did someone compliment me?

251
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,560
Senior Brother.

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,900
I was stating a fact.

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,700
Your young lady is in a pickle now.

254
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,900
As her senior brother, shouldn't you intervene?

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,800
I can't.

256
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Why not?

257
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,380
If I do, it will just be a duel between Qianluo and me.

258
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,700
Knowing Xueyue City's rules and Qianluo's personality,

259
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,200
I cannot go easy on her in public like I did to Lei Wujie in Dengtian Tower.

260
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,900
Besides, all these years, Qianluo and I are like siblings.

261
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,340
I can't possibly marry her.

262
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,610
Excuses.

263
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,400
You just don't want Fairy Rui to find out

264
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,700
that you're participating in this tournament because that might ruin your relationship with her.

265
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
You... Say that again and I'll hit you.

266
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,200
I believe in Senior Brother.

267
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,600
You know me the best, Wujie.

268
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,800
What do you believe in?

269
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
That he loves Fairy Rui.

270
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
You need a beating too, it seems.

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,300
I'll keep my mouth shut.

272
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,900
Wait.

273
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,800
I can't go, but you can, Lei Wujie.

274
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,500
I can't.

275
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,900
Why?

276
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,800
I... Well...

277
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,100
I'll be frank.

278
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,300
If Miss Ruoyi knows about this, she'll think that I'm in love with Sister Qianluo.

279
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,100
It'll be hard to explain the whole situation.

280
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,300
You're overthinking.

281
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm sure Miss Ye doesn't care.

282
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,370
What if she does?

283
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,050
What are you talking about?

284
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,300
Lei Wujie here wants to fight you.

285
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,700
It's none of your business.

286
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,500
Qianluo.

287
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,400
- Stay there! 
 - Qianluo.

288
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
A thought came to my mind, Lei Wujie.

289
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Senior Brother.

290
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,200
After seeing this, I share the same thought too.

291
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,550
Don't you run, Xiao Se.

292
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,800
Why are they fighting again?

293
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,900
It has begun again after several days of peace.

294
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh, this daughter of mine...

295
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,990
I beg to differ.

296
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,600
At her age, the more she likes someone, the more she wants his attention.

297
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,100
Unfortunately, I do not have a solution for the tournament that will begin in three days.

298
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,800
Pull a cheeky act then.

299
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,400
The Principal City Lord always does that.

300
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
You can try.

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,600
He can afford to be shameless because I am dealing with his mess.

302
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,700
If I do that, Xueyue City will lose its entire reputation.

303
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,100
So you want to marry Qianluo off then?

304
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,500
She will marry whomever she likes.

305
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,300
I will handle this then.

306
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,400
The way I see it, the only one who can fight her in Xueyue City is your disciple, Luo Mingxuan.

307
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Master. What brought you to Dengtian Tower?

308
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm here to check if my good discipline is training properly.

309
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,500
Don't worry, Master.

310
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
I have been studying this Liubo Puzzle

311
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,200
and I'm getting some ideas now.

312
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm sure I can decode the sword technique within.

313
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,100
I know they are all boastful and whatnot.

314
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,400
But when I become a sword deity, I'll make you proud.

315
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
You can make me proud now.

316
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,100
Do you want to know how?

317
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,700
Master, are you saying I should take part in Sister Qianluo's tournament?

318
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
I don't like her.

319
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,000
And she wields a mean spear. It scares me.

320
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,600
What's there to be afraid of?

321
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
She's a girl.

322
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,300
When she has a husband, she turns meek.

323
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,500
Back then, Qianluo's mother was so powerful.

324
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,200
Once she caught up to Sikong Changfeng, she kicked him off his steed.

325
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,000
But then, she became the most beautiful and graceful woman in Xueyue City.

326
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,580
But I think you're more beautiful than her.

327
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,230
Nonsense.

328
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,920
When you became my disciple, her mother already passed away.

329
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,780
You have never seen her before.

330
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,500
Tell me.

331
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,650
Why you don't want to fight?

332
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,610
I'm already in love with someone.

333
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,270
You are?

334
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,790
Why didn't you tell me?

335
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,200
I see now, Luo Mingxuan.

336
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,990
- You are in love, but you won't tell me. 
 - Master...

337
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,700
No, Master...

338
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,700
The one I'm in love with isn't in love with me.

339
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,540
Calm down, Master.

340
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,820
Tell me now. Who is that girl?

341
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,900
I'll help you out.

342
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,220
It's still too early, Master. Stop asking me.

343
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,430
I have to train. Don't disturb me.

344
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,520
Sikong Changfeng asked me to do this.

345
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,110
I have no other option.

346
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,470
You know what?

347
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,420
Defeat others and then lose to Qianluo.

348
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,920
That will work?

349
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,030
Yes. Just one small mistake and you lose.

350
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,990
You return so soon？

351
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,370
It's settled.

352
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,260
Good.

353
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,470
Why?

354
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,000
Why are you upset?

355
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,160
Not because of it.

356
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,080
What happened?

357
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,830
A special guest is visiting Xueyue City.

358
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,400
What special guest can make you sulk?

359
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,660
Because the name of this special guest is...

360
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,540

361
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,560
Xiao.

362
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,740
Xueyue City must have received my letter.

363
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,020
Your Highness.

364
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,270
Do you think Xueyue City will hide Xiao Chuhe away when they receive the letter?

365
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,530
Perhaps, but knowing Chuhe,

366
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,830
he won't go into hiding again.

367
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,800
But he has remained hidden for many years.

368
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,610
Since he's decided to set foot in Xueyue City,

369
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,370
it means he doesn't care if he's found out nor is he ready to surrender.

370
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,220
Your Highness, are you truly bringing Xiao Chuhe back to Tianqi City?

371
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,820
I carry my father's message.

372
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,260
But...

373
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,160
Just be forthcoming.

374
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,050
I know you are loyal, Your Highness.

375
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,580
But please reconsider this.

376
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,200
Why does Xiao Chuhe reappear at this precise timing?

377
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,840
Why does Sikong Changfeng want to take him in as a disciple?

378
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,310
Xueyue City used to serve Prince Langya.

379
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,920
I'm sure Xiao Chuhe will make use of this.

380
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,360
I do not wish to be out of line,

381
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,670
but Xiao Chuhe's objective of usurpation cannot be more apparent.

382
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,950
If he returns to Tianqi City...

383
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,940
There are many things that I cannot change.

384
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,240
Besides, maybe that person isn't Chuhe.

385
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,160
Maybe it's just a normal innkeeper, Xiao Se.

386
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,500
Your Highness!

387
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,890
Get up.

388
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,390
Send another letter to Xueyue City.

389
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,960
Tell them our arrival is not to be interrupted or announced.

390
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,310
We will sneak into the city

391
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,410
and meet Xiao Se in private.

392
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,500

393
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,470
Sikong Qianluo is getting stronger by the day.

394
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,220
You could have dodged it. Why did you give up?

395
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,440
If I dodged it, my sleeve would be torn.

396
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,290
This sleeve costs 200 silver taels.

397
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,530
You would rather die just to save your sleeve?

398
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,120
The Dragon Needles tell me Senior Brother is here.

399
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,240
Why should I fight?

400
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,550
Besides, I was being hunted all day long.

401
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,260
Do I have to run away from my home now too?

402
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,800
I know your lightness technique is amazing.

403
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,780
But the small test just now tells me that your reflexes are quick and accurate.

404
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,300
You just lack the inner force.

405
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,570
Why are you bringing this up?

406
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,610
Lian and I made a decision.

407
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,360
Stop. I reject your decision.

408
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,730
We haven't even said it. You can't say no yet.

409
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,740
I already guessed it.

410
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,380
We have been through a lot on our journey here.

411
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,020
Senior Brother, don't play the sentimental card.

412
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:17,140
Boss Xiao, we just hope you can make a little sacrifice for the friendship of our Xueyue Four Heroes.

413
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,850
Four Heroes of Xueyue?

414
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,910
I made it up.

415
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,540
It's awful.

416
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,180
 Trust me. Our plan is foolproof.

417
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,260
It is perfect.

418
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,150

419
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,290
Attack! Hit him.

420
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,500
Are you here to spectate?

421
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,830
We still can spectate now.

422
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,900
In a while, we'll have to fight.

423
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,760
Qianluo, any one of them tickles your fancy?

424
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,550
They can't even take three hits from me.

425
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,630
Martial prowess is not the only criterion to choose a husband.

426
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,460
- What about their looks? 
 - Their looks?

427
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,220
Even Lei Wujie looks way better than them.

428
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,780
The winner goes to Xueyue.

429
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,530
Elder Brother, look at them.

430
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,500
They are no match for me.

431
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,770
I shall end this boring game.

432
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,120
Let me prep everything for you.

433
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,490
- Who is he?
 - Duan Xuanheng, Second Young Master Duan.

434
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,330
He's swift.

435
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,390
The winner goes to Duan Xuanheng.

436
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,780

437
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,710
Which sect are you from, if I may ask?

438
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,460
Oh, the esteemed guest. Third City Lord has told us.

439
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,080
Please come in and rest up.

440
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,050
Is there a grand event in Xueyue City today?

441
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,920
Why is the street empty?

442
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,760
The daughter of the Third City Lord is holding a tournament in search of a suitor.

443
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,740
Everyone went to spectate it.

444
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,990
The Third City Lord should be in the arena now watching it.

445
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,820
- A tournament?  
 - That's right.

446
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,580
- Zang Ming. 
 - Yes.

447
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,690
We definitely have to join in this fun.

448
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,130
Okay.

449
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,710
Let's go.

450
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,130
Careful.

451
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,850
Xiao Se. Go down now.

452
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,550
Fighting people like him will only dirty my hands.

453
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,830
But if you don't go now, it'll be too late.

454
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,600
Exactly. Look.

455
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,520
- Anyone else? 
 - No one is challenging him.

456
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,680
- Xiao Se!  
 - Go train for a few more years.

457
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,460
Luo Mingxuan?

458
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,830
I am the disciple of the prettiest elder in Xueyue City, Yin Luoxia.

459
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,470
I am Luo Mingxuan. Here to challenge you.

460
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,830
So Luo Mingxuan secretly admires Sister Qianluo.

461
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,340
He intervenes when the moment calls for it.

462
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,270
It's really touching.

463
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,900
Indeed.

464
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,890
I didn't see this coming.

465
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,340
Luo Mingxuan has been following his master,

466
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,480
and he hardly talks to us.

467
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,670
What a surprise. What a surprise.

468
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,560
Let's watch his performance then.

469
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,660
You look confident.

470
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,300
Should we have a bet?

471
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,700
I bet that I'll win.

472
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,400
100 silver taels.

473
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,150
Sure.

474
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,890
I bet that you'll die.

475
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,440
200 taels.

476
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,440
Xiao Se. Who do you think will win?

477
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,620
- Bravo, Luo! 
 - Luo Mingxuan.

478
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,670
Why? He isn't using a weapon. That's bad.

479
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,630
Luo Mingxuan studies Luoxia Splitting Palm.

480
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,780
It can split a river, let alone a normal long sword.

481
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,620
Right.

482
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,800
It seems like Luo Mingxuan will marry Sister Qianluo. What a shame.

483
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,920
Why are you lamenting?

484
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,030
I want to see you marry Sister Qianluo.

485
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,120
You two are perfect together.

486
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,920
Look. Sister Qianluo is righteous. And you are cunning.

487
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,890
If the two of you are together, it'll be a perfect balance.

488
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,500
Scram.

489
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,970
As expected of Brother Luo. Right?

490
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,770
The winner goes to Luo Mingxuan.

491
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,670
Thank you. Thanks.

492
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,950
I'm Duan Xuanyi from the Duan family.

493
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,470
Greetings.

494
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,060
He is here too.

495
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,400
Is he strong?

496
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,720
Among our generation, only Tang Lian can certainly defeat him.

497
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,750
But judging from Luo Mingxuan's palm just now, he can win too

498
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,480
Young Master Duan. Your reputation precedes you.

499
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,090
You defeated my brother.

500
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,470
I am kind of impressed.

501
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,030
But you can't defeat me.

502
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,810
 What is happening?

503
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,030
What is happening?

504
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,820
Luo Mingxuan was poisoned.

505
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,130
Something is wrong with Mingxuan.

506
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,950
Brother Mingxuan! Are you all right?

507
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,530
Come on.

508
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,120
Master.

509
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,140
How are you feeling?

510
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,150
Sorry.

511
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,520
I was careless.

512
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,770
So the Elder of Xueyue City can take part in the tournament too?

513
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,640
I surrender on my disciple's behalf.

514
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,730
The winner goes to Duan Xuanyi.

515
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,980
Elder Yin. Let me have a look.

516
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,720
The poison is called Three-Cun Snake Venom.
 (TN: Cun is a traditional Chinese unit of length)

517
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,280
It is not fatal.

518
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,530
Elder Yin, don't worry.

519
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,160
I will detoxify him in an hour.

520
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,580
I'm counting on you.

521
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,990
Is there anybody else who is willing to compete?

522
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,030
How dare a despicable and shameless person speak so arrogantly

523
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,370
Well, if Senior Luo lost to him too,

524
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,940
who among us could defeat him?

525
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,240
That's right.

526
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,300
Shame on him. He used poison.

527
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,350
Your Highness. We might have arrived late.

528
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,210
Is it over already?

529
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,420
It seems that way.

530
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,960
I don't think there'll be another challenger.

531
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,500
Qianluo.

532
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,860
Duan Xuanyi is not a disciple of Xueyue City.

533
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,690
You cannot challenge him.

534
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,910
But, Father, he used poison.

535
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,760
It isn't against the rules to use poison.

536
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,170
Besides, Duan Xuanyi didn't poison him.

537
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,490
It was from the previous challenger, Duan Xuanheng.

538
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,990
You... Why did you get down?

539
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,290
You two asked me to.

540
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,160
No.

541
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,790
Knowing you, it'll take a lot of begging from us before you get down reluctantly.

542
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,220
Shut up.

543
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,360
No way. Why would he challenge him?

544
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,860
Who?

545
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,470
Who are you?

546
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,180
Xiao Se of Snowfall Mountain Villa.

547
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,860
You are the disciple of the Spear Deity, Xiao Se?

548
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,990
If you say so.

549
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,570
Your Highness, we have an answer to one of our questions already.

550
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,850
Did Chuhe step in?

551
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,350
Yes.

552
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:56,380
The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe, is attending a tournament in Xueyue City.

553
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,410
The one using a fan doesn't sound very strong.

554
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,930
Why does Chuhe keep dodging then?

555
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,630
I don't get it.

556
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,100
24 Fan Blades.

557
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,020
Your lightness technique is exceptional and your knowledge is broad.

558
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,230
Unfortunately, you can't defeat me by dodging.

559
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,480
That we shall see.

560
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,710
The Walking on Clouds of the Sixth Prince has improved,

561
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,910
but I do not feel any inner force from him.

562
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,820
Does that mean his martial skills were truly crippled?

563
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,770
I now understand your movement.

564
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,740
You will lose within the next ten attacks.

565
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,400
Try me.

566
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,410
Explosives from the Lei Clan.

567
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,120
One will stun you.

568
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,920
Two will send you home.

569
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,630
 Keep bragging. We are sending you home.

570
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,290
 Say that again? Mind your mouth.

571
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,290
- Just go home. 
 - You're cheating.

572
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,850
You used the firearm from the Lei Clan.

573
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,490
You used poison.

574
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,900
So shut up.

575
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,180
You...

576
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,760
Xiao Se. Use all those explosives.

577
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,050
Sure.

578
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,820
I used too many of them, so there are only two left.

579
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,740
Die now!

580
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,690
Beautiful!

581
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,740
Good.

582
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,440
That was an amazing usage of Death Letter.

583
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,760
Come on.

584
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,740
 Senior Brother and I discussed it.

585
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,960
 We decided to lend you our weapons so that you can have the upper hand and win it.

586
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,630
 What weapons?

587
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,420
 Both of my bombs and three Death Letters from Senior Brother.

588
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,640
 They are worth 1,000 silver taels.

589
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,570
 For the next three days, Senior Brother and I will teach you how to use explosives and hidden weapons.

590
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,640
 You are the best lightness technique user in the world.

591
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,310
 And now, you're equipped with Lei Clan's explosives and Tang Clan's hidden weapons.

592
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,440
 No one can defeat you.

593
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,780
 Exactly.

594
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,200
24 Fan Blades.

595
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,580
23 of them are on the front, representing grace.

596
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,620
One blade is on the rear.

597
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,550
It's called Mortality.

598
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,840
The end of grace is mortality.

599
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,470
And you lack grace.

600
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,140
Who are you?

601
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,320
Xiao Se of Snowfall Mountain Villa. The one who defeated you.

602
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,870
The winner goes to Xiao Se of Xueyue City.

603
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He actually won?

604
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,380
Yes, he did.

605
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,440
He fought wonderfully too.

606
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,270
Chuhe can always do the unexpected.

607
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,800
Even in the bleakest of situations, he can still turn the tide.

608
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,640
Your Highness. He cannot win.

609
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,890
Are you worried that he will ally with Xueyue City with this marriage?

610
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,090
If he forges an alliance with Xueyue City as Xiao Se,

611
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,790
his power will grow out of our control,

612
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,760
when we bring him the news that His Majesty is ready to pardon him.

613
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,990
Xiao Se. You did very well.

614
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,410
I didn't expect your compliment, Miss Sikong.

615
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,270
Your Highness, a prince's marriage should be decided in the ancestral shrine.

616
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,950
He cannot decide on his own.

617
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,790
But he is now Xiao Se,

618
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,540
not a prince.

619
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,580
Your Highness. When you deliver His Majesty's message, he'll become Xiao Chuhe.

620
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:55,720
I just want to know the final outcome of this tournament.

621
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,190
 All the best, Sister Qianluo.

622
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,390
 Good luck!

623
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,160
- Sister Qianluo! 
 - All the best, Xiao Se!

624
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,420
- You can do this, Sister Qianluo. 
 - Sister Qianluo!

625
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,790
You defeated them,

626
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,820
but you still have to fight my spear.

627
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,860
I admit defeat.

628
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,770
This kid, can't he play along even though he completed his mission?

629
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,450
Zang Ming.

630
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,850
Chuhe surely does the unexpected.

631
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,520
So full of surprises.

632
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,430
Xiao Se! What is going on?

633
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,360
I lost.

634
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,940
But the fight hasn't even begun. How did you lose?

635
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,900
I used all the explosives and hidden weapons you gave me.

636
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,320
How am I supposed to fight now?

637
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,760
Sister Qianluo will go easy on you.

638
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,800
Lei Wujie. Don't spout nonsense.

639
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
No one will go easy on him.

640
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,890
A rigged match in Xueyue City!

641
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,590
 Mind your mouth.

642
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,480
 A rigged match is unacceptable.

643
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,870
 - Who rigged the match? 
 - How can Xueyue City do this?

644
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,870
How is this a rigged match?

645
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,270
 Rigged?

646
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,680
Shut up now, you losers.

647
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,390
How annoying.

648
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,110
The tournament is over.

649
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,570
Take it as you wish.

650
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,590
Let's go.

651
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,690
Stop them. Xueyue City has to give us an answer.

652
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,420
Zang Ming, since the final outcome is out now,

653
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,930
help them out, will you?

654
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,090
Prince Bai of Beili Kingdom has arrived.

655
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,420
Kneel before His Highness.

Xiao Se!

658
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,580
Long time no see, Vermilion Bird.

659
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:55,030

660
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,450
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

661
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,780
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

662
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,950
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

663
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:15,580
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

670
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,600
♫  I face the sun  ♫

671
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,750

♫  No dream is small  ♫

677
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,450
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

678
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,700
