23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,980

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,340
I was so close.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,400
Don't make it sound like I can't do anything right.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,290
Do you know why you fail at the last step?

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,410
Why?

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
I'm the last step to success.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,950
You only sent Bai Xiao Sect to intercept Prince Chi. How would that be enough?

30
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,720
Therefore, he came back way earlier than you expected.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,670
If you had sent me, they wouldn't have made it back in time.

32
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,100
See, you can't answer it, can you?

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,510
Sister Ruoyi, what do you think?

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,380
Where is Lei Wujie?

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,100
I will find him for you.

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,590
Ruo...

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,720
You tell me.

38
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,590
Look at you. You scare people away every time.

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,250
Sit down.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,940
I was thinking about it last night. Finally, I figured it out.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,100
You didn't let me go because you were afraid I'd be in danger, right?

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,740
Yes. You've been in danger because you were afraid I'd be in danger, right?

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,210
Things in Tianqi City will be over soon.

44
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,220
Afterward, you can go back to Xueyue City without worries.

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,710
But you saw it too.

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,020
If it weren't for me, you'd all have been in danger.

47
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,230
If you leave me out again, I will really get mad.

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,480
You know what happens when I get mad.

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,270
You will be in even more danger then.

50
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,060
Xiao Se,

51
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,810
actually, even if I don't go back to Xueyue City, it's fine.

52
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,270
As long as I can stay in the same place as you,

53
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,460
anywhere is fine for me.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,860
Xiao Se, do you hear me?

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,800
Yes.

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,820
What? The Leader is dead?

57
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,500
Near Prince Chi's Residence yesterday, the head of the Su family, Su Muyu, Lei Wujie,

58
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,180
Li Fansong and Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng, as well as Fairy Lady Rui of Xueyue City,

59
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,520
joined forces and ambushed the Leader.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,490
The Leader was wounded by Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst and died at the hands of Su Muyu

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,080
Useless!

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,290
They are all useless!

63
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,230
Calm down, Your Highness.

64
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,090
What about the rest of Dark River?

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,730
The other forces in Dark River have retreated, leaving only a few drugged subjects,

66
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,440
hidden in secret chambers, unawakened.

67
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,080
Darn it.

68
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,860
I want you to deliver two letters, one to Nanjue.

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,120
Since Xiao Chuhe dared to release the fake news that the envoy of Nanjue had entered Tianqi City,

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,300
it means he already knew that I was in contact with Ao Yu.

71
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,580
In that case, we have to speed things up.

72
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,620
Tell the one in Nanjue to make a move at the best time.

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,500
It's just that when is the best time?

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,660
The best time is the day my godfather enters the city.

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,080
So, the second letter will be sent to Muliang City.

76
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,320
Why did you call me back so urgently?

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,540
We received a letter from Leader Ji.

78
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,280
Father?

79
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,150

80
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,600
- Luo Qingyang left the city? 
 - Yes.

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Luo Qingyang left Muliang City five days ago, heading in the direction of Tianqi.

82
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,650
Given his speed, won't he reach Tianqi soon?

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,630
Luo Qingyang is Prince Chi's godfather.

84
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,560
Prince Chi must've asked him to come.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,340
Looks like Prince Chi wants to fall out completely, so he's asked Lone Sword Deity to attack the city.

86
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,630
Xiao Se, how strong is Lone Sword Deity among the Five Sword Deities?

87
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,530
Compared to Zhao Yuzhen, he is only stronger.

88
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,440
But Luo Qingyang is aloof and arrogant.

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,790
He won't obey Prince Chi easily.

90
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,060
Prince Chi must've asked him here to take someone away.

91
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,920
He will fight with all his might. This is the most troubling part.

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,790
Who is he taking away?

93
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,520
Consort Xuan.

94
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,820
There are rumors in the martial arts world that Luo Qingyang is deeply in love with his martial sister, Yi Wenjun.

95
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,030
Unfortunately, his feelings are unrequited.

96
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,980
Consort Xuan has married twice, but she never chose him.

97
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,330
Lone Sword Deity is halfway to the Mental Phase of the Unknown.

98
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,680
We are no match for him.

99
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,380
Why don't we write to my father?

100
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,970
Third City Lord can't leave Xueyue City.

101
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,010
Wushuang City is watching every move of Xueyue City.

102
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,410
With the two city lords gone, if one more city lord leaves,

103
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,060
the forces that are eyeing Xueyue City will make a move.

104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,690
It seems we are on our own.

105
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,575

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,830
Inform Wushuang City,

107
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,020
this is my last chance and their best chance.

108
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,570
Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,590
Your Highness, Lone Sword Deity has come to challenge Tianqi.

110
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,620
We have Rage Sword Deity, don't we?

111
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,890
Why are you still asking Wushuang for help?

112
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,740
Although Master and Lone Sword Deity are both among the Five Sword Deities,

113
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,380
if they really fight each other, it won't be easy for Master to beat him.

114
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,690
But if even Rage Sword Deity is no match,

115
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,130
it's even impossible for Wushuang City Lord to defeat Lone Sword Deity.

116
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,420
If he is wounded, won't you lose a major helper?

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,130
If the news is true and Wushuang can really manipulate Wushuang Sword Box completely,

118
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,410
then he still has a chance to defeat Lone Sword Deity.

119
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,730
I wonder what they will do.

120
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,220
They?

121
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm sure Chuhe is trying to figure something out too.

122
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,850
Who dares to come to Xueyue City to cause trouble?

123
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,520
Are you that young city lord of Wushuang City?

124
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,460
Just City Lord. Why did you add the word "young"?

125
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,400
You really are Song Yanhui's darn disciple.

126
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,450
Take this!

127
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,030
 This man's swordsmanship is superb. I can't believe he's as good as Master.

128
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,270
 Is this the legendary Sword Wielding Arts?

129
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,090
 I've only just learned the art of Liubo. I have yet to master it.

130
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,180
 I am afraid I am no match for him.

131
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,780
Stop.

132
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,800
City Lord Wushuang, did you come to Xueyue City to seek a battle with me?

133
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,930
I've been looking forward to it.

134
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,500
Cloud Shuttle, Light Frost, Desolate Wind, Absolute Shadow, Slaughter, Ordeal Breaker,

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,230
Red Leaf, Butterfly, Thread, Jade Wish, go!

136
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm afraid these ten flying swords are not enough.

137
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,610
What about two more?

138
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,700
Ash-Gray, Boundless.

139
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,780
City Lord Sikong, what do you think now?

140
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,500
You have a chance to fight, but no chance of victory.

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
I see.

142
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,880
Then I will fight first, then find a chance to win.

143
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,090
Thank you, City Lord Sikong.

144
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,920
Did you come to Xueyue City just to show me flying swords?

145
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,880
I have been ordered to go to Tianqi.

146
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,390
I don't know if I can return, so I want to fulfill some wishes.

147
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,350
I've come to Xueyue City to see you and learn about my current strength.

148
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,320
Second, I'm here to see Fairy Luoxia.

149
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,850
Me?

150
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,430
Why do you want to see me?

151
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,250
About this,

152
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,530
my master has given up the pursuit of the sword deity title.

153
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,700
He is living in seclusion in the sword cottage at the back of Mount Wushuang.

154
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,170
He said he had thought things through.

155
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,420
If you are willing to, he'd like to invite you to Wushuang City for a meeting.

156
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,100
A meeting your foot! You...

157
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,960
Calm down. Calm down.

158
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,140
Master, you can't agree to this.

159
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,710
That shameless guy obviously wants to get you back.

160
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,040
Master. You can't go, Master.

161
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,470
So what if I go with him?

162
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,320
I won't go with him.

163
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,210
What am I going to do if you leave?

164
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,970
You are not a child anymore. You can live without me.

165
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,110
It's exactly because I'm not a child anymore.

166
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,760
So...

167
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,870
So, whatever Song Yanhui can give you, I can give you as well.

168
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,200
What is he... What is he doing? What is he talking about?

169
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,510
What is he...

170
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,520
Are you confessing to her?

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,270
You are not a child anymore.

172
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,330
What the adult can offer, you can offer it too?

173
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,410
Why does that sound strange?

174
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,810
Did you hit your head?

175
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,620
No.

176
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,920
A beauty like you is around me every day.

177
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,360
If that didn't make me feel anything, I wouldn't be in my right mind then.

178
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,530
I am your master.

179
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,740
That's why people say first come, first served.

180
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,960
Keep the goodies within one's own people.

181
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,190
I have a poor memory, but I don't think this is the right scenario to apply that saying.

182
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,420
I knew something was off with you, you brat,

183
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,500
but I just didn't expect you had got the nerve to talk to the Fairy like this.

184
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,880
Do you know how many young talents confessed to the Fairy like this back then?

185
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,780
They were all beaten away by her.

186
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,150
But you do have a point.

187
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,820
What's wrong? Why can't a disciple be with his master together?

188
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,310
Shut up.

189
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,280
Tell him I'm not going.

190
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,880
One can only wait for some things once in a lifetime.

191
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,850
Since he gave it up last time, there is no more.

192
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,340
Master, well said!

193
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,600
- This is great!
- Brat.

194
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,550
Shut up.

195
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,810
It seems that swallows will return one day, but love won't.

196
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,040
I feel sorry for my master.

197
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,100
Farewell.

198
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,350

199
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,330
Sir.

200
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,850
Do you still serve food now?

201
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,660
Sorry, sir. The kitchen is closed.

202
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,140
That lady over there still has some food.

203
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,630
Please don't, sir. Please...

204
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,840
Sister, I'm feeling hungry from all the traveling.

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,740
Can you share some food with me?

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,520
You know, even my closest peers do not dare to eat with me.

207
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,110
Why?

208
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,140
Because I'm good at poisoning.

209
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,710
Every cup of liquor you drink could be a deadly poison.

210
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,900
It's fine.

211
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,150
Waiter.

212
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,300
Coming, Sir.

213
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,730
Here's your cup.

214
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,380
Interesting.

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,410
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

216
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,130
You're sitting here drinking alone.

217
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,630
Are you thinking about something sad?

218
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,210
You are interesting, Young City Lord of Wushuang City.

219
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,700
You know me?

220
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,910
I recognize your sword box.

221
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,460
Do you know who I am?

222
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,680
I have a poor memory.

223
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,690
Senior brother has probably told me, but I don't remember it.

224
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,580
I'm the head of the Dark River Mu family, Mu Yumo.

225
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,230
I see.

226
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,390
I've heard that there are many beautiful women in the Mu family of Dark River.

227
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,520
Looks like the rumors are true.

228
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,460
You are such a lovely child.

229
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,840
If I lean one inch closer to you, you will break my arms and legs, won't you?

230
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,490
- You can try. 
 - I'm not taking the risk.

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Come on, Sister. Let's have a drink.

232
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,580
Let's talk about the man in your eyes.

233
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,020
The man in my eyes?

234
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,410
What kind of person is he that you can't forget him?

235
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,500
Have you ever heard of this poem?

236
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,400
As the music flows upon the moon reflected on the water's surface,

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,590
the breeze and the cloud are caught up.

238
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,600
In the Pipa City of Nine Rivers, he became famous for his three hidden weapons.

239
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,010
Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan, a master swordsman on the Top-Rank List.

240
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,640
That's right. Back then, everyone knew who he was.

241
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,980
Even after years of retirement,

242
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,110
he is still the head of the Tang Clan after he entered the martial artists world.

243
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,760
Sister, I'd like to hear about how you met each other.

244
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,010
How we met each other...?

245
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,730
Our encounter began when I tried to kill him the first time.

246
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,770
The first time?

247
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,210
I tried to kill him three times.

248
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,620
The first time, he and I...

249
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,210
I kind of miss him now.

250
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,480
It's all over.

251
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,940
You can go see him anytime.

252
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,570
It's all over?

253
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,980
Changhe's body is in the carriage outside.

254
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,600
We will send him back to Dark River.

255
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,250
Then, we will dissolve Dark River.

256
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,800
After that, everyone can do what they want to do.

257
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,470
You are Su Muyu, the head of the Su family.

258
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,420
You recognize him, but not me.

259
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,560
Your 18 Swords Formation is incredible.

260
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,370
I'd like to see it.

261
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,870
Your swords are good, while mine is only a killing weapon.

262
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,960
It's not worth seeing.

263
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,920
Dark River has withdrawn from the fray.

264
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,500
This battle between me and you is unnecessary.

265
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,730
Yumo, let's go.

266
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,150
Xiao Wushuang, next time we meet, I hope to hear your story too.

267
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,610
Remember to visit me in Wushuang City then.

268
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,360
You're asking the head of a family of Dark River to go to visit you?

269
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,420
That's very cute, Xiao Wushuang.

270
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,500
Just like what this brother said, you won't be Dark River members any more soon.

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,390
Since you are not Dark River members, the killing weapon that he said will become a sword.

272
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,420
I look forward to fighting with you, Mr. Su.

273
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,110
You are going to Tianqi, aren't you?

274
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,350
Yes, Tianqi.

275
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,900
There are many good swords in Tianqi City.

276
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,250
This trip won't disappoint you.

277
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,140
You will even see the best sword in the world.

278
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,220
The best sword?

279
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:34,075

280
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,680
The City Lord of Wushuang City has gone to Xueyue City alone.

281
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,520
I've heard that the new young city lord has already mastered Wushuang Sword Box.

282
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,210
Rumors say that he's there to challenge Sikong Changfeng.

283
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,700
That's impossible.

284
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,880
Wushuang City has no reason to make a move on Xueyue City.

285
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
Those from the martial arts world think they know what the two city lords are thinking.

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,790
How preposterous.

287
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,020
Speaking of city lords, another city lord has left his city too.

288
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,460
He is going to Tianqi.

289
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,180
He is Prince Chi's godfather.

290
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,300
He's going to Tianqi to support Prince Chi.

291
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,460
As for Xueyue City, their Principal City Lord has yet to return.

292
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,310
Their Second City Lord is severely injured.

293
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,310
Their Third City Lord can't leave due to the tension in the martial arts world.

294
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,440
No one can go and help them.

295
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,670
Says who?

296
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,960
Tang Clan can go and help them.

297
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,100
Tang Clan?

298
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,190
We have no chance of making peace with Lei Fortress for now,

299
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,170
but the alliance with Xueyue City can't be given up so easily.

300
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,920
Besides, I am expecting big things from that young man named Xiao Se.

301
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,310
The moon is bright tonight. Let's depart.

302
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,725

303
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,530
What are you doing here?

304
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,010
Didn't you say you would stay in your room to heal?

305
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,340
That's right. I was going to deliver breakfast to you.

306
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,500
It's just a minor injury. It's not a big deal.

307
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,140
Eat your food.

308
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,320
Why are you here too?

309
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,880
Because he has arrived.

310
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,780

311
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,170
What's wrong with this man?

312
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,500
He's been standing here for a long time.

313
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,000
- That's right.
 - Leave it. Let's go. Come on.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,910
Mind our own business.

315
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,360

316
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,880
Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang, is a disciple of Tianqi's Shadow Sect,

317
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,090
secret bodyguards of the imperial family.

318
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,800
After the fall of Shadow Sect, there are only two Shadow disciples left in the world.

319
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,560
The other one is Consort Xuan?

320
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,830
That's right.

321
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,740
Luo Qingyang was the most brilliant disciple in Shadow Sect.

322
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,040
Later, he became the late Emperor's personal secret bodyguard.

323
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,100
He saved the late Emperor many times.

324
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:54,400
The late Emperor rewarded him with a city before his death in recognition of his merits.

325
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,240
Luo Qingyang chose Muliang City, the most desolate city in the west.

326
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
It is said that it was to practice his Desolate Sword.

327
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,230
Desolate Sword?

328
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,110
That's right. His life is pitiful.

329
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,300
He was born an orphan.

330
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,860
All of his martial siblings are dead.

331
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,910
The woman he loves married twice, but it has nothing to do with him.

332
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,850
Isn't his life pitiful?

333
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:31,650

334
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,460
What is going on?

335
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,290
You're saying that he chopped off the plaque of Tianqi City with his sword?

336
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,890
Yes. Captain Luo took the plaque down with his sword.

337
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,770
Then, he took it to Qianjin Gambling House.

338
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,970
Everyone in Qianjin Gambling House was so scared that they ran away.

339
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,930
Even Second Master Tu ran away.

340
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,660
The plaque of Tianqi City has been taken down three times.

341
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,170
The first time was when Xiao Yi, the first emperor of Beili, broke open the city gate.

342
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,810
As the true energy of his sword was too powerful, he struck it down at once.

343
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,910
The second time was 60 years ago when Sword Deity Baiyu saved the disciple who was being held hostage.

344
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,050
He struck it down as a warning to the people of Tianqi City.

345
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,900
This is the third time.

346
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,320
Why did he take the plaque to Qianjin Gambling House?

347
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,480
He did so because that place has people from all levels of society.

348
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,130
They will spread the news of his return to Tianqi.

349
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,850
What else did he say besides chopping down the plaque?

350
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,420
He didn't say anything at all.

351
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,170
In the end, he heaved the plaque into the ground

352
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,240
and said a few words.

353
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,900
Challenge Tianqi to sword fights.

354
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,170
My godfather only said these words?

355
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,780
Yes.

356
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,180
I wrote and asked him to come.

357
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,990
He really came, but he didn't tell me it would be this way.

358
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,950

359
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,260
Marquis, what should we do now?

360
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,550
You are the leader of the imperial guards.

361
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,070
When someone breaks Tianqi City's plaque, what do you think we should do?

362
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,340
We should behead him. Execute him.

363
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,620
Yes. Go and do it then.

364
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,230
Marquis, this is Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

365
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,830
I've known him for ten years.

366
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,670
I know what kind of person he is...

367
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,780
He isn't a person. He's a monster.

368
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,920
I asked imperial guards and Tiger Soldiers to surround him with dozens of barrels.

369
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,140
So what?

370
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,750
If he enters this palace, will I be able to stop him?

371
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,370
If a swordsman could kill the ruler of Beili easily, the world would've been in chaos already.

372
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,340
Captain Li, you are looking down on me.

373
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,260
State Preceptor.

374
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm so glad that you came.

375
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,330
Let me tell you, if he had really come to kill my royal brother,

376
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,630
he wouldn't have taken the plaque down

377
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,230
and yelled something about challenging Tianqi to sword fights.

378
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,880
He would've just killed his way into the palace.

379
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,030
"Challenge Tianqi to sword fights."

380
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,630
The meaning of this phrase is not simple.

381
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,020
One of the reasons Luo Qingyang came this time is to challenge swordsmen.

382
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,590
He was ranked as the best swordsman in the world,

383
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,160
but he hasn't fought in a long time.

384
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,280
Who knows if he is still the best swordsman in the world?

385
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,010
All the swordsmen in the world want to know that.

386
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,840
He himself also wants to find out.

387
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,700
Does he have another purpose then?

388
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,600

389
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,131

390
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,770
City Lord Luo.

391
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,670
Scholar Xie, I never thought you'd be the first person

392
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,980
I'd see at Qianjin Gambling House.

393
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,710
It's my pleasure.

394
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,840
Qingyang, have you mastered your Desolate Sword?

395
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,230
Almost there.

396
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,520
No wonder.

397
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,790
People wanted to challenge you before.

398
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,160
Now that you've made a little achievement, you want to challenge the world. There is nothing wrong with it.

399
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm just curious as to who you will challenge.

400
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,350
The one I wanted to challenge the most

401
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,250
is dead.

402
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,760
You mean Tao Sword Deity, Zhao Yuzhen?

403
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,860
But you are still here.

404
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,570
Me?

405
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,710
I can't fight you. I'm just a scholar.

406
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,140
Look, my sword is called Ten Thousand Scrolls.

407
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,730
Reading ten thousand books is like traveling ten thousand li.

408
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,950
I respect you.

409
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,730
No need for this courtesy.

410
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm flattered.

411
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,390
Brother Qingyang, are you just here to ask for a sword challenge?

412
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,670
Asking for a sword challenge is one of my wishes.

413
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:18,830
I will stay for three days, waiting for swordsmen of the world to come to challenge me.

414
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,750
Three days later, I will kill someone

415
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,060
and take someone away.

416
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,970
The one you're waiting for, Baili Dongjun, he's not coming.

417
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,630
Taking away the one you want to take away? It won't be easy.

418
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,960
As for the person you want to kill...

419
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,470
Who do you want to kill, if I may ask?

420
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,650
What a nice Nine-Song Sword.

421
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:01,100
Brother Qingyang, then, I should get going.

422
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,640
Are you in a hurry to leave?

423
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,490
I could have stayed a little longer,

424
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,760
but I'm afraid someone is losing his patience.

425
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,570
I'm even more afraid that he would misinterpret this and think that I'm competing with him.

426
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,100
This man is bad-tempered and very strong.

427
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,080
I need to go.

428
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,430
You see. I'm not wrong, aren't I?

429
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,790
Brother Zhantian, it's been a long time.

430
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,850
My sword is here. Let's fight!

431
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,530
What...

432
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,480
Young Master. What happened?

433
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,210
Young Master, the guards said they spotted an incredibly long flying sword coming at us,

434
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,360
and it struck our plaque to the ground.

435
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,940
It looks like it's coming at me.

436
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,270
Yes, Young Master.

437
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,590
- Put it away now. 
 - Yes.

438
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,160
- Hurry.
 - Go now.

439
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,270
Someone has sent word that the first to challenge Luo Qingyang has appeared.

440
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,890
It must be the Rage Sword Deity.

441
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,970
Xiao Se...

442
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,550
You want to watch the show?

443
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,780
Let's go now.

444
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,570
Come on.

445
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,510
Lei Wujie, can you keep it quiet?

446
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,420
It's not like I let it do this on purpose.

447
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,040
Two sword deities are fighting here.

448
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,450
Of course the sword with the purest heart in the world will be a little excited.

449
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:11,200
Xiao Se, do you have the Hanghao I asked you to bring with you?

450
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,460
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

451
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,350
Then I am relieved.

452
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,470
You are the daughter of Spear Deity.

453
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,210
How can you place your faith in a good luck charm?

454
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,650
It took us an hour to get here.

455
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,600
We spent another hour chatting.

456
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,410
Why aren't they fighting yet?

457
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,350
Are they waiting for someone to come?

458
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,940
You think sword deities fight like you?

459
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,080
He strikes, you duck.

460
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,090
He strikes again, you duck again.

461
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,420
Then you turn around and stab...

462
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,800
Then I leap, raise my giant sword, and strike the gate open.

463
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,150
Thousands of sword deities step out the gate of Heaven, raising their swords, and stab!

464
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,850
The two of you together could be storytellers.

465
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,210
You all seem to be in a good mood.

466
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,910
Scholar Xie.

467
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,780

468
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,500
I just asked Luo Qingyang about the purpose of his visit to Tianqi City.

469
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,410
He said he would challenge Tianqi to sword fights for three days.

470
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,190
Three days later, he will take someone away and kill someone.

471
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,170
The one he wants to take away must be his younger martial sister, Consort Xuan.

472
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,510
As for the one he wants to kill...

473
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,470
I'm guessing that it's me.

474
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,760
What?

475
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,170
He wants to kill Xiao Se?

476
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,340
Is this show still fun to watch?

477
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,700
We will go back now. I will ask Ji Xue to send a letter to Xueyue City.

478
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,040
I will ask my father to come to help us.

479
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,510
Take it easy. We still have three days.

480
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,490
- Xiao Se! 
 - Xiao Se...

481
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,050
You've guessed it already, haven't you?

482
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,690
Let's watch the battle first.

483
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,280
Challenging Tianqi's swordsmen for three days is a ploy to put pressure on us,

484
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,060
proving that he is already invincible in the world.

485
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,170
After three days, whatever he wants to do, no one will be able to stop him or stand in his way.

486
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,510
Looks like Rage Sword Deity isn't just here to ask for a sword challenge.

487
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,770
He has also borne the expectations of Prince Bai.

488
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:14,680
If he can defeat Luo Qingyang, then Luo Qingyang's invincibility would be a joke.

489
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,320
He won't be able to take away the one he wants to take away and kill the one he wants to kill.

490
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,780
Master, why hasn't Yan Zhantian made his move?

491
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,930
Yan Zhantian's Rage Sword Technique has only three moves.

492
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,600
Draw the sword with rage, strike with rage, and withdraw it with rage.

493
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,490
He won't use the Rage Sword Technique easily against unnecessary opponents.

494
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:41,010
But for an opponent like Luo Qingyang, he has to use the Rage Sword Technique.

495
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,680
Since he can only use these three moves, he has to build up strength.

496
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,350
Here it comes.

497
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,290
Luo Qingyang wants to defeat Yan Zhantian without drawing his sword. How arrogant.

498
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,120
Draw your sword!

499
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,850
This is what Yan Zhantian looks like when his rage is at its peak.

500
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,100
What a great duel.

501
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,800
But who won?

502
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,430
Good question. Who won?

503
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,360
He has fought hundreds of battles and has fought with one sword against millions of soldiers.

504
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,130
It's tacky to judge this duel as victory or defeat.

505
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,770
Master!

506
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,970
Thank you, Master.

507
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,240
He's better than I.

508
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,340
Chong'er, I couldn't help you this time.

509
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,820
It's fine. I'm just glad you're not hurt.

510
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,490
Master, my men will take you back to rest.

511
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,430
- What about you? 
 - I will stay and watch.

512
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,770
Be careful.

513
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:45,350
After this battle, Prince Bai's Residence in Tianqi City will never be the same again.

514
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,610
I never thought Prince Bai would be the one to make the first move.

515
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,480
There are several reasons why he did that.

516
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,140
In the Imperial Court, the senior officials who were supporting Prince Bai

517
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,530
have begun to waver because of Xiao Chuhe's return.

518
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,290
His biggest helper in the court, Bearer of Records, has been killed by the Head Eunuch.

519
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,160
The Tang Clan no longer supports him in the martial arts world.

520
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,210
If Prince Bai had won this battle, then Prince Bai's Residence,

521
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,080
which has the strongest protector in the world, would've turned things around.

522
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,820
Didn't Prince Bai realize that?

523
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,700
Prince Bai is not a fool, but he is also a fool.

524
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,270
He actually began to care about his vain brotherhood with Xiao Chuhe.

525
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,450
He made the first move because he didn't want to give my godfather the chance to kill Xiao Chuhe.

526
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,720
Lei Wujie, don't be reckless.

527
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,420
I... My two sword deity masters aren't here.

528
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,210
I'll challenge Luo Qingyang on their behalf. What's wrong with that?

529
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,750
Besides, doesn't he want to kill Xiao Se? He can't be allowed to be that cocky.

530
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,850
It's not time for you to play the hero yet.

531
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,160
I'm Wushuang from Wushuang City. I have come to challenge you!

532
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,930
Brother Wushuang!

533
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,140
We met again. You have to fight well.

534
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,200
Don't worry. I will do my best.

535
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,590
I heard Wushuang City has a new city lord, who is young and talented.

536
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,090
I didn't expect he could be so young.

537
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:28,850
I didn't expect that even the City Lord of Wushuang has come to Tianqi City.

538
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,140
I invited him.

539
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,840
You asked Wushuang to enter the city because you think he can beat Luo Qingyang?

540
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,690
Wushuang City has been waiting for a chance.

541
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm waiting for a chance too.

542
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,310
Please enlighten me, Elder.

543
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,410
It's an honor to see Wushuang Sword Box.

544
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,690
You know about Wushuang Sword Box too?

545
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,070
People say I was born to be a swordsman. Some people also say...

546
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,200
We will talk with swords.

547
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,820
Sure!

548
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,100
Twelve flying swords.

549
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,430
Wushuang City finally has a sword deity after a century.

550
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm flattered, Elder. Go!

551
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,380
The Flying Sword Technique is indeed a wonderful sword art,

552
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,220
but as a swordsman, if you don't hold a sword in your hand,

553
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,690
you are still a bit short of the mark.

554
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,890
If you had borrowed your master's Water Breaking Sword,

555
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,130
you might have lasted longer.

556
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,170
I have a sword that I hold in my hand.

557
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,860
The Vermilion!

558
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,350
What is he doing?

559
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,410
The Vermilion and the twelve flying swords were made by the Ghost Swordsmith.

560
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,130
They need to be fed with blood. Therefore, the Vermilion has another name...

561
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,040
The Devil Sword.

562
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,350
It really is a good sword.

563
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,060
Kill Wushuang. I want this sword.

564
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,730
Oh no.

565
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,730

566
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,980
Wushuang failed to control the Vermilion. Instead, the sword has taken control.

567
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,050
There is no way that I would be controlled by a sword.

568
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,060
What do you think, Mr. Luo?

569
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,590
It's a good move. It's worth drawing my sword.

570
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,700
Look at Luo Qingyang!

571
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,700
This is... Martyr Sword Dance.

572
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,300
Why do I feel sad watching him draw his sword?

573
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,490
Martyr Sword, the best technique of Desolate Sword, is Luo Qingyang's strongest move.

574
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,320
What does Martyr mean?

575
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,150
Those who die without courage on the battlefield

576
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,380
 are not allowed to be coffined and buried in the cemetery.

577
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,400
 They are called ghosts without a master.

578
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,440
 Do you know why Luo Qingyang chose Muliang City?

579
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,770
In the past, 100,000 soldiers were killed in Muliang City, which is the most powerful gate in the west.

580
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,280
Their country was defeated, and they retreated in a hurry,

581
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,490
leaving the bodies of those who had died in battle uncollected in the wilderness

582
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,700
until they turned into ashes 100 years later.

583
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,120
 This is called Martyr.

584
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,060
What melancholy can be greater than the melancholy of a nation?

585
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,250
Is this the legendary sword tendency?

586
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,610
Then I will break the Nine-Song and the melancholy!

587
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:04,610
It's an honor for Wushuang City to have a disciple like you.

588
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,980
Your sword is not like a mortal sword. It was an eye-opener for me.

589
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,140
Is this a tie for them?

590
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,850
I still lost.

591
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,980
If you practice for another ten years,

592
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,650
perhaps your sword will really surpass mine.

593
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,060
It's a pity that you are going to die here today.

594
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,320
Luo Qingyang wants to kill him?

595
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,850
He actually took the bait so quickly? Kill him.

596
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,490
Wuji Staff?

597
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:59,180
I thought you were a man of extraordinary stature to have this kind of cultivation,

598
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,680
but when faced with such a talented young man,

599
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,720
City Lord Luo, why were you so determined to kill him?

600
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,440
I have my reasons.

601
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,350
But you can't kill this person today.

602
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:38,020

♫  Visiting all corners of the world with our youthful spirits  ♫

633
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:32,025
♫  Traveling freely with friends  ♫

634
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:39,135
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫
