24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,580
 Your home is a place of freedom.

25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,520
 A place beyond the border, beyond the sky.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,840
No.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,880
Master, I don't want to go anywhere.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,340
I only want to return to Hanshui Temple.

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
 Oh, my foolish child.

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,520
 Only they think you are capable

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,720
 of ruining the world.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,660
Master, I seek your guidance.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,080
 The truth is, I was neither your master nor were you my disciple.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,920
 We were only fated to keep each other company

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,420
 to complete a journey, that's all.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,600
 Now, my journey with you has come to an end.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,720
 As for the journey ahead, you can only rely on yourself to continue.

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Master.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
Master!

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,980
 No matter what you've decided,

41
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,220
 don't forget your true intention

42
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,860
 and don't look back.

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,960
 This umbrella can protect you from the rain.

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,000
 Yet, it cannot protect your sad heart.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,260
 Come on.

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,060
 Let's purify our thoughts and feelings first.

47
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,580
 I'm sure the rain will stop, and the sun will shine again.

48
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,480
I shall heed your advice.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,780
Senior Brother, what do you think Wu Xin is up to?

50
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,300
Why is he not hiding when so many people are pursuing him?

51
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,920
Isn't it dangerous for him to cause a commotion?

52
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,220
That sound indicates they're performing a ritual to release the souls from their suffering.

53
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,700
What's that?

54
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,280
That's the Extinction of Mental Intoxicants.

55
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,840
The evil spirit is right ahead in that barren mountain.

56
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,920
Pick up your pace!

57
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,640
It turns out Wu Xin is performing the ritual for Abbot Wangyou.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,460
Master said his homeland was Yushi.

59
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,960
Is Wu Xin's goal just to bring Abbot Wangyou back to his roots?

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,460
Back to the roots?

61
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,120
Junior Brother Wu Xin isn't a demon.

62
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Master wasn't helping a demon, either.

63
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,620
"Act with my heart."

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,600
I've finally figured out my intention.

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,400

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,120
Let's go.

67
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,440
Can you refrain from putting up that otherworldly appearance?

68
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,880
We all saw it.

69
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,720
I wanted to be indifferent toward the world.

70
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,400
Yet, I turned out to be a detached person who's proud of it.

71
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,220
I didn't know that I would feel so attached to an old abbot.

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,960
How I overestimated myself.

73
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,920
But Old Wang You said I still need to complete the rest of the journey myself.

74
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,860
Abbot Wang You had profound knowledge of Buddhism,

75
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,440
but he was wrong about one thing.

76
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,380
You won't be walking that path all by yourself.

77
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,200
You still have us.

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
We'll walk with you.

79
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

80
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,880
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

81
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,380
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

82

♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

83
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,580
Sure.

84
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,240
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
 Master, I used to think

86
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,640
 that I could only feel at ease all my life when you were around.

87
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,180
 That's why I've been bringing your sarira with me

88
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,340
 and pretended you never left.

89
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,160
 But I made two good friends.

90
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
 The road ahead may be dangerous.

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,340
 But with them by my side,

92
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,480
 I believe I can keep going.

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,060
 Please rest assured, Master.

94
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,760
So it's them?

95
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes, it's them.

96
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,060
Why don't...

97
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Why don't I break the formation?

98
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,560
As a disciple of Xueyue City, you want to fight against a famous sect?

99
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,620
Well, I'm not officially their disciple yet.

100
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,580
If Senior Brother Tang arrives, I'll leave right away.

101
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,680
But that's the Truth Revealing Formation.

102
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
It's Nine Dragon Sect's most powerful magical power.

103
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,920
It's very hard to break.

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,180
We'll see if we can break it.

105
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
Who are you?

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm the Secondary Owner of Snowfall Mountain Villa, Xiao Wuse!

107
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,560
Get lost.

108
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
May I know why you're getting in our way?

109
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,800
There's only one person who wants to go home.

110
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
You are the ones who are in the way.

111
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,260
How eloquent.

112
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,860
What?

113
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,160
What did you say?

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,280
I don't understand what that means.

115
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,620
You're a disciple of the Lei Clan.

116
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,620
What Lei Clan? Didn't you hear what I said?

117
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,140
I'm the Secondary Owner of Snowfall Mountain Villa.

118
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm not afraid of being known.

119
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm Xiao Wujie.

120
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,160
Didn't you just say your name is Xiao Wuse?

121
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,540
Why did you change your name all of a sudden?

122
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,460
I-I merely misspoke.

123
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,740
What exactly is your real name?

124
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,120
Didn't you hear it clearly?

125
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm the Secondary Owner of Snowfall Mountain Villa, Xiao Wuxin!

126
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,280
Why don't you bring him back here?

127
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
No.

128
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,460
It's better to let them beat him to death.

129
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,600
That would work too.

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,160
Do you want to think about it again?

131
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,060
I, Lei Wujie of the Lei Clan from the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect,

132
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,440
wish to challenge the Truth Revealing Formation of the Nine Dragon Sect.

133
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,340
Please guide me!

134
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,320
Get into formation!

135
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,260
How many do you think this child can break?

136
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,180
I think, not a single one.

137
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,720
Do you have no faith in him at all?

138
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
He is the secondary owner of my Snowfall Mountain Villa.

139
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
When the Truth Revealing Formation is formed,

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,720
seven people turn into one person,

141
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,100
and one person turns into seven people.

142
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,980
Lei...

143
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,320
I mean, Xiao Wuse is currently not inferior to it

144
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,860
because the formation is not yet

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,880
completely formed.

146
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,880
It looks like the opponents don't take this Xiao Wuse seriously.

147
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,940
This is bad. They've completed the formation.

148
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
Wu Xin.

149
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,820
Stop getting in the way.

150
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Senior Brother, are we there yet?

151
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,600
We're almost there. We'll reach Yushi after walking another five li  (1.55 miles)  ahead.

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm sure the Great Master of Nine Dragon Sect has already arrived.

153
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
Senior Brother, is Wu Xin really that important?

154
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,820
All this rushing day and night really tires me out.

155
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,180
I can't believe you said that.

156
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,300
We've wasted our time in Sangu City because you were late.

157
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,660
If it weren't for you, we would have arrived at Yushi earlier.

158
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,000
Without me, you can't defeat them, even if you arrive earlier.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
You...

160
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,060
You're right.

161
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,200
Senior Brother, what else does Wu Xin have other than some of

162
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,480
the Secret Arts of Rakshasa?

163
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Did you just say some?

164
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,700
He has mastered 32 Secret Arts.

165
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,340
It's 32, get it?

166
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,860
Then, what's our purpose in capturing Wu Xin?

167
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,620
The first reason,

168
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,120
we must return the Secret Arts to its original owner, the Rakshasa.

169
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,040
As for Wu Xin, we must bring him back to Wushuang City.

170
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,300
This time, we must not let Xueyue City take him first.

171
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Back then, our Wushuang City was truly

172
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,260
incomparable in the world before the founding of Xueyue City.

173
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,420
I may not want to admit it,

174
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,760
but you're the most talented person in Wushuang City in a century.

175
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,240
If Wushuang City wants to be back at the top of the world again,

176
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,300
we can only rely on you.

177
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,700
So I hope you can give your best this time.

178
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,820
Do you have anything else to ask?

179
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm just curious.

180
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,360
Since Wu Xin is so important, why didn't you tell me before we departed?

181
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,580
Yet, you chose to tell me when we have almost arrived?

182
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,420
I've already told you all this already.

183
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,940
 Is Wushuang City's century-old foundation really depending on this fool?

184
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,300
Wu Xin of Hanshui Temple is here to break the formation.

185
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
Wu Xin.

186
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,400
Sect Leader Da Jue.

187
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,460
It's been a long time.

188
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,700
Since you said that,

189
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,280
why didn't you open your eyes to look at me?

190
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,380
Nine Dragon Sect may not be good at martial arts.

191
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,640
But it has the Truth Revealing Formation passed down from the Buddhism-related Western Regions.

192
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,900
It's said even the greatest expert can't break this formation.

193
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,980
Seven of you act like one and the same person.

194
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,840
I wonder if you share the same mind too.

195
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,600
Are these people trapped because of their inner demons?

196
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,320
It looks like those from Nine Dragon Sect are not that great.

197
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,620
Wu Xin is not using martial arts.

198
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,340
So you can't compare it that way.

199
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,240
But the formation is not broken yet.

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,040
Sect Leader Da Jue.

201
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,400
If you don't open your eyes, your martial brothers will die.

202
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,820
Wu Xin, why must you force me?

203
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,240
Sect Leader Da Jue, you talk too much.

204
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,460
If you don't release the formation,

205
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,240
do you think they can last for more than half an hour?

206
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,380
If your heart is clear, no evil can enter.

207
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,720
I had no idea you have such advanced mental cultivation.

208
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,380
Wu Xin, do you still remember

209
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,040
when we first met?

210
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680
Of course, I remember.

211
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,800
At that time, I had only been in Hanshui Temple for four months.

212
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,320
After you came from Nine Dragon Sect

213
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,320
and spoke to my master for seven days, you took Senior Brother Wuchan away.

214
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,140
Do you know what I thought

215
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,740
when I first saw you then?

216
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,120
The Nine Dragon Sect follows the Five Precepts.

217
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,920
No killing. No stealing.

218
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,680
No vice. No falsehood.

219
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
No intoxication.

220
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,760
I think when you first saw me,

221
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,440
you were about to violate the first precept.

222
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,380
You're right.

223
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,000
When I first saw you,

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
I wanted to kill you!

225
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,900
What kind of martial arts is this?

226
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,080
Invincible, immune to poison,

227
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,120
indestructible, formidable.

228
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,140
This is one of Nine Dragon Sect's top ten unique skills.

229
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,740
The Vajra body was achieved by practicing Purification Chants to the extreme.

230
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,000
This is the Vajra body Old Wang You told me about.

231
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,620
Wu Xin!

232
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Wu Xin.

233
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
Are you all right?

234
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,080
That sure hurts.

235
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,600
Da Jue may have high cultivation,

236
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,980
but the Vajra body exhausts the internal power.

237
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,260
You have to stall for time and don't fight him head-on.

238
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,100
I'm afraid it won't work.

239
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,480
The last stage of the Truth Revealing Formation is the return to one.

240
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,580
Now, all seven internal powers are inside Da Jue's body.

241
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,020
I guess I'll be exhausted first if I want to exhaust him.

242
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,720
What do you plan to do now?

243
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Since he wants to build a Vajra body,

244
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,720
I'll have to break it then.

245
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,600
If your Vajra body is indestructible,

246
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,720
I'll destroy your primordial spirit!

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,900
Senior Brother, why are we still taking this coffin with us?

248
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,400
This Coffin of Reincarnation can dispel Wu Xin's demonic energy.

249
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,880
Wu Xin is the Head of the Demon Sect, after all.

250
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,660
Demon Sect?

251
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,380
It was nothing but a rumor people created.

252
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,380
When did he get on top of the carriage?

253
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,340
I didn't notice it at all.

254
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,080
What great footwork.

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,380
Master, were you the one who performed the ritual just now?

256
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,900
Yes.

257
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,820
I was entrusted to release my old friend's soul from suffering.

258
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,800
Was it for Abbot Wang You?

259
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,600
Did that lad Da Jue tell you to come?

260
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,700
Yes.

261
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,620
He kept accusing others of being demons and wanted to fight and kill them.

262
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,600
He had learned nothing after all these years.

263
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,300
These people also have a secret name.

264
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,740
The name Tian Wai Tian may not sound much and is too fishy.

265
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,800
But Tian Wai Tian is the enemy of the Central Plains' martial arts world.

266
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,940
Twelve years ago...

267
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,040
How much do you know about the incident twelve years ago?

268
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,880
The enemy of the martial arts world of the Central Plains?

269
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,400
Is that what your master told you?

270
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,920
My master rarely speaks of the incident.

271
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,720
He would mention it once in a while.

272
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,140
He'd talk about Ye Dingzhi being powerful by nature,

273
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,300
which he rarely saw in life.

274
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,120
But he did sound quite...

275
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,160
My father said the same thing too.

276
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,720
He seems to worship the Head of the Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi.

277
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
I found it odd at the time.

278
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,160
Aren't those from the Demon Sect our enemies?

279
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,100
If Baili Dongjun and Sikong Changfeng

280
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,720
had the same tolerance and insight as those men,

281
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,640
none of what happened today would have happened in Xueyue City.

282
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,840
Can you tell us what exactly happened back then?

283
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,720
These are all the grudges of the previous generation of the martial arts world.

284
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,820
What's the use of you young people asking about trivial incidents?

285
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,500
But...

286
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,920
These were the decisions of the people involved.

287
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,360
Be it regret or discontentment,

288
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,680
this is our martial arts world.

289
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,000
And young people of your generation should have your own martial arts world.

290
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
If you were tied down to these old incidents,

291
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,740
how could you enjoy your lives as young people?

292
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,260
Young people should act with their hearts.

293
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,500
Am I right?

294
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,600
"Act with their hearts."

295
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,020
It was written in my master's letter.

296
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,360
But I still don't know what I really think.

297
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,000
Foolish child.

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,080
The reason you followed Da Jue here

299
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,300
is because of the so-called justice of the martial arts world that good and evil can't be reconciled.

300
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,020
Am I right?

301
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,730
Then you hesitated again at the foot of the mountain.

302
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,500
Am I right?

303
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,440
That means it's what you want.

304
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,160
What I want?

305
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,300
Da Jue, do you know why my master died?

306
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,300
It was because of hypocrites like you all who made him speechless

307
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,840
to the point of having nowhere to go and being unable to keep living!

308
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,240
Wu Xin!

309
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,520
If it weren't for protecting an evil spirit like you,

310
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,660
why would Wang You end up like this?

311
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,540
I'll kill you today!

312
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,080
Wuchan! Are you going to protect this evil spirit too?

313
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,560
Junior Brother is not a demon.

314
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,280
Get out of my way!

315
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,700
Master said I was born with a devil's heart

316
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,720
and not destined to cultivate Buddhism.

317
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,500
So he let me enter Rakshasa and cultivate the Secret Arts

318
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,520
to comprehend all mental cultivation.

319
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,700
All of you here are prating about eradicating evil.

320
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,820
But who are you to decide what evil is?

321
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,000
Can an evil spirit like you ask for a profound mental cultivation skill?

322
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,220
Profound mental cultivation skill?

323
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,460
When it comes to this phrase around this world,

324
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,420
only my master can utter it.

325
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,660
But not you.

326
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,320
Still blathering, are we?

327
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Prepare to die!

328
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,060
- Senior Brother! 
 - Senior Brother!

329
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,240
- Senior Sister. 
 - Junior Brother.

330
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,500
Tang Lian, does Xueyue City

331
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,820
also want to fight for the remnant of the Demon Sect?

332
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,260
Master Da Jue, I hope you don't misunderstand.

333
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,820
This is my personal act.

334
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,260
It doesn't represent Xueyue City's stand.

335
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,820
I don't think Wu Xin is someone treacherous and evil.

336
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,280
I hope you can be compassionate and spare him.

337
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,820
Master Da Jue, Wu Xin really isn't a demon.

338
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,960
You people can't distinguish good from evil.

339
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,000
What is wrong about rooting out the remnant of the Demon Sect?

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,700
Master Da Jue, Wu Xin was only five when the Demon Sect marched to the east.

341
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,680
What does the hatred have to do with him?

342
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,560
Watch out. Something is wrong with Da Jue.

343
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,560
All the remnants of the Demon Sect shall die!

344
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,260
Ye Dingzhi, pay for my master's death!

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
Nine Dragon Demon Subduing Formation!

346
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,640
Rise!

347
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,940
Ye Dingzhi,

348
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,840
die now!

349
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,120
Wu Xin, you...

350
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,920
When my father led Tian Wai Tian to invade the Central Plains,

351
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,320
he committed grievous sins.

352
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,940
It's reasonable

353
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,140
for a son to pay for his father's sin.

354
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,280
Wu Xin, don't do anything foolish.

355
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,720
I, Ye Anshi, am the Young Master of Tian Wai Tian,

356
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,600
but I mastered Secret Arts of Rakshasa of the Central Plains.

357
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,920
In this matter,

358
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,320
I must give an explanation.

359
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,220
Sect Leader Da Jue,

360
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,640
you succumbed to your inner demon because of me.

361
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,780
Today, we shall end this preordained fate together.

362
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Da Jue's skill is dissipating.

363
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,960
What kind of evil technique is this?

364
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,640
It can actually disintegrate the enemy's skills.

365
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,220
Watch closely.

366
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,500
Wu Xin skill is dissipating even faster.

367
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,680
Wu Xin, you...

368
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,380
Stop glaring at me.

369
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't know what the name of this martial arts skill is.

370
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,500
The book cover was destroyed,

371
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,060
so I renamed the skill

372
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,040
"The Compassion".

373
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,940
Master Da Jue.

374
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,360
Master Da Jue, I've destroyed the skills you cultivated for decades.

375
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,840
But don't worry.

376
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,720
I won't take the 32 Secret Arts of your Rakshasa Sect

377
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,820
with me.

378
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,900
Wu Xin!

379
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,500

380
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,560
Why did you have to disintegrate your skills?

381
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,620
There were better ways to deal with it.

382
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,100
If I hadn't disintegrated these skills,

383
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm afraid they would have risked their lives to stop me from leaving.

384
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,060
What do you want to say?

385
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,840
The Compassion.

386
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,780
It's a good name.

387
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,940
It has always been.

388
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,560
Sect Leader Da Jue, you had a fight,

389
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,260
and Wu Xin's martial arts skills are gone too.

390
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,020
Shouldn't you get out of our way now?

391
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,780
Thank you for saving my life.

392
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,600
I'll leave you two to talk.

393
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,820
Despite everything, you're also Old Wang You's old friend.

394
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
How could I not save you?

395
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,760
It's just too bad that you've lost your cultivation.

396
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,100
I hope you can forgive me.

397
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,280
How ridiculous.

398
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,100
I cultivated the Purification Chants for so many years.

399
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,080
Yet, I couldn't subdue my inner demon.

400
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,440
There is no evil in this world.

401
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,680
It is just our inner demons.

402
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,780
Wuchan, are you returning to Hanshui Temple?

403
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,580
Master Da Jue, I shall remember all your teachings for the past 12 years.

404
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,840
Twelve years ago,

405
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,700
I made a bet with Wang You.

406
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,560
A bet?

407
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,060
So many years have passed.

408
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,720
It now appears that the bet never came to fruition.

409
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,640
Everything was my wishful thinking.

410
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,420
It looks like Old Wang You won the bet.

411
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,660
Junior Brother Wu Xin, you must have suffered a lot.

412
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,860
A fine line between evil and good.

413
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
It looks like Nine Dragon Sect has failed!

414
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,200
Wushuang City wants to get involved in this chaotic situation too?

415
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,240
And Xueyue City is not getting involved?

416
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
Are you trying to stop us?

417
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,700
We only want him.

418
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,260
A thought of evil.

419
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,900
What if we refuse to hand him over to you?

420
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,300
Are you going to kill us?

421
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,780
We're still capable of inflicting injuries without killing anyone.

422
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,460
By you and that lad called Wushuang?

423
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,500
Of course not.

424
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,320
By myself alone.

425
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
You rascal.

426
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,240
You're so arrogant.

427
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,360
- Is there any problem with that? 
 - You...

428
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,520
If not, then I'll begin.

429
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,100
I want to end this quickly because I need to rush back to Wushuang City.

430
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,440
Cloud Shuttle!

431
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,380
The Sword Wielding Arts.

432
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,040
Light Frost!

433
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,120
Thread!

434
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,020
Jade Wish!

435
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,880
At this age, this lad can control four flying swords from the Wushuang Sword Box.

436
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,680
He's truly one of the greatest geniuses in the world.

437
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,140
What's wrong?

438
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,220
A thought of evil.

439
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,180
A thought of good.

440
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
A thought of evil.

441
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,160
Desolate Wind, go!

442
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,100
I only had a short rest,

443
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
and you're already in a tight corner.

444
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,900
It looks like you need me to change the course of events.

445
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,080
And now comes the fun part.

446
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,980
Go!

447
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,480
Xiao Se, I thought Wu Xin had lost all his abilities. How did he...

448
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,820
I dare say he lied to that old man.

449
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,400
He's using different martial arts skills.

450
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,580
Divine Eye. Astral Travel. Divine Ear.

451
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,100
These aren't Rakshasa Arts,

452
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,500
but the real Six Higher Knowledge Arts.

453
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,580
Could this be what Master said about a thought of the universe?

454
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,080
He disintegrated all his Secret Arts and attained the Six Higher Knowledge Arts.

455
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,180
Congratulations, Junior Brother.

456
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,240
It's probably for the best.

457
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,220
I can keep fighting if it's more interesting.

458
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,440
How interesting do you want it to be?

459
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,220
Go!

460
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,340
What do you feel?

461
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,160
What?

462
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,380
Do you feel particularly defeated?

463
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Yes, a little.

464
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,740
Originally, I wanted to make a name for myself using my own abilities on this journey.

465
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,040
But I can't beat any of the people I met along the way.

466
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,920
Do you still remember what you said in your first fight with Ming Hou and Yue Ji?

467
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,880
I said...

468
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,900
 Such a huge blade.

469
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,380
"Such a huge blade."

470
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,980
Not this one.

471
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,380
 I just entered the martial arts world and I could fight an opponent like you.

472
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,600
 How lucky am I?

473
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,020
Watch closely.

474
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:06,440
The best of this generation will be one of them.

475
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,720
The Sword Wielding Arts are truly an eye-opener.

476
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
The Six Higher Knowledge Arts are indeed profound.

477
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
This is bad.

478
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,260
His injury is serious. He has reached this limit.

479
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,640
 I can't believe that after taking the blows from Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword

480
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,000
 and Nine Dragon Sect's Truth Revealing Formation,

481
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,520
 I still have to die in the end.

482
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,600
Wu Xin!

483
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,080
You used your body to block instead of using your sword.

484
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,240
What a fool.

485
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,140
- Get up. 
 - He's indeed a fool.

486
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,100
But this friendship is worth admiring.

487
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,920
What's your name?

488
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,940
Lei Wujie of the Lei Clan of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

489
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,900
I know Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

490
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,340
But I don't think Lei Wujie is famous.

491
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,360
You'll know it in the future.

492
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,020
All right.

493
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,140
My sword doesn't harm nameless heroes.

494
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,280
So, I'll let you go for today.

495
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,140
You must remember to make a name for yourself in the future.

496
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,380
Of course.

497
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,200
Wushuang, why did you stop?

498
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,820
I had fun, so I don't want to fight anymore.

499
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,760
Everyone, let's attack and bring that lad back with us!

500
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:44,990

501
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,740
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

502
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,180
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

503
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,340
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

504
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,880
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

505
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,980
♫  The roaring fate  ♫

506
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,520
♫  Sweeping away the fog of time  ♫

507
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,540
♫  The past is desolate  ♫

508
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,280
♫  Waiting for the ride to the highest heaven  ♫

509
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,280
♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

510
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,820
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

511
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,020
♫  I face the sun  ♫

512
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,140
♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫

513
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,520
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

514
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,860
♫  I'm not wasting my youth away  ♫

515
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,220
♫  Like blade and sword, relying on each other  ♫

516
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,940
♫  With devoted friends and strong bonds  ♫

517
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,460
♫  No dream is small  ♫

518
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,760
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

519
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,120
♫  Youths ought to be fearless  ♫

520
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,820
♫  Visiting all corners of the world with our youthful spirits  ♫

521
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,200
♫  Traveling freely with friends  ♫

522
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,280
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫
