24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,440
I don't accept it.

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,700
I don't accept it!

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,560
You've already rejected him. So why are you wavering now?

27
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,240
What a talented young man.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,840
It really would be a pity to kill you.

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,710
I haven't lost yet.

30
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,930
His last sword has been broken as well.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,830
Rather than wanting to conquer the world, why not keep the world's resolve safe?

32
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,770
I suppose I was too narrow-minded.

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,340
What was that?

35
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,710
A sword just cut through the sky.

36
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,710
What kind of sword has that great power?

37
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,300
Could it be another sword deity?

38
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,320
That is the Tianzhan Sword.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
The first among the top ten famous swords.

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,490
How could this be?!

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,730
Since Heaven has chosen me, I shall follow Heaven's will.

42
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,200

♫   Life and death, promised in a pot of wine  ♫

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,990
Master. Who won?

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,150
Luo Qingyang wanted to be the sky, but Xiao Se cut through the sky.

♫   Martial arts legends say, there have been heroes since ancient times  ♫

63
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,880
- Xiao Se. 
 - Xiao Se. Here.

64
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,390
Luo Qingyang looks shaken.

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,860
I have no more energy to fight.

66
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,780
If City Lord Luo wishes to push on without regard to the injured, half of the people will die.

67
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,530
Then, you'll be unable to take the person you want.

68
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,280
Now is your time to make a choice.

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,820
Lone Sword Deity. Luo Qingyang.

70
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,950
Your Majesty!

71
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,210
- Your Majesty. 
 - Your Majesty.

72
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,250
Your Majesty.

73
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
What's happened?

74
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,540
His Majesty has been attacked!

75
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,190
- His Majesty is dead! 
 - Don't shout!

76
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,660
His Majesty has been attacked! His Majesty has passed away!

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,640
What did you say?

78
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,670
- Arrest him! 
 - Yes, sir!

79
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,010
His Majesty has passed away!

80
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,300
His Majesty has passed away!

81
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,110
- Is His Majesty dead? 
 - No.

82
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,160
Don't panic. He can still be saved.

83
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,510
Then tell me. What's happened?

84
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,310
He's been poisoned.

85
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,070
Poisoned?

86
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,360
I get it now. He knew I'd use this treatment method.

87
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,140
He wanted me to use this method. He wants His Majesty dead.

88
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,110
He wanted His Majesty to die at this time.

89
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,800
Master. We haven't lost yet.

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,450
His Majesty is still alive. We still have a chance.

91
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,290
Speak. Who told you to do it?

92
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,840
Master. Why are you here?

93
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,900
There's news from the palace.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,710
His Majesty has died.

95
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,490
What?

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
It's Luo Qingyang!

97
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,260
I felt the Nine-Song Sword's bloodlust just now.

98
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,080
It was out to kill.

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,350
But when it reached the palace, it was stopped by a powerful force.

100
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,680
It then turned back.

101
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,980
Emperor Mingde might still be alive.

102
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,360
Or perhaps someone else killed him.

103
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,310
Chong'er. Whether it is true or not,

104
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,650
we have to leave right away and return to the residence.

105
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,570
Why?

106
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,760
Look at Luo Qingyang down there.

107
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,320
See his gaze?

108
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,430
I've never seen him look like that before.

109
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,340
Could it be that he's gone mad after using too much power?

110
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,990
If he loses his mind, he'll definitely kill every one of us here.

111
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,630
Your Highness.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,550
This is enough.

113
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,580
Today, Tianqi City will experience an interesting night.

114
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,700

115
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,760

116
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,750
He's already lost his sanity. We should get out of here now.

117
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,430
Sir.

118
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,330
If Tianqi City is in any danger, please go and help Tianqi City first.

119
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,180
- Never mind me. 
 - What are you saying?!

120
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,560
Please promise me, Sir!

121
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,050
Save Tianqi City first.

122
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,110
 Senior Brother, you've come.

123
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,300
It's the Sound Mirror.

124
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,400
It's Consort Xuan.

125
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,550
I'm here.

126
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,590
I'm glad you're here.

127
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,670
It's just that you came a little late.

128
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,120
-Xiao Se!
-Xiao Se.

129
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,330
- Xiao Se. 
- Xiao Se!

130
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,810
Xiao Se!

131
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,150

132
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,780
- Your Highness. 
 - Captain Li. How's the situation outside?

133
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,450
It hasn't been an hour, but within the city walls, people are spreading the news of the Emperor's death.

134
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,790
People are killing and setting fires too. Tianqi City is in chaos right now.

135
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,070
Consort Xuan also injured the imperial guards and left the palace.

136
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,560
- Consort Xuan? 
 - Yes.

137
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,970
I'm pretty sure that Tianqi City has fallen into chaos because of someone's deliberate action.

138
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,400
Your Highness. I need to take some more of the imperial guards.

139
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,740
All right.

140
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,220
Captain Li. Tianqi City depends on you.

141
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,270
I will get going now.

142
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,520

143
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,740
I just got news from Bai Xiao Sect.

144
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,770
The city in the south is on fire. A group of unknowns is on a rampage.

145
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,380
There are also mobs and riots on the north side.

146
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,790
The local governors have sent men to maintain order, but the situation is out of control.

147
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,030
The armory in the west has also been burned down.

148
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,330
Nearby residents are scrambling to escape.

149
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,950
It's just as Xiao Se said, Tianqi City will be in chaos.

150
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,620
This is a set-up on a grand scale.

151
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,130
But the set-up is missing one last piece.

152
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,330
He will come to Prince Yong'an's Residence.

153
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,980
How is Xiao Se?

154
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,800
Go and get ready. Place men at all corners of the villa.

155
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,010
Yes, will do.

156
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,850

157
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,310
Thank goodness. So imperial father is okay. The news is fake.

158
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:26,650
Whether the news is real or fake, the people of Tianqi City already believe it to be true.

159
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,980
This won't do. I'm going out there to help Captain Li maintain order.

160
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,280
You cannot go.

161
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,130
Master.

162
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,220
Wushuang and I were injured in the previous fight.

163
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,350
Now, the only thing we can do is to safeguard this residence.

164
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,680
If you go, you'll be stepping into his trap.

165
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,790
Master. I once couldn't see.

166
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,290
I lived in darkness, but I never stopped pursuing the light.

167
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,650
Now I've regained my sight, but the people of Tianqi City are thrust into darkness.

168
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,220
How do you expect me to ignore their plight?

169
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,030
This has nothing to do with the throne.

170
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,750
It's just my wish to never give up.

171
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,690
I hope you understand, Master.

172
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,030
Fine then.

173
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,570

174
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,910
How is Xiao Chuhe?

175
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,730
Since going to Prince Yong'an's Residence, he hasn't been seen again.

176
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,470
After preparing for so many years, with today's ultimate move, they will be easy pickings.

177
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,740
But Prince Bai has taken his elites to help maintain order outside.

178
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,510
Together with the Scholarly Sword Deity, they're posing some challenges for us.

179
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,470
Is there any news from the upper and lower armies?

180
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,180
After tonight's massacre, they will be arriving in the capital tomorrow morning

181
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,460
to welcome Your Highness's coronation.

182
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,160
Good.

183
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,660
But according to news from the palace, imperial father is not dead yet.

184
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,510
He won't last past tonight. Rest assured, Your Highness.

185
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,020
Then there's only one thing left to do tonight.

186
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,060
Kill Xiao Chuhe.

187
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,750
Master.

188
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
Quick.

189
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,080
I beg you, Divine Healer. Even if you can't heal His Majesty,

190
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,800
I hope you'll be able to make him last the night.

191
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,170
Please.

192
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,260
All right.

193
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,900
Give me another.

194
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,420

195
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,370
Sister,

196
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,380
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,200
I came late.

198
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,960
Senior Brother, I was just kidding.

199
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,980
Don't take it so seriously.

200
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:35,360
I thought that if I managed to make my sword strong enough, I would be invincible.

201
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,230
I'd then conquer all of Tianqi and take you away.

202
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm to blame.

203
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,980
I'm too conceited and clueless.

204
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,280
Heroes will continue to emerge.

205
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,780
The Martial Arts World isn't going to cease because of one person.

206
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,080
If I had been able to comprehend this sooner,

207
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,780
you and I...

208
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,770
One wouldn't be trapped within four walls,

209
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,180
while the other was imprisoned.

210
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,000
Where do you intend to take me this time?

211
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,500
Wherever you wish to go, I shall take you there.

212
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,430
Actually, not even I myself know where I wish to go.

213
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,480
I have been disconnected from the outside world for too long.

214
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,910
Before I got married, I hated staying at home.

215
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,430
I would go outside whenever I was free.

216
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,970
My father once said, when you're born with the wind, you're destined to never stop wandering.

217
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,090
But destiny makes fools of the people.

218
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,730
Here I am, stuck in the palace for over a decade.

219
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,020
That's in the past.

220
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,750
We're free now.

221
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,280
Senior Brother, there's one more thing.

222
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,090
I want to leave together with Shi'er and Yu'er.

223
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,430
All right.

224
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,450

225
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,080
Xiao Se.

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,480
I remember the last time you lay like this before me.

227
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,560
It was in the Sword Heart Tomb.

228
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,720
That was the first time I felt real fear that a person would suddenly leave me.

229
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,280
I told myself this when I left Xueyue City.

230
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,740
I must protect your well-being.

231
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,700
But each time something happened, you were the first to step up and protect everyone.

232
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,750
 I will exhaust my inner force before long.

233
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,970
 We have to make this quick.

234
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,760
♫  Looking at the flowers and listening to the wind as a couple in the world of Mortals  ♫

235
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,050
♫  In a life where my only companion is the wilderness, I wish to meet you while wandering   ♫

236
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,450
Actually, at first, I thought you were mean and stingy.

237
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:11,330
I didn't understand why my senior brother would agree to travel together with you.

238
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,290
Now when I think about it, I'm glad he agreed.

239
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,380
Otherwise, we wouldn't meet each other until a long time after.

240
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,130
Seems like I should thank Lei Wujie properly.

241
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,690
Thankfully, he went to your inn and owed you money.

242
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,190
Xiao Se.

243
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,620
I've already lost senior brother.

244
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,780
I don't want to lose anyone else close to me.

245
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,980
I beg you.

246
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,920
If you can hear me, please wake up soon.

247
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,390
One year ago, I left without letting my master's knowledge.

248
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,990
My biggest wish was to become better at sword-fighting

249
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,080
to improve my skills.

250
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,720
So that one day I could become a powerful man like my master.

251
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,560
I'd then fight for justice in the martial arts world and make my name known far and wide.

252
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,080
Soon after, I met Xiao Se,

253
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,330
Wu Xin, senior sister, and senior brother.

254
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,180
My companions increased in number.

255
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,840
The opponents I came across were stronger too.

256
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,990
At the time, I told myself

257
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,630
that before I can protect the world, I must first protect my companions.

258
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,040
But senior brother died.

259
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,010
And Xiao Se got injured again and again.

260
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,600
In the beginning, I could still do something to help.

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,090
But now, all I can do is sit here.

262
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,520
This feeling is a first for me.

263
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,330
Full of anger, but also hopelessness.

264
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,410
You sitting here is also a form of protection.

265
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,830
Look.

266
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,110
The entrance is right ahead.

267
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,860
Behind us is where Xiao Se is resting.

268
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,820
Whoever wishes to get into the room will first have to go through us.

269
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,050
While you're guarding the door, they will have to think twice

270
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,390
about whether they can beat you, or how they can beat you.

271
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,490
You're the reason they dare not barge into the residence.

272
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,120
So do you still think you're useless?

273
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,480
With you here, I feel much more reassured.

274
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,770
Look.

275
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm scared too.

276
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,010
Don't be. I'll guard this place with everything I've got.

277
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,470
With me here, no one will be able to harm anyone of you.

278
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,620
You're injured too.

279
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,640
You should go and recuperate too.

280
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,990
Keeping watch here is not beneficial for either of you.

281
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,980
Since leaving the celestial mountain, he's not been this badly injured.

282
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,150
Moreover, the last thing Xiao Se said before he passed out really worries me.

283
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,770
What did he mean by saving Tianqi first?

284
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,620
Don't worry. I'll help him regain consciousness.

285
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,140
Although this would mean that I can't get my power back in the next five years.

286
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,660
I'll do it.

287
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,300
Be it five or ten years,

288
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,170
even if I lose all my power, that's fine.

289
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,380
He and I have the same master.

290
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,030
We practice the same martial arts. That's why I'm able to help him.

291
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,570
Your good intention is appreciated. But you should wait outside.

292
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,890
Trust me. I'll give you back a conscious Xiao Se.

293
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,360
I'll leave him to you then.

294
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,220
I'll stop butting heads with you again.

295
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,890
Go on then.

296
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,860
What a silly girl.

297
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,260
This is weird.

298
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,670
I'm suddenly feeling a sense of loss now that Xiao Se isn't around.

299
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,730
I always found him annoying.

300
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,160
But as long as he was there, everything would work out.

301
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,390
That's Xiao Se for you. He gives people a sense of security.

302
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,750
Actually, it's not hard to do something.

303
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,960
Whoever comes, we'll just chop them off.

304
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,100
You're always the most charismatic, Senior Sister.

305
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,920
With you here, I won't be taken as the most hot-headed.

306
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,090
You punk. I know you're criticizing me.

307
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,680
How come you look like you've been crying?

308
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,370
Lei Wujie. Xiao Se is going to be fine, right?

309
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,440
Lei Wujie. You and your nonsense.

310
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
I was joking.

311
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,290
Don't fret.

312
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,720
I heard that Sixth Brother was injured while fighting Lone Sword Deity.

313
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,710
I came specifically to check on him.

314
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,230
He's fine. Please go back.

315
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,630
I'm already here.

316
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,990
Aren't you going to invite me inside?

317
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,480
Is this how Prince Yong'an treats his guests?

318
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,040
Just give up. You've all been injured by my godfather earlier.

319
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,380
You're no match for Wu Xin.

320
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
Longxie.

321
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,190
Let me remind you.

322
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,140
My godfather

323
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,810
is Luo Qingyang.

324
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,860
Xiao Se, your injury...

325
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,060
Ji Xue gave me all her inner force.

326
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,280
She has fainted.

327
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,510
But that has given me another chance to fight.

328
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,320
Lei Wujie. Don't push yourself too hard while you're hurt.

329
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,580
I'm fine. We have to save Wu Xin first.

330
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,370
Xiao Yu. Are you looking for me?

331
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm right here.

332
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,580
As expected of Xiao Chuhe, always full of surprises.

333
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,480
Xiao Yu. You really went too far this time.

334
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,440
Did I? As long as you're still alive, I'm willing to do even more despicable things.

335
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,940
Do you really hate me that much?

336
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,430
Since we were young, because of you,

337
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,460
I always ranked second in martial arts and talents among the princes.

338
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,690
As soon as you joined the government-run academy, you became the chancellor's apprentice.

339
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,340
I trained hard in martial arts.

340
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,360
But when you turned 17, you reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven. You became famous.

341
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,260
From that point onward, I knew that if I wished to stand out,

342
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,760
I'd have to get rid of you.

343
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,020
Later, you left Tianqi City and I finally managed to get what I wanted and gain recognition.

344
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,580
It was truly a memorable period.

345
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,830
But just four years later, you reappeared.

346
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,710
The banquet at the Qianjin Gambling House.

347
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,910
You forced everyone to attend it.

348
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,170
Even our imperial father was there.

349
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,040
The mutiny led by the Langya Army was about to break the palace walls.

350
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,300
But with just a few words, you made an army of 100,000 turn around.

351
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,690
When Lone Sword Deity brought calamity upon Tianqi, you simply summoned the Tianzhan Sword.

352
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,900
As if you were proclaiming your status as the chosen emperor.

353
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,470
Sixth Brother, that was all the things you did.

354
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,290
And you said I went too far?

355
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,060
Is that appropriate?

356
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,140
What a joke.

357
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,630
Are you out for blood, just because others are better than you?

358
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,220
I'm not like you people,

359
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,510
who are willingly subjecting yourselves to others and doing other people's bidding.

360
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,060
I will be the ruler of men!

361
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,080
Whoever gets in my way will be dead!

362
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,730
There's nothing left to be said then. Just come at us.

363
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,690
Sixth Brother, why do you look at me like that?

364
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,980
Oh, Xiao Yu.

365
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,190
Today, you're different from your usual self.

366
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,930
Different, how?

367
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,380
You've always been a calm person.

368
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,660
You don't like to bare your heart.

369
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,250
But you just divulged your most honest thoughts.

370
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,360
Meaning you are not calm anymore.

371
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,440
This is what I've been dreaming of.

372
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,510
The day has finally come.

373
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,270
For sure, I can't hold back my excitement.

374
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,400
Because you are about to meet your end!

375
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,070
Is that so?

376
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,810
By the hands of my friend?

377
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,260
That's right.

378
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,450
Watching your best friend kill you.

379
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,520
That would be an awesome sight.

380
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,210
 Wu Xin,

381
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,000
 how did he end up being drugged?

382
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,310
 If he wanted to escape, no one would be able to stop him.

383
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,050
 If he wished to die, who then could turn him into this monster?

384
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,820
 Who in Tianqi City has the power to give him a way out?

385
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,630
 Who can he trust?

386
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,360
It's me. And Lei Wujie.

387
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,460
 You've guessed right.

388
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,790
 I chose you two for a specific reason.

389
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,340
Lei Wujie. Use the Formidable Fist.

390
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,840
Got it!

391
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,950
You were the one who taught me this skill.

392
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,440
Today, I'll show you how far I've come.

393
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,320
Xiao Se! Wu Xin's bloodlust isn't as strong as before.

394
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,760
Then my guess was right.

395
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,220
This skill has the ability to calm the mind and subdue evil.

396
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,390
So it has the same effect on drugged subjects.

397
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,630
Wu Xin.

398
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,140
Wu Xin!

399
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,940
Wu Xin. Your name means heartless,

400
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,550
but is that what you are?

401
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,840
♫  Not sad when losing, not modest when winning  ♫

402
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,530
♫  My only wish is to stand true to my convition  ♫

403
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,390
Look at me.

404
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,400
Look into your heart.

405
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,310
Look at me and then look into your heart.

406
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,640
Your name is Wu Xin. But do you really have no heart?

407
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,860
♫  Affection emerges and perishes in an instant of thought  ♫

408
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,650
♫  Fate is the most different to understand  ♫

409
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,000
♫  Looking at where I'd been, the breeze and moon are what remains  ♫

410
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,950
♫  No wish left unfulfilled and no regret left unsettled  ♫

411
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,340
My heart...

412
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,810
♫  The Taoist is caught between good and evil  ♫

413
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,480
♫  It's hard to tell them apart  ♫

414
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,910
♫  How pitiful of mortals as they have to go through all the hardships

415
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,050
♫  Benevolence exists everywhere and compassion presents in silence  ♫

416
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,260
Lei Wujie. Great work.

417
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,290
I've always been smart, you know?

418
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,220
Lei Wujie. Are you all right?

419
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,520
♫  No wish left unfulfilled and no regret left unsettled  ♫

420
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,820
You've lost.

421
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,800
Have I?

422
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
Yu'er.

423
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,610
- Consort Mother. 
 - Xiao Se.

424
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,040
I wish I could hold you and cry right now.

425
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,270
How could there be so much helplessness in this world?

426
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,030
The bad guys just keep coming!

427
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,520
It's either we die or become crippled.

428
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,890
The big bad is here. Stop your yapping.

429
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,880
I can't fight anymore.

430
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,040
Looks like it's just you against me again.

431
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,380
The earlier fight today was a culmination of Heaven

432
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,100
and the sword's will.

433
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,010
At this point, I'm no match for you.

434
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,220
Don't forget about me.

435
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,490
How come my appearance

436
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,270
happened at such a tricky moment again?

437
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,000
Always having to rescue others from danger.

438
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,710
Could this be my destiny?

439
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,980
I, Wu Xin, am destined to be the savior,

440
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,330
a light descended from the heavens.

441
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,560
You're shameless.

442
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,420
Right. You two were the ones that saved me.

443
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,560
Devil Eye. Magical Freedom Fist.

444
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,880
Good job.

445
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,180
It's the "Unparalleled Formidable Freedom Fist".

446
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,970
It's just a name I made up.

447
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,480
I'm surprised you remember it so clearly.

448
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,660
Shi'er.

449
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,430
- How could you...
 - Mother.

450
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,920
You left but came back so that you could leave with my brother?

451
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,110
No!

452
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,640
Senior Brother, take Yu'er away.

453
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,320
Your Highness.

454
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,820
At this point, things aren't as simple as they were.

455
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,200
I don't care if Xiao Yu wants to kill me or wants the throne.

456
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,490
But he killed my friend.

457
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,140
He instigated treason against Tianqi today and caused the death of innocent people.

458
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,080
He even colluded with Nanjue and attacked Beili.

459
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,680
Millions were displaced, and families were destroyed.

460
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,300
No one is going to save him this time.

461
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,290
Are you going to kill Yu'er?

462
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,370
How touching.

463
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,530
Finally, I'm the one being chosen.

464
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,380
This good fortune took me by surprise.

465
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,670
I wasn't ready for it.

466
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:35,970
But, Mother, when did I say I wanted to leave Tianqi?

467
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,440
And you.

468
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,630
Do you think you've already won? It's not over yet.

469
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,050
Sister.

470
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm guessing this is what you are using to force me and Lone Sword Deity to kill for you.

471
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,550
Did he secretly drug his mother too?

472
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,490
Yu'er.

473
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,940
You...

474
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,330
Impertinent fool!

475
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,860
Your Highness!

476
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,000
Stop, Senior Brother!

477
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,990
How did you know?

478
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,810
I realized it when I met mother the other day.

479
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,180
Why did you think I willingly walked into your trap and turned into a drugged subject?

480
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,990
I knew nothing of mind control.

481
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,240
So I had to experience it for myself.

482
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,640
Demons subdued, six senses cleansed!

483
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,360
Be gone!

484
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,960
Mother.

485
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,890
Shi'er.

486
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,040
Nicely done.

487
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,260
Such a touching reunion between mother and son.

488
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,880
I was right. There's only one family in your heart.

489
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,850
Just leave. Take your son with you.

490
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,250
Don't ever return to Tianqi City again.

491
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,110
Fool!

492
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:27,560
If not for you, martial sister would never have suffered so much.

493
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,250
But look how you've hurt her.

494
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,340
Senior Brother.

495
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,800
Wenjun.

496
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,580
Now that it's come to this, what else is holding you back?

497
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,820
My godfather, you've devoted your whole life to mother.

498
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,040
Of course, you'd defend her.

499
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,690
Fine.

500
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,060
Let me tell you about what happened.

501
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,560
Back then, martial sister and Ye Dingzhi had managed to escape Tianqi City.

502
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
They lived in seclusion outside Gusu City

503
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,800
but were tricked into returning to Tianqi.

504
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,760
Think about it.

505
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,830
What could have made her leave behind the happiness she had found and go back to being imprisoned?

506
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,270
It was you.

507
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,170
Me?

508
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,840
Someone passed along a fake message from me,

509
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,000
saying that you fell gravely ill in Tianqi.

510
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,180
So she rushed back to Tianqi.

511
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,370
Because of that, she was trapped in Tianqi.

512
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,770
It triggered the Demon Sect's invasion of the east.

513
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,660
The second time, I had the chance to take her away from Tianqi.

514
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,780
But she once again refused.

515
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,210
It was because she made a deal with Xiao Ruojin so that Wu Xin's life could be spared

516
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,470
and your position in the imperial family was retained.

517
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,550
What you said... are merely excuses.

518
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,720
Excuses?

519
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,150
Many a time, I've tried coming to Tianqi.

520
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,710
But every time she said no.

521
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,510
Because she knew that you would never give up your position as an imperial member.

522
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:30,120
This whole time, she was the one enduring in silence bearing the burden for you!

523
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,030
You think the whole world has turned against you?

524
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,340
What a fool! You gave up on everybody!

525
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,520
Xiao Yu. You always feel like you're the victim.

526
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,880
But in fact, you've received a lot of love too.

527
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,010
My mother died young.

528
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,240
What you have is what I could only dream of.

529
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,590
But you were dead set on competing with me

530
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,770
over things, I did not care about at all.

531
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,360
Senior Brother, take Yu'er away.

532
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,110
Martial Sister.

533
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,710
But this impertinent boy drugged you!

534
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,930
Your Highness. One has to pay for what one did wrong.

535
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,090
Even if I were to die today, I'd never let Xiao Yu get away.

536
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,340
I can spare him.

537
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,410
But he will go to the Court of Judicature to be punished by imperial father.

538
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,670
Turns out my whole life

539
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,490
is the biggest joke of all.

540
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,560
Yu'er...

541
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,840
Yu'er!

542
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,850
Your Highness!

543
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,310
Yu'er!

544
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,960
Yu'er.

545
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,300
Yu'er.

546
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,190
Seventh Brother.

547
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,590
You still refuse to accept it, huh?

548
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,380
Only when you belittle others,

549
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,060
will you not be belittled by them.

550
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,420
Yu'er...

551
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,450
Yu'er.

552
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,880
Your Highness.

553
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
Yu'er.

554
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,420
Yu'er...

555
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,350
Yu'er...

556
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
It's snowing.

557
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,020

558
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,680
 Is that seventh brother? Why is he kneeling over there?

559
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,260
 Seventh Prince started a fight with the other princes at the academy today.

560
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,350
 This is His Majesty's punishment.

561
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,950
 Seventh brother can be naughty.

562
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,880
 But he knows when to stop.

563
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,750
 Why would he pick a fight with others?

564
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,630
 Because Seventh Prince was upset that his result was not as good as yours.

565
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,780
 The other princes made fun of him for that.

566
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,300
 A prince even ridiculed Consort Xuan.

567
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,360
 So Seventh Prince lost it and...

568
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,150
 Your Highness.

569
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,680
 Are you my sixth brother?

570
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,210
 One day, I'm going to best you!

571
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,090

572
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,350
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫
