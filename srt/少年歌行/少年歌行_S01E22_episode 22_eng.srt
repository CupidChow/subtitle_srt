00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,150
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,878
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,370
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,300
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,630
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,470
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,600
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,020
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,150

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,499

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,576
Xiao Chuhe?

25
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,524
Prince Yong'an?

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,000
- Do you need to get so worked up about this? 
 - Why can't I?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,780
It's too late to throw us off the ship now.

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,690
You're the Prince Yong'an who'd rather get punished for protecting Prince Langya

29
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,871
than change the decision despite losing his title and status

30
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,670
and ending up wandering the martial arts world?

31
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,260
Good! Great!

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,460
I've heard many stories about you!

33
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,796
I admire you!

34
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,430
The world thinks I am guilty.

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,192
Well, that's only what they think.

36
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,844
Who is Prince Langya?

37
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,320
He would never commit treason!

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,950
There is no such reasoning in books.

39
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,840
And there shouldn't be such nonsense in this world.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,384
I'm only upset that I can't stand by your side and fight for justice with you.

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,300
You really are the silly son of a wealthy family.

42
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,719
Young Master Mu, if you encounter trouble on the island, find Marquis Lanyue.

43
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,706
He will help you.

44
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:58,058
Marquis Lanyue.

45
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,150
He is an admirable character, too.

46
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,210
All right. I'll remember that.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,240
Come on. Let's drink.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,410
This liquor is called Qiulubai.

49
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,370
It's produced by the Diaolou Parlor in the imperial capital, Tianqi.

50
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,840
They only bring out three jugs of this to serve their guests on the 15th of every month.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Even for us, the Mu family of Qingzhou,

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,344
it took quite a bit of effort to acquire this one jug.

53
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,090
You're a member of the imperial family, Brother Xiao.

54
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,326
You must miss this liquor.

55
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,569
Mu Chunfeng, let me give you a piece of advice.

56
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,220
You know Xiao Se's identity now.

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,720
It's not a big deal if you want to get close to him and form connections.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,220
But you should ask him whether he wants to be the Emperor first.

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,460
Be careful so that you don't misjudge another person again.

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,180
Does it matter whether he wants to be the Emperor or not?

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm a merchant.

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,800
You can suspect my intentions,

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,480
but you can't doubt my judge of character.

64
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,740
This wine is called Hantanxiang,

65
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,600
a famous liquor of Luoxiang City in Nanjue.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Once the liquor is made, it is stored underneath a deep cold pond and taken out after one year.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,900
It is chilly when you drink it, and it has a faint peach blossom fragrance.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,420
It's even better than Qiulubai.

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,760
Hantanxiang is a rare liquor indeed.

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,886
You all don't drink much, do you?

71
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,860
I do.

72
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,450
I love drinking!

73
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,006
What do you all usually drink?

74
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,210
Beauty of Four Seasons is on the milder side,

75
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,100
but it's the one I drink the most.

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,370
Different festivities call for different liquors.

77
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,060
Sangluo, Xinfeng, and Tusu are all fine liquor.

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,456
But the best is the Seven Starry Nights.

79
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,010
I don't get many chances to drink it, however.

80
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,370
But sometimes, I get to savor it, thanks to Third Master.

81
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,518
You get to drink Seven Starry Nights?

82
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,770
I often drink that liquor too.

83
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,898
What's the big deal?

84
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:07,470
I think it's not as good as Beauty of Four Seasons.

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,722
It's too strong and not sweet enough.

86
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:13,668
Did you forget who my master is?

87
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,340
Here.

88
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,908
Let's drink Han… Let's drink.

89
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,510
Brother Xiao.

90
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,470
A toast to everyone.

91
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,420
The smell of the peach blossoms is so fragrant!

92
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,470
Good liquor.

93
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,530
It is great liquor indeed.

94
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,460
Brother Tang, I'm a liquor enthusiast as well.

95
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,720
Will you let me try some of the Seven Starry Nights when we go back to Beili?

96
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,750
It's a little embarrassing to say this, but we snuck out and finished the last pot of that liquor last time.

97
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,470
My master is away on a trip.

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,366
We don't know when he will return.

99
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,830
Never mind then.

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,806
Didn't Scholar Sword Deity give you the Book of Liquor?

101
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,130
Shouldn't that book include the method to make it?

102
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,026
The Book of Liquor?

103
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,554
May I have a look at it, Brother Tang?

104
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,660
Are you interested in making liquor?

105
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,610
So this is the book…

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,066
It really is this book…

107
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,684
Is it valuable?

108
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,896
It's priceless!

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,270
No.

110
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,060
I mustn't keep reading.

111
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,204
If I do, I would be no better than a thief.

112
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
You're too harsh on yourself.

113
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,670
It's just a book about making liquor.

114
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,590
I'm not interested in it anyway.

115
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,500
But it was a gift from an elder, so I can't let you have it.

116
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,770
If you like it, you can keep it with you for a few days.

117
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,070
Fool…

118
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,560
Foolish!

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,690
Drink 30 cups of liquor in a row,

120
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,570
and your inner force and aura will be greatly improved.

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,042
I've only heard them say this, so I don't know much about it,

122
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:14,786
but what I cherish will not be as simple as you think it is.

123
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,940
I… I just remembered.

124
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,580
After drinking Principal City Lord's liquor,

125
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,120
my power and skill improved by leaps and bounds the next morning.

126
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,462
Could that method of making the liquor be written in this book too?

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,592
It's true that the liquor Master made can boost one's cultivation.

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Did he really learn how to make liquor from this book?

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,966
Even if it isn't true, you can make liquor for us after studying that book.

130
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,800
You better don't drink too much.

131
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,249
It's good liquor, but it's one of the strongest there is.

132
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,850
Great liquor!

133
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,100
Lei Wujie!

134
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,840
Where are you going?

135
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,834
I wish to travel north with the wind,

136
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:11,222
watching the snow sweeping across the land.

137
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:14,300
I wish to travel east with the ship,

138
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,864
seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.

139
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,330
I wish to travel far with the clouds,

140
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,062
even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

141
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,540
I will bathe in sunlight n the top of Mount Kunlun.

142
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,380
I will witness lush mountains rise at the edge of the ocean.

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,726
We shall reunite after a long journey.

144
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:45,540
But I won't go home unless I've seen the world.

145
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,090
"But I won't go home unless I've seen the world."

146
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,690
Great poem.

147
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,326
It is poetic and bold.

148
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,970
But I've never heard it before.

149
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,122
Who wrote this poem?

150
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:05,088
A peculiar man in this world who also happens to be my friend.

151
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,870
One.

152
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,080
Two.

153
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,010
Three.

154
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,790
Lift that sword higher.

155
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,090
Position your fingers correctly.

156
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,690
Gong Bu, lower.

157
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,180
- Go lower in your horse stance. 
 - Look.

158
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,040
With all of them gone, Luo Mingxuan has become the eldest disciple here now.

159
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,360
Four.

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,730
He isn't the best cultivator himself.

161
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,570
He had better not misguide the others.

162
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,570
Keep going.

163
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,420
- We have a guest. 
 - Hold it.

164
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,690
Bai Xiao Sect?

165
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,160
One.

166
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,380
City Lord Sikong. Elder Yin.

167
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,490
It is an honor to meet you.

168
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,710
What brings a disciple of the Baixiao Sect to Xueyue City?

169
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,300
The storm has calmed.

170
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,180
Martial artists are ranked on the Golden Ranking.

171
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,370
The Golden Ranking?

172
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,660
The Baixiao Sect hasn't released the Golden Ranking in many years.

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,870
It seems that Baixiao Sect

174
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,910
believes the battle at the Lei Fortress marks a new beginning for the martial arts world.

175
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,860
Spear Deity, please read the ranking.

176
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,400
Let me see it.

177
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,170
You announce it.

178
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,730
Thank you, Third City Lord.

179
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,450
The first ranking of the Golden Ranking.

180
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,430
Weapon Mastery Ranking.

181
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,330
Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng.

182
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,138
Weapon, Wuyue Spear.

183
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,940
Sword Deities. Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

184
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,490
Weapon, Nine-Songs Sword.

185
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,970
Scholar Sword Deity, Xie Xuan.

186
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,570
Weapon, Ten Thousand Scrolls.

187
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,180
Rage Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian.

188
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,280
Weapon, Pojun Sword.

189
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,900
Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

190
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,184
Weapons, Iron Glacier, and Peach Blossom.

191
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:03,190
The Tao Sword Deity has fallen.

192
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,022
The Martial Arts World only has four Sword Deities.

193
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:07,904
What a pity.

194
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,890
Indeed.

195
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,540
Blade Deities.

196
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,300
Tyrant Blade, Tan Taipo.

197
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,836
Weapon, Kirin Moon.

198
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,330
Ghost Blade, Moon Snatcher.

199
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,780
Weapon, Yinyang.

200
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,608
Tender Blade, Su Yuluo.

201
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:22,250
Weapon, Chiluo.

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,998
Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun.

203
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,266
Weapon…

204
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,032
Fists and everything else.

205
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,810
Master, I see my name!

206
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,790
Look!

207
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,210
I'm in eighth place on the second ranking, the Jade Ranking.

208
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,242
Luo Mingxuan, a disciple of Xueyue City.

209
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:39,660
Master, I made it into the ranking!

210
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,880
You only barely made it.

211
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,790
What's there to be happy about?

212
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,610
Next year, I'll get a higher ranking for sure!

213
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,650
Let's see who is in seventh place.

214
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,098
It's senior sister!

215
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,626
Sikong Qianluo, a disciple of Xueyue City.

216
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,420
In sixth place, Li Fansong, a disciple of Mount Wangcheng.

217
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,360
In fifth place, Lei Wujie, of the Sword Heart Tomb, a disciple of Xueyue City and Lei Fortress.

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
That's a long title.

219
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,670
In fourth place, Tang Ze, a disciple of the Tang Clan.

220
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,990
In third place, Tang Lian, a disciple of Xueyue City.

221
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,090
- There is no second place. 
 - No second place?

222
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,240
Second place?

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,290
- There are two people in first place! 
 - Two people in first place?

224
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,380
Jade Ranking. First place.

225
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,110
Wushuang, a disciple of Wushuang City.

226
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,850
First place. Ye Anshi, a disciple of Tian Wai Tian.

227
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,000
- This… 
 - Four of Xueyue City's disciples made it on the list.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,356
But none of them was able to take first place.

229
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,830
The martial arts world is filled with capable talents.

230
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,310
It's not essential, even if we don't get first place.

231
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,490
There is one more ranking that I will relay verbally.

232
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,290
What?

233
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,120
The Top-Rank List.

234
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,931
- The Top-Rank List? 
 - I've never heard of that.

235
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,091
- Hasn't that been stopped a long time ago? 
 - It was stopped a long time ago.

236
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,490
Why are they bringing it up again?

237
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,870
Master, what does this mean?

238
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,730
The top. As the name implies, it means the top of the world.

239
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,880
Once the names are listed on that ranking, the first place and second place will get second place on the list.

240
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,940
The second place will always go after the first place.

241
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,720
And the one in first place will have to face challenges from the entire world.

242
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,246
From what I know, Ji Ruofeng sealed that list over ten years ago.

243
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,120
Now, it has been brought back,

244
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,260
is the competition for the most powerful in the world about to end here?

245
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,932
I'm just the messenger.

246
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:24,058
If Xueyue City does not wish to hear it, I will take my leave.

247
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,120
No. Tell us.

248
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,406
In fourth place on the Top-Rank List, Yan Zhantian.

249
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:40,080
Tan Taipo. Xie Xuan. Li Tian.

250
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,668
In third place on the Top-Rank List, Sikong Changfeng.

251
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,396
Moon Snatcher. Tang Lianyue.

252
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:51,570
In second place on the Top-Rank List, Luo Qingyang.

253
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,940
It looks like Principal City Lord is in first place, after all.

254
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,372
And Baili Dongjun.

255
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,640
I still haven't heard my name even until now.

256
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,586
Could it be that I am in first place?

257
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,550
The Head of Bai Xiao Sect says that you have fallen from your initial phase for some time now.

258
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,540
Now, you've returned to the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

259
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,431
On Mount Wangcheng, your battle with Zhao Yuzhen ended in a tie as well.

260
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:20,010
Although Zhao Yuzhen held back, you will surely return to the peak soon.

261
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,266
No need to fret.

262
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,180
This is all within expectations.

263
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
What surprised me is the fact that there is someone else

264
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,000
who can rank above Baili Dongjun and Luo Qingyang.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,140
That's right.

266
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,980
The first place should either be Luo Qingyang or Baili Dongjun.

267
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,780
And you put them both in second place.

268
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,530
Then… First place on the Top-Rank List.

269
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,910
- There is someone in first place? 
 - Really?

270
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,380
Is there someone even more powerful than Principal City Lord?

271
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,520
Who?

272
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,310
In first place on the Top-Rank List, Mo Yi.

273
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,180
 Who is that?

274
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,310
- I don't know him. 
 - I've never heard of him.

275
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,990
Where did he come from?

276
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,330
Tell me.

277
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,366
Who is Mo Yi?

278
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:01,060
I've been the chief supervisor of the Lei Fortress for 20 years.

279
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,440
I know the martial arts world like the back of my hand.

280
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,790
Yet, I've never heard of this name.

281
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,462
Mo Yi…

282
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,790
It has been so long since I last heard that name.

283
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,550
We've been traveling for so long.

284
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,280
We're finally close to our destination.

285
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,910
The Sanshe Island is up ahead.

286
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,310
Rest assured, Young Master Mu.

287
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,034
We will get you what you need.

288
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,580
That won't be necessary.

289
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,610
His body can't hold on much longer.

290
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,102
You all should get a move on.

291
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:59,490
We, the Mu family, will handle the matter on Sanshe Island ourselves.

292
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,840
All right. Thank you.

293
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,280
Oh, right.

294
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,570
I have some poison with me.

295
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,886
It might be useful when catching snakes.

296
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,320
Take this.

297
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,850
Thank you.

298
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,540
Young Master Mu, you've already come this far.

299
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,916
Are you sure you won't follow us to the island to see the immortal?

300
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,880
I'll pass.

301
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,110
Compared to immortals and divine beings, my brother's happiness is more important.

302
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:32,099
Brother Xiao, no one has ever seen the world beyond Sanshe Island.

303
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:34,430
Will you be able to find what you seek?

304
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,862
Besides, how will you navigate your way in the vast sea?

305
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,690
What's your suggestion, Young Master Mu?

306
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,100
To prevent any accidents,

307
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,210
we've recruited an astrologer before embarking on this trip.

308
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,506
I studied astrology too.

309
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:56,132
I can find my own way.

310
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:59,500
What good will your limited skills be?

311
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,976
- Miss Ye! 
 - Sister Ye!

312
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,920
Miss Ye, didn't you return to Tianqi with the general?

313
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,490
I didn't really want to go back, so I slipped out when I found a chance.

314
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,750
Then, you're here…

315
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,420
To save him, of course.

316
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,070
I don't know what my father thinks.

317
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,550
All I want is to help him return to Tianqi.

318
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,410
Because I helped you when we were younger?

319
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,180
No.

320
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,960
Because we're friends.

321
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
That's right! We're friends!

322
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,412
Friends will travel thousands of miles to help one another.

323
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:32,590
Well, I bet you're happy.

324
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,490
I haven't seen you in a while.

325
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,680
It has been a while.

326
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,988
Well… You look even more beautiful now.

327
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,470
Miss Ye, you may be young,

328
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,520
but you're far more capable than the masters who've studied astrology for decades.

329
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,650
I was wondering why you would answer my recruitment.

330
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,350
So you came for Brother Xiao.

331
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,950
Perfect. We have a map of Sanshe Island.

332
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,249
Miss Ye, you should go to the island with Xiao.

333
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,750
Thank you.

334
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,388
Brother Xiao, when should I pick you up?

335
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,530
How much time do I have left?

336
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,610
Five days.

337
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,260
Make it seven days then.

338
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,340
Pick me in seven days.

339
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,540
All right.

340
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,150
I will come and pick all of you up in seven days.

341
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,586
Please stay safe, everyone.

342
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,580
Thank you, Young Master Mu.

343
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,980
Thank you.

344
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,680
I will.

345
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,102
Is this the undercurrent Principal City Lord mentioned on the map?

346
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,324
Yes, the undercurrent is up ahead.

347
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,886
Be careful, Lei Wujie!

348
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:21,760
Hold on to the oars!

349
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,980
Hold on tight, everyone!

350
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,700
Hold on to me!

351
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,980
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

352
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,440
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

353
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,550
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

354
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,020
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

355
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,210
♫  In the world, the wind blows miserably  ♫

356
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,730
♫  The secrets of the mortal life are hidden  ♫

357
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,950
♫  Talking about destiny  ♫

358
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,040
♫  The heart moves and does what it wants  ♫

359
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,460
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

360

♫  I'm not wasting my youth away  ♫

361
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,080
♫  Like blade and sword, relying on each other  ♫

366
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,420
As expected of the celestial mountain.

367
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,230
♫  Traveling freely with friends  ♫

368
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,240
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫

369
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,032
I'm exhausted!

370
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:38,680
I'm in no mood to appreciate the scenery.

371
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,900
I just want to find a place to sleep.

372
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,060
It's a pity there isn't an immortal in this beautiful scenery.

373
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,980
There's a deity on the island,

374
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,708
who can ride clouds, harness wind,

375
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,820
co-exist with Heaven and Earth,

376
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,280
and live as long as the sun and the moon.

377
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,120
He must be what they were talking about.

378
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,840
Guests have arrived.

379
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,810
A pleasure to meet you.

380
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,322
Immortal, we apologize for intruding.

381
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,334
Few have been able to reach this place over the years.

382
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:26,272
Since you're here, it must be fate.

383
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:28,330
There is no intrusion to speak of.

384
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,940
He seems like an approachable guy.

385
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,440
Let's go!

386
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,954
I sense a familiar aura on that immortal.

387
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:50,050
Have you met him before?

388
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,554
It seems so.

389
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:53,548
I can't be sure.

390
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,574
Where did you all come from?

391
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,240
We came from Beili.

392
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,940
Beili?

393
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,290
I haven't heard that name for a while.

394
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,830
Do you know Beili, Immortal?

395
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,050
Not only do I know the name, but it's also my birthplace.

396
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,640
I spent a long time there in the past.

397
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,299
It appears that you have traveled far.

398
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,332
You all must be tired.

399
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:27,520
Since you're here, there is no need to hold back.

400
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,880
Thank you, Immortal.

401
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,820
Immortal, instead of pointing at me with your finger,

402
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,530
can you please touch my head?

403
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,930
Why?

404
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,750
It is written in the books that if an immortal touches your head, you will be granted longevity.

405
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,640
I wish to have a long life.

406
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,046
Someone once asked me to do that.

407
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,440
What happened afterward?

408
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,619
I shattered the cliff he was cultivating on in one hit.

409
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,524
Well… You can just point at me then.

410
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,570
Just pointing between my eyes will do.

411
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,766
So you two are the ones who seek my aid.

412
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,556
Why do you think it is us?

413
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:42,460
The three of them may be physically and mentally exhausted,

414
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,340
but their auras remain strong.

415
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,120
They'll recover after a night's sleep.

416
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,860
But the two of you are different.

417
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,770
The aura of one of you is in a state of disarray.

418
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,390
You're on the verge of death.

419
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,870
The other was born with a defect.

420
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,060
You should already be dead.

421
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,450
As expected of an immortal.

422
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,050
He doesn't even need to check their pulse.

423
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,840
One look, and he already knows what's wrong with them.

424
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,824
You are correct, Sir.

425
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,410
You carry a familiar presence.

426
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,950
Have we met before, Immortal?

427
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,022
No need to call me Immortal.

428
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:16,760
My name is Mo Yi.

429
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,230
Mo Yi…

430
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,870
Sir, are you an immortal or…

431
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,070
I am already 64 years old.

432
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,940
You look like you're only Senior Brother's age!

433
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,120
You really are an immortal!

434
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,092
My master once told me that the celestial hood is something entirely different.

435
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:46,566
In my current state, I can only be considered an Earth Deity.

436
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,190
Earth Deity?

437
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,910
An earth deity can only change matters of the Earth

438
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,168
but not of Heaven.

439
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,647
Sir, is our case a matter of the Earth?

440
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:58,320
Of course.

441
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,644
I can heal both of them and they can be cured.

442
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,750
That's great!

443
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,220
However, I have a condition.

444
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,210
Deities have conditions too?

445
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,710
Of course.

446
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,834
I will help you with your problems on Earth,

447
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,826
and you must help me change Heaven's will.

448
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,036
What do you wish to change?

449
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,880
I want to bring someone who's gone back to this realm.

450
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,522
How can we help you?

451
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,006
You only have three days at most.

452
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,134
Tomorrow, I will ask one thing from you.

453
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,376
If you can give me that item, I will cure you.

454
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,580
What is it?

455
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,476
You'll know when the time comes.

456
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:51,530
Mr. Mo Yi, have you ever met my master, Baili Dongjun?

457
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,488
He left the city a year ago for the immortal realm across the seas, searching for a brew.

458
00:26:57,488 --> 00:27:00,368
Did you ever come across him?

459
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,920
I met him once many years ago.

460
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,076
He is an interesting man.

461
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,760
He makes fine liquor.

462
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,076
I haven't seen him since we parted ways.

463
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:15,780
Perhaps he deceived you.

464
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,580
 Three days from now, I will give you a new body.

465
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,530
 You will give me what I seek.

466
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,430
He is no deity.

467
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,010
What kind of deity makes demands and deals?

468
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,420
You burn incense when you pray at the temples.

469
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,680
Moreover, we're the ones who seek his help.

470
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,360
It's only natural that we have to pay the price.

471
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,150
But I am curious.

472
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,470
What do we have that he would need?

473
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,476
I have an inkling.

474
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:54,470
Instead of the immortal realm, it's closer to another legendary phase we speak of in the Martial Arts World.

475
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,900
- The Mental Phase of the Unknown. 
 - Yes.

476
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,290
You sit and concentrate in silence,

477
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,620
but your mind and soul wander a thousand li away.

478
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,810
It is the highest phase that reigns above the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

479
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,310
Even my master was never able to reach this phase.

480
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,570
Mr. Mo Yi's footwork that allows him to move as swiftly and fleetingly as the wind

481
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,618
resembles more of one who has reached the Mental Phase of the Unknown.

482
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,830
It doesn't matter if he is a deity or if he has reached the Mental Phase of the Unknown.

483
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,100
I think something's strange about him.

484
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,920
I have cultivated for a long time under State Preceptor Qi.

485
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,340
He has an aura that is similar to that of the State Preceptor.

486
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,530
They might have cultivated under the same master.

487
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,422
What's more, the aura he carried was stronger than the State Preceptor.

488
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:38,012
But when he spoke of his wish, the look in his eyes changed.

489
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,510
How did it change?

490
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,330
From that of a deity to a demon. It sends a shiver down one's spine.

491
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,650
Mr. Mo Yi is different from what we imagined.

492
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,990
What should we do then?

493
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,426
Xiao Se only has three days left to live.

494
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,530
Let's wait and see what happens first.

495
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,159
See if we can find any clues within these three days.

496
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,240
Maybe we're overthinking it.

497
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,440
You all stay here. I'll look for my master.

498
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,610
Senior Brother, you…

499
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,114
Don't worry. I know my master.

500
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:10,490
He will do it as long as he promised.

501
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,522
I have faith that he is in this celestial mountain.

502
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,854
I think Baili Dongjun was here too.

503
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,679

504
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,830
 Master.

505
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,928
 Can we help him?

506
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:54,914

507
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,544
 Are you a deity?

508
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,278
 No, I am not.

509
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,354
 I'm just an ordinary person.

510
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,504
 Will you buy me, Sir?

511
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,636
 I can help you bury your sister, but I won't buy you.

512
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,950
 You only need to become my disciple

513
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,322
 and cultivate with me.

514
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:33,710
 Cultivate?

515
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,710
 As in, become a deity?

516
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,470
 If I become one, can I bring my sister back to life?

517
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,726
 I can't do that.

518
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,190
 Neither have I ever met anyone capable of it.

519
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,070
 But you'll be much more powerful than me in the future.

520
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,660
 I'm not as powerful as you are.

521
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,800
 It's not for me to say whether you can do it or not.

522
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,734
 All right. I'll do as you say.

523
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,200
 What's your name?

524
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,208
 My name is Mo Yi.

525
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,830
Mo Yi.

526
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,200
Ruoyi, yesterday, you said Mo Yi and Qi Tianchen carried a similar aura.

527
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Could he be from the Directorate of Astronomy too?

528
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,130
Before joining the Directorate of Astronomy,

529
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,570
the State Preceptor once studied under Taoist Qingfeng of Mount Huanglong.

530
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,970
He once told me that in his later years, Taoist Qingfeng took in a young disciple.

531
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,200
That disciple had incredible talent.

532
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,810
Within three years, his cultivation and attainments have reached the top two in the ranking,

533
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,870
second only to the State Preceptor.

534
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,271
But at that time, the State Preceptor had already been cultivating for 16 years.

535
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,500
Yet, it only took that disciple three years to catch up.

536
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,810
Three years.

537
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,240
If he had stayed in Beili, he would've been sure to take the highest rank someday.

538
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,150
Yet, he insisted on going out to sea to seek the path of immortality.

539
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,200
He wants to get away from the Mortal World and become a true immortal.

540
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,792
Taoist Qingfeng couldn't change his mind and set out with him.

541
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,990
But he has never returned since.

542
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,872
So you suspect that disciple is Mo Yi.

543
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:10,670
If it is him… Then what he said about changing the Heaven's will

544
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,150
would mean reviving his little sister.

545
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,130
She has already been deceased for so many years.

546
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,666
Even her remains would be long gone now.

547
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,830
How can she be revived?

548
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,166
Mortality is Heaven's will.

549
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,370
Going against that would mean going against heaven's will.

550
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,904
But we must cure you.

551
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:33,890
There is no turning back for us.

552
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,480
Listen closely to what I'm about to tell you next.

553
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,972
This is our only chance.

554
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,830
 Is anyone in?

555
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,242
 Can you spare me a steamed bun?

556
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:07,984
 I'll repay you when I grow up.

557
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,060
 Is anyone inside?

558
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,810
 Is anyone there?

559
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,370
 Can you give me some congee?

560
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,850
 My little sister is starving!

561
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,960
 I can work for you! I don't need any money!

562
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,800
 Is anyone in? Anyone?

563
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,490
 Is anyone in?

564
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,536
 Is anyone inside?

565
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,890
 If my father hadn't saved you back then, all of you would be dead!

566
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,810
 I can't believe you guys would leave us to die!

567
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,310
 Brother, you're back.

568
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,990
 Lü'er, I'm useless.

569
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,680
 I didn't manage to find any food.

570
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,390
 Look what this is, Brother!

571
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,530
 Flatbread? Where did you get this from?

572
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,000
 A kind abbot passed by earlier.

573
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
 He gave me two pieces of flatbread.

574
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,370
 I've already eaten one.

575
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,680
 I saved this one for you.

576
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,340
 You've already eaten?

577
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,450
 Lü'er?

578
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,280
 Lü'er! Wake up!

579
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,538
 Lü'er, Lü'er!

580
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:46,930
My dear Lü'er, I have faith that we will be reunited soon.

581
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,770
Mr. Mo Yi.

582
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,310
Even though you're just an insignificant character, you are a nuisance.

583
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,210
Why did you do that, Mr. Mo Yi?

584
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,850
An immortal is unaffected by emotions.

585
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,870
So these are your true colors.

586
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,522
You're clever and capable.

587
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:49,292
Unfortunately, this time, you must die.

588
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,310
Master… Is it you, Master?

589
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,290
Master, are you here?

590
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,442
Has he awoken? Impossible.

591
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:22,260
Are you here?

592
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,120
So he isn't awake.

593
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,200
He is familiar with your aura,

594
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,550
and he protected you instinctively.

595
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,520
So be it.

596
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,424
He will never wake up after drinking the Oblivion Broth.

597
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:43,892
I'll seal him and his disciple in this cave forever.

598
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,640
Could my master be in here?

599
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,080
Master!

600
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,220
Master?

601
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,660
Master, wake up. It's me, Tang Lian.

602
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,780
Master. Master!

603
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,898
What did he drink that put him in such a deep sleep?

604
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,270
Oblivion Broth.

605
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,160
 Third place on the Top-Rank List. Baili Dongjun of Xueyue City.

606
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,020
 Master!

607
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,690
 Master! I've made a name for myself in the world!

608
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,060
 I don't understand.

609
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,439
 Why are you so determined to make yourself renowned in this world?

610
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:15,284
 When I was young, I met a girl.

611
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:18,520
 It was love at first sight. She told me…

612
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,690
 When you become someone famous,

613
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,170
 I'll know where you are and come to find you.

614
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,014
 The time I become famous is the time we will be reunited.

615
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,122
 I think she's here.

616
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,108
 Who are you?

617
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:36,420
 Are you asking for my name?

618
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,294
  I am Baili Dongjun.

619
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:43,206
 Dongjun. That's a nice name.

620
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,488
 I forgot to ask you the most important thing back then.

621
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:53,452
 What is your name?

622
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:55,171
 I'm Yue Yao.

623
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,418
Yue Yao…

624
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:01,550
Master. Master!

625
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
 How could it be you?

626
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,600
 Why are you dressed like Yueqing?

627
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,628
 Why did you endure my attack?

628
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,560
 Let her go.

629
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,880
 Take it as I died for her.

630
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,662
 I will bear all of her sins.

631
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,740
 No.

632
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,570
 Come with me. I'll take you to Changfeng.

633
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,380
 - He can heal you. 
 - It's too late.

634
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,378
 I'm already dead.

635
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,690
 Dead?

636
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,456
 Our meeting.

637
00:39:41,456 --> 00:39:43,320
 Our reunion.

638
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,254
 Don't you think all of this feels familiar?

639
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,300
 It's because we're in a dream.

640
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,192
 You knew all along.

641
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,640
 When you drink the Oblivion Broth,

642
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,876
 you remember those that you've forgotten,

643
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:09,056
 and the ones you've lost will return.

644
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,460
 Everything will change.

645
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,836
 Will you wake up,

646
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:25,528
 or will you stay in this dream?

647
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,380
 I want to live in a world where you exist forever.

648
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,892
 I've waited so long for this day.

649
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:40,528
 You silly man.

650
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,180
 I'm already dead.

651
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:04,950

652
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,725
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

653
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:16,105
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

654
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:19,125
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

655
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:23,775
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

656
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,955
♫  The roaring fate  ♫

657
00:41:26,955 --> 00:41:31,405
♫  Sweeping away the fog of time  ♫

658
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,405
♫  The past is desolate  ♫

659
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:39,125
♫  Waiting for the ride to the highest heaven  ♫

660
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:42,155
♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

661
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:46,675
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

662
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:49,775
♫  I face the sun  ♫

663
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:53,925
♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫

664
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:58,405
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

665
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:01,725
♫  I'm not wasting my youth away  ♫

666
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:04,005
♫  Like blade and sword, relying on each other  ♫

667
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,705
♫  With devoted friends and strong bonds  ♫

668
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:09,325
♫  No dream is small  ♫

669
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:13,695
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

670
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:16,975
♫  Youths ought to be fearless  ♫

671
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:20,655
♫  Visiting all corners of the world with our youthful spirits  ♫

672
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,155
♫  Traveling freely with friends  ♫

673
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:28,131
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫

674
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:35,055
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

675
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,205
♫  I'm not wasting my youth away  ♫

676
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,455
♫  Like blade and sword, relying on each other  ♫

677
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:43,225
♫  With devoted friends and strong bonds  ♫

678
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:46,301
♫  No dream is small  ♫

679
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:52,055
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

680
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:55,255
♫  Youths ought to be fearless  ♫

681
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:59,075
♫  Visiting all corners of the world with our youthful spirits  ♫

682
