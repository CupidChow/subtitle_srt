00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,060
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,860
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,420
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,440
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,900
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,920
It's called Beautiful Day.

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,240
Look! So many flowers.

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,620
Look at all the petals!

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,540
They're so beautiful!

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
- How beautiful. 
 - You're right.

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,540
One strike from the Sword Deity lasts forever.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,640
We still can't beat her.

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,540
That's the Xueyue Sword Deity.

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,060
How can we beat her?

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,020
It would be weird if we could.

34
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,240
What's the name of this sword?

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,220
Xueyue Sword Deity, I carved this sword myself from peach wood.

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,820
I haven't named it yet.

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,400
Why don't you name it for me, Sword Deity?

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,320
I can't be bothered to name it.

39
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,940
Why did you come to see me?

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,400
I've heard my master talk a lot about the Xueyue Sword Deity. So I was fascinated.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,680
I descended the mountain under Master's order.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,980
So...

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,720
So I wanted to meet you, Senior.

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,920
You've seen me now.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,960
Yes, I've finally met you! As expected from the Xueyue Sword Deity.

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,640
As you've already met me, why haven't you left yet?

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,760
Martial Uncle!

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Lift!

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,280
That's the Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,780
Li Fansong of Mount Wangcheng. Greetings, Third City Lord.

51
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,620
Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng. Greetings, Third City Lord.

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,920
Since you've already met the desired person, you can leave now.

53
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,040
Let's go.

54
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,380
Mount Wangcheng did a great job in dividing its teaching of martial arts skills and the way of heaven

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,620
in this generation.

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,540
It looks like Mount Wangcheng will take half of the future martial arts world from Xueyue City.

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,380
Who cares?

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,980
What about you?

59
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,160
Why did you want to see me?

60
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,480
Watch closely. Things are about to get interesting.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,360
I, Lei Wujie, greet the Xueyue Sword Deity.

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,620
I earnestly invite Xueyue Sword Deity to travel to Lei Fortress to see my master.

63
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,180
Third Master, is this what you meant by interesting?

64
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,180
 Don't tell me this lad doesn't know Hanyi's identity.

65
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,920
 Lei Hong really didn't tell him anything.

66
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,380
Lei Hong?

67
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,320
He wants to see me?

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,660
Master once told me he practiced swordsmanship

69
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,280
because he had witnessed your sword techniques.

70
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,660
Ever since then, he often thinks about it.

71
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,980
He hopes to meet you again.

72
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,680
At present, my master is currently caught up with other things.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
So he can't leave the Lei family.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,200
If I, Lei Wujie, may be so bold to earnestly invite the Xueyue Sword Deity to travel to Lei Fortress to see my master.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
All right.

76
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,440
I'll go with you.

77
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,140
But I have one condition.

78
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,420
 I can't be bothered to name it.

79
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,680
Sword Deity, please don't break it!

80
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,040

81
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,120
It's easy.

82
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,900
I want you to be my disciple.

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,360
Whenever you manage to block my move three times and take back this Shabu Sword,

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,580
I'll follow you back to meet Lei Hong.

85
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,320
Are you not willing?

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,220
Your extraordinary skills have fascinated me for a long time.

87
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,960
But... this is a serious matter.

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,220
I still have to notify my master about this.

89
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,260
Are you saying we must first meet Lei Hong before acknowledging me as your master?

90
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,940
Do you know what this is called?

91
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,540
Getting something for nothing.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Lei Wujie, being the disciple of the Sword Deity isn't something you could ask for.

93
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,260
Stop hesitating already.

94
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,600
I, Lei Wujie, pay my respects to my master, Xueyue Sword Deity.

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,320
 If Master Lei Hong disapproves of me in the future,

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,440
I shall die in gratitude for the teachings bestowed by both masters.

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,700
What a fool.

98
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,900
Come and see me behind the mountain tomorrow.

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,080
Life is unpredictable, like travelers who come and go suddenly.

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,780
You talk too much.

101
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,480
We've made a deal.

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,500
Ten thousand mountains couldn't prevent me from coming!

103
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,820
Lei Wujie, get up.

104
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,780
Lei Wujie, don't faint.

105
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,560
- You haven't paid me back yet. 
 - What?

106
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,820
Lei Wujie.

107
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,780
He has exhausted himself in this fight.

108
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,460
He's worn out now.

109
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,100
Since you've put it that way,

110
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,240
you're now officially his senior brother.

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,900
Your junior brother owes me 800 silver taels.

112
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,980
As his senior brother, you can maybe help him pay off the debt.

113
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,200
Then I can return to Snowfall Villa.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,920
I don't have any money.

115
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,160
Who has it, then?

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,740
Come on. Let's go.

117
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,160
That's right.

118
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,820
I'm responsible for all the expenditures in Xueyue City.

119
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,840
The problem is solved, then.

120
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,280
800 silver taels.

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,900
Tang Lian said you're Xiao Se.

122
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,960
- So what? 
 - It's a good name.

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
Stop flattering me.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,820
Just pay up.

125
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,280
I need to continue on my journey.

126
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,020
Xiao Se, you...

127
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,460
Of course, a debt must be paid.

128
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,540
But I'd like to invite you to stay in Xueyue City for a few days.

129
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,780
I do have some questions that I would like your advice on.

130
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,060
What if I refuse?

131
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,420
Are you going to force me to stay?

132
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,220
Of course not.

133
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,740
I do have a selfish reason for wanting you to stay.

134
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,540
What reason?

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,320
I, Changfeng, would like to take you as my disciple.

136
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Father, what are you saying?

137
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,560
I, Changfeng, would like to take you as my disciple.

138
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,100
You want to take me as your disciple...

139
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Why should I agree?

140
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,140
My martial arts skills in the martial arts world are considered decent.

141
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't even practice martial arts.

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,340
Other than martial arts, my skill in playing GO is unparalleled in the world.

143
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,520
Does Brother Xiao like playing GO?

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,160
I can't say that I like it.

145
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
- But I've never lost. 
 - Great.

146
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,420
How about we play one round?

147
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,720
If you win, then I won't push you anymore.

148
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,340
What do you say?

149
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,580
All right, Xueyue City...

150
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,830

151
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,880
This is how you tricked Fairy Luoxia into staying here back then?

152
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
A bet is a bet.

153
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,640
How is it a trick? Shall we begin?

154
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,680
Go is a game of trickery, not of the right path.

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,200
I didn't expect the dignified Third City Lord to be so immersed in such trickery.

156
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,800
If the four cities are the pawns and the world is the board,

157
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,860
could it be regarded as the right path?

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,700
Third City Lord, you sure have big plans.

159
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
But I don't.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,420
In my opinion, any plan can't compare to money.

161
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,680
You don't have such ambition, but you want money.

162
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,740
That I don't understand.

163
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,260
Of course, I have other use for it.

164
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,000
If you don't want to pay, forget it then.

165
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,440
How about this?

166
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,520
As long as you accept me as your master,

167
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,380
I'll let you manage the finances of Xueyue City.

168
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,860
What do you think?

169
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,900
Third City Lord, is it worth for you to do this?

170
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,860
This is Xueyue City's choice.

171
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,040
- Monthly salary. 
 - 800 silver taels.

172
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,060
Not enough.

173
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,840
How much do you want then?

174
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,420
A total of eight million silver taels.

175
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,500
You can pay me after I leave the city.

176
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,020
Did you say eight million silver taels?

177
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,680
Why don't you just say you want to be the City Lord?

178
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
All right. It's a deal.

179
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
Since you don't want to stay,

180
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,780
but the four cities as pawns and the world as the board has already been laid out.

181
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,880
Everyone of us here is a pawn.

182
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,920
You and I are no exception.

183
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
That's just what you think.

184
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,340

185
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,900
 The plum blossoms in Fallen Snow Villa always wither in a moment.

186
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,260
 Often at this time, the snow will lightly flurry.

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,680
 When Father was still alive,

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,120
 he would wait to view this fleeting beautiful scene.

189
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,680
He called such scenery the death of snow.

190
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,280
He thought when the plum blossoms withered,

191
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,000
the snow would also die with them.

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,060
I've waited so long to witness this death of snow.

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,360
Yet, you cut them off with your blade.

194
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Take her away.

195
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,280
Once she wakes up, she'll forget what happened.

196
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,760
Since the twelve Lin Blades have all been broken,

197
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll leave the rest for you all to handle.

198
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,000
Sect Master, we received some news about your friends just now.

199
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,600
How are they doing lately?

200
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
After Tang Lian left Yushi,

201
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,640
he returned to the Tang Clan to meet the master of the Tang Clan, Tang Lianyue.

202
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,060
Xiao Se and Lei Wujie spent three months

203
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,920
wandering in circles before reaching Xueyue City.

204
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,300
Lei Wujie went to Dengtian Tower and reached the top.

205
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,580
He and Zhao Yuzhen, the Tao Sword Deity's disciple,

206
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,200
challenged the Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi, at the same time.

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,580
He lost after one strike from Li Hanyi,

208
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,640
but she took him as her first ever disciple.

209
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,420
This lad sure has good luck.

210
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,980
To be accepted as the Xueyue Sword Deity's disciple...

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,180
But I heard his other master, Lei Hong, and Li Hanyi go way back.

212
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,860
What about the other one?

213
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,020
The stingy innkeeper.

214
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,100
Did he return to his Snowfall Mountain Villa?

215
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,300
Xiao Se is also staying in Xueyue City.

216
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,720
He's become a disciple of the Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng.

217
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,540
I had thought it'd be the Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun.

218
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,420
I'm sure those friends of mine will be famous in the martial arts world soon.

219
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,800
I can't wait

220
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,840
for us to meet again.

221
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,640
Xiao Se!

222
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,500
- You're finally up? 
 - How long did I sleep?

223
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,600
One day and one night.

224
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,380
That long?

225
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,320
Then, are you waiting for me to bid farewell to me?

226
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,120
Do you really want me to go that badly?

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you trying to run from your debt after knowing you can't afford to pay me the 800 silver taels?

228
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
No.

229
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,660
Then...

230
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,140
I'll go and ask for the money from my eldest senior brother.

231
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,220
Go on.

232
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,720
You just wait here.

233
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,220
What do you want?

234
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,160
Third Master already gave him money.

235
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,020
Don't let him fool you.

236
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,780
- Eldest Senior Brother.  
 - It's finally justifiable to address me that way now.

237
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,940
Oh right, let me introduce you.

238
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,400
The one sitting next to you is your third junior brother.

239
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,780
Third junior brother?

240
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,740
After you paid respects to Second Master as your master,

241
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,440
Xiao Se was also taken in as a disciple by Third Master.

242
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,900
Everyone in Xueyue City might be martial brothers,

243
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,920
but we're the only three disciples of the three city lords.

244
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,680
No matter who joined as a disciple first or the masters' seniority, that's how it should be arranged.

245
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Am I right, Third Junior Brother?

246
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,740
I never imagined that I would be in the same sect as Brother Xiao Se.

247
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,820
I had thought that I would feel a bit sad to part ways with you since we've gotten along really well.

248
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,200
It's all good now!

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
We can always be together now.

250
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,840
Who wants to be with you?

251
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Get lost.

252
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,360
Brother Lei, you sure have the enthusiasm of a young man.

253
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,420
Listen me tell you.

254
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,440
The three of us should travel the martial arts world together,

255
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,680
just like what the three city lords did in their youth.

256
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,900
We should impress the world too!

257
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,300
That's not a bad idea.

258
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,360
Lei Wujie, Li Hanyi told you to meet her the next day.

259
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,460
But it looks like it's going to get dark soon.

260
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,760
The dignified Second City Lord always keeps her word.

261
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,320
If you're late, I'm guessing that "nothing can stop you" promise doesn't count anymore.

262
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Farewell!

263
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,200
What an airhead.

264
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,120
Isn't that what a young man of his age is like?

265
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,860
Always rushing forward, caring about nothing else.

266
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,060
That's why I called him an airhead.

267
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,790
Are you really staying in Xueyue City

268
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,640
just because of that 800 taels of silver?

269
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,260
Wrong. It's eight million.

270
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,920
Xiao Se, I have a question I want to ask you.

271
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,220
When Master Lianyue sent me to Xueyue City that year,

272
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,460
he told me to wait for someone on behalf of the Tang Clan.

273
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,480
Is this person you?

274
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,060
Of course not.

275
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,960
You answered without thinking.

276
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,760
You really are pretty strange.

277
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,940
Even if you were to wait, you should be waiting for a beautiful woman.

278
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,680
Why would you wait for a man like me?

279
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
You look like you've experienced the world.

280
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
But you're not that old.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,460
You're just a few years older than Lei Wujie, right?

282
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,540
Why do you care?

283
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,280
I don't care.

284
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,000
But someone else does.

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Well said.

286
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,360
Third Master.

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,200
It looks like I have a lot of guests in this small courtyard today.

288
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,420
Xiao Se, why aren't you greeting Third Master?

289
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,360
It's all right.

290
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,040
I wanted to accept you as my disciple, but you never agreed to it.

291
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,140
Tang Lian, Qianluo, please wait outside.

292
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,560
I have something important to discuss with Brother Xiao.

293
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,240
- Yes, Father. 
 - Yes, Third Master.

294
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,440
I've noticed that you don't like me.

295
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Why should I like you?

296
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,260
Is it because you're the one and only Spear Deity?

297
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,540
Are you blaming me for that incident?

298
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,260
I don't blame you.

299
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,800
It's everyone's choice to avoid what's unfavorable to them.

300
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm just not like those who think highly of you.

301
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,500
So what if you're the one and only Spear Deity?

302
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
You want to take me as your disciple?

303
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,300
You're still not qualified enough.

304
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,520
When your imperial uncle was imprisoned back then,

305
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,960
I was already planning to leave Xueyue City and head to Tianqi City with my long spear.

306
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,140
But at the time, I received a letter.

307
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,140
This letter was written by your imperial uncle himself.

308
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,120
What did my imperial uncle write in the letter?

309
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,880
He wanted me to stay in Xueyue City no matter what happened next.

310
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,020
Are you sure it was written by my imperial uncle?

311
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,880
I'm sure you can recognize your imperial uncle's handwriting better than I can.

312
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,740
Nobody in the world can imitate such beautiful penmanship.

313
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I didn't intend to do as he said.

314
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,500
But back then, he was known as an official who never miscalculated his plans.

315
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,120
I had thought this might be a part of his plan.

316
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,740
If I had gone, I might have ruined his plans.

317
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,780
But I never imagined

318
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,500
that he would end up dead.

319
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,560
No one would have expected this.

320
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,800
I really regretted it.

321
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,840
At that time, I should've torn his letter into pieces

322
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,020
and rushed to Tianqi to rescue him.

323
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,240
But today, I'll never do anything that would make me regret it anymore.

324
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,480
What are you doing?

325
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,800
Qianluo, don't worry.

326
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,240
Third Master will not make things difficult for Xiao Se.

327
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,280

328
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,760
So you weren't pretending.

329
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,460
Your martial arts skills are indeed crippled.

330
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,220
You should mind your own business.

331
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,280
I, Sikong Changfeng, can be considered Medicine King Xin Baicao's disciple.

332
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,440
In terms of medical skills,

333
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I can at least rank in the top five in the world.

334
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,640
So...

335
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,560
You can help?

336
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,080
You have poor blood circulation.

337
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,840
It'll have serious consequences for your hidden meridians.

338
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,440
What does that mean?

339
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,420
You should exercise more.

340
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,920
Father, you didn't beat him up, did you?

341
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
What do you think?

342
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,260
Qianluo, didn't you say you feel less passionate

343
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,020
 because there's no opponent to spar with you?

344
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,420
 Father, why are you talking about this all of a sudden?

345
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,180
Xiao Se's lightness techniques are good.

346
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,000
If your spear can outrun him, it means you've improved.

347
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,780
I already told him just now,

348
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,260
in the future, both of you will practice together.

349
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,300
When did I agree to that?

350
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,340
I shall follow your order, Father.

351
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,100
Master!

352
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,860
- Master! 
 - Stop.

353
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,980
Why are you so late?

354
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,360
I was too tired and overslept.

355
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,780
Kneel!

356
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,800
You're truly a simpleton.

357
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,800
Why haven't you greeted me formally yet?

358
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,900
I, Lei Wujie, pay my respects to Master.

359
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,860
Why did I take in such a disciple?

360
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,880
Get up.

361
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,660
Lei Wujie.

362
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,960
Yes, Master.

363
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,420
Do you know why you draw your sword as a swordsman?

364
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,420
Why I draw my sword?

365
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,960
Some people draw their swords because they want to be heroes.

366
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,420
They want to use the power of their swords to fight injustice in the world.

367
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,660
Some people draw their swords because of fear.

368
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,560
If they don't draw their swords, others will draw their swords.

369
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,360
If they don't want to die, they can only draw their swords.

370
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,840
So let me ask you, why do you draw your sword?

371
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,820
Master... I've never thought about this before.

372
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,720
Then why did you choose to practice swordsmanship back then?

373
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,320
The other day, I saw my master waving his sleeves

374
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,580
and soaring into the sky with a fiery red long sword.

375
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,180
That red light even made the clouds appear red.

376
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,180
I've never seen such profound swordsmanship in my life.

377
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,720
At that time, Master asked if I wanted to learn it.

378
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,480
I didn't even hesitate because I was amazed by the beauty of the sword at that moment.

379
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,100
That's right.

380
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,420
The sword is the most beautiful thing in the world.

381
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,240
If your master had not seen the beauty of a sword,

382
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,680
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

383
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,680
But you were talking about practicing swordsmanship.

384
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,300
I'm asking about drawing your sword.

385
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,760
These are two different things.

386
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,560
You can romanticize swordsmanship.

387
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,340
But drawing the sword can only mean life and death.

388
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,620
"Life and death"?

389
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,160
Yes, life and death in the martial arts world are very simple things.

390
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,400
It seems people draw their swords when they disagree with each other.

391
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,100
When the sword slits their necks, they'll just die.

392
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,740
But I don't approve of such a martial arts world.

393
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,920
Victory and defeat in the martial arts world are common.

394
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,140
Is there a need to involve life and death?

395
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,320
So, we can discuss the way of the sword, not life and death when we draw our swords.

396
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,240
You don't want to talk about life and death?

397
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,440
But what if others draw their swords and want you to die,

398
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,800
are you going to die just like that?

399
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,260
Then I-I'll...

400
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,780
This sword is called Tingyu Sword. 
  (T/N: Listen to the rain)

401
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,760
It was forged by the Head of the Sword Heart Tomb.

402
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,660
It's one of the Elegant Four Swords.

403
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,300
I shall give it to you as a gift for becoming my disciple.

404
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,740
Tingyu Sword?

405
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,140
Master, something is wrong with this sword.

406
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,380
Tingyu Sword is a spiritual sword.

407
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,940
It recognizes its master.

408
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,140
You don't have the will to draw your sword.

409
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,120
That's why you can't draw it.

410
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,920
Tingyu Sword?

411
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,060
That was the first sword you got when you first entered the world of martial arts.

412
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,340
It looks like you're pretty generous with your disciple.

413
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,720
But no matter how I've pressured him for the past few days,

414
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
he still can't draw that sword.

415
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,860
Do you really hope he'll be able to draw the sword while fighting with you?

416
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,600
Drawing his sword in the face of life and death is the best way.

417
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,620
I'm just worried that he doesn't draw his sword for himself, but for others.

418
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,060
Let's not talk about this anymore.

419
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,860
Are you reviewing your medical skills lately?

420
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,840
Why are you looking at these meridian charts?

421
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,720
I also took in a disciple.

422
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,420
But his hidden meridians are damaged.

423
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,560
So he can't use his martial arts anymore.

424
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,100
It's that serious?

425
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,840
Yes.

426
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,940
I wrote a letter to Xie Xuan to see if he has a better solution.

427
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,080
That stupid scholar.

428
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,560
If he really does come, you mustn't ask him to spar with you.

429
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,240
Your disciple can't draw his sword.

430
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Instead of guiding him, why did you let him descend the mountain?

431
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,220
I told him to go.

432
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,540
I want him to understand the true meaning of drawing the sword.

433
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,060
Lei Wujie?

434
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,220
It's you, Senior Brother Luo Mingxuan.

435
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,480
You've been cultivating with the Second City Lord in the mountain for ten days.

436
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,620
It's been so hard to find you.

437
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,280
So when are you going to pay me back the 300 silver taels you owe me?

438
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,220
- Master. 
 - Do you think a loser has the right to ask for money?

439
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,800
Stop embarrassing me here.

440
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,140
Are you Lei Wujie?

441
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,740
I'm Yin Luoxia.

442
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,840
I've heard so much about you, Fairy Luoxia.

443
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,340
Why did you leave the mountain?

444
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,820
Where's your master?

445
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,440
My master went into seclusion to cultivate.

446
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,020
So she asked me to come back down for a few days and not disturb her.

447
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,480
Seclusion?

448
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,280
Don't tell me he's coming again.

449
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,860
What did you say?

450
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,920
Nothing.

451
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,240
Mingxuan, why are you swaying back and forth?

452
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,860
Can't you stand still?

453
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,080
Tingyu Sword?

454
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,400
I didn't expect your master would pass it down to you.

455
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,460
Do you know its origin?

456
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,400
Master said this was the sword she used in her early years.

457
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,720
But no matter what, I can't seem to draw it.

458
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,020
Do you know the reason for drawing a sword?

459
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,360
 Don't run!

460
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,860
They're getting faster every day.

461
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,360
Xiao Se!

462
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,920
Walking on Clouds is indeed the world's top lightness technique.

463
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,580
Xiao Se has no inner force at all.

464
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,500
Yet his lightness techniques are at the level possessed by experts of the Carefree Phase.

465
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,080
Watch where you swing that thing.

466
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Do you know what you're trying to swing at?

467
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,860
This is Yunyan's finest cotton.

468
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,540
It costs 1,000 silver taels a bolt.

469
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,600
I don't care what it is.

470
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,000
- Lei Wujie! 
 - I'm coming!

471
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,520
Is there anything I can help you with, Junior Brother Xiao?

472
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,940
Get lost.

473
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,140
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,540
I dare you to call me Junior Brother again.

475
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,600
Senior Qianluo, why are you chasing after my Brother Xiao?

476
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
Can't you just address me as an older brother?

477
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,580
Lei Wujie, this doesn't concern you, let go.

478
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,480
Xiao...

479
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,320
Are you going to say I have to get your permission first before trying to beat your Brother Xiao?

480
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,820
All right. I won't beat your Brother Xiao today.

481
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,320
I'll beat you instead.

482
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,660
I'd like to see just how special you are

483
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,780
to make the Xueyue Sword Deity take you as her disciple!

484
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,020
Xiao Se, I can't beat her!

485
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,580
If you manage to make her fall flat on the ground, I'll give you 800 silver taels.

486
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,880
- How about 8,000 silver taels? 
 - I...

487
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,460
Make me fall flat on the ground?

488
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,820
Neither of you can get away today.

489
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,960
Xiao Se, what did you do to provoke her?

490
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,220
Who would provoke someone like her for no reason?

491
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,400
Xiao Se, what did you say?

492
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,500
What do you mean by someone like me?

493
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,700
Someone that chases after men all day without any shame.

494
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,120
- You... 
 - Lei Wujie!

495
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,260
You can't even keep them here.

496
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,280
I feel sorry for this Yinyue Spear.

497
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,700
I would've kept them here with that shot just now.

498
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,940
Stop joking around.

499
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,020
You missed the shot on purpose.

500
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,060
Not just today, she has been throwing it that way for the past four days.

501
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,140
All right. Watch me teach him a lesson today!

502
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,080
Him?

503
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,580
I mean them.

504
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,160
I don't think she came after us.

505
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,420
Are you hurt?

506
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,060
I'm fine.

507
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,680
Hey! This is Yunyan's finest cotton!

508
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,560
It must be expensive, right?

509
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,780
W-Well, not really.

510
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,680
The main thing is that it doesn't absorb blood.

511
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,200
Let's go. I'll find some water to wipe it off for you.

512
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,080
Let's go.

513
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,080

514
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,360
Hurry up.

515
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,640
We were passing by and are sorry to disrupt you.

516
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,220
 It's him?

517
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,040
 It's her?

518
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,980

519
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,620
Lei Wujie,

520
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,100
your nose is bleeding.

521
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,960
Use this.

522
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,660
No, it's all right. I can do it myself.

523
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,820
This is Luo brocade. This handkerchief costs at least 80 silver taels.

524
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,020
It's all right! Really.

525
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,880
Miss, are you...

526
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,920
Those two rascals must be somewhere nearby.

527
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,140
Oh, no. How did she catch up so quickly?

528
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,540
Wait. Why don't you go inside my chamber?

529
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,460

530
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,800
There are experts everywhere in Xueyue City.

531
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Let's go.

532
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,080
Sister Ye, how are you?

533
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,620
Miss Qianluo.

534
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,500
Did you see two rascals passing by here?

535
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,400
What do the two rascals look like?

536
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,060
One of them wears red with a sword in his hand.

537
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,420
The other one is dressed in green.

538
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,540
In any case, they don't look like decent people.

539
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,240
I didn't see them.

540
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,440
If I see them, I'll tell you.

541
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
The weather is getting cold lately.

542
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,820
Sister Ye, you're not in good health.

543
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,620
So you should rest more indoors.

544
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,740
I won't be bothering you anymore.

545
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,500
Sister Ye, please get some rest!

546
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,760
I'll come and visit you in a couple of days!

547
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,760
You can come out now.

548
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,540
Is she really gone?

549
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,100
Thank you, Miss. May I know your name?

550
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,960
It was nothing.

551
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,000
Come on.

552
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,720
Thank you.

553
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,560
It's been a long time, Xiao Chuhe.

554
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,580
Why did you drag me away?

555
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,180
If I hadn't dragged you away,

556
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,980
would you have asked her age and if she was married?

557
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,920
I... I wouldn't have.

558
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,420
She didn't answer any of your questions.

559
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,920
That means she clearly didn't want to talk to you.

560
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,260
Why would you stay there then?

561
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,960
Besides, it won't be hard if you wanted to see her again.

562
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,500
Sikong Qianluo knows her, right?

563
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,580
You can ask Tang Lian.

564
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,700
That's right!

565
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,880
What is it that you want to ask me?

566
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,340
Eldest Senior Brother!

567
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,260
Xiao Se, you were chased by the Young Lady all over the city all day.

568
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,720
Can't you just stop?

569
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,260
How is that my fault?

570
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm now in charge of Xueyue City's finances.

571
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,380
Yet, she keeps bothering me every day, saying she wants to spar with me.

572
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,760
I don't even know martial arts.

573
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,160
Insulting her that gently is already being nice to her.

574
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,100
Yesterday, you imitated her trying to steal the Golden Coffin, by pinching your nose as you talked.

575
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,940
So what did you do to upset her today?

576
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,880
Today, he said Qianluo is one of those women who chase after men.

577
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,260
I can't believe you laughed.

578
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,740
You can't even defeat Qianluo.

579
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,080
I really don't want to be your eldest senior brother anymore.

580
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,440
Who says this?

581
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,840
If I had my Shabu, it would at least be a draw.

582
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,400
But what's wrong with Tingyu Sword?

583
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,060
My master said...

584
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,580
 Wrong.

585
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,160
 I told you it's not about using your strength to draw it.

586
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,700
 You don't have the will to draw the sword.

587
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,480
 That's why you can't draw it.

588
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,520
 "The will to draw the sword"?

589
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,280
 What is that?

590
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,960
 You need to find the reason to draw your sword.

591
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,440
That's right.

592
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,020
The sword forged by the Sword Heart Tomb is indeed different.

593
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,380
It's said that the last step of their sword forging was to make their palm bleed and feed the sword blood.

594
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,060
So the swords that were forged in the end are said to have souls.

595
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,680
However, with your talent, drawing the sword is only a matter of time.

596
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,540
Since it's rare for you to be here, why don't we go and have a drink?

597
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,680
Good idea! I have one more thing to ask you.

598
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,240
With this know-it-all around,

599
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,740
what would you need to ask me about?

600
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,420
Isn't that right?

601
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,920
I want to ask about Master Lei Hong, Master Li Hanyi,

602
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,600
and the Tao Sword Deity of Mount Wangcheng, Zhao Yuzhen.

603
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,280
What's the story between the three of them?

604
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,100
 Miss, who are you?

605
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,340

606
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,740
♫   Deep in the clouds, I hear your zither whispering faintly  ♫

607
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,180

608
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,400

609
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,500
♫   Turns every scene into a dream  ♫

610
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,380
♫   Alas, one thought is all it takes to reunite and one to part  ♫

611
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,340
♫   Alas, one thought is all it takes to reunite and one to part  ♫

612
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,220
♫   This life is full of tribulations  ♫

613
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:39,960
♫   The seasons are just our fates passing through this life  ♫

614
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,000
♫   A moment of romance, a moment to remember  ♫

615
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,680
♫   It's hard for tears to untie the knot in my heart  ♫

616
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,020
♫   When feelings disappear, who's to blame?  ♫

617
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,800
♫   When feelings disappear, who's to blame?  ♫

618
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,660
♫   A lifetime of longing for the love of half a lifetime  ♫

619
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,360
♫   The seasons never age and this love will last forever  ♫

♫   In the end, looking back  ♫

621
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,520
♫   You are in the waning light  ♫

622
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,000
 Miss, who are you?

623
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,940
 How did you know I was a lady?

624
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,000
 All you did was wearing men's clothes and applying a fake mustache.

625
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,980
 Only the child who's guarding the small mountain path would fall for that trick.

626
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,820
 You're Zhao Yuzhen?

627
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,880
 Yes, I'm Zhao Yuzhen.

628
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,260
 Why don't you come and sit with me?

629
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,040
 We'll be able to have peaches in a while.

630
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,480
 Peaches?

631
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,620
 Yes, peaches.

632
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,700
 I infused my wooden sword with the Fire Formation Secret Arts and stuck it under the tree.

633
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,780
 In another hour, the peaches will grow.

634
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,060
 Fire Formation Secret Arts?

635
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
 The supreme mental cultivation method of Mount Wangcheng.

636
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,480
 And you're using it to grow peaches?

637
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,300
 What's the point of learning it otherwise?

638
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,740
 I'm Li Hanyi from Xueyue City.

639
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,440
 I heard you're the youngest celestial master in the history of Mount Wangcheng.

640
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,840
 I'm here to ask you to show your swordsmanship.

641
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,800
 Xueyue City?

642
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,560
 Li Hanyi?

643
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,620
 These words sound pretty cold when they're put together.

644
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,240
 It better not stop my peaches from growing.

645
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,100
 Stop talking nonsense. Watch my sword!

646
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,720
 Taiyi Lion Secret Arts?

647
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,240
 I'm here to test your swordsmanship!

648
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,220
 Don't fight me with such spells!

649
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,580
 Can't you be reasonable?

650
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,900
 I can't fight right now.

651
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,120
 Why not?

652
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,780
 My sword is under the tree.

653
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,460
 If I pull it out, I won't have peaches to eat anymore.

654
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,720
 Eat peaches?

655
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,120
 Yes, eat peaches.

656
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,740
 You can forget about eating them!

657
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,560
 Come forth!

658
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,540
 What's wrong with my Tingyu Sword?

659
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,040
 - You... 
 - I knew you were a wo...

660
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,060
 woman.

661
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,080
 But that doesn't do you justice.

662
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,800
 You're like a fairy.

663
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:04,960

664
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,840
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

665
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,180
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

666
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,340
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

667
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,880
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

668
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,180
♫  The roaring fate  ♫

669

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,540
♫  The past is desolate  ♫

671

♫  Waiting for the ride to the highest heaven  ♫

672
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,280
♫  The ethereal fog  ♫

673
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,880
♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

674
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,980
♫  I face the sun  ♫

675
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,140
♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫

676
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,540
♫  Traveling far and overcoming challenges life throws my way  ♫

♫  I'm not wasting my youth away  ♫

678
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,220
♫  Like blade and sword, relying on each other  ♫

679
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,840
♫  With devoted friends and strong bonds  ♫

680
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,360
♫  No dream is small  ♫

681
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,860
♫  Despite conflicts and the feuds, we sing proudly  ♫

682
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,080
