22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,940

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,980

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,610
Your Majesty. Don't think about the problems.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,030
You just need to trust me.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,620
Of course, I do.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,440
The thing is

28
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,690
I want you to do me a favor.

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,440
What is it?

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,900
Use your healing skills to extend my life

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,680
for a few more days.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,550
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,070
There is a reason why I say this.

34
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,920
The chaos in Tianqi has yet to end.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,140
If I were to die now, probably Tianqi would fall apart.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,460
If otherwise, Chuhe and the rest still have a rock to depend on.

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,250
I'm old already.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,590
There is nothing much left I can help with my three sons.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,140
All I can do now

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,860
is merely struggle to breathe for a few days more.

41
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,430
I will do my best.

42
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:17,375

43
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,620
Jin Xuan is merely locked up by His Majesty?

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,440
Yes. Still, I'm not surprised by this.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,010
After all, Jin Xuan is only a eunuch and nothing more.

46
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,460
He's not capable of making waves in the Imperial Court.

47
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,540
Father is surely aware that he meddles in the partisans.

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,060
Anyway, he has done more than enough.

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,390
Currently, Pingxin Hall is heavily guarded by eighty imperial guards day and night.

50
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,660
Not even a fly can sneak in.

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,870
Prince Chi has lost his important aide, I suppose.

52
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,520
What's our next plan?

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,860
I will reclaim Wu Xin.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,410
So this time they are all mature works, right?

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,290
One is contrived from the blood of his kin.

56
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,940
While another one is contrived from the blood of her beloved one.

57
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,740
Very good.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,650
By then, I would like to ask Xiao Chuhe

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,860
what he feels to die in the hand of his best friend.

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Master.

61
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,540
How is the treatment?

62
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,920
It is beyond my ability. It seems I'm going to ruin the reputation of Medicine Valley.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,830
Master. Look at it this way.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,250
Previously, Xiao Se told us it was Night Crow who poisoned His Majesty.

65
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,720
And Night Crow was once part of Medicine Valley.

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,430
In that case, the reputation of Medicine Valley is not considered ruined.

67
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,590
It's not ruined.

68
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,180
Are you saying it's just my own reputation ruined?

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,820
Master. I-I-I didn't mean that.

70
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,970
Ever since I noticed the problem with the oil lamp, we have started to check on the lamps on daily basis.

71
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,860
Every time we get to solve her mechanism, she will come up with a new one.

72
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,120
It seems that killing her is the only way to stop all of this.

73
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,180
I wonder when the chaos will come to an end.

74
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,500

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,900
Can this tonic crack the Art of Drugs on Wu Xin?

76
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,520
My master has checked on this.

77
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,260
Plus, the tonic is concocted strictly according to the book.

78
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,580
Speaking of its efficiency, I can't be certain of it.

79
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,280
Anyway, we have to give it a shot.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,760
But where is Ghost Physician Night Crow?

81
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,370
Where did she imprison Wu Xin?

82
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,070
Let's meet someone.

83
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,610
Who is it?

84
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,980
Shall I inform Sister Qianluo and Miss Ruoyi?

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,790
No need. Just the two of us.

86
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,250
Sure.

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,170
Xiao Se. You have been acting weird lately.

88
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,080
Why do you say so?

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,430
Before, you would always bring along Sister Qianluo and Miss Ruoyi

90
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,810
unless they were not around or occupied with something.

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,980
However, I notice that you only let me tag along and purposely send others away,

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,260
including Mu Chunfeng and Miss Ji Xue.

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,700
Do you know why I returned to Tianqi?

94
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,690
Because this is your home.

95
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,950
You're just coming back home from the journey.

96
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,850
Do you know why I was exiled?

97
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes. It was because of Prince Langya Mutiny.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,590
Exactly so.

99
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,800
Now that his name is cleared and Ye Xiaoying has left Tianqi.

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,730
Everything I've been planning to do is almost completed.

101
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,960
As for the remaining one, it will be done soon too.

102
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,540
By then, will you leave Tianqi?

103
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,230
Xiao Se. I don't really get you.

104
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,980
As you know, I'm kind of simple-minded.

105
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,920
Can you please make it simple?

106
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,490
Although you inherited the Guardians' Tokens and became my guardians,

107
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,180
do you really want to follow wherever I go in the future?

108
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,060
Since Prince Langya Mutiny is put right, your task has ended already.

109
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,550
Be it senior brother or Wu Xin, they ended up like this because of me.

110
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,670
I shouldn't drag my friend into trouble as to save another friend again.

111
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,440
When you put it like that, I get it now.

112
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,340
Prince Langya's name has been cleared, therefore, our duty of protecting you has terminated.

113
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,480
As for the rest challenges, you don't wish to have Qianluo and the rest involved.

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Yes.

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,110
- I have one question. 
 - Go on.

116
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,290
Why do you bring me along?

117
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,980
Isn't my life as precious as theirs?

118
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,740
Well...

119
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,240
I got it.

120
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,550
It is because I'm robust.

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,940
Hero Lei said it right.

122
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,260
All right. I get what you mean.

123
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,320
Rest assured.

124
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,760
I will protect all of them with you.

125
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,230
- Deal. 
 - Deal.

126
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,950
Why is it you?

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,680
We meet again.

128
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,230
Calm down.

129
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,290
I invited him over.

130
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,880
The one we're meeting today is him?

131
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,090
But he's from Dark River.

132
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,880
That's the reason why we meet him here.

133
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,830
He was one of those who tried to kill my sister.

134
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,150
I wrote to your sister before this.

135
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,000
In fact, Mr. Su, the head of the Su family, and your sister go way back.

136
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,350
What did she say?

137
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,680
According to her letter, she said that even though Mr. Su belongs to Dark River,

138
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,970
however, he is different from the vermin of Dark River.

139
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,070
He's an assassin but with a kind heart within.

140
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,860
Therefore, your sister isn't against our meeting with him.

141
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,740
I didn't mean to kill City Lord Li.

142
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,570
I was summoned to halt her.

143
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,980
Since she isn't against this, I won't say much.

144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,770
Mr. Su has his own set of principles, and I'm clear about this.

145
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,960
However, news came out that many assassins of Dark River have already left Tianqi,

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,890
including the head of the Mu family, Mu Yumo.

147
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:37,010
Besides, the drugged testers contrived by Xiao Yu appeared at Prince Bai's Residence that day.

148
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,370
Only a few assassins of Dark River

149
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,110
were able to paint the Bearer of Swords and the successor of Heart Sword Tomb into a corner.

150
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,430
Mr. Su, you just sat by and did nothing there.

151
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,740
Instead, you took away one of the testers.

152
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,320
 Master, help me.

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,360
Therefore, I presume that you don't know about the drugged tester.

154
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,520
The scheme was plotted by Xiao Yu and the Leader.

155
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,050
Afterward, assassins from Su and Mu families left Tianqi.

156
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,260
Only assassins from the Xie family who have lost their head stay.

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,520
And that proved I was right.

158
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,290
The drugged testers incident has caused Su and Mu families to not be on the same page as the Leader.

159
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,320
You're indeed intelligent, Your Highness.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,080
You could actually restore the whole story by piecing fragments of information together.

161
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,470
You're right. Leader didn't tell Yumo and me about that.

162
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,660
He has Ghost Physician Night Crow to turn a large number of Dark River assassins into drugged testers.

163
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,700
Upon knowing this, we had several negotiations with Leader, but to no avail.

164
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,800
You used to make a perfect team.

165
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,780
But now, the decision of Su Changhe is leading Dark River to its downfall.

166
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,260
Did you invite me here just to prove your guess, Your Highness?

167
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,580
No.

168
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,570
I'm here to persuade you to collaborate with me instead.

169
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,840
Collaborate with you?

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,360
Currently, the majority of the Dark River members are under the control of the Leader.

171
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,340
It's impossible for you alone to rescue them.

172
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,320
If you turn down my proposition,

173
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,890
I would ask Xueyue City to launch carnage against those who are about to return to Dark River

174
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,560
and none of them will be left alive.

175
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,840
You're threatening me, aren't you?

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,930
I will try fair means before resorting to force.

177
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,550
What if I say yes?

178
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,810
We collaborate to get rid of the Leader.

179
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,310
When you and Dark River members return to the martial arts world afterward,

180
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,210
I will forgo the grievances between us.

181
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,010
But still and all, Dark River is only allowed to exist as a common sect,

182
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,870
not the assassin syndicate.

183
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,210
There is no one born to kill.

184
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,900
Xiao Se.

185
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,750
Did he agree?

186
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,220
He has no reason to say no.

187
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,650

188
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,030
Your Highness. Ao Yu, the Crown Prince of Nanjue has sent a message.

189
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,700
Their envoys have entered Tianqi.

190
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,730
They request to meet you tonight.

191
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,910
This devious fox is getting impatience after seeing the situation in Tianqi City.

192
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,850
Fine. I will meet them tonight.

193
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,450
Where are they?

194
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,050
Liuxian Parlor, in the south of the capital.

195
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,090
How come they pick a remote place like such?

196
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,425

197
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,440
You're here too, Miss Ruoyi.

198
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,190
Qianluo is upset as you have been going out without her recently.

199
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,250
We didn't go somewhere special though.

200
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,230
It has been peaceful in Tianqi recently,

201
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,700
so I asked him to bring me somewhere fun.

202
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,600
What fun places have you been to?

203
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,330
We went to the...

204
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,980
I guess Xiao Se took you to Full Bloom Parlor, right?

205
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,310
It's an amusing place.

206
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes.

207
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,080
This is it.

208
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,100
The flowers are fragrant and beautiful.

209
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,430
They are soft and warm to hold.

210
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,550
Certainly. Soft and warm.

211
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,790
You little airhead.

212
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,970
Full Blossom Parlor is the biggest brothel in Tianqi City.

213
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,640
I didn't go there. I mean it.

214
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,930
I swear to Heaven.

215
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,760
I swear on the century-old reputation of the Lei Fortress.

216
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,800
I have never been there. I have never even heard of it.

217
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,750
Why?

218
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,430
There's no harm admitting it.

219
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,800
It's not your first time though.

220
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,380
Full Bloom Parlor can never be better than Belle Manor.

221
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,880
You're right, Sister Fairy Lady Rui.

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,300
No, you're not.

223
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,850
I've never been to such a place.

224
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,280
- Gosh, you made me confused. 
 - Enough.

225
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,380
You may leave here.

226
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,810
I have something to speak to her alone.

227
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,300
Sure.

228
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,850
I... Well...

229
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,530
Please be seated.

230
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,000
After we met at Qianjin Gambling House, you asked me to wait there.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,450
I have been waiting for one whole month.

232
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,130
What awaited me is Langya Army entering the capital, but not your next plan.

233
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,350
Very soon.

234
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,180
How soon?

235
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,780
Within these few days.

236
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,590
I will send someone to relay the message to you.

237
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,800
Why so long?

238
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,810
It's better to err on the side of caution.

239
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,320
Also, I don't want to put you in danger.

240
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,410
If you were to be hurt because of this,

241
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,480
I would disappoint senior brother.

242
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,150
Miss Ruoyi. I didn't go to the brothel.

243
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,500
I have never even heard of it.

244
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,010
Xiao Se and I just simply went to Diaolou Parlor and took Qiulubai brew.

245
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,170
- It tastes worse than the brew in Xueyue City. 
 - Enough, Lei Wujie.

246
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,660
Concerning your intelligence, you won't go to the brothel.

247
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,230
Perhaps those ladies would peg you as an idiot and throw you out.

248
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,140
Stop explaining. You were lying just now.

249
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,250
You're so right, Senior Sister.

250
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,460
Very good, you've admitted that you were lying.

251
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,190
So, where did you go just now?

252
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,190
Wait. It's a trap again. I...

253
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,850
We're going somewhere interesting tonight.

254
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,280
Lei Wujie, do you want to join us?

255
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,140
I will surely go if you go, Miss Ruoyi.

256
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,890
What about Xiao Se?

257
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,740
He is busy recently.

258
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,400
He and his father have grown closer now.

259
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,680
Today, he's asked to have dinner in the palace.

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,580
I don't think he can join us tonight.

261
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,150
Fine. I will have a blast too without him.

262
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,875

263
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,680
Ever since the Langya Army left, Tianqi City has returned to its calmness.

264
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,760
Especially when Father burnt the letter, I became more at ease now.

265
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,990
Is the wind that blows within Tianqi City going to stop now?

266
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,810
Many things seem to have come to an end,

267
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,450
but somehow, I'm getting restless.

268
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,780
By the way, Your Highness. Today's the Lantern Festival.

269
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,960
Lantern Festival?

270
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,520
It's a new festival celebrated in Tianqi City.

271
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,330
Every year on this date, colorful lanterns would be hung all over Yanyu Street in the south of the city.

272
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,710
The colorful lanterns look splendid.

273
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,870
Your Highness.

274
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,910
If you have time tonight, make sure that you go take a look.

275
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,100
Sure, I will.

276
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,670
Shopkeeper,

277
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,030
this, this, and this one.

278
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,070
I will have all of them.

279
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,000
Miss, isn't it too many?

280
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,070
No, not at all. I will buy all of them.

281
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,800
Sure.

282
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,060
This one.

283
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,140
I will claim the money from that jerk later. It really angers me.

284
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,450
Sister Ruoyi..

285
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,930
Please pack all of them.

286
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,870
Miss Sikong. You have underestimated me though.

287
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,460
I wouldn't get angered even if you buy all of them.

288
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,110
Well, I will buy the entire store and send it to Snowfall Mountain Villa.

289
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,750
Sure. Do what she said.

290
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,390
Sure thing.

291
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,390
Are you really Xiao Se?

292
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,110
Lei Wujie, did you pretend to be him?

293
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,860
Just tell me.

294
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,640
Do you want it or not?

295
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,780
So you're a bossy prince now.

296
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,570
I'm just joking.

297
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,870
I will take this one.

298
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,340
It's a gift for you.

299
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,870
Hanghao?

300
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,420
It's said that this is the mascot of Tianqi that protects one from danger.

301
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,890
You must keep it with you.

302
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,790
Sure.

303
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,100
Shopkeeper.

304
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,070
I will have this.

305
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,240
I thought you were attending a feast in the palace tonight.

306
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,730
The feast didn't take much time.

307
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,360
Do you like the lantern festival?

308
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,810
Sometimes, I like coming here,

309
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,510
but sometimes, I don't.

310
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,880
You sound mysterious again.

311
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,870
You always claim that Tianqi is a huge city

312
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,750
which is fun and prosperous.

313
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,340
But ever since I have come here, I could only spend time with my spear.

314
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,130
Tonight is my first time hanging out on the street here.

315
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,620
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,290
From now on, you should take me out more often, all right?

317
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,000
Is there anything fun in Tianqi City?

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,940
There is Mount Wuwang in the suburbs with magnificent scenery.

319
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,700
Xulan Street at the night market, you can find a lot of delicious food over there.

320
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,090
If you fancy a good wine, you may visit Diaoluo Parlor...

321
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,440
All right.

322
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,620
Tomorrow, list out all the places and bring me to one place every day.

323
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,330
Sure, I got it.

324
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,970
Good boy.

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,870
I didn't know there would be such an atmospheric street in Tianqi City.

326
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,330
In this Lantern Festival, talented gentlemen, nonchalant swordsmen,

327
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,520
and unparalleled beauties have all gathered here.

328
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,020
Xiao Se would be the gentleman,

329
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm the swordsman,

330
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,620
while Qianluo and you are unparalleled beauties.

331
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,490
You're right.

332
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,930
It seems your visit to Full Bloom Parlor has turned you into a smooth talker.

333
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,220
Miss Ruoyi. I was wrong and I shouldn't have lied to you.

334
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,970
But please quit saying that.

335
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,070
Lei Wujie.

336
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,270
Your task in Tianqi City is almost done, right?

337
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,550
I think so.

338
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,800
The case of Prince Langya Mutiny is put right

339
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
and things Xiao Se has planned to do are already done.

340
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I can't possibly keep staying in Tianqi City.

341
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,750
Then, where do you plan to go?

342
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,940
Going back to Lei Fortress or Xueyue City?

343
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,510
No.

344
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,660
I want to begin a real adventure this time.

345
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,660
I haven't been to those places mentioned in the book.

346
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,640
For instance, Jiuxiao City where the best swordsman, Poetic Sword Deity, stayed a century ago.

347
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,090
Also, Muliang City where Lone Sword Deity used to live alone.

348
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,580
Chaisang City, the biggest city in the southwest

349
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,760
and the world's first academy, Shili Langdang of Qiantang.

350
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,700
I must visit all of them.

351
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,500
Can you take me with you?

352
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,210
Previously, I had to stay at home due to my poor health.

353
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,490
Before I met you, I have only been to Tianqi and Xueyue City.

354
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,490
Now that I'm in good condition and I can travel around.

355
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,690
Honestly, I have dreamed of roaming the world like a swordsman too.

356
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,630
Why don't we go to Sword Heart Tomb to ask for a sword?

357
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,420
Sure, of course.

358
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,320
Silly chap.

359
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,880
Qianluo. You had asked me a question before.

360
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,330
What was it?

361
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,990
You asked, after everything is settled, where will I...

362
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,980
- Look! 
 - It's beautiful.

363
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,030
This is so beautiful. Look.

364
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,060
- Over there. This is so beautiful. 
 - This is so beautiful.

365
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,360
Let's enjoy the fireworks first. We may talk about it later.

366
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,660
You're deliberately mystifying things again.

367
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,230
There are more fireworks. Look. Over there.

368
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,350
This is astonishing.

369
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,850
There are fireworks displays at Xueyue City every year too.

370
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,800
However, it can never be compared with this magnificent scene tonight here.

371
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Indeed, it's mesmerizing.

372
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,150
It would be great to have such a wonderful scene every day here.

373
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,880
Tianqi City claimed to be the most beautiful city

374
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,620
where the strongest liquor, the fastest steed, the prettiest women,

375
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,180
and the most talented youths to be found here.

376
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,060
It's a place where carefree swordsmen see their bright future

377
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,950
and poor scholars find their career.

378
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,950
Nevertheless, it's also the worst city.

379
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,690
Underneath the glitz and glamour, this place is shrouded with conspiracy.

380
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,660
Xiao Se once said something about this.

381
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,560
He said if you are a simple person,

382
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,140
you can see the most beautiful side of this city.

383
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,760
Why doesn't that sound like something he would say?

384
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,120
You know what, back then, Xiao Se was just like Lei Wujie.

385
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,010
I was nothing like this silly chap.

386
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,950
Despite all the appealing sides, it is merely a city.

387
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,080
Exactly. Despite all the appealing sides, it is merely a city and nothing more.

388
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,130
Let's solve all the problems here as soon as possible.

389
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,470
I'm returning to the martial arts world.

390
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,030
Why?

391
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,700
Needless to say, I'm going to cultivate my swordsmanship and become a sword deity.

392
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,070
If so, let's go to Jiuxiao City.

393
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,080
The place where Poetic Sword Deity once dwelled.

394
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,310
It's now the only place that deserves to be called the City of Sword in Beili.

395
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,760
Jiuxiao City.

396
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,620
Sister Qianluo. Let's launch the boat lanterns.

397
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Can I join you too?

398
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,450
No, you can't. It's a secret between girls.

399
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,330
I want to go too.

400
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,490
- Let's go. 
 - I'm off.

401
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,030
Lei Wujie.

402
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,090
We should move now.

403
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,390
Just leave it here.

404
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,450
- Shopkeeper, two boat lanterns, please. 
 - Sure thing.

405
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,040
Thank you.

406
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,500
Qianluo. This is the boat lantern.

407
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,610
Legend has it that if you write the name of someone you like on the lantern,

408
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,390
it will encounter with that person's lantern if he or she launches one too.

409
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,530
Here you go, Miss. Please write your beloved one's name on it.

410
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:59,150

411
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,275

412
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,580
I forgot to tell you not to write his full name.

413
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,780
Has Prince Chi left his residence?

414
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,300
Yes, he's heading south.

415
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,290
Disciples of Bai Xiao Sect will take action soon.

416
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:26,130
Let's put everything to an end tonight.

417
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,140
 I heard that many lantern festivals will be held in Tianqi every year.

418
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,550
 I wonder if you can take me there.

419
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,960
 I'm willing to if there is a chance.

420
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,560
 Do you know what it means when you made that promise to a woman?

421
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,340
 Have you fallen in love with me too?

422
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,780
 Miss Rui. We are on a mission now.

423
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,220
 Our enemies might show up anytime. Please stay focused.

424
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,600
 And stop making ridiculous jokes.

425
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,960
 Ridiculous? Jokes?

426
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,460
 Young Master Lian.

427
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,180
 Do you know that many men in Belle Manor want to share this joke with me?

428
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,420
What a killjoy.

429
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,560
 After you complete the mission, you're returning to Xueyue City and I'm going back to Belle Manor.

430
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,770
 I doubt we can meet again.

431
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,210
 Yet, all you think about is only the task.

432
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,990
 I must accomplish the task entrusted to me by my master.

433
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,520
 Miss Rui. I will surely entertain you when you come to Xueyue City.

434
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,820
 The lantern festival in Xueyue City might not be as splendid as in Tianqi City,

435
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,520
 however, you will enjoy the Flora Spectacle very much.

436
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,620
 Silly. I'm a spy sent from Xueyue City.

437
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,510
 My identity will be exposed if I go back.

438
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,930
 Back then, Third Lord City saved my life.

439
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,570
 I joined Xueyue City to repay his kindness.

440
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,900
 I once asked him when I could renounce this identity

441
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,360
 and blend in with the people without hiding.

442
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,420
 He said...

443
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,590
 What did he say?

444
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,170
 When I meet someone I like and the man also treats me sincerely,

445
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,070
 the moment we tie the knot is when I'm set free.

446
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,440
 Young Master Lian, you said you would show me around Xueyue City,

447
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,730
 did you mean...

448
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,725

450
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,350
Longxie. Are we almost there?

451
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,600
Your Highness. Almost there.

452
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,970
To not attract attention, they chose somewhere less obvious to meet.

453
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,180
Ao Yu is always arrogant.

454
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,980
I didn't expect this from him.

455
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:50,960
Your Highness. Someone blocks the road.

456
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,180
Crap! We fell into the trap.

457
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,790
To my surprise, someone dares to assassinate a prince in public.

458
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,480
It's the men sent by Prince Yong'an, I suppose.

459
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Prince Chi needs your help right now.

460
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,120
Otherwise, he will be in danger.

461
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,800
Prince Yong'an?

462
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,130
I seem to have walked into the trap you set up.

463
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,730
You lured me here to kill me.

464
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,520
My eldest martial brother was killed because of you.

465
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,750
Lei Qianhu, the Fort Leader of Lei Fortress, died because of you.

466
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,830
Zhao Yuzhen, Tao Sword Deity died because of you too.

467
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,030
So, you must die.

468
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,260
I will end your life.

469
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,310
Just you alone?

470
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,090
I know you are not easy to handle.

471
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,010
So, I didn't come here alone.

472
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,980
Muyu. The two of you joined hands?

473
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,570
Leader. Please stop doing the wrong thing.

474
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,080
I never want to confront you.

475
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,360
The moment you made the decision,

476
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,420
you should know that we will turn against each other one day.

477
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,470
We are people who live in darkness.

478
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,090
I thought you wouldn't mind that.

479
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,980
You said that although we act in darkness,

480
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,880
you will lead us into the light.

481
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,350
But what I saw is that you sacrificed the lives of the clan

482
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,760
for the sake of your greed.

483
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:47,060
Well. If so, you can walk your own path,

484
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,260
and I walk on my own.

485
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,980
I can tell that you have regained your power

486
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,740
and have improved quite a lot after the duel in Lei Fortress.

487
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,900
It's enough to eliminate you.

488
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,310
Infinite Sword from Zhao Yuzhen.

489
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,060
I'm Li Fansong, the disciple of Zhao Yuzhen.

490
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,930
I'm here to avenge my master.

491
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,480
You shall meet your end now.

492
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,300
And me, Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng.

493
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,800
You shall meet your end now.

494
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,290
Xiao Se. Go ahead.

495
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,400
Just leave it to us.

496
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm counting on you.

497
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,790
It's Zhao Yuzhen's Taiyi Lion Secret Arts.

498
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,590
Charge.

499
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,520
Charge.

500
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,300
Qianluo.

501
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,120
There's no sign of them.

502
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,160
Maybe they have returned to Snowfall Mountain Villa?

503
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,570
Let's go back and check it out.

504
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:18,100
No way. They wouldn't just leave without informing us.

505
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,300
I know now.

506
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,440
Perhaps they go to rescue Wu Xin.

507
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,480
Why would you say so?

508
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,630
They've been acting weird these days.

509
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,690
And now, they just disappeared out of a sudden. I guess they must have gone to rescue Wu Xin.

510
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,590
But they didn't take me along.

511
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,190
Is it because they don't think I can be of help?

512
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,660
Qianluo. You're the first disciple among all in this generation of Xueyue City to reach the Insouciant Phase.

513
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,510
How could you not be helpful?

514
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,180
Even if they did go to rescue Wu Xin without you, that'd be because they don't wish you to be in danger.

515
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,240
Not to mention that this is only a guess.

516
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,530
Isn't that Xiao Se's second brother?

517
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,820
Your Highness. It's already started.

518
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,810
What has happened?

519
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,980
A fight broke out in Prince Chi's Residence.

520
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,040
Sixth Brother is there too.

521
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,320
Yueji? You have become a drugged tester too?

522
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,480
I will take you out later.

523
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,150
Wu Xin.

524
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,450
Wu Xin. Can you hear me?

525
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,540
I'm Xiao Se.

526
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,130
I'm here to save you.

527
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,880
Eat this and you will be fine.

528
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,390
You want to avenge your master,

529
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,740
however, concerning your strength, you can barely touch me.

530
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,610
Come on, Feixuan.

531
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,000
Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill!

532
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,060
This can't be true.

533
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,180
None of the needles could hurt him?

534
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,730
No.

535
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,210
There is one.

536
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,650
I asked Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan to give me this before I came to Tianqi.

537
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,320
It's your retribution to be killed by the Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst.

538
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,060
No!

539
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,850
We can't let him get rid of the Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst.

540
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,080
Changhe.

541
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,880
Muyu.

542
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,310
Am I wrong?

543
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,770
There's no absolute right or wrong in this world.

544
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,120
It's just that we are protecting different things.

545
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,900
Someone wants to protect the world,

546
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,920
but as for me, I want to protect the members of Dark River.

547
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,400
Fine then.

548
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,070
Please send me to my demise.

549
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,520
In the extreme land of inferno,

550
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,380
light can be seen.

551
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:29,930
When cloud and fog dissipated, the moon becomes visible.

552
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,980
Wu Xin.

553
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,130
Wu Xin.

554
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,050
 - Are you insane?
 - I'm going to rip your lips off.

555
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,840
 There is no Young Master of Tian Wai Tian here nor Xiao Chuhe.

556
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,250
 I'm just Wu Xin from Hanshui Temple.

557
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,950
 What's wrong with him? He shouldn't possess consciousness now.

558
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Wu Xin.

559
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,380
Wake up. You're Wu Xin.

560
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,430
 Wu Xin, if you intend to stay, I will help you.

561
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,690
You're Ye Anshi of Tian Wai Tian, my best friend.

562
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,070
You shouldn't be in this place, nor should you become like this.

563
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,610
 The rest of your journey isn't yours alone.

564
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,380
 But ours too. We will embark on this journey with you.

565
00:38:48,380 --> 00:39:01,050
♫  No wish left unfulfilled and no regret left unsettled  ♫

566
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,060
Xiao Chuhe. I knew it was you.

567
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,490
Trying to distract me?

568
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,200
Never think that you can leave here alive.

569
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,150
Kill him.

570
00:39:32,855 --> 00:39:34,045
Why are you here?

571
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:35,545
Why didn't you ask me to come?

572
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:37,555
- I... 
 - It's great that you're all here.

573
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:40,485
All of you can meet your end here.

574
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:44,365
Seventh Brother, do you really want to hurt your siblings?

575
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:48,915
This is hilarious. He stormed into my place.

576
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:51,910
But you, on the other hand,

577
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,325
seem to have taken Xiao Chuhe's side now.

578
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:59,935
Previously, he saved my life in my residence.

579
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:04,155
So today, I will save him in your residence.

580
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:10,495
My sword skill may not be that ferocious, but it would still cause quite a scene here.

581
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:15,285
Are you sure you can bear the consequence of killing two princes in your residence?

582
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:20,555
If yes, your men can do it now.

583
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:22,775
You're threatening me.

584
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:25,805
Sixth Brother, let's go.

585
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:41,800

586
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:51,825
He's fine. It's just some small injuries.

587
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,675
What a relief.

588
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,695
Where is Miss Sikong?

589
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,635
It's rare to not see her around.

590
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:02,555
Don't mention it. She went straight to her room after returning yesterday.

591
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:04,555
Probably she was sulking all night.

592
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:07,885
No, I'm not sulking. I will express my anger.

593
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,875
Xiao Se, what were you thinking?

594
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,995
We witnessed how powerful Wu Xin is when we were at Prince Bai's Residence that day.

595
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:16,905
Yet you sneaked into Prince Chi's Residence yesterday.

596
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:20,145
You can't possibly beat him.

597
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,800
I was so close.

598
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,830
Don't make it sound like I can't do anything right.

599
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,080
Do you know why you fail at the last step?

600
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,750
Why?

601
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm the last step to success.

602
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,350
You only sent Bai Xiao Sect to intercept Prince Chi. How would that be enough?

603
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,950
Therefore, he came back way earlier than you expected.

604
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:46,220
If you had sent me, they wouldn't have made it back in time.

605
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:09,020

606
