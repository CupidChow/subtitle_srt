♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,300
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,050

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,760
Everyone, attack! Bring that lad back with us!

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,180
Lu Yuzhai!

26
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,660
I can't defy my master's order.

27
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,940
Tang Lian, I suggest you get out of the way.

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,660
Attack together!

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,480
Who are you?

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,180
Father?

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,900
Third Master.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,000
Who's that man?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,220
Lei Wujie... you'd better remember this man.

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,460
Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword and Wang Rensun's Shattering Blade that you encountered

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
may be first-rate experts.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,060
But they are just some of the first-rate experts.

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,240
And this man is the current top spear fighter of this age.

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,360
The Spear Deity Sikong Changfeng.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,940
The Spear Deity Sikong Changfeng?

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,880
The Third City Lord of Xueyue City?

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,860
Your drool is about to fall to the ground.

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Stop looking at him like that. Don't embarrass us.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,480
Just now, you asked who I was.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,280
If you don't recognize me, do you recognize my spear?

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,180
Greetings, Spear Deity.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,100
Wushuang City has sent so many elites this time.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,280
Is this hostage really that important?

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,500
Go back to Wushuang City and tell those old fools.

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,120
If they really think they can overturn the martial arts world by capturing a child,

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,240
they can forget about being the best in the world.

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't think the name Wushuang City has to be used anymore, either.

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,280
One more thing, Wushuang City finally has great talent.

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,340
They better not waste it.

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,220
Please convey my message to Song Yanhui.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,060
I'll definitely convey your message to him,

56
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,540
if I don't forget at the time.

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,180
You held back just now.

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,580
Or else, they would have been seriously injured, if not killed.

59
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,300
Thank you.

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,380
It's nothing.

61
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,200
I hope we have a chance to fight again after you recover.

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,420
Sure.

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,220
My swordsmanship may be inferior to my Second Senior Brother,

64
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,520
but I've practiced it for several years.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,980
This is...

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,860
How is this possible?

67
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,480
The Spear Deity is indeed worthy of his name!

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,920
Indeed, only those who've become a sword deity can completely control the 13 swords of the Wushuang Sword Box.

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,740
Xiao Se, this sword is...

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,060
The second of the world's top ten famous swords, the Vermilion.

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
The Vermilion.

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,240
The Vermilion.

73
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,460
Sikong Changfeng!

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,140
The Vermilion!

75
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,400
Sikong Changfeng.

76
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
Hey, come back.

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,820
Whether using swords or spears, the principles are the same.

78
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,260
I only used my inner force to control the Wushuang Sword Box by force.

79
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,520
If you want to understand the rest of the principles, you still have to rely on yourself.

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you for your guidance, Spear Deity.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
You can leave now.

82
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Come on, Senior Brother.

83
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,620
- Third Master. 
 - Tang Lian,

84
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,980
you've done well.

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,000
Father!

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,580
Qianluo, you've really gone too...

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,540
Father! Can you come down first before you talk?

88
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,800
It's really tiring to talk looking up.

89
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,460
Father!

90
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,380
Father, don't be mad. I'm sorry.

91
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,880
I won't do it again.

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,020
Next time?

93
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,320
Do you know I turned Xueyue City upside down trying to find you?

94
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,840
Father, I'm sorry.

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,020
I'm truly sorry.

96
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,140
Third Master, Qianluo was indeed a troublemaker this time.

97
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,720
She must be severely punished.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Senior Brother, how many times did I help you out on this journey?

99
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,700
How could you say that?

100
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,040
She's right. Qianluo did it out of kindness.

101
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,440
You call that helping me? You've been holding me back the whole way here.

102
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,880
How did you help?

103
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,220
Hold you back?

104
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,080
Qianluo, Qianluo, this is where you were wrong.

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,700
Why do you keep causing trouble for your Senior Brother?

106
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,680
If it weren't for me, he would have been in trouble at Belle Manor!

107
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,460
I heard you helped him break some formation

108
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,620
- called... 
 - Guxu Technique.

109
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,040
Ah, the Guxu Technique. Right?

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,340
Even if you hadn't intervened, a mere Guxu Technique couldn't have stopped me.

111
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,080
Xiao Lian is also right about that.

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,840
Xiao Lian's martial arts skills are the best among the younger generation in Xueyue City.

113
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,400
I think you're upset because I interrupted your time alone with Fairy Lady Rui.

114
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,300
You...

115
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,000
All right, that's enough. Calm down. Calm down.

116
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,440
Fairy Lady Rui?

117
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,180
Who's Fairy Lady Rui?

118
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,800
She's a girl with a beautiful face.

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,080
That's what happened.

120
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,800
- Father. 
 - Luo'er.

121
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,320
I never thought the world-famous Spear Deity would be like this in private.

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,140
It is unexpected indeed.

123
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,920
He's so cool.

124
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't think it'll be hard for the three of them to talk all night.

125
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,420
Next time, you can't behave this mischievously anymore. Do you hear me?

126
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,400
- Hey... 
 - Understood.

127
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,980
Senior Spear Deity, I'm Lei Wujie of Lei Fortress' Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

128
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,540
I'm on my way to Xueyue City to train under a master.

129
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,400
Young man, you're a fine-looking man with talent.

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,560
Stop embarrassing yourself.

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,540
He said I'm full of vigor.

132
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm Wu Chan, and this is my junior brother, Wu Xin.

133
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
You two have had it rough today.

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,820
I was supposed to have been here earlier,

135
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,240
but I ran into an old friend on my way here.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
We talked for a while, which delayed me.

137
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,500
No ordinary person could disintegrate their own martial arts skills.

138
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,040
It was no wonder, Wang You thought highly of you.

139
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,120
Are you also here to take me away?

140
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
No.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm here especially to send Ye Anshi back to the sect.

142
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,120
- I want to go back to Hanshui Temple. 
 - I'm here especially to send Ye Anshi back to the sect.

143
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,940
- White-Haired Deity? 
 - White-Haired Deity!

144
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,300
The old friend I mentioned just now was him.

145
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,820
Uncle Mo.

146
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
Not only did you run away without a word after seeing me,

147
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,700
but you also struck me pretty hard.

148
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,330
Are you going to acknowledge this uncle of yours?

149
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,580
Uncle Mo, you're an expert in martial arts.

150
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,620
How could I possibly injure you?

151
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,840
I'll take him with me then.

152
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,180
Will Xueyue City not regret it?

153
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll say it again.

154
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,540
Xueyue City doesn't fear the Demon Sect or Tian Wai Tian,

155
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,040
let alone... a mere young man.

156
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,340
Let's go.

157
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
Wait!

158
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,760
Child, what do you want?

159
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,160
Why haven't you asked if he was willing to go with you?

160
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,000
He's the Young Sect Master of Tian Wai Tian.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,620
If he doesn't return to Tian Wai Tian, don't tell me he should return to Hanshui Temple.

162
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,220
What if he does want to return to Hanshui Temple?

163
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Child, are you tired of living?

164
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you think I won't kill you because I fear that Lei Hong, who is hiding in Lei Fortress?

165
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,920
Wu Xin, do you really want to go?

166
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,660
I...

167
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,780
The twelve-year term has expired.

168
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,100
You are originally supposed to go.

169
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,080
Why do you hesitate?

170
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,000
The armistice was for a twelve-year term.

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,600
During that time, he was a hostage.

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,980
Now, the twelve-year term has expired.

173
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,500
The world is vast.

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,080
He can go anywhere he wants.

175
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,900
That's right!

176
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,280
Wu Xin, just say it.

177
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,360
At worst, we can fight again!

178
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,900
You're seeking a master in Xueyue City.

179
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,180
How can you fight the Spear Deity?

180
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,840
A sect is a sect. Justice is justice.

181
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Brotherhood is brotherhood.

182
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,780
Xiao Se, am I right?

183
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
He's right.

184
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,640
Young Sect Master.

185
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,980
Uncle Mo.

186
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,440
Uncle Mo, what are you doing?

187
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,160
Young Sect Master,

188
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,500
Tian Wai Tian has been waiting for your return for 12 years.

189
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,000
As of today, the other 16 sects outside the region have fallen apart.

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,740
Tian Wai Tian is the only one where no one has ever left.

191
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,340
All of us are waiting for you to return and take charge of the situation.

192
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,740
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

193
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,100
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

194
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,212
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

195
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:46,780
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

196
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,814
♫  In the world, the wind blows miserably  ♫

197
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:54,420
♫  Sweeping away the fog of time  ♫

198
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,549
♫  Talking about destiny  ♫

199
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:01,640
♫  The heart moves and does what it wants  ♫

200
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,615
♫  Trekking millions of miles across the woodlands  ♫

201
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:09,240
♫  Dancing among the waves  ♫ 
 ♫  Melodious youth  ♫

202
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,683
♫  Dependent on the sword  ♫

203
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,380
♫  As devoted friends with strong bonds  ♫

204
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,040
♫  Dreams and fears are insignificant   ♫

205
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,000
Uncle Mo.

206
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,320
I understand.

207
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Let's go.

208
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,688
♫  Traveling freely with friends  ♫

209
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:35,070
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫

210
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,100
Congratulations on your return, Ye Anshi, head of the Tian Wai Tian Sect.

211
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,960
Spear Deity, you don't have to force me.

212
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
I understand.

213
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,300
Actually, Old Wang You is already gone.

214
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,840
It doesn't matter if I return to Hanshui Temple or not.

215
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,120
But Old Wang You was right.

216
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,860
My home is a place beyond the border, beyond the sky.

217
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,452
You can return to Hanshui Temple, but not right now.

218
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:16,020
♫  I won't be lonely if I have my confidants  ♫

219
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,080
Senior Brother, I'm leaving now.

220
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,220
Junior Brother, it doesn't matter if you're the Sect Master of Tian Wai Tian,

221
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,800
Hanshui Temple will always be your home.

222
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,720
Remember to practice that fist technique I taught you.

223
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,500
It may look ordinary.

224
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,980
But after countless practices, even dripping water can wear away a stone and sand can build a pagoda.

225
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,460
As for what I taught you...

226
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,840
I hope you'll never get to use it.

227
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,740
I had already forgotten about it.

228
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,980
It's best if you do.

229
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,780
Wu Xin.

230
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,600
If you don't want to go, I can figure something out.

231
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,780
I know you're full of ideas.

232
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,320
People say life is ruthless.

233
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,040
But who can really be ruthless?

234
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,060
I can't avoid the inevitable.

235
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,620
I'll go to settle an old score.

236
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
What happens after that?

237
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,320
After that...

238
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,440
I'll return to the martial arts world

239
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,880
and continue the journey with you both.

240
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,560
What do we do with the coffin at the foot of the mountain?

241
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,760
Just bury it.

242
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,420
 I want to travel north with the wind,

243
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,960
 watching the snow sweep across the land.

244
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,160
 I wish to travel east by boat

245
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,640
 to see the elegant fairy brave the wind.

246
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,200
 I wish to travel thousands of miles with the clouds,

247
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,000
 even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

248
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,440
 I will bathe in sunlight on the top of Mount Kunlun.

249
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,900
 I will witness lush mountains rise at the edge of the ocean.

250
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,860
 We shall reunite after a long journey.

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,820
 But I won't go home until I've seen the world.

252
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,580
After struggling for half a night,

253
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,360
I finally found a good move.

254
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,980
You've been making advances without leaving me any room.

255
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,780
I have to put a lot of energy into this,

256
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,540
so I don't lose so miserably.

257
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,480
The one struggling half a night should be me, right?

258
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,420
I dare not.

259
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,400
I haven't played Go with you for a long time,

260
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,940
but your moves are completely different from before.

261
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,100
Your Majesty is wise.

262
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,580
Lately, I did come to a realization.

263
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,920
What is it?

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,320
This world is ever-changing.

265
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,900
Only the balance of Yin and Yang is not broken.

266
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,980
Yin and Yang are both in the vast world

267
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,260
and also here in black and white, in latitude and longitude.

268
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,800
Be it attack or defense, to pursue or to let go,

269
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,880
there are countless moves with losing and winning as the two outcomes.

270
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,820
For Go players, it's nothing more than a feeling of gaining and losing.

271
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,160
Since when did you learn to insinuate?

272
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,100
I dare not.

273
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,940
Since you've already brought it up, keep talking.

274
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,740
With the hostage, what do you think

275
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,820
I've gained and lost?

276
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,980
If I may be so bold,

277
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,460
Your Majesty lost a hostage in exchange for national stability.

278
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,760
It's the morality and justice of the human heart.

279
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,980
It seems you also think that this outcome is the best result for now.

280
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,600
I do think so.

281
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,180
- There's one more thing. 
 - One more thing?

282
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,020
No, I mean one person.

283
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,240
I heard... he also got involved in this matter.

284
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,780
Where are we going now?

285
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,400
To Xueyue City, of course.

286
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,100
Are you sure this is the right way?

287
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,320
Don't worry. Senior Brother Tang has gone on to carry out another task.

288
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,760
Before he left, I asked him to draw me a map.

289
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,500
See? This is the one.

290
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,860
This time we definitely won't get lost!

291
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,740
I hope so.

292
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,780

293
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
 Ladies and gentlemen, the breeze from Southern Pass,

294
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,780
 the flowers in Northern Pass, the snow on Mount Cang,

295
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,360
 and the moon's reflection on Erhai Lake, describe

296
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,760
 the four wonders of our romantic Xueyue City.

297
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,120
 - The so-called Beauty of Four Seasons.  
 - Martial Uncle!

298
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,340
 I'm sure you don't know this.

299
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,180
Martial Uncle!

300
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,980
He disappeared after only a while.

301
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,240
When martial artists from the martial world want to join Xueyue City,

302
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,640
they must first challenge the Dengtian Tower!

303
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,120
Dengtian Tower?

304
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,260
Excuse me, please make way.

305
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,280
Back then, Xu Wei, an old beggar with a stick from the martial arts world

306
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,200
managed to climb up to the tenth floor of the tower in one go.

307
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,540
 Ten floors?

308
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,000
After that, he came down to ask for a bowl of liquor.

309
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,440
After drinking, he continued climbing Dengtian Tower with his dilapidated stick

310
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,680
and climbed up another five floors in one go!

311
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,000
Incredible! That's more like it.

312
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,360
Martial Uncle, what are you doing here?

313
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,580
- Hey, Feixuan. 
 - Let's go. Let's go.

314
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,400
Feixuan, stop pushing me. Let me listen a little longer.

315
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
- Just a little longer. A little longer. 
 - Just go!

316
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,000
A little longer.

317
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,520
Nice!

318
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,120
Why are you dawdling around? Do you still want to challenge the tower?

319
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,420
I was starting to get excited about the story.

320
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,000
He was just talking about an old beggar challenging the tower who climbed 15 floors in one go.

321
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,700
In the end, the Spear Deity created a storm that changed into a spear to defeat him.

322
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,960
It's not like we haven't heard it before.

323
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,700
You're right. But what we heard in Mount Wangcheng before was hearsay.

324
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,180
What we have now heard at the foot of Dengtian Tower in Xueyue City

325
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,040
is what we call a story.

326
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,780
Do you even get it?

327
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,320
So pretentious.

328
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,370
I'll tell the Great Master that you came to Xueyue City to take the trials of Dengtian Tower.

329
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,020

330
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,420
Xiao Se, I'm about to go challenge Dengtian Tower now.

331
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,200
Instead of encouraging me, you're pulling such a long face.

332
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,980
What are you thinking about?

333
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,760
Look who's talking.

334
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,580
We got lost three times on the way to Xueyue City.

335
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,760
We've wasted a month just for that 500 silver taels.

336
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,580
How about we include interest, and you pay back a total of 800 silver taels?

337
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,480
I have to go challenge Dengtian Tower now. Wish me luck!

338
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,980
Dengtian Tower! Here I come!

339
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,340
Martial Uncle, it looks like that person in red is going to challenge the Tower too.

340
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,880
It's all your fault for sleeping in. See? He gets to go first now.

341
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,280
Calm down. Maybe he'll be defeated really quickly.

342
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,020
Martial Uncle, didn't you learn Great Master's Qi-Observing Arts?

343
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,060
Can you see how many floors this young man can climb?

344
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,660
This young man? I figure he can reach level...

345
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:58,860
Feixuan, it looks like I indeed slept in too late today.

346
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,440
 Mount Wangcheng's disciples?

347
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,400
 Someone is challenging the Dengtian Tower!

348
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
 Let's go and take a look!

349
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,120

350
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,160
He's on the first floor now!

351
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,440
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

352
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,280
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

353
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,880
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

354
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,680
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

355
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,940
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

356
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,300

357
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,060
-  It's the fourth floor now! 
 - He's amazing.

358
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,100
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

359
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,420
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

360
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,500
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

361
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,720
♫  With one smile, there's understanding  ♫

362
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,940
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

363
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,940
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

364
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,660
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

365
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,900
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

366
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,780
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

367
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,300
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

368
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,260
He's on the tenth floor now! 
 ♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

369
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,480
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

370
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,880
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

371
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

372
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,800
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

373
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,320
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

374
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,320
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

375
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,040

376
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,580
 - It's the 13th floor! 
 - Who is that man?

377
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,020
Lei Wujie of the Lei family of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect has come!

378
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,680
What are you doing?

379
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
There's nothing wrong, is there?

380
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,260

381
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,320
Nothing wrong?

382
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,420
How do you plan on compensating me?

383
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,200
Compensate you?

384
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,220
Do you know what that is?

385
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,600
No.

386
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,660
Two deities were playing Go leisurely on Mount Tai.

387
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,320
It's said to be an endgame.

388
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,180
Hiding in the endgame is an exceptional martial arts skill.

389
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,820
If one person can comprehend the moves, it's better than 20 years of hard training.

390
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,740
I was just about to figure it out when you walked in.

391
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,380
So tell me, how are you going to compensate me?

392
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,840
Don't tell me it's another 500 silver taels.

393
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,500
What a good man! I'll give you a discount.

394
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,380
Three hundred silver taels will be enough.

395
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,220
Three...

396
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,000
Then, can I pay you after I pass the trials?

397
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
Of course.

398
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,740
Great! Pardon me for this, then.

399
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,520
What do you want to bet?

400
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,680
Liubo, Pai Gow, Xuanhe, or Madiao.

401
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,620
I'm asking which you want to play. Pick one.

402
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,860
I don't know any of these.

403
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,640
Not a single one?

404
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,420
Why did you come up here if you don't know?

405
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,580
I... I only know one.

406
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,320
The big and small game.

407
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,100
Fine. Big and small, it is. How boring.

408
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,620
Come on.

409
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,900
We really can't compete in martial arts?

410
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,680
No.

411
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
One round to determine the winner. Take a guess.

412
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,060
Big!

413
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,920
Three, three, one. It's so small, it couldn't be smaller!

414
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,600
You lost.

415
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,020
It's my first time playing. So this round doesn't count.

416
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,380
- Do you dare to have another round with me? 
 - Sure.

417
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,860
I'll play another round with you.

418
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,760
As long as you win one round, I'll consider you the winner. Come on.

419
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,860
Wait! I'll go down the tower to have a bowl of soy milk first.

420
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,900
I'll play the last round with you when I get back.

421
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,640
Sure. Go ahead.

422
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,820
- Don't forget to bring the silver taels you owe me! 
 - All right!

423
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,440
What an interesting lad.

424
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,140
 You're the one with the least advantage.

425
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,560
 For some things, you have to try and fight for.

426
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,480
 If I don't try it, how will I know the outcome?

427
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,280
 If you fail, you'll die.

428
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,760
- Xiao Se. 
 - You lost on the 13th floor?

429
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,020
- You're weaker than I thought. 
 - I haven't lost yet!

430
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,820
That guy on the 13th floor doesn't want to compete in martial arts with me.

431
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,460
He's playing dice with me.

432
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,800
You're a better gambler than me. Can you teach me?

433
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,080
I can teach you. But you need to pay more.

434
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,380
- How much? 
 - Another 300 silver taels.

435
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,580
- So it's a total of 800 silver taels. 
 - Eight...

436
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,310
Fine!

437
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,320
The person you met should be Yin Luoxia's disciple.

438
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
Yin Luoxia?

439
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,760
Fairy Luoxia who split the Canglan River with one palm strike.

440
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,800
The one on the list of most beautiful women in the martial arts world for ten years?

441
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,420
- Are you still listening? 
 - Yes, of course.

442
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,140
Yin Luoxia loves gambling by nature.

443
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,860
She once lost three consecutive bets with Sikong Changfeng, the Spear Deity.

444
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,140
So she was forced to join Xueyue City as its elder.

445
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,540
It's said after she joined Xueyue City,

446
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,700
she only accepted one disciple who loves gambling like her.

447
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,560
So tell me. What method did he use to gamble with you?

448
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,740
I can only make a random guess at first.

449
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,280
He... He opened it a crack and with one look said I lost.

450
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,860
There's a hidden box under the treasure chest. He looked at the dice in advance.

451
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,040
If your guess was right, he'll only have to flick gently to roll the dice.

452
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,360
You'll lose no matter what.

453
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,220
So that's what happened. I'm heading back now.

454
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,920
Come back here!

455
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,060
Gambling is nothing but a small trick.

456
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,240
Challenging Dengtian Tower isn't a trifling matter.

457
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,060
If you want to win, you still need to do what you're good at.

458
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,700
What am I good at?

459
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,350
Beat him up.

460
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,590
I get it now.

461
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,220
He's out.

462
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,200
- Excuse me! Make way! 
 - He only took a short break.

463
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,920
Not necessarily. There are 15 floors.

464
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,280
Martial Uncle, that man in red keeps running around.

465
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,100
It looks like he was only taking a break and was not defeated.

466
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,880
If this goes on, he'll steal away all of today's limelight!

467
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,380
There's no rush.

468
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,260
When he reaches the 16th floor, watch me go up there and kick him out.

469
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,040
It also saves us the energy of going up the floors one by one.

470
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,280
Since we're all waiting for him to come down,

471
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,820
how about I invite you two to have some tea?

472
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,060
The crepe myrtle gazes at Qi, the all-seeing eyes seek the dragon.

473
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,400
What have you seen?

474
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,140
Who are you? How did you know my martial uncle?

475
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,760
Feixuan, calm down.

476
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,180
This man doesn't know martial arts.

477
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,980
There are three phases of Qi-Observing Arts.

478
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,920
You've only practiced the first phase.

479
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,720
Are you saying I misread your skills and that you're actually an expert?

480
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,120
No. You didn't misread me.

481
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
It's true I don't know martial arts.

482
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,120
I only want to invite you to have some tea.

483
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,840
Just for tea?

484
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Since I've run into disciples of Mount Wangcheng, I will naturally want to ask you to do a reading.

485
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,020
You can stop hiding your identities.

486
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,500
There's an organization in Xueyue City called Spiderweb that specializes in collecting intelligence.

487
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,380
From the moment we entered the southern part of this city, we were already being watched.

488
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,640
You seem to know a lot of things.

489
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,100
What I don't know is my fate.

490
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,480
So I want to have it read.

491
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,160
Please come this way.

492
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,840
Feixuan, didn't you always say you have mastered the Divination Arts,

493
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,140
but you don't have someone talented to practice on?

494
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,460
There's one right there. Go and perform a divination for him.

495
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,260
Talented subject?

496
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,320
Just go. You don't have anything to lose.

497
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,680
Let's go.

498
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,640
You're back.

499
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,080
How was the soy milk?

500
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,120
After I reach the top of the tower, I'll treat you to a bowl.

501
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,760
That confident?

502
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,580
My friend told me gambling actually relies on little tricks.

503
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,800
- So? 
 - So I'm still going to bet on big.

504
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,320
We'll open if you're sure.

505
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,000
If I want to win, I still need to use real skills.

506
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,700
Move your hand away!

507
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,080
Six!

508
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,540
One!

509
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,860
- Let go! 
 - No, you let go!

510
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,280
- I said, let go! 
 - You let go!

511
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,460
If you don't let go, I'm going to bite you.

512
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,460
One, one, six. So it's eight points.

513
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,780
No, it's 13 points!

514
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,720
It's so big, couldn't be bigger!

515
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,940
Not bad.

516
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,300
Your martial arts skills are a lot better than your gambling skills.

517
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,280
I don't feel flattered at all.

518
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,160
What's your name?

519
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,900
Lei Wujie from the Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

520
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,480
Didn't I tell you that before when I came up earlier?

521
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,860
I'm Luo Mingxuan.

522
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,600
I know. You're Fairy Luoxia's disciple.

523
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,020
I've long admired Fairy Luoxia!

524
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,720
L-Long admired her?

525
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,120
What's wrong?

526
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,660
S-S-She's already over 30.

527
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,020
They said she split a river in half.

528
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,300
But the one she split isn't the Yangtze or Yellow River.

529
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,560
Why do you admire her?

530
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,500
Listen.

531
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,440
She's actually an old woman.

532
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,320
 Mingxuan, come to Xizhao Pavilion.

533
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,200
I'd better get going to the upper floor.

534
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,780
I'll see you around.

535
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,700
What an interesting guy.

536
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,700
I was only away from the city for half a day,

537
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,440
yet someone has already reached the 13th floor!

538
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,260
What a bunch of useless garbage!

539
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,000
Young Master, we can begin now.

540
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,800
Wait.

541
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,480
What now?

542
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,800
The person who's challenging the tower owes me 800 silver taels.

543
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,820
So I have to make an effort to support him in some way.

544
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,240
Xiao Se?

545
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Miss Sikong, it's been a while.

546
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,620
What took you so long to arrive?

547
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,220
You were supposed to arrive at Xueyue City a month ago.

548
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,640
I don't want to answer this question.

549
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,220
Martial Uncle, he passed the 13th floor!

550
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,280
He's heading to the 14th floor now!

551
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,620
Where's Lei Wujie?

552
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,800
Don't tell me... he's the one challenging the tower!

553
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,520
Miss Sikong, you guessed right.

554
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,660
We didn't have the time to spar last time because we bade farewell in a hurry.

555
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,380
Now it's perfect.

556
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,200
What are you doing?

557
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,900
I can't let you pass.

558
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,320
Are you trying to stop me on behalf of Lei Wujie?

559
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,780
Martial Uncle, didn't you say that person doesn't know martial arts?

560
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,920
That's not a martial arts skill.

561
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,460
It's a lightness technique.

562
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,420
One doesn't need inner force to use it.

563
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,680
Which lightness technique?

564
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,360
The world's best lightness technique, Walking on Clouds.

565
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,140
Why is there no one here?

566
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,360
Eldest Senior Brother!

567
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,500
It's been a long time, Eldest Senior Brother!

568
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,000
Didn't I tell you not to address me that way before you're officially accepted?

569
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,320
I can ignore the rest. But I must address you that way!

570
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,240
After all, we've gone through thick and thin together.

571
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,620
You're a Lei Clan disciple.

572
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,340
If you want to join us, you only have to bring a visiting card and come see me.

573
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,760
Why do you insist on challenging the Dengtian Tower?

574
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,820
I came to Xueyue City to see someone.

575
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,220
But if I want to see her, I must challenge Dengtian Tower.

576
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,620
If I really have to fight you,

577
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,680
I hope you won't blame me.

578
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,180
Not bad.

579
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,600
Your martial arts skills really have improved a lot lately.

580
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,820
I practice every day and never slack off even for a moment.

581
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,800
Eldest Senior Brother, again!

582
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,840
I didn't expect your Fire Infusion to be this powerful.

583
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,740
It broke my Thread Blade Formation in a flash.

584
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,540
Thread Blade?

585
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,100
It looks like an ordinary silk thread, no matter how I look at it.

586
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,680
See? It breaks as soon as I pull it.

587
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,920
Nonsense.

588
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,600
My Tread Blade is the best weapon in the world.

589
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,340
Unexpectedly, it can't beat your Fire Infusion.

590
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm not your match.

591
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,400
Just go.

592
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,940
Senior Brother, your acting skills are terrible.

593
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,740
Look, there are only the two of us here.

594
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,460
You can tell me if you want to throw this fight.

595
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,820
I won't tell anyone about this.

596
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,600
You dare say I would throw a fight?

597
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,840
Fine. Then take a blow from my Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm.

598
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,520
- Do you dare say I threw the fight again? 
 - No, no! I don't!

599
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,060
I'll keep my mouth shut.

600
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:31,970

601
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,060
