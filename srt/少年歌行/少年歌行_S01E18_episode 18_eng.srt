00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,150
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,790
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,270
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,500
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,500
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,720
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,750
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,350
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,320
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,490
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,700
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,150
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,770
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,190
When you carry out a heroic deed in the future, do you know how to reply to others when people thank you?

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,830
 No.

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,060
You should say, "You're welcome."

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,230
 You're welcome.

28
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:13,190
 I'd always stand up for those in need. No need to thank me.

29
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,300
 I have to go now. Hopefully, we'll meet again.

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,150
"I have to go now. Farewell." Got it?

31
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,870
 Yes.

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,210
All right, let's call it a day.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,450
- You're free to go now. 
 - Come on, let's play.

34
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,390
- Let's play. 
 - Good.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,260
Oh my. Don't teach them useless things.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,550

37
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,410
This is what Master taught us.

38
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,250
Did you forget about this?

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,160
Back then, you had the loudest voice despite you're the youngest one.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,580
Stop saying that.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,370
 How come the toxic cold spread so fast in merely five days?

42
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,430
How much time do I have?

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,670
Three months or one?

44
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,140
Don't you have faith in my medical skill?

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,910
You won't die with me by your side.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,760
Enough.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,700
Quit bragging.

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,910
Without the Wen family's method to fight the frost poison with poison, you'd be out of your depth.

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,390
By the way, the hero banquet will be held here soon.

50
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,750
I know.

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,760
I thought you didn't like attending such events.

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm afraid I can't live through this winter.

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,350
I hold this hero banquet to tell the entire martial arts world

54
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,290
that even if I, Lei Qianhu, die, the Lei Clan will be more prosperous.

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,720
Because the Two Heroes of the Lei Clan will emerge again.

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,160
Back then, Master said that there are four heroes in the Lei Clan from our generation.

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,590
Supposedly, it's the era of the Lei family.

58
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,280
Yet, you have to shoulder all the responsibility alone.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,750
We're sorry that we put you through this.

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,810
You can ask Yunhe to take over my position,

61
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,000
and you can roam around the martial arts world and look for your Li Hanyi.

62
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,570
 I'll personally pay you a visit when you become a sword deity.

63
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,810
Previously, Li Hanyi turned me down with the excuse of sword skills.

64
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,700
And I bought it.

65
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,470
After all of these years, I'm not the silly boy anymore.

66
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,490
She doesn't like me.

67
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,040
I think it's because you're ugly.

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,070
I'm more handsome than you.

69
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,800
Your disciple has departed from Xueyue City.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,280
Fortunately, he has got a conscience coming back to visit his master.

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,310
Right after he left Xueyue City, someone followed along.

72
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,420
Who's it?

73
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,700
Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity.

74
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,280
Besides, Zhao Yuzhen left the mountain too.

75
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,950
How's the progress of your unrivaled sword skills that can suppress the sword deities?

76
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,990
Am I...

77
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,310
still a step behind again?

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,890
Where can I get the best physician in this city?

79
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,930
You're late. All physicians in the city have already been called away.

80
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,040
Why?

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,620
There's a patient with a noble identity dropped by the magistrate's residence.

82
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,730
All physicians were asked to go there.

83
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,830
- Where's the magistrate's residence? 
 - Calm down.

84
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,940
Today, there's a guest holding a medical book in his hand.

85
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,350
Probably he is skilled at healing.

86
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,860
Are you talking about me?

87
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,650
It's him.

88
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,090
Though we haven't met before,

89
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,990
if I'm not wrong, you must be the Tao Sword Deity, right?

90
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,510
Are you the Scholarly Sword Deity?

91
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,810
Yes, I'm.

92
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,630
Why did you leave the mountain?

93
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,660
Also, a woman tagged along...

94
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,530
Li Hanyi?

95
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,160
She was attacked by Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm.

96
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,350
Sir, can you cure her?

97
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,960
I've stopped 26 of them.

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,360
But one is left inside her.

99
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,970
The last Pear Blossom Needle sealed the valve of qi.

100
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,850
And that leads her zhenqi to continue to leak.

101
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,890
If this goes on, not even an immortal can save her in less than an hour.

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,710
Therefore, we ought to force the Pear Blossom Needle out immediately.

103
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,940
Later, I'll seal five of her main acupoints with five silver needles

104
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,280
to guide the zhenqi flow to push the Pear Blossom Needle towards Baihui acupoint.

105
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,460
I need you to exude your zhenqi to draw the needle out.

106
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,850
Let us begin.

107
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,340
The first needle falls on Jiuwei acupoint.

108
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,470
The second needle falls on Shenque acupoint.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,160
The third needle falls on Qihai acupoint.

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,450
The fourth needle falls on Guanyuan acupoint.

111
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,370
The final one falls on Zhongji acupoint.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Do it now.

113
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,360
As expected of Tao Sword Deity.

114
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,870
Withdraw.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,280
You're injured.

116
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,750
It doesn't matter.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,250
Little Fairy.

118
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,140
She'll be fine. Do not worry.

119
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,740
Where's that Pear Blossom Needle?

120
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,100
That needle almost killed her,

121
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,240
so naturally, I'd crushed it.

122
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,620
State Preceptor.

123
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,510
Wading through millions of scrolls and million li of the journey.

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,380
Taoist Xie, it's been a long while.

125
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,020
State Preceptor.

126
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,680
Are you here for Zhao Yuzhen?

127
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,250
However, a night passed, and I haven't seen you talking to him.

128
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,320
You only stare at him.

129
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,420
I wonder what is on your mind, State Preceptor.

130
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,990
How does a wilted tree thrive?

131
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,590
How do bleak days revive?

132
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,020
Your speech is indeed profound, State Preceptor.

133
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,640
I promised Lu Suzhen, who was Yuzhen's master, to do him a favor.

134
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,020
Sadly, I'm late.

135
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,120
But he came at the right time.

136
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,190
I think Xueyue Sword Deity should be awake now.

137
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,770
 I've been thinking about how it'd be when we meet each other again.

138
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,860
 When I left Mount Wangcheng, I passed by a peach blossom grove.

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,720
 I think peach blossom should be around where we meet.

140
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,480
 Hence, I've brought some flower petals.

141
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,160
 Do you like it?

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,200
 This is not the right time.

143
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,930
 There is nothing I can do if you do not like it.

144
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,160
 I've left Mount Wangcheng. I won't go back.

145
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,060
 Little Fairy. Let's go.

146
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,180
 I'm not young anymore.

147
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,390
 That is true.

148
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,900
 We're not young.

149
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,670
 You're a mature fairy, and you look prettier than before.

150
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,930
 Stop calling me Little Fairy.

151
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,820
 Just call me Li Hanyi.

152
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,670
 Amidst the bone-chilling winter wind, a wanderer wears no coat to stand against it.

153
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
 This name sounds ominous.

154
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,610
 Let's come up with a new name.

155
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,560
 What's it?

156
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,690
 Taohua.
(TN: peach blossom)

157
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,670
 Li Taohua. What do you think?

158
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,940
 That sounds gaudy.

159
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,560
 The name sounds gaudy only when it's used by others.

160
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,180
 However, if it were for you, the name would sound elegant and gorgeous.

161
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,120
A wilted tree thrives when spring arrives, no youth repeats twice.

162
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,470
We were in our youth when I set on eyes on you

163
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,650
in the midst of peach blossom petals falling.

164
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,040
Before you were up, I'd asked Mr. Xie Xuan to seek me a place.

165
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,960
What does the place look like?

166
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,630
A small residence with a peach blossom tree,

167
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,750
like the place we first met.

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,200
Why do we need a place like that?

169
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,470
As we reunite here,

170
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,090
I can finally ask the question I wanted to ask you when I was young.

171
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,240
Little Fairy, will you be my wife?

172
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,900
 People said "bloom at dawn, pluck at dusk"

173
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,550
 is indeed a killjoy.

174
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,900
 Because the flower isn't the same as the one at dawn.

175
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,430
 Likewise, the person isn't the same as the one you used to love.

176
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,160
 This is hilarious.

177
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,130
 People change because their hearts aren't pure enough.

178
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,930
 Flowers change because they aren't beautiful enough.

179
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,530
 Fortunately, I'm still the one I used to be.

180
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,920
 While the flower is still the most beautiful one.

181
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,540
 Plucking the flower that blooms at dawn.

182
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,960
 What a blessing.

183
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,450
You're pretty.

184
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm pretty because I have you.

185
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,470
I should've come down earlier.

186
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,440
This is the happiest moment of my life.

187
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,090
Our lives just barely start though.

188
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,350
♫   Turns every scene into a dream  ♫

189

♫   In a daze  ♫

♫   How many years have passed?  ♫

194

I'm nearing my death.

Zhao Yuzhen.

196
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,470
Peach blossom outside blooms beautifully,

197
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,300
but the lady here blooms more lovely.

198
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,220
Little Fairy.

199

 a woman.

202
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,110
 But that doesn't do you justice.

203
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,950
 You're like a fairy.

204
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,190
I'm happy.

205
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,630
 Halt.

206
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,630
 You're late.

207
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,960
 Silly chap.

208
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,990

211
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,000
I can meet you in this life.

212
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,400
 Oh, my little fairy. Why are you wearing a mask again?

213
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,970
 It doesn't look good on you.

214
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,090
 Taking it off is better.

215
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,920
 How beautiful.

216
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,010
 Her voice is soothing too.

217
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,700
 When I come here the third time, you will come with me and leave the mountain.

218
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,390
 Of course, I will.

 I've never been happier.

230
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,953
♫   In the end, looking back  ♫

231

 Our lives just barely start though.

 As long as I can stay by your side for good, I'll do whatever it takes.

235
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,570
The peach blossom tree...

236
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,750
This...

237
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,960
After all, the calamity is still inevitable.

238
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,160
We, Taoists of Mount Wangcheng,

239
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,830
devoted ourselves to divination and to rid of secularity.

240
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,220
However, we won't let them off the hook.

241
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,830
Disciples of Mount Wangcheng.

242
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,630
 Yes.

243
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,610
Mount Wangcheng shall avenge this!

244
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,920
 We shall avenge this!

245
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,470
How come the Pojun Sword shudders intensely?

246
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,129

247
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,300
Why is a star fallen in this broad daylight?

248
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,440
What did you see?

249
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,790
After this strife, we start a feud with Xueyue City and Mount Wangcheng

250
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,860
who used to stay out of secular grudges.

251
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,850
Is it really worth it?

252
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,950
Muyu.

253
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,650
I never raise doubt against Leader's plan.

254
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,950
However, I'd like to ask if it's worth it.

255
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,220
Regardless of Xueyue City or Mount Wangcheng,

256
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,570
they'll cease to exist before long.

257
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,680
State Preceptor. Did you hear that?

258
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,210
It's the omen of demonic invasion.

259
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll go take a look.

260
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,130
What's wrong?

261
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,460
Nothing.

262
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,110
Somehow I feel ill at ease... and upset.

263
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,260
Let's be on our way.

264
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,770
Royal Brother.

265
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,170

266
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,310
I wonder why you summon me on short notice.

267
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,610
It's said that Chong'er is back.

268
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,240
Prince Bai?

269
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,010
I heard that he just returned to his residence.

270
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,140
Probably he'll come to pay you a visit later.

271
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,020
Do you miss him, Royal Brother?

272
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,270
Did he come back alone?

273
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,860
Shouldn't he come back alone?

274
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,410
Accompany me.

275
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,900
Where are we going?

276
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,450
Prince Bai's residence.

277
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,406

278
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,310
Greetings, Royal Father.

279
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,830
Rise.

280
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,500
Thank you, Royal Father.

281
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,570
Why have you lost so much weight in just a few days?

282
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,300
Royal Father, I caught a cold after returning from the journey.

283
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,680
I've been recuperating at home lately.

284
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,060
You're weak.

285
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,500
Do take great care of yourself.

286
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,410
Thank you for your concern, Royal Father.

287
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,560
Father. Regarding Chuhe...

288
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,660
Your Majesty. His Highness had tried his best.

289
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,930
However, Sixth Prince made his position very clear.

290
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,930
He was insistent to stay even though I hurt him with my sword.

291
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,470
I know you must have tried your very best, Chong'er.

292
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,820
Everything in this world can't be decided by humans.

293
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,440
We shall obey destiny.

294
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,590
Thank you, Royal Father.

295
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,860
Is Chuhe all right?

296
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,100
Royal Father, Chuhe's faring very well.

297
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,480
Chuhe...

298
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,380
Chuhe said he misses you very much.

299
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,450
Did Chuhe really say this?

300
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,470
My child, you have a kind soul.

301
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,970
Take care of yourself.

302
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,680
I'll head back now.

303
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,930
I bid you farewell, Royal Father.

304
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,630

305
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,640
You're indeed an amusing prince.

306
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,920
I bid you farewell, Uncle.

307
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,290

308
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,480
Royal Brother.

309
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,210
Where are we going now?

310
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,260
To Prince Chi's residence.

311
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:46,538

312
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,240
Royal Father.

313
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,050
You started practicing archery when you were young.

314
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,990
Yet you still missed the target now.

315
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,760
It'll be better to give your eyes to your second brother.

316
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,530
You may not know about this, Royal Father.

317
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:27,360
I've fallen sick for one whole month,

318
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,310
and both my hands feel strengthless now.

319
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,380
Pass it to me.

320
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,260
Are you able to shoot with this heavy bow when you're sick?

321
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,340
That's why I missed the target.

322
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,110
Royal Father. I'm at fault.

323
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,390
I didn't fall sick.

324
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,100
But I'm much bothered by something.

325
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,920
What's it about?

326
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,410
I don't feel like going to the imperial court.

327
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,290
Royal Father, you're amazing.

328
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,920
Kneel down.

329
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,290
Since you don't feel like going to the imperial court, do as you wish.

330
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,830
From today on, stay at home.

331
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,680
Tomorrow, the Chief Academician of the Imperial Library

332
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,310
will lead twelve academicians to your residence to compile the Chronicle of Beili.

333
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,490
Chronicle...

334
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,930
Chronicle of Beili?

335
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,590
But it hasn't been accomplished after several decades?

336
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,240
Yet you assign me this task.

337
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,860
Do you want to lock me down in the residence until my last breath?

338
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,320
Royal Father, please spare me.

339
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,100
Yueli, let us leave.

340
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,410
Yes.

341
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,370
Royal Uncle, please plead on my behalf to Father.

342
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,660
Royal Uncle, I'm at fault. I... This...

343
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,580
You want me to plead on your behalf?

344
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,640
Little nephew.

345
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,770
You ignored me when I conveyed to you the decree to enter the imperial court a few days before.

346
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,650
Don't you think it's too late to beg me now?

347
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,260
Royal Uncle, I'll go to the imperial court.

348
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,770
Royal Uncle...

349
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,260
Let go.

350
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,920
Royal Brother.

351
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,400
I almost couldn't help myself and gave this pathetic brat a spanking.

352
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,320
Yueli, get on the carriage.

353
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,980
I have something to tell you.

354
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,480
Royal Brother.

355
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,070
Are you going to task me with some kind of hassle?

356
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,590
It is not a hassle.

357
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,510
 Actually, I've learned something

358
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,640
that Jade Deity didn't convey to me.

359
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,540
Probably Eunuch Jade Deity reckoned it was something trivial.

360
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,960
No.

361
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,580
It's very important.

362
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,560
There's a young chap in a red outfit beside Chuhe,

363
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,540
named Lei Wujie.

364
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,690
Lei Wujie?

365
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,440
I gave him this name.

366
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,440
No sword unsheathes in a righteous world.

367
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,400
No rebellion emerges in a peaceful empire.

368
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,270
I held him in my arms when he was small.

369
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,310
Is he the son of General Lei and Guardian Li?

370
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,610
He's a bright chap.

371
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:19,370
Much to my surprise, he still returned to Lei Clan, after all.

372
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,660
Well. Do me this favor.

373
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,800
I didn't anticipate much when I sent Chong'er over.

374
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,720
I just wanted to show my attitude.

375
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,670
Now you're in charge of it, so I can rest assured.

376
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,340
I understood.

377
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,370
Go ahead.

378
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,590
Sure.

379
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,760
There's one more thing.

380
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,800
When you meet Chuhe or that Lei's chap,

381
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,750
please pass my message to them,

382
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,440
"I feel guilty for what I did."

383
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,150
No more running. No more running.

384
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,870
I'm out of breath.

385
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,860
I, the mighty Young Master of Tian Wai Tian, am chased by a man carrying a sword,

386
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,990
and I hardly stopped for breath.

387
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,030
This is so embarrassing.

388
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,310
Stop looking for him.

389
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,000
We're weak enough to be tracked by him, but not the other way around.

390
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,850
Brats. I appreciate that you know your limitation.

391
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,460
Senior, your swordsmanship is unrivaled.

392
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,970
We still lack behind by years of cultivation to catch up with you, even though we're gifted.

393
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,720
You have nowhere to run now.

394
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,310
Exactly.

395
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,360
However, someone came to be of my help.

396
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,000
Stupid scholar.

397
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,420
Big Devil.

398
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,340
Very good.

399
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,060
Since you reunite here, Sword Deities.

400
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,360
I don't want to disturb you.

401
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,830
We shall take our leave now. Until next time, hopefully.

402
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,580
Ming Hou, run.

403
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,000
I can't believe Ye Dingzhi has given birth to a useless son.

404
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,670
Rage Sword Deity, if you're better than me, catch me if you can.

405
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,020
Big Devil, let him be.

406
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,140
Do me a favor now.

407
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,820
What's it?

408
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,460
According to the book, after one is possessed by obsession,

409
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,290
the veins flow reversely and both blood and qi surge.

410
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,440
The power will then boost by manifold as compared to before.

411
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,850
However, such conditions only do the person harm and end his life in no time.

412
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

413
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,970
Possessed by obsession?

414
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,970
Big Devil. She's possessed.

415
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,430
Li Hanyi?

416
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,360
Where's Su Changhe?

417
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm going to kill him!

418
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,300
Stupid scholar.

419
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,800
It turns out you wanted me to restrain her.

420
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,380
Why should I help you?

421
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,670
Calm down. I've figured out the method to solve this.

422
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,530
Firstly, render her unconscious and halt the qi inside her.

423
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,770
- Then, find the... 
 - Cut your crap.

424
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,640
It's easy. Knock her out.

425
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,540
Su Changli is dead.

426
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,340
But why are you still alive?

427
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,750
The strength of the target is far from matching the information we had.

428
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,970
Plus, there was Lord Li Su from Sword Heart Tomb.

429
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,310
In my estimation, I should pull out from the task in a situation like that.

430
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,830
I see.

431
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,730
Your mission ends for now.

432
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,530
As for Changli's death, it has nothing to do with you.

433
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,260
Thank you, Leader.

434
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,650
You may leave now.

435
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,130
Leader. Those young brats...

436
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,270
Mu Ying and Changli have bought enough time for us.

437
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,670
Now that our deployment is all set.

438
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,090
Those mere young brats won't affect our plan.

439
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,610
You intended to kill Mu Ying just now.

440
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,960
When killers fail the mission, it's normal for them to surrender their lives in return.

441
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,240
However, Changli is different from them.

442
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,860
He's a swordsman rather than a killer.

443
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,030
He doesn't deserve to end up like this.

444
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:21,240
As Changli's blood brother, Leader was overly calm just now.

445
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,310

446
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:53,580

447
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,470
- Mr. Xu. 
 - Congratulations, Fort Leader Lei.

448
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,800
- Welcome. 
 - Please come in.

449
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,470
Congratulations, Fort Leader Lei.

450
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:01,470

451
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,260
Clan Leader, almost all of our guests have arrived.

452
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,590
Only guests from Xueyue City and Tang Clan haven't arrived.

453
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,900
What if...

454
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,810
They are important guests.

455
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,210
Naturally, they're worth the wait.

456
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,590
Understood.

457
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,290
Tang Xuan, the best poison alchemist of the Tang Clan.

458
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,400
How come he's attending the banquet?

459
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,920
No.

460
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,310
Inside the carriage is Tang Huang, Elder of External Academy.

461
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,760
Qianhu, I'll come down after I finish smoking.

462
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,410
You can take your time.

463
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,770
We're almost there. It's five li away from Lei Clan.

464
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,570
Hopefully, we can reach there on time.

465
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,340
Someone's ahead of us.

466
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,930
Again, it's Dark River.

467
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,110
Indeed, it's Dark River.

468
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,460
However, it's something different this time.

469
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,820
Su Muyu of Dark River, head of the Su family.

470
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,370
Code name, Umbrella-Wielding Demon.

471
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,390
Xie Qidao, head of the Xie family.

472
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,440
Code name, Grim Reaper.

473
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,460
Our lives are quite important.

474
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,260
Even the killers from Dark River await us.

475
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,370
That's very flattering.

476
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,830
Heart Sword, the famous sword ranked fourth.

477
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,760
That's Lei Wujie.

478
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,700
The one who killed Su Changli.

479
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,950
I'll leave him to you.

480
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,440
As for the rest, I'll take care of them.

481
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,290
It's the Eight Knights of the Lei Clan.

482
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,410

483
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,240
Pathless mountains but endless streams, the exit appears when one least expects to.

484
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,260
It's been a while, Junior Brother Wujie.

485
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,310
You're as eloquent as expected, Senior Brother.

486
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,210
The clan leader ordered us to come down and see you in.

487
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,550
However, I failed to find you.

488
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,840
I thought about returning and taking my punishment.

489
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,760
Unexpectedly, I'd meet you up here at the entrance of the mountain.

490
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,880
By the way, who are they?

491
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,580
I'm Tang Lian from Xueyue City.

492
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,390
They are my juniors.

493
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,440
Oh, you're from Xueyue City. I should've greeted you earlier.

494
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,780
Have you finished chatting?

495
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,320
Judging by that tone, he doesn't seem to be your friend.

496
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,570
Senior Brother.

497
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,040
Are you all right, Senior Brother?

498
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,150
Brother Wujie, lead them to Lei Fortress first.

499
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,640
A hero banquet without heroes from Xueyue City won't live up to its name.

500
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,950
- Senior. 
 - Shut up!

501
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,770
I shouldn't let others look down on Lei Fortress.

502
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,340
Brothers. Formation!

503
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,790
I shall thank you in advance.

504
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,390
Let's go.

505
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,230
Don't let them go.

506
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,420
It's Thunder Shield Array.

507
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,700
Brothers, give them all a good look.

508
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,967

509
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,470
I've kept you waiting, Qianhu.

510
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:41,520
Since you're coming to the banquet, I'm willing to wait for you one day and one night.

511
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,770
You're more polite than your father.

512
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,660
Clan Leader. The guests from Xueyue City...

513
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,040
Well, we shall start the banquet without them.

514
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,470
Sure.

515
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,030
The banquet commences now!

516
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,950
Pathless mountains, but endless streams.

517
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,300
Don't you dare set your foot anymore.

518
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:26,860

519
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,600
Let's drink up. Bottoms up.

520
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,970
Let's drink up, Young Master Yao.

521
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,030
Let's drink.

522
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,280
-  Let's drink. 
 - Let's drink.

523
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,330
- Here. 
 - Bottoms up.

524
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,510
- Let's drink. 
 - Let's drink.

525
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:47,050
At this banquet, we, Lei Fortress, are honored to have Old Master Tang here.

526
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:55,400
Qianhu. If you do feel so, drink it up.

527
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,070
Many years ago, I had a battle with the Demon Sect,

528
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,810
and the toxic cold penetrated my system.

529
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,280
I've quit drinking for many years.

530
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,720
It's a mere toxic cold.

531
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,200
I've added some Blazing Heart Weed to it.

532
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,530
It helps to ward off the cold.

533
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,890
Why?

534
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:25,400
Are you worried that I might add something to the liquor?

535
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,410
Of course not.

536
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,510
Brother Tang Xuan. I've quit drinking for years.

537
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,460
But since this brew is requested by Old Master Tang...

538
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,710
Very well.

539
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,470
What's wrong with me?

540
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,230
I feel giddy.

541
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,830
Spider.

542
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,340
Spider. This...

543
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,910
This is the Array of Thousand Arachnids from Dark River.

544
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,110
We're being ambushed.

545
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,960
Fort Leader! Fort Leader.

546
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,930
Fort Leader, whoever drank the brew, including the disciples on duty, are all poisoned.

547
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,290
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

548
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,540
They've been poisoned.

549
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,110
I wonder why are Old Master Tang and the two guests from Tang Clan

550
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,280
sitting here well?

551
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,700
Qianhu.

552
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,020
Aren't you standing here well, too?

553
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,480
After being attacked by the toxic cold, I'm immune to all poisons.

554
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,870
Oh, I miscalculated this.

555
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,380
You miscalculated?

556
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,110
I'm the one who miscalculated this though.

557
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,570
Despite I have asked Qianhen to handle everything discreetly, we still fail this.

558
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,190
The most secretive poisonous array gangs up with the most secretive Divine Afterglow Dew of the Tang Clan.

559
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,560
It's really out of my depth.

560
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,010
Old Master Tang.

561
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,410
Array of Thousand Arachnids is only mastered by one family,

562
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,510
that's the Mu family, the Dark River.

563
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,760
It's been a long while, Brother Qianhu.

564
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,620
You're the clan leader of Lei Fortress and I'm the head of the Mu family, Dark River.

565
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,280
It's been so long.

566
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,620
I knew it was you.

567
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,210
Spider Maiden, Mu Yumo.

568
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,560
Old Master Tang.

569
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,620
Although both of our families are on bad terms, you betray the entire martial arts world by conspiring with Dark River.

570
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,850
What does it do you good by ganging up with them?

571
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,580
Dark River?

572
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,730
I only came here for a drink.

573
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,630
I know nothing but the brew.

574
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,680
Are you using someone else to do the dirty work?

575
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,000
Why would I do that?

576
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,620
As you know, we have to pull our weight while collaborating in a business.

577
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,020
Where are the Eight Knights?

578
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,620
Supposedly, they should reach soon.

579
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,240
No one will come to your aid.

580
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,490
What has happened?

581
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,720
Did someone invade Lei Fortress?

582
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:10,010

583
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,700
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫
