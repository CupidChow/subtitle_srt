00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,960
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,060
♫  Waving the banner amidst the storm and rain  ♫

00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,520
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,420
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,640

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,204
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,150

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,014

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Any news of that person?

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,360
No.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
It was chaotic last night.

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,700
As we were pursuing them, we even clashed with several groups of scouts.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,680
We ended up...

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
He deliberately leaked his whereabouts to lure us out

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,480
and find our camp by following the clues he found.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,880
After that, he caused chaos by surprise and escaped.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,540
Then he used us to help him get rid of those following him.

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,032
This Wu Xin... sure came up with a great plot.

34
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:38,432
Unless we can get a sword deity to make a move,

35
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:42,100
it'll be difficult to find him again.

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,172
Young Master, should we ask...

37
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:48,700
We don't need to alert my father about something small like this.

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,980
Besides, I can guess

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,000
where he's heading.

40
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,980

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,640
Anyone here?

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,480
Is there anyone around?

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Are you still going to deny that we're lost?

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,848
This is clearly an inn in Beili.

45
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:17,308
We went the opposite way.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,260
We may have taken the wrong road. But the direction is right.

47
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,000
We were heading in the west direction. So how can we get lost?

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,050
 What's this?

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,820
 Master?

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,600

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,960

52
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,380
 Look how heavily at it rains! How strange it is.

53
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,700
 Who's there?

54
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,120
 Who are you?

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,200
 Someone who's here to kill you.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,180
 I heard you've already reached the Carefree Phase at a young age.

57
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,672
 It looks to be true.

58
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:04,576
 It's a pity if you have to die like this.

59
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,460
Xiao Se.

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,800
This place is too dilapidated. We can't stay here at all.

61
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,448
It'll be dark soon.

62
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,840
Why don't we spend the night here after cleaning this place up a bit?

63
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,220
Didn't you just tell me we should get back on the road

64
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,520
because it's not normal for an inn to appear out of a sudden?

65
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,480
I've changed my mind.

66
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,580
Xiao Se, what do you think?

67
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm fine with it.

68
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,340
I knew you weren't asleep.

69
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,320
The mark was left by the martial artist the Great Sage, right?

70
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,900
You're his disciple?

71
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,520
You could say that.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,992
No wonder you know so many things about the martial arts world.

73
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,876
Old Wang You once told me

74
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:04,076
that the Great Sage had a disciple by the last name Xiao.

75
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,490
You should mind your own business.

76
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,792
I should say the same to you.

77
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:16,688
Boss Xiao, remember to come back before the day breaks.

78
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,180
You really hold a grudge.

79
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,700
Master.

80
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,260

81
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,328
Are you heading to Xueyue City?

82
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,860
Yes.

83
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,060
Do you know the consequences if you enter Xueyue City?

84
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,368
I heard...

85
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,148
you are doing it for 500 silver taels.

86
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,420
Master, you're indeed worthy to be called the Great Sage.

87
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,012
You actually found out.

88
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,084
Is it all because of 500 silver taels?

89
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:19,460
Anything related to silver taels is important, after all.

90
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,496
All right, it's for 500 silver taels.

91
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,460
But it's not a small amount.

92
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,212
Can Xueyue City afford it?

93
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,044
They can't.

94
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,224
But I'm certain they'd be happy to help me claim the money.

95
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes, they'd be happy indeed.

96
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,960
Not only they would, any major force in the Martial Arts World

97
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,500
would be happy to claim the 500 silver taels for you.

98
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,540
- However... 
 - However,

99
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,184
I'm not the only person who can claim this money.

100
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,720
I know that.

101
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,396
You're the one with the least advantage.

102
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:03,600
We need to fight for some things.

103
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,524
If I don't try it, how will I know the outcome?

104
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,832
If you fail,

105
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,936
you'll die.

106
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,200
I've died once before already, haven't I?

107
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,560
Even the Sword Deity failed to kill me.

108
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,848
Stop probing.

109
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,732
I already know who crippled your martial arts

110
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,980
and seriously injured me that night.

111
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,260
Was it the Rage Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian?

112
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,020
Could it be the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang?

113
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,084
Stop guessing.

114
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,092
Since you've decided to let go,

115
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:46,500
stop trying to find out.

116
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,400
It's only 500 silver taels, isn't it?

117
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,524
If you compare it to life,

118
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,696
you should know

119
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,172
which one is more important.

120
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,028
It looks like you don't have faith in me.

121
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,880
Then who do you think can obtain the 500 silver taels?

122
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,740
Prince Bai, Xiao Chong?

123
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,748
Prince Chi, Xiao Yu?

124
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,340
I have faith in Prince Yong An, Xiao Chuhe,

125
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,772
not Xiao Se of the Snowfall Mountain Villa.

126
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,480
Are martial arts skills important to you?

127
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,980
You know that was not what I meant.

128
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,892
Just look at yourself.

129
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,740
What's wrong with me?

130
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,660
You are arrogant, thin-skinned, and boastful.

131
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,500
You show off your petty tricks, treat others ruthlessly, and are self-righteous.

132
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,244
These are the six shortcomings a monarch should avoid.

133
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Master, it's your turn.

134
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,740
I'm passing it down to you.

135
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,540
My martial arts skills are crippled.

136
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,820
How is this Wuji Staff going to be useful to me?

137
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,600
It's going to be a rough journey to claim that 500 silver taels.

138
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,932
You can use it as a crutch.

139
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,700
Thank you, Master.

140
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Master, there's one thing I still can't figure out.

141
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,960
I hope you can enlighten me.

142
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
What is it?

143
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,332
I want to go to Yushi.

144
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:41,880
Can you tell me the direction?

145
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,024
Are you lost?

146
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,280
Yes.

147
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,580
Master, this is not funny.

148
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,760
I thought you brought those two lads to seek death on purpose.

149
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,168
Seek death?

150
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,880
There's a city 30 li  (9.32 miles)  to the west.

151
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,940
What city?

152
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,796
Muliang City?

153
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,820
Did I hear that correctly?

154
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,660
I can't believe that we'd come here by accident.

155
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,876
Xiao Se, why don't you have any reaction at all?

156
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,700
What kind of reaction should I have?

157
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,120
There are four major cities in this world.

158
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,740
Tianqi of the North, Xueyue of the South,

159
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,680
Wushuang of the East, and Muliang of the West.

160
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,540
It's a city as famous as Xueyue City in the Martial Arts World.

161
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,528
I must go and visit it.

162
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,620
It's nothing but a deserted ghost city.

163
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,140
What's so special about it?

164
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,216
How can you say that?

165
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:44,440
Every martial artist knows there is this one person living in Muliang City.

166
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,820
And this is the person who made Muliang City one of the four most famous cities.

167
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,700
This person is one of the Five Sword Deities,

168
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,300
Luo Qingyang, the Lone Sword Deity!

169
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,740
The Lone Sword Deity,

170
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,724
Luo Qingyang.

171
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
Enough said.

172
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,944
How would he not know about rumors in the Martial Arts World?

173
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,820
It's said the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang,

174
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,060
lives alone in Muliang City to practice his swordsmanship.

175
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,800
For more than ten years, he has never left the city.

176
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,440
He claims he'll only leave the city after he masters the Nine-Song Sword Technique.

177
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,864
His situation is quite similar to Lei Hong of the Lei Clan.

178
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Lei Hong, Luo Qingyang, and Zhao Yuzhen,

179
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,860
who has never left Mount Wangcheng since they were born.

180
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,520
These three people are considered the three homebodies in the Martial Arts World.

181
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,600
Wait, why are you...

182
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,960
But not many rumors in the Martial Arts World are true.

183
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,021
Lei Hong and Zhao Yuzhen at least have the support of the Lei Clan

184
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,020
and Mount Wangcheng respectively.

185
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,052
But there's only Luo Qingyang in Muliang City.

186
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,600
What has he been eating and drinking for the past ten years?

187
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,020
Does he really think his title makes him an immortal who doesn't eat or drink?

188
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,220
You have a point.

189
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,760
Rumors may be exaggerated.

190
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,112
But the title of Luo Qingyang as the Sword Deity is real.

191
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:23,040
Many people think Luo Qingyang's martial arts skills can rank first among the Five Sword Deities.

192
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Lei Wujie.

193
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,780
Lei Wujie! What's wrong?

194
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,880
I mean, since we're already here,

195
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,360
why don't we go and take a look?

196
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,780
Shall we?

197
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,820
Master Wuchan, how long until we reach Nine Dragon Sect?

198
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,360
We're almost there.

199
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,804
Lian, it's sweet.

200
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,040
Here.

201
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,532
Why aren't you eating?

202
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,080
Let me feed you.

203
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,260
Senior Brother, we'll...

204
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,260
Xiao Se's face turned pale when I said I was going to Muliang City.

205
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,500
Wu Xin is the same too.

206
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,080
What did he mean by it's better not to cause trouble?

207
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,180
I only want to watch from afar.

208
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,340
It's not like I'm going to challenge the Lone Sword Deity.

209
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,420
They're making a big deal out of this.

210
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,700
Prince Chi sure is cautious.

211
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,120
He actually asked us to meet him at the Western Regions' border.

212
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,324
The situation in Beili is different from Nanjue's.

213
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,768
Their crown prince has not been decided yet.

214
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,900
Those princes who are eligible for the throne

215
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,340
have been growing their powers in the martial arts world in secret.

216
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,916
Other than Prince Chi, Xiao Yu, there's Prince Bai, Xiao Chong.

217
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,032
Behind Prince Bai, Xiao Chong,

218
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,440
is Yan Zhantian, the Rage Sword Deity.

219
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
What about Prince Chi?

220
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,800
Could the Sword Deity who supports him is...

221
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,360
Of course, it's Luo Qingyang, the Lone Sword Deity.

222
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,260
Who's there?

223
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,680
Was that thunder?

224
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,900
But it doesn't look like it's going to rain.

225
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,280
That's the direction Lei Wujie went.

226
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,060
Could it be he's engaging in a fight with someone?

227
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,636
This airhead could cause trouble from anything.

228
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:24,300
This place is quite secluded.

229
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,420
To my surprise, Lei Wujie would run into people who made him use his explosives.

230
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,248
They're on the move.

231
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:40,900
It looks like they're heading in the direction of Muliang City.

232
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,740
Muliang City.

233
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Lone Sword Deity.

234
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,300
What?

235
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,720
Aren't you going to rescue him?

236
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
No.

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,020
What did you say?

238
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,368
That airhead won't die that easily.

239
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,800
He may have already escaped. He'll be back here soon.

240
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,240
You may say that. But they're heading toward Muliang City.

241
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,660
If they provoked the Lone Sword Deity...

242
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,240
Didn't he want to see the Lone Sword Deity?!

243
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,624
If he met him, it would be just as he wanted.

244
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Are you troubled by something?

245
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,300
Ever since you came back last night, you've been a little off.

246
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,720
If you want to go, you can go alone.

247
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,300
That airhead was the one who wanted to help you. I never agreed to do so.

248
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,240
I can take this chance to split ways with you. It's better for me this way.

249
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,340
Are you scared?

250
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,812
You can go alone. Why do you want to take someone who doesn't know martial arts at all?

251
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,540
Isn't Lei Wujie your companion?

252
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,440
We only met by chance and became acquainted, that's all.

253
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,948
His life doesn't concern me.

254
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,380
I've been smart since I was a child.

255
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,700
I reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven when I was 13.

256
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,260
I was excited at the time and asked Old Wang You

257
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,012
if I was considered a prodigy of the generation.

258
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,224
After I pestered him relentlessly, he finally told me

259
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:48,740
there was also someone in Beili who reached the Carefree Phase of Heaven at 13.

260
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,524
At 17, he reached the Mental Phase of the Unknown.

261
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:56,117
He deserves the reputation of the greatest prodigy in the world.

262
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:59,780
He's the disciple of the Great Sage of the martial arts world,

263
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,064
the Sixth Prince of Beili, Xiao Chuhe.

264
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:07,648
Soon after that, the incident with Prince Langya happened.

265
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,800
Li Xinyue, one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi, died.

266
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:16,944
 Her daughter, Li Hanyi, pointed her sword at the Emperor,

267
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,160
 which shook the Martial Arts World.

268
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,740
 It's said Xiao Chuhe kneeled in Tianqi City for three days and three nights

269
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,600
 to plead mercy for Prince Langya.

270
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,040
 Finally, he was implicated and demoted to a commoner.

271
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,840
At that time, I thought Xiao Chuhe may be from the imperial family.

272
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,972
But he's unexpectedly a righteous person.

273
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,560
It's someone worth making friends with.

274
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,344
At first, I thought you were Xiao Chuhe.

275
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,936
Stop pretending as if you know everything.

276
00:22:56,936 --> 00:23:01,380
You like telling stories, right? I can tell you one too.

277
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,920
In the last battle of the Demon Sect's expedition in the east 12 years ago,

278
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,080
every major sect in Beili besieged the Grand Master of the Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi.

279
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,152
Ye Dingzhi was defeated and died after he took his own life.

280
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,036
The funny thing was the person who betrayed Ye Dingzhi

281
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:22,220
was his best friend, Wang Rensun.

282
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,648
In my opinion, Ye Dingzhi claimed himself to be the greatest in the world.

283
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:31,840
But he eventually died because of his friend's betrayal. Utmost stupidity.

284
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,076
Why? Does that humiliate you?

285
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:42,080
Without using any martial arts skills, I'm going to teach you a lesson.

286
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,940
I'm warning you.

287
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,340
- Are you mad? 
 - I'm going to rip your foul mouth!

288
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,800
Are you out of your mind?

289
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,620
 You are arrogant, thin-skinned, and boastful.

290
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,960
 You show off your petty tricks, treat others ruthlessly, and are self-righteous.

291
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,940
 These are the six shortcomings a monarch should avoid.

292
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,980
I'm sorry.

293
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,760
Today, there's no Young Master of Tian Wai Tian

294
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,680
or Xiao Chuhe.

295
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,580
I'm only Wu Xin from Hanshui Temple.

296
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,820
No matter what, Lei Wujie came here because of me.

297
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,060
So I must go and bring him back.

298
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,200
 And you are only Xiao Se of Snowfall Mountain Villa.

299
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,980
 I have faith in Prince Yong An, Xiao Chuhe,

300
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,828
 not Xiao Se of the Snowfall Mountain Villa.

301
00:25:23,828 --> 00:25:27,240
I dare you to fight one on one. Do you call yourself great for outnumbering me?

302
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,320
Rascal, cut the crap. Who sent you here?

303
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,840
Just kill me if you want. If I blink, I'm not a hero!

304
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,040
-  These people seem to be carrying Nanjue's long blade.  
 - Untie me now!

305
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,440
-   This man does look familiar.  
- We can fight until the day turns dark.

306
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,200
 He's the Crown Prince of Nanjue's guard, Fu Hengxing.

307
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,960
 There must be a special reason for him to show up here.

308
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,080
 I think Wujie must have overheard their conversation by accident.

309
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,940
 Why is Wu Xin not here yet?

310
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,580
Teach him a lesson.

311
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,860
You're not serious, are you? No!

312
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,420
Stop!

313
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,460
Xiao Se!

314
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,280
It's you?

315
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,400
I didn't expect you to remember me.

316
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,852
How could I forget?

317
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:28,140
The Crown Prince is still upset about losing a city to you

318
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,780
at the Qianjin Gambling House in Tianqi City back then.

319
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,380
That was the folly of youth.

320
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Since you showed up here, I suppose you know quite a bit about our business.

321
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,924
How's my worthless brother doing now?

322
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,800
It looks like you know everything. That's why you brought him to stop us.

323
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
What a clever strategy.

324
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,316
It's not my clever strategy.

325
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:07,940
After all, nothing in Beili goes unnoticed by that person.

326
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,220
Are you here under orders?

327
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,940
I'm only here to deliver a message.

328
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,704
I hope you can go back and tell your crown prince that there are some things he can't meddle with.

329
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,068
I was almost tricked by you.

330
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:25,612
Why do you say so?

331
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:28,232
As far as I know,

332
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:32,052
you were banished from Tianqi City.

333
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,040
That information is right.

334
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,860
But matters in Tianqi City are more unfathomable than you imagined.

335
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,660
If you don't believe me, you can try.

336
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,780
All right. I'm willing to try.

337
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,760
Why aren't you fighting? Do you only know how to avoid my attacks?

338
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,220
I didn't expect the prodigy of the world in the past can't even hold his own weapon.

339
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,620
How tragic. Prepare to die!

340
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,280
Xiao Se!

341
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,020
Wu Xin.

342
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,728
Leave now.

343
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,820
Let's go.

344
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,600
When did you arrive?

345
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,680
It was when you started confronting that person.

346
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,520
Since you were already here, why didn't you make a move earlier?

347
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,044
I wanted to, but you were talking about the folly of youth.

348
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:46,472
I found it interesting, so I decided to watch it longer.

349
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,184
Then, can you untie me?

350
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,900
Xiao Se, you know that person?

351
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,540
I was listening to you two talking, but found it so confusing. I didn't completely understand.

352
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,260
From what he said, you used to be an official in Tianqi City.

353
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,560
But you were dismissed after that. Why?

354
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,440
You also mentioned your younger brother. What's going on?

355
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,612
Say something.

356
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,560
You obviously can kill those three. Why didn't you do it?

357
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,960
How can I take lives as I please?

358
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,660
If they find out they were tricked, they'll definitely come back for us. We should get out of here now.

359
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,360
You're right.

360
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
We should hit the road to Yushi Kingdom.

361
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,664
You didn't answer my questions yet.

362
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,240
Xiao Se, why?

363
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,100

364
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,440
Ling Jun, where is he now?

365
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,520
Master, the scouts reported that he escaped from Belle Manor several days ago.

366
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,480
During his escape, he ran into the Western Regions' most vicious mounted bandits.

367
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,300
After that, he created chaos and is nowhere to be found now.

368
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,020
He should be on his way here.

369
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,100
But...

370
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,460
Keep talking.

371
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,560
He's not traveling alone.

372
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,980
Is Tang Lian with him too?

373
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,772
He was persuaded by him?

374
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:26,060
It's not Tang Lian. It's two young men.

375
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,240
One wears a red garment, while the other one is the owner of an inn.

376
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,260
But we're still not clear about their identities right now.

377
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,660
Master, how did you know he would come here?

378
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,476
He wants to see someone here.

379
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,740
Wu Xin.

380
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,200
If you don't have money to spend in the Kingdom of Yushi,

381
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,312
I can lend you some.

382
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:09,200
At most, you can pay me twice the amount in the future.

383
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,220
If you truly have no money, you can also pay with your secret martial arts.

384
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,240
But if you really don't know the direction,

385
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
I can't help you even if I want to.

386
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,608
If we knew the direction, we wouldn't have met you.

387
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,560
Mister, please buy one.

388
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,480
Stop looking. He's not a monk.

389
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,980
He can't show you the way to Great Fanyin Temple.

390
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,180
He sure can hold his liquor.

391
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,900
The pot of liquor he's drinking costs two or three silver taels at Snowfall Mountain Villa.

392
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,440
Two or three silver taels?

393
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,440
How many jars of plain liquor I can buy with that much money?

394
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,100
Found you.

395
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,312

396
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,100
An expert indeed.

397
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,820
Don't just stay here. Go after them.

398
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,620
You're right.

399
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,240
Abbot.

400
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,260
Abbot Falan, it has been more than ten years since we bade farewell in Tianqi City.

401
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,412
How have you been?

402
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,040
How dare you?

403
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,820
No matter. The Abbot is not being disrespectful.

404
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,136
He just can't speak.

405
00:32:56,136 --> 00:33:00,236
Abbot, I'm here to seek a person.

406
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,280
I have a letter written by the Lord of Yushi.

407
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,240
Twelve years ago, the Grand Master of Demon Sect, Ye Dingzhi,

408
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,640
came to see your master, The Venerable One, to inquire about Heaven's will.

409
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,580
No matter how Ye Dingzhi threatened him with his sword,

410
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,812
The Venerable One only shook his head silently.

411
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,580
We'll put aside the Buddhist doctrine.

412
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,500
You surely have the demeanor of The Venerable One

413
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,948
when you shake your head silently.

414
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:34,640
Abbot, you've helped that person hide for 12 years.

415
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,620
This time,

416
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,120
you can't hide him anymore.

417
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,100

418
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,720
Why aren't we on the move?

419
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,530
We're already here.

420
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,550

421
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,740
What is all this noise?

422
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,760
Why are there so many people coming here today?

423
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,560
What are they doing here?

424
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,676
Kick them out!

425
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:09,100
Senior Brother, who's this person?

426
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,060
The Slumber Luohan Fist.

427
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,200
This isn't the Slumber Luohan Fist.

428
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,552
He's just drunk.

429
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:18,140
- Why did you come back here again? 
 - Falan.

430
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,760
Great Fanyin Temple doesn't have any rules that forbid me from visiting him.

431
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,180
How competent can a drunkard be?

432
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,464
It's a pity to see the Precept Breaking Blade in your hand.

433
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,360
Senior Brother, stop shaking your head.

434
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,000
We can't avoid the inevitable.

435
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,320
Since we can't, we'll just kill them.

436
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
It's been 12 years since we last met,

437
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,780
Wang Rensun, the Shattering Blade.

438
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Oh, so you're the effeminate

439
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,544
Eunuch Jade Deity, Incense Bearer.

440
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,820
Incense Bearer?

441
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:34,460
It's true that people will meet again after a farewell.

442
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,920
Oh, Wu Xin.

443
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,900
Why are there always experts wherever you go?

444
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,408
And they're always picking a fight.

445
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:44,648
Are these experts going to fight?

446
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,800
You know the Lei Clan is a well-known family in the Martial Arts World.

447
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,740
How did they produce an airhead like you?

448
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,440
- That's not how you pronounce it. 
 - Airhead.

449
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,740
- No, it's not. 
 - Airhead.

450
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,200
Since you're here,

451
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,500
you can get down from there.

452
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,260
Did they notice us?

453
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,160
Shut up.

454
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,740
Thank you for coming all the way to see me, Incense Bearer.

455
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,892
I feel honored.

456
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,560
- Incense Bearer. 
- Don't address me that way.

457
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,552
Only the one in the palace can address me as such.

458
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Eunuch Jade Deity.

459
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,092
I'm not used to you being so respectful.

460
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,940
Where is the friend in white who argued with me about tea tasting that year?

461
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,668
You came to see me for tea tasting.

462
00:36:55,668 --> 00:36:59,204
But you're here to capture me now.

463
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:02,796
I have to follow the order of the one in the palace.

464
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,316
But I can still

465
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,180
keep you alive.

466
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,120
You can stop there.

467
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,780
All the way, Xueyue City, Nine Dragon Sect,

468
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,700
Wushuang City, and Tian Wai Tian had come to me.

469
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,012
Every single one of them said they wouldn't kill me.

470
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,340
So, the condition you offered

471
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,832
is not special at all.

472
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:38,364
Be it Xueyue City or Wushuang City,

473
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,556
the power that I'm representing is different from theirs.

474
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:48,276
If I can't take you with me this time, I'll not hesitate to kill you.

475
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:50,948
Eunuch Jade Deity, don't go too far.

476
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:54,740
If you want to kill him, you have to go through me first!

477
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,820
You...

478
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
What?

479
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,220
This time, you can't do it?

480
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,116
Eunuch Jade Deity is here for me.

481
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:24,192
We'll talk about what happened between us later.

482
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:28,796
The drunk man looks like an expert.

483
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:33,948
If I'm not mistaken, the person Wu Xin wants to meet is him.

484
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:36,900
Do you mean the old friend Wu Xin mentioned?

485
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,560
It's just an old score from the previous generation.

486
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,820
Please brandish your sword.

487
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword.

488
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,300
Wu Xin, I heard you've learned many strange martial arts skills.

489
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,780
What are you planning to use this time?

490
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,912
Great Soul Seeker?

491
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:37,284
You even mastered the martial arts skills of the Great Sorrow.

492
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,560
 Zhou'er.

493
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,200
 Eunuch Jade Deity, what's the matter?

494
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
 Why can't you look into my eyes?

495
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,000
Break!

496
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,780
Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword sure precedes its reputation.

497
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,580
When Eunuch Jade Deity was 17, he became famous with the Blizzard Sword in the Martial Arts World.

498
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,996
Wu Xin is also 17 now.

499
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,300
Wu Xin, I'll ask you one last time.

500
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,420
Are you coming with me or not?

501
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,292
It's a pity to kill someone as interesting as you.

502
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:32,068
It's not easy to kill me.

503
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,700
 This is bad.

504
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,380
 Zhou'er.

505
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,660
Your Devil Eye won't work on me.

506
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,364
Die now!

507
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:30,060

508
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,700
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

509
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,080
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

510
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,200
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

511
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,740
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫

♫  Fame and fortune do not matter to an enlightened person  ♫

518
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,940
♫  I face the sun  ♫

519
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,100
♫  To have a pristine soul in this polluted world  ♫

520
