23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,830
I can't make a decision until the moment when Prince Langya Army arrives at the city.

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,240
At this moment, I just hope you could trust me once.

26
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,170
I see.

27
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,090
You want the commander's tally in my hands that can mobilize Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,670
That's right.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,670
Is everyone here?

30
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,770
They have camped a li  (approx. 500 m)  away.

31
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,520
Uncles,

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,640
do you think those who are coming to join me now are having mixed feelings?

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,620
After all, father didn't allow me to go to the army back then.

34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,540
I don't know them well, and I've never even met most of them.

35
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,500
I have the title Prince Langya because I inherited it from my father.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,060
The troops only come to welcome me because of my father's military prestige.

37
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,070
But these have nothing to do with me.

38
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:11,160
When those people see me, do you think they will think I am worthy of the title?

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,940
Never mind. My good times have come to an end.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,800
Listen here, all soldiers of Ye Battalion!

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,520
 Yes!

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,320
From today onward, Ye Battalion will be part of the Langya Army!

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,790
 Langya! Langya! Langya!

44
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,270
 Greetings, Your Highness!

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,730
You have worked hard all these years.

46
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,680
I am glad.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,620
Since you are all here today, I won't let you down.

48
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,880
It's time to tell the world that we are back

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,370
and the Langya Army is back.

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,300
Please tell me.

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,330
Where is there?

52
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,240
 Tianqi! Tianqi!

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,640
We are going to Tianqi

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,430
to show the world that the Langya Army is back.

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,000
Langya Army is coming. Beili will be shaken again.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,620
 Beili will be shaken again!  Beili will be shaken again!

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,040
Let them know that we never conceded defeat and never left!

58
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,190
Military report!  Military report!

59
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,750
Expedited urgent report!

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,120
- Why are you so flustered?  
 - It's a military report.

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,690
Ye Xiaoying has risen up in rebellion.

62
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,210
He's leading the old troops of Prince Langya to Tianqi City.

63
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,340
 That brat Xiao Se's prediction came true.

64
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,970
His Majesty has fallen into a coma. I don't know when he would wake up.

65
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,850

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,610
Langya Army is moving northward with a sweeping victory.

67
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,900
These garrison troops couldn't stop them at all.

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,900
Imperial father  just happened to fall ill at times like this.

69
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,980
Everything is like a well-planned game,

70
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,520
and we are all pawns trapped inside.

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,610
Have you got any ideas?

72
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,270
I sent Ji Xue there.

73
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,160
She should be seeing Xiao Lingchen soon.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,970
You want Ji Xue to convince Xiao Lingchen?

75
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,190
What do you think will happen if Xiao Lingchen calls off the attack?

76
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,400
He would be fed mute poison and be tied to a horse by my father.

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,990
He has to go to the battlefield, even if it means he has to be forced.

78
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,650
You are right.

79
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,180
Why did you still send Ji Xue over then?

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,610
I need to know what he really thinks about this.

81
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,650
The moon in Beili is not as beautiful as the moon on the sea.

82
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,640
How is it not as beautiful?

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,820
The moon on the sea is big and round.

84
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,030
The moon in Beili looks a bit blood-colored.

85
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,970
What do you think, Miss Ji Xue?

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,110
You remember me?

87
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,060
Of course, I do.

88
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,740
After all, you are so pretty.

89
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,480
I remember I liked to follow you around when I was little.

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,050
I did whatever you did.

91
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,250
But I think you liked to follow Yong...

92
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,870
His name is now Xiao Se.

93
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,380
What's the matter? Did he send you here to persuade me to retreat?

94
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,210
Will you retreat then?

95
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,370
Of course not.

96
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,440
I will trample Tianqi and go right into Tai'an Hall.

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,280
Is that what you really think?

98
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,210
I swear it on my father, Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya,

99
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,920
I mean every word I said.

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,350

101
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,300
Longxie, do you remember Xiao Lingchen?

102
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,740
Of course.

103
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,150
Prince Langya Junior has lived in the military camp since he was little.

104
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,370
He has picked up commoners' habits.

105
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,600
Whenever he stood among the nobles at banquets, he didn't look like royalty at all.

106
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,200
A few days later, Prince Langya Junior, who acts like a commoner,

107
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,820
will ascend the throne.

108
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,350
Is it really going to be that easy?

109
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,550
One last step to go.

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,790

111
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,180
Not bad.

112
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,750
Looks like you have a lot of confidence in me.

113
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,580
Look at that smile on your face.

114
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,730
Have you done all the things that Head Eunuch and I told you to do?

115
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,990
I have convinced my master, Eunuch Zhuoxin.

116
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,250
He will come out of retirement for us.

117
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,050
It wasn't easy to persuade him.

118
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,720
Your master, Zhuoxin, is the only one of the last Five Eunuchs who is still alive.

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,010
He's the perfect person for the next thing we are going to do.

120
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,630
But there is another thing we need.

121
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,980
A joint handwritten letter by all officials in the court.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,770
I've got it here.

123
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,160
What about the most important person?

124
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,850
He has also written down his name.

125
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,920
It's going that smoothly?

126
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,880
Looks like Langya Army's approach to Tianqi with a sweeping victory

127
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,500
has scared the officials out of their wits.

128
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,470
But there is one thing that I find slightly odd.

129
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,690
You mean Marquis Lanyue?

130
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,710
From what Head Eunuch knows,

131
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,420
the commander's tally of Wangli Heavenly Soldiers has been in the hands of Marquis Lanyue.

132
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,490
Now that the Langya Army is close by, the Wangli Heavenly Soldiers, which is 200 li away,

133
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,970
are supposed to be quickly summoned into Tianqi City.

134
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,750

135
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,270
Xiao Chuhe, what are you still hesitating about?

136
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't be anxious, Imperial  Uncle.

137
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,780
Give me some more time.

138
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,960
Fine.

139
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,320
I will give you time. Tell me then, how long do you need?

140
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,220
The order to rescue the Emperor has been issued.

141
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,390
When will the other two armies come to support Tianqi?

142
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,850
They will reach Tianqi in three days.

143
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,920
But it will only take two days for Langya Army to get here.

144
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,050
If we summon Wangli Heavenly Soldiers into the city, we only need to resist for one day.

145
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,390
And the reinforcement will come.

146
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,970
By then, we will be able to put down this rebellion when we join forces.

147
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,580
Will it really be that simple?

148
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,890
Why did the two armies come to support us at such a coincidental speed?

149
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,320
It's not too fast or too slow.

150
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,510
It's exactly at this time.

151
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,180
Fine.

152
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,570
I will give you one more day.

153
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,460
One day later, I will personally lead my men out of the city to meet Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

154
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,660
Thank you for your trust, Imperial Uncle.

155
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,230
Your Highness, I am blind now,

156
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,110
but I can feel that something is bothering you.

157
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,800
I just got the news.

158
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,840
Marquis Lanyue still hasn't summoned Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

159
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,410
General Li of Wangli Heavenly Soldiers has already sent three military reports,

160
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,000
but he still hasn't received permission to enter the city.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,490
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers are getting more anxious.

162
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,800
Of course, they are anxious.

163
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,350
If they can't enter Tianqi, they will have to face the Langya Army head-on.

164
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,880
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers haven't fought a battle for more than a decade.

165
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,580
If they face them head-on, they will only be beaten to a pulp.

166
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,900
Your Highness, do you think this could have been arranged by Prince Yong'an?

167
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,140
What makes you think that?

168
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,320
Prince Yong'an grew up in Prince Langya's military camp.

169
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,780
He has been friends with Xiao Lingchen and Ye Xiaoying.

170
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,050
Besides, it's obvious that Marquis Lanyue is taking his side.

171
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,110
Could he have intended to stop Wangli Heavenly Soldiers from entering the city

172
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,830
while making it easy for Langya Army to do so?

173
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,340
Would you kill a thousand people just to save one?

174
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,920
It depends on who I'm saving.

175
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,750
He is Prince Langya, the hero who is revered by all

176
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,920
and the man whom Sixth Brother respects most.

177
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,390
If killing a man will clear his name,

178
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,530
but if the man is innocent, he won't do it.

179
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,440
This is who he is.

180
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,580
He believes that a drop of unjust blood on his hands

181
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,280
is a stain on Prince Langya.

182
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,260
Therefore, he will not sacrifice all the people.

183
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,790
There is only one reason why he won't dispatch Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

184
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,130
That is he doesn't think this is right.

185
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,250

186
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,130
I don't want to play anymore.

187
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,300
My father personally taught me how to play GO.

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,390
Yet I can never beat you.

189
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,810
You are just too impatient.

190
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,960
Sometimes, don't rush to admit defeat.

191
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,740
This may look like you're bound to lose,

192
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,920
but you can turn the tables with just one move.

193
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,830
It will be a twist.

194
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,350
How come I can't see it?

195
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm not seeing it either.

196
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,830
It's chaos out there. I can't believe you are playing GO here.

197
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,050
If Marquis Lanyue knew about this, he would probably be so furious that he would cough up blood.

198
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,700
Sister Ruoyi, Xiao Se likes to keep people in suspense, and you know it.

199
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm pretty sure he must already have an idea in mind.

200
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,500
You're wrong this time.

201
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,430
Look at this game.

202
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,160
It's as chaotic as the current world.

203
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,660
I met Xiao Lingchen.

204
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,100
What did he say?

205
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,040
He said he would trample Tianqi and kill his way into Tai'an Hall.

206
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,520
And he swore that on his father's name.

207
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,860
Is that all?

208
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,820
In the end, he said,

209
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,820
"I, Xiao Lingchen, carry the bloodline of Prince Langya, so how can I withdraw?"

210
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,810
"You, Xiao Chuhe, inherited the mantle of Prince Langya, so how can you not fight?"

211
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,330
Oh no. This is bad.

212
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,980
He looked like he was on our side before.

213
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,690
Now, it looks like he is going to fight us to the death.

214
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,700
It is only when you are in a desperate situation that you can find a way out.

215
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,130
I found the twist.

216
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,260
Is that really what he said?

217
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,980
Yes.

218
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,890
Is he sick in the brain?

219
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,490
As far as I know, he isn't.

220
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,730
Where is he? Why didn't he come and see me himself?

221
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,860
He said he was afraid that you would chop him up.

222
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,610
So he had to run first. He went to Bai Xiao Sect.

223
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,830
He's afraid that I would chop him up?

224
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,970
I see. He, Ye Xiaoying, and Xiao Lingchen are in cahoots.

225
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,400
That's what I thought when I first heard what he said.

226
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,270
Why is he doing this?

227
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,390
Xiao Se asked you to trust him.

228
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,940
Trust him?

229
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,570
It would be over for us if I made a wrong decision.

230
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,200
But even if you're right, you might not win.

231
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,300
Marquis Lanyue has left the city.

232
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,830
He personally went to summon Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

233
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,170
Looks like he has lost his patience.

234
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,150
Your Highness, permission to speak my mind?

235
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,940
Go on.

236
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,970
I think what we are doing now is very risky.

237
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,450
Many things can go out of control.

238
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,790
First of all, when Langya Army enters the city, we will put ourselves in danger.

239
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,160
Second, what should we do if two armies join forces

240
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,490
but they are still no match for the Langya Army?

241
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,790
War is a gamble.

242
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,970
No one knows the outcome until they leave the table.

243
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,840
But sometimes, you just have to take the risk.

244
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,090
Since I was little, when I have something I want, I take it myself.

245
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm not afraid to lose.

246
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,400
Everyone, Tianqi City is right in front of us.

247
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,040
I have waited for so many years.

248
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,500
This day has finally come.

249
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,460
Uncle Ye.

250
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,010
It's been so long since I looked at Tianqi from this distance.

251
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,310
It's not long.

252
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,480
It was just a big dream.

253
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,820
The dragon roars when it wakes up.

254
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,920
Uncle Ye, Aunt Ye told you those words, didn't she?

255
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,260
When you fought in wars,

256
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,730
Aunt Ye's sword dance in a white dress was breathtaking.

257
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,300
My wife is gone, but her white dress is still here.

258
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,430
Nephew, I'm happy to have you back.

259
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,460
Uncle Ye, why haven't those two armies shown up yet?

260
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,710
I'm ready for a fierce battle.

261
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,950
Be patient.

262
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,220
Those who are hiding in the shadows do not dare to come out and confront you now.

263
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,560
Don't worry.

264
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,610
As long as you take down Tianqi, those people will come out then.

265
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,600
You can fight with them then.

266
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,380
You are right, Uncle Ye.

267
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,240
They are merely ants.

268
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm not waiting for them.

269
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,610
I can't wait to conquer Tianqi.

270
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,160
Conquer Tianqi?

271
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,170
As a soldier or as an emperor?

272
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,070
As a soldier, for now.

273
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,790
My answer may change in the future.

274
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,790
Let's go!

275
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,975

276
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,140
Look. What is that?

277
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,040
Hurry! Let's go! Let's go!

278
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,350
There will be a war.

279
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,300
Let's go.

280
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,110
Stop looking. Let's go. Leave it.

281
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,000
Divine Healer. Divine Healer.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,980
Your Majesty, you're finally awake.

283
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,670
What is that sound?

284
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,240
That sounds like a horn used on the battlefield.

285
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,680
- Changqing! 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,240
What is happening out there?

287
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Your Majesty, Langya Army is outside of Tianqi City.

288
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,690
They still came.

289
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,980
Your Highness, we got a message from the palace.

290
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,380
His Majesty is awake. Please meet him at the Tai'an Hall, Your Highness.

291
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,500
He's awake?

292
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,430
At this timing?

293
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,020
But Marquis Lanyue didn't bring Wangli Heavenly Soldiers back.

294
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,730
There are only city guards and imperial soldiers in the city.

295
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,460
Where do you think Marquis Lanyue has taken Wangli Heavenly Soldiers?

296
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,920
There are two possibilities.

297
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,320
One is that Marquis Lanyue intends to confront Langya Army outside the city.

298
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
He's fighting a hopeless battle then. He has no chance of winning.

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,920
The second possibility is Marquis Lanyue knows that there is no hope, so he's abandoned the city and run away.

300
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,050
No. There is another possibility.

301
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,740
Xiao Chuhe wants to get Marquis Lanyue out of the city on purpose.

302
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,310
He wants to join forces with Ye Xiaoying and Xiao Lingchen.

303
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,380
Does that mean Langya Army will enter Tianqi City unharmed?

304
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,740
No. Even though Wangli Heavenly Soldiers aren't here, the imperial guards, Tiger Soldiers,

305
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,880
and the martial arts masters of Tianqi City will still hit Langya Army hard.

306
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,650
All right. Let's go to Tai'an Hall.

307
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,350
Your Highness, why not avoid it at times like this?

308
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:07,900
No. I don't want to miss this good show today.

309
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,050
If I shoot a command arrow, bring him into the palace.

310
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,800
With his protection, even if there is a troop, they can't kill me.

311
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,960
I only got to know about battlefield horns in books before.

312
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,450
Now that I have heard it with my own ears,

313
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,440
I feel that the descriptions in the book couldn't convey the tragic,

314
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,520
fearful, and majestic sound of the horn.

315
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,080
Little Disciple, I'm not as calm as you are.

316
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,590
And I'm not as poetic as you.

317
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,080
All I know is we are dying.

318
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
We will be trampled by the horses of the Langya Army?

319
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,290
How irony.

320
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,860
When I was little, I only heard that Langya Army kept Beili safe and peaceful.

321
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,740
They were like gods from heaven who were revered by all,

322
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,580
but now...

323
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,870
But, Master, I won't let you die.

324
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,130
I'll take you out of the palace now.

325
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,520
We are not officials and have no positions here.

326
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,150
Langya Army won't make things difficult for us, I think.

327
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,290
Are you sure?

328
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,150
Don't worry.

329
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,590
Xiao Se told me about a safe place.

330
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,870
Miss Sikong will protect us.

331
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,520
Tianqi.

332
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,880
Tianqi City was originally a military city.

333
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,600
It's defensible.

334
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,190
How many days will it take for our army to invade this city?

335
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,680
If I'm not mistaken, the largest battle force in this city is Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

336
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,930
Although this army's combat power isn't strong, its Tianji Crossbow Formation is perfect for defending the city.

337
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,530
So, even Langya Army needs two days to take the city.

338
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,440
What if we attack it regardless of all costs?

339
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,920
One day.

340
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,770

341
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,440
How disappointing.

342
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,050
I was expecting to fight a fierce battle to take the city.

343
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,840
They're surrendering already?

344
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,970
What is going on?

345
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,070
You are worried that it might be a trap?

346
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,560
Yes.

347
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,990
Something like this has happened before.

348
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,780
They opened the gate and let the enemy in.

349
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,760
Then, they killed the general to repel the army.

350
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,120
In a hopelessly deadly battle, this is their only chance.

351
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,330
So, we can't rule out that they have made this plan.

352
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,270
The gate is open.

353
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,490
Are we going to let them intimidate us?

354
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,400
Kill the general?

355
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,420
I am right here.

356
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,860
My head is right here!

357
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,850
Come and get it!

358
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,680
Enter the city!

359
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,250
Has Tianqi City been invaded by the army of 200,000 soldiers?

360
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,980
Is the army led by Lingchen?

361
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,340
Your Majesty, he's accompanied by General Ye Xiaoying.

362
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,970
Lingchen is a kind-hearted boy, just like his father.

363
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,190
At least Tianqi City won't suffer casualties.

364
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,140
Pass my order

365
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,280
to avoid unnecessary clashes.

366
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,180
We...

367
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,140
We'll wait for him here.

368
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,570
Your Majesty, the order to rescue the Emperor was delivered while you were in a coma.

369
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,410
You should retreat to Sword Pavilion now and wait for the arrival of reinforcements.

370
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,980
There are 200,000 soldiers. What's the point in retreating to Sword Pavilion?

371
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,140
These men here are loyal soldiers of Beili.

372
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,050
If we retreat, they will have to fight to the death for us.

373
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,000
Are you going to let them die in this unnecessary war?

374
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,420
Unnecessary?

375
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,920
Whenever my father returned home after winning a battle back then,

376
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,640
he would ride slowly down the street like this.

377
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,350
Everywhere he went, people knelt and bowed.

378
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,350
Their eyes were filled with reverence.

379
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,420
But now, they don't even have the courage to come out and take a look.

380
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,870
A lot of people have changed.

381
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,980
This city is not the Tianqi City it once was.

382
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:42,100
Tianqi has been dead since the day my father died.

383
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,550
Nephew, those people should be waiting for us in Tai'an Hall now.

384
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,140
Let them wait a little longer then.

385
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,950
Please wait for me too, General.

386
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,100
I need to drop by Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

387
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,230
State Preceptor, what's your plan?

388
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,020
I will follow fate.

389
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,740
Whose side will fate be on?

390
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,690
Many years ago, it was on Prince Langya's side,

391
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,980
but he gave it up.

392
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,920
Even if the immortals come, they won't be able to drive out 200,000 soldiers.

393
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,825

394
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,350
Great Uncle.

395
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,490
Lingchen?

396
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,690
It's me, Great Uncle.

397
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,380
You're back.

398
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,340
This is great.

399
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,120
Do you really think it's great?

400
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,320
Ruofeng was convicted of treason.

401
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,340
His name won't be enshrined in the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

402
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,740
His name will be here tomorrow.

403
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,900
Great Uncle, please give me an incense stick.

404
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,420
Dear ancestors, coming back this time,

405
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:03,320
I shall set down the rebellion for my imperial family and reestablish the Imperial Court.

406
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,800

407
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,650
Protect His Highness!

408
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,850
State Preceptor has loved me since I was a child.

409
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,350
Don't worry. He won't kill me.

410
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,180
How have you been after all these years?

411
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,850
I haven't been doing well.

412
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,130
I haven't eaten well or slept well.

413
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,490
But ever since I set foot in Tianqi City, I started to feel a little better.

414
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,460
How so?

415
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,510
It feels good that I will get to kill the people I want to kill.

416
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,510
You're a lot like your father, but your father wouldn't do such a thing.

417
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,530
That's because my father was not young when those things happened to him.

418
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,860
But I'm young.

419
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,470
I still have the chance to make mistakes.

420
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,540
Some mistakes are redeemable, but there are certain mistakes

421
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,630
that are the final mistakes you make in life.

422
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,790
Tell me then, my father was executed back then.

423
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,040
What mistake did he make?

424
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,430
Prince Langya didn't make any mistakes.

425
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,180
Yes.

426
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,050
Emperor Mingde is the one who made a mistake.

427
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,160
So, shouldn't he pay the price?

428
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,220
State Preceptor,

429
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,940
perhaps it takes hundreds of years for a man like my father to appear.

430
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,310
He was revered by people, but I don't want to be him.

431
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,540
Chuhe.

432
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,890
Yes, Imperial Father.

433
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,620
You grew up with Lingchen.

434
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,950
Remember to give him advice when the time comes.

435
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,510
There must be no infighting within the Xiao family.

436
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,820
The grudges and feud between Ruofeng and me

437
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,090
should end here.

438
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,630
Don't worry, Imperial Father.

439
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,770
I will protect Tianqi, the Xiao family,

440
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,440
and you.

441
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,450
Chuhe...

442
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,430
That's absurd.

443
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,050
Which of my words you think is absurd, Seventh Brother?

444
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,120
I heard that Marquis Lanyue went to your house two days ago

445
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,570
and he left the city the next day.

446
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,990
He said he was going to meet Wangli Heavenly Soldiers, but he has not returned yet.

447
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,250
I also heard that Marquis Lanyue had given the order in advance

448
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,640
for Tianqi City's gates to be opened to welcome Langya Army into the city.

449
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,500
I think you and Marquis Lanyue have already conspired with the rebels

450
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,850
to give away Tianqi City.

451
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,140
I didn't expect you to be so well-informed despite staying in your residence all the time.

452
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,660
What do you want us to do then?

453
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,690
Let Langya Army and Wangli Heavenly Soldiers have a bloodbath and pay a heavy price?

454
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,040
Let them kill their way into Tianqi City,

455
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,540
step on the corpses of the people of Tianqi City as they continue to kill their way into Tai'an Hall?

456
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,300
and then kill all the imperial family members?

457
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,030
So that the Upper Army and the Lower Army can reap the benefits?

458
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,520
All troops! On alert!

459
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,220
They still came in. Langya Army.

460
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,540
Open the palace gate.

461
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,480
Your Majesty!

462
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,410
I don't want unnecessary casualties.

463
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,970
I will wait for him here.

464
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,270
Open the palace gate!

465
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,400
He looks just like him.

466
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,770
Chong'er.

467
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,550
Lingchen, I didn't know you would still be alive.

468
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,810
Brother Chong'er, you can see now.

469
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,260
Yes.

470
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:07,520
I didn't expect that the first thing I saw after I regained my sight is your rebellion.

471
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,060
Did I rebel?

472
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,380
Why do I feel like I'm home?

473
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,900
It's Jinyan and Eunuch Zhuoxin.

474
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,120
Eunuch Zhuoxin is the only survivor of the last Five Eunuchs.

475
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,060
He is not allowed to leave the mausoleum without an imperial order.

476
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,580
What are you doing here, Eunuch Zhuoxin?

477
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,960
You left the mausoleum without an imperial order.

478
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,340
You will be executed!

479
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm here to reestablish the Imperial Court!

480
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,050
I have the Dragon Seal Scroll in my hand.

481
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,230
It's written by the late Emperor himself.

482
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,180
Kneel at once.

483
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,700
Kneel!

484
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,860
With a scroll that no one knows is real or not, you want to bring us to our knees.

485
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,420
Zhuoxin, this is traitorous!

486
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,940
The name written in Dragon Seal Scroll is Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng.

487
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,140
Emperor Mingde, Xiao Ruojin, disobeyed it and usurped the throne.

488
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,520
He forced Prince Langya to tear up the scroll

489
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,500
and finally ascended the throne.

490
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,130
We, the Five Eunuchs, have endured humiliation over the years.

491
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,180
I finally got this scroll now.

492
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,950
So we are going to reestablish the Imperial Court,

493
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,990
put the right heir on the throne,

494
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,940
welcome the son of Prince Langya, Xiao Lingchen, back to Tianqi,

495
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,370
overthrow Emperor Mingde, and have a new emperor!

496
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,470
You darned eunuch! What nonsense are you spouting?

497
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,040
It has the stamp of the imperial seal on it.

498
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,450
It was written by the late Emperor.

499
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,530
It can't be fake.

500
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:32,680
Imperial Uncle Langya yelled out my father's name in front of the palace, in front of everyone.

501
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,040
How could he possibly be forced?

502
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:43,550
Besides, if he was forced, why did you Five Eunuchs sit by and do nothing?

503
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,210
Chong'er, calm down.

504
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,640
Let him talk.

505
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,150
We owe it to the late Emperor.

506
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,060
Today, we shall return the truth to the world.

507
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,880
I have in my hand a joint petition from the officials.

508
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,620
They are willing to support the right heir and the re-establishment of the Imperial Court.

509
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,500
On guard!

510
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,170
Eunuch.

511
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,850
Yes, Prince Langya.

512
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,280
Did you come personally today to see me take the throne?

513
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Yes.

514
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,590
The Dragon Seal Scroll is here.

515
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,010
Please announce the real heir

516
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:45,720
of the Xiao family and the ruler of Beili.

517
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,820
Everyone, would you like to see me open this scroll?

518
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,820
 Please open the scroll personally, Prince Langya!

519
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:14,090
Everyone, would you like to see me ascend the throne and become the Emperor of Beili?

520
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,960
 Please succeed the throne and reign over Beili immediately!

521
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,690
Soldiers, is your allegiance to the flag of the Langya Army

522
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,590
or the imperial flag of Beili?

523
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,140
Eunuch, do you still want me to open it myself?

524
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,010
Please, Your Highness.

525
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,175

526
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,160
Master!

527
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,692
♫   The sweeping winds forewarns of heavy rain   ♫

528
00:40:35,692 --> 00:40:42,900
The imperial family of mine has been at war for 40 years before we established the nation.

529
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,970
We have been in power for six generations, passing on the throne for 123 years.

530
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,710
Our nation is prosperous and worshipped by all other nations.

531
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:00,610
A eunuch like him has no right to decide who the right heir of the imperial family is!

532
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,180
Traitors should be executed!

533
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,437
♫   Who hears the sound of the flute?  ♫

534
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:08,640
The traitor has been executed.

535
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,710
Who else has a death wish?

536
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,553
♫   Why fear the sword hanging above?   ♫ 
 ♫   My heart yearns for what it can be   ♫

537
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:19,563
♫   Loyalty is promised over a pot of wine   ♫ 
 ♫  No matter how the world changes  ♫

538
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,803
♫   Who says the youth are wild?  ♫ 
 ♫   Who knew a sky existed beyond the sky?  ♫

539
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:26,840
How did I do, Xiao Se? Oh no, I mean, Xiao Chuhe.

540
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,010
Did I look dominant when I tore the scroll?

541
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,440
It took me quite some time to come up with the idea.

542
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:39,640
I sent Ji Xue to you. Why didn't you just tell her?

543
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,390
You had to come up with so much nonsense.

544
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,990
That made me sound heroic.

545
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:50,390
I, Xiao Lingchen, carry the bloodline of Prince Langya, so how can I withdraw?

546
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:56,290
You, Xiao Chuhe, inherited the mantle of Prince Langya, so how can you not fight?

547
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:03,080
So in the face of those who want to disrupt the Imperial Court, we must fight and not withdraw.

548
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:25,930

549
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:32,375
