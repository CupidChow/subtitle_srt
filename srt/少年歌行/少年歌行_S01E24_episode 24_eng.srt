22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Xiao Se, I have a question for you.

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,450
Ask away.

26
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,820
When we met at Snowfall Mountain Villa,

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,940
was it just a coincidence?

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,280
It was indeed a coincidence, as if it had been arranged in advance.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,440
Lei Wujie...

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,820
Keep this question for another time.

31
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,800
I'll tell you some other time.

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,250
Second Brother, did you notice it?

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,140
The State Preceptor has lost a lot of weight

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,660
and he looks pale.

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,100
I forgot that you can't see things.

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,820
The State Preceptor will certainly work hard in the preparation for the annual ceremony.

37
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,900
Nephews, what were you talking about?

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,620
We were saying that the State Preceptor didn't get enough rest recently.

39
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,900
Thanks for your concern, Your Highnesses.

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,900
You've worked hard for the annual ceremony.

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,340
It's my duty.

42
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,320
Seventh Prince, this is a nice outfit.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,620
If you like it, I'll take it off right now.

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,250
This outfit of yours is too fancy.

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,410
It doesn't fit me.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,690
Where is Ye Xiaoying?

47
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,470
Why isn't he here yet?

48
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,830
Imperial Uncle.

49
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,860
The Commander-in-Chief is allowed not to attend the annual ceremony.

50
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,760
I heard that Ye Xiaoying has prepared to come here.

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,770
I got it.

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,840
It seems like there won't be any Dragon Seal Scroll again this year.

53
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,740
State Preceptor. Look, I've misspoken again.

54
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,470
I didn't hear anything.

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,300

56
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,670
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

57
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,830
- Your Majesty! 
 - Imperial Father!

58
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,920
- Imperial Father! 
 - Your Majesty!

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,350
Your Majesty!

60
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,372
Based on the diagnosis of the Imperial Medical Academy,

61
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,680
His Majesty fainted due to a sudden heart attack.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,970
His life is not in danger for now,

63
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,440
but they couldn't find a cure.

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
In these three days, His Majesty has been in a trance.

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,140
State Preceptor Qi came three times.

66
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,630
His Majesty has only been awake three times,

67
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,670
and he has issued three edicts.

68
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,500
The first edict mandates Marquis Lanyue and Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu to govern the nation...

69
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,050
And to manage everything in Beili.

70
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,190
The second edict states that second-rank officials and below are not allowed

71
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,100
to enter or leave Tianqi City during the one-month lockdown.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,760
The second-rank officers and above are not allowed to leave their residences.

73
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,680
As for the third edict, it's a secret decree.

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,450
It was delivered to General Ye Xiaoying's residence by Eunuch Jin Yan, Bearer of Seals.

75
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,740
- Ye Xiaoying? 
 - Ye Xiaoying?

76
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,630
It seems like imperial father is severely ill.

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,740
What do you mean by this?

78
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,220
Once the officials hear about the three imperial edicts,

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,810
there will be three meanings contained in them.

80
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,890
It's to entrust national affairs, prevent disorder, and keep the people calm.

81
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,070
Imperial father has a clear intention.

82
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,270
But with such a clear intention, it can keep the people pinned down for now.

83
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,840
Yet, on the other hand, it has exposed the fact that he's severely ill.

84
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,020
General.

85
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,640
How is it?

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,000
There must be a lot of people visiting my residence in the past few days, right?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,850
Whoever it is, we won't allow them to enter this place.

88
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,420
Since it's a secret decree, it should've been issued in secret.

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,400
Now that the princes are aware of it.

90
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,110
Our emperor suffers from heart disease because he's very scheming.

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,340
General, what do you think is His Majesty's intention?

92
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,110
His intention?

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,640
I've led the main army force with the commander's tally for years.

94
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,170
There are many soldiers under me.

95
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,630
Now that His Majesty gave me this secret decree,

96
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,000
it's to tell those officials that he has given me some sort of edict.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,260
With this edict,

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,980
if there's someone trying to hatch a plot,

99
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,200
I can take action in accordance with it.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,280
General, you're right.

101
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,050
But why isn't there a single word on the secret decree?

102
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,970
Because I'm the Slayer.

103
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,660
Will our emperor have faith in me and give me an imperial edict?

104
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,210
Now I'm being set up by him.

105
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,820
Is there any news from Ruoyi?

106
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,770
Yes, they've succeeded.

107
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,630
That person has arrived in Xueyue City.

108
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,680
Young Lady is on her way back to Tianqi City.

109
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,740
Good.

110
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,360
It's about time.

111
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,050
How is it?

112
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,640
Marquis, I've used medication to stabilize His Majesty's condition.

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,980
As for the cure, it still takes...

114
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,670
I've had enough of this.

115
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,480
Tell me. How much longer until His Majesty wakes up?

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,340
It may take three months,

117
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,080
or even six months.

118
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,940
This is absurd.

119
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Do you want His Majesty dead?

120
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,140
I dare not.

121
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,810
Marquis, should we send someone to the Directorate of Astronomy

122
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,680
and ask the State Preceptor over to check on him?

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,050
Grand Preceptor, the State Preceptor is not a physician.

124
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,220
Besides, his body...

125
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,260
Grand Preceptor, I need to leave Tianqi for several days.

126
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,160
I'll leave the national affairs to you.

127
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,050
Noted.

128
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,170
Lately, Bai Xiao Sect has been very active in the Martial Arts World.

129
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,010
What happened? Did Ji Ruofeng return to manage Bai Xiao Sect again?

130
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,650
Our head did say that he'll lead us, Bai Xiao Sect, back to our former glory.

131
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,140
But it wasn't Head Ji who said it.

132
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,550
So it's your new head.

133
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,120
Who is it, then?

134
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,470
Our head said it won't be long until we meet City Lord Sikong.

135
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,980
You'll know when you meet him.

136
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,520
It's interesting.

137
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,390
This means Bai Xiao Sect has something important to tell us.

138
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,240
There's something Bai Xiao Sect would like to ask Xueyue City.

139
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,750
Go ahead.

140
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,570
Our head asked why Baili Dongjun and Mo Yi didn't come back.

141
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,290
It seems like there are many things Bai Xiao Sect knows and wants to know.

142
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,430
Mr. Mo Yi has entered his dreamland for self-reflection.

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,790
He won't wake up for the next ten years.

144
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,040
Martial Uncle Baili is there to protect him.

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,710
He won't leave Penglai Island until Mo Yi wakes up.

146
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,590
I see.

147
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,360
You're an interesting person.

148
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,910
You told us it was urgent.

149
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,780
Yet, you kept asking us questions.

150
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,640
After wasting a lot of our time, you still haven't told us about it.

151
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,980
Calm down, Young Lady,

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,220
because I didn't come here alone today.

153
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,140
Another friend of mine has found the person who really needs the information.

154
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,090
Xiao Se?

155
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,460
Why do you look for Xiao Se?

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,070
What is the information?

157
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,760
A big event has happened in Tianqi City lately.

158
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,540
His Majesty fainted at the annual ceremony.

159
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,040
With the help of Qi Tianchen, the Head of Astronomy, he managed to regain consciousness.

160
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,690
 Nonsense!

161
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,010
 Imperial Father, please accede to my request.

162
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,060
 You're a prince, the most outstanding prince I've got.

163
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,740
 The officials and people are saying that you'll inherit the kingdom in the future.

164
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,640
 But I can't believe you tell me that you want to travel in the Martial Arts World.

165
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,720
 What else could it be if it isn't nonsense?

166
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,210
 But Imperial Uncle Langya did the same thing as well.

167
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,260
 I...

168
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,790
 Prince Langya again?

169
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,450
 Who is your father? Me or him?

170
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,440
 Of course, you are.

171
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,560
 But I was tutored by Imperial Uncle Langya.

172
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,200
 You say I'm talking nonsense.

173
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,620
 So just punish Imperial Uncle Langya for that.

174
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,560
 This is absurd!

175
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,100
 Didn't you say that you wanted to travel the world?

176
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,410
 Very well.

177
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,330
 I'll dethrone you and take away your identity.

178
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,710
 Just go to the mountain, to the uncultivated land,

179
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,240
 and don't ever come back again!

180
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,300
Xiao Se.

181
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,090
Did you already know it?

182
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,340
So, are you going back?

183
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,360
Can I come with you

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,200
to the Tianqi you mentioned?

185
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,160
I suppose Tianqi City will send people here at a time like this.

186
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,180
Third City Lord is the world-renowned heir of the Medicine King.

187
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,770
If the Imperial Medical Academy couldn't solve this problem,

188
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,570
perhaps the Third City Lord knows a method.

189
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,690
That's not the answer I want.

190
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm asking you if I can go to Tianqi with you.

191
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,270
Xiao Chuhe, Xiao Chuhe, the lady has already put it this way.

192
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,600
Yet, you remain silent.

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
You're such a killjoy.

194
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,180
Who are you?

195
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,350
Me? I'm Prince Langya.

196
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,480
This is absurd.

197
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,500
I really am Prince Langya.

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,850
Imperial Uncle Langya was granted to pass on his title through generations.

199
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,180
His descendants can inherit his title.

200
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,950
This is Imperial Uncle Langya's only son, Xiao Lingchen.

201
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,260
He indeed can claim himself as Prince Langya.

202
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,600
Long time no see, Lingchen.

203
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,240
Qianluo, I've got something...

204
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,140
I understand.

205
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,940
Is she the daughter of City Lord Sikong?

206
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,270
I think she's out of your league.

207
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,930
It's been four years. Did you show up just to tell me this?

208
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,300
Of course... not.

209
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,880
Where have you been all these years?

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,200
I've tried to look for you many times, but I couldn't find you.

211
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,340
That day when the rebellion happened in Tianqi City,

212
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,830
my father took me to the North Gate in a wagon.

213
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,390
We were stopped by White Tiger on the road.

214
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,080
My father stayed there alone without resisting.

215
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,130
So White Tiger let me leave the city.

216
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,780
Then, I met the Three Divine Warriors from Beili in my escape.

217
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,000
Thereafter, the former soldiers of the Langya Army and I concealed our identities

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,870
and lived among the citizens.

219
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,990
Why would Imperial Uncle Langya suddenly leave the city on that day?

220
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,280
I have no idea. It all happened very fast.

221
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,090
Before I met the Three Devine Warriors, I didn't know why I was being chased.

222
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,470
And I didn't know why my father would be stopped by White Tiger.

223
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,790
As the Ministry of Justice said,

224
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,410
Prince Langya plotted treason

225
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,750
and deliberately created chaos that day.

226
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,640
If my father did try to revolt, half of Beili would've been destroyed.

227
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:56,130
A small tumult in Tianqi City like this was portrayed as the treason of Prince Langya.

228
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,990
It was an insult to my father.

229
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,610
Indeed.

230
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,590
The Emperor didn't say anything.

231
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,470
So did Imperial Uncle Langya.

232
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,950
You mean, it was like they had reached a common ground.

233
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,980
It's just my guess.

234
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,660
Then, you should return to Tianqi and get to the bottom of it.

235
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,420
What about you?

236
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,760
You and I will eventually return to Tianqi.

237
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,160
But we'll do it at different times.

238
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,980
Your time has come, but mine hasn't yet.

239
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,210
I need... a fire.

240
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,150
I'll light the fire for you when I find out the truth.

241
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,260
Who do you want me to save? I don't provide outpatient service.

242
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,660
You may not know

243
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,290
that there are requests that you can't reject.

244
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,940
Just like mine.

245
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,410
Why is that?

246
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,990
"Why?"

247
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,880
Because I'm Golden Marquis Lanyue, the Director of Nation in Beili.

248
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,140
Now that Beili is under my control.

249
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,790
Let alone you...

250
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,080
- Save me, Old Man. 
 - He's right.

251
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,620
He holds the greatest power in Beili now.

252
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,970
Even I can't stop him.

253
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,050
But, Marquis, why bother making fun of a child?

254
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,210
Very well.

255
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,500
I allow you to ask me a question.

256
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Who do you want me to save? What symptoms does he have?

257
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,150
The person you've got to save is Xiao Ruojin.

258
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,830
He's the Emperor of Beili.

259
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,380
The Emperor?

260
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,580
Yes. He's suffering from heart disease.

261
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,830
A while ago, he suddenly fainted during the annual ceremony.

262
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,130
He's been in a coma since then.

263
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,470
All right. I'll go with you.

264
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,900
You're having guests over?

265
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,290
Yes.

266
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,810
Both of my grandchildren came back for a short stay.

267
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,080
No wonder there's a strong sword qi here.

268
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,310
Did Li Hanyi come back?

269
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,840
No.

270
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,100
This sword qi is different from Li Hanyi's.

271
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,240
Instead... It's more like Xinyue's.

272
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,650
Does it belong to the child in the red shirt?

273
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,330
Yes, it's his.

274
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,700
Good, very good.

275
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,860
Sword Heart with the moon on it kills someone in a dream.

276
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,560
Guardian Azure Dragon finally has her real heir.

277
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,870
Qianluo looked upset.

278
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,970
She said she asked you a question.

279
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,470
But you didn't give her an answer.

280
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,550
Because I don't know the answer, either.

281
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,250
Your imperial father is a good parent.

282
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,020
You think so too?

283
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,720
He's also a good emperor.

284
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,920
I thought you hated him.

285
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,100
Of course, I hate him.

286
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,070
No matter if it was about Ye Dingzhi

287
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,780
or the matter of Prince Langya,

288
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,250
I hate him for that.

289
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,860
I even despise him, and I want to kill him.

290
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,990
But as a father, he gave you everything back then.

291
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,900
Then, he tried his best to fix everything.

292
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,830
But as an emperor,

293
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,760
Beili has prospered, and the people have been at peace lately.

294
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,490
Prince Langya is the only person he has wronged.

295
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,040
To him, I'm just an unfilial son.

296
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,920
The wanderers will eventually return to their homes.

297
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,170
I met Xiao Lingchen today.

298
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,040
Did you arrange this?

299
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,450
In fact, I have no idea of the whereabouts of the old garrison of the Langya Army.

300
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,450
But Lingchen came to me several days ago.

301
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,990
He said he knew that you were here.

302
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,730
And he knew that you'd been hesitating.

303
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,210
He said he'd like to give you some encouragement.

304
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,790
He didn't say much.

305
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,560
He said his appearance would be the biggest encouragement to you.

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,570
He's awfully confident.

307
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,200
Your Highness, something big happened in the Tang Clan.

308
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,330
Say it.

309
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,140
Tang Lian returned to Tang Clan from Xueyue City.

310
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,220
The Tang Clan is going to punish him severely.

311
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,130
They want to take away his martial arts and evict him from Tang Clan.

312
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,710
But Tang Lianyue suddenly broke through them

313
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,160
and defeated Tang Huang, Tang Xuan, and Tang Qisha.

314
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,700
The three of them couldn't even fight back.

315
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,700
The sectors in Tang Clan that support Xueyue City and who have been suppressed also take the chance to resist them.

316
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:16,040
So, Tang Clan has got their long-anticipated new old master.

317
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,490
Tang Lianyue has become their new head.

318
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,380
Now that he's the ruler of the Tang Clan, he surely won't work with us.

319
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,130
Actually, this is not necessarily a bad thing.

320
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,220
Based on the way Tang Lianyue does things,

321
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,750
I suppose he'll keep Tang Clan away from this dispute.

322
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,320
One less friend is better than having another enemy.

323
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,030
Besides, the matter of Tang Lian has sent us another message.

324
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,570
What is it?

325
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,290
He's back and has recovered.

326
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,040
Your Highness, we all await your words.

327
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Good.

328
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,970
I command you to do it!

329
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,470
Noted!

330
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,440

331
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,000
Master, I've stayed at Tang Clan for over a month.

332
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,090
Yet, you haven't given me the answer I want.

333
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,350
Does the Tang Clan take Xueyue City's side now

334
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,770
or continues to support Prince Bai of Tianqi City?

335
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,630
Tang Clan won't get involved in partisan politics. It's our rule.

336
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,250
Old Master refused to obey it.

337
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,120
In order to overthrow Lei Fortress,

338
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,280
he secretly broke his covenant with Xueyue City and joined hands with Prince Bai.

339
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,910
He was bewitched by Dark River during the operation.

340
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,290
That was how things turned out like this.

341
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,150
Lei Fortress has feuded with us,

342
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,870
and it's impossible for us to realign with Xueyue City for now.

343
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,940
As for supporting Prince Bai...

344
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,280
Lian, do you think I'll make such a choice?

345
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,630
I've thought too much.

346
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,550
So, Master, your choice is to remain neutral.

347
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,730
The present Tang Clan is ineligible to make choices.

348
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,030
I understand.

349
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,050
What about you? Tang Clan is ineligible to make choices.

350
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,300
But you're eligible.

351
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,240
I've made a choice.

352
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,930
This is quite surprising.

353
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,290
I thought you came to ask me for some advice.

354
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,270
Tell me. What are you going to do?

355
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,030
I'll follow my heart. Act with my heart.

356
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,700
This is something that Baili Dongjun would say.

357
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,640
Not bad, you're making progress.

358
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,630
Maybe I've started to study the art of making liquor lately.

359
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,460
That's why my character has become more like Master Baili.

360
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,040
The art of making liquor?

361
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,430
Yes. I've been studying this book recently.

362
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,630
It's said that it's not an ordinary liquor-making book.

363
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,560
The Book of Liquor originally recorded a strange skill which was cultivated by liquor.

364
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,760
Baili Dongjun combined his peerless art of making liquor with this skill after getting it

365
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,070
and wrote the latter half of it.

366
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,930
You must've heard of the story about Baili Dongjun

367
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,860
climbing Diaolou Parlor with Seven Starry Nights.

368
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,010
I've heard of it many times.

369
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,730
But people don't know that Lord Langya, Xiao Ruofeng, was one of the liquor tasters.

370
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,250
After drinking Seven Starry Nights, he made a breakthrough.

371
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,170
Made a breakthrough?

372
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,920
He suddenly entered the Carefree Phase of Heaven from the Unrestrained Phase of Earth.

373
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,460
Before that, it had been years since Xiao Ruofeng's martial arts reached another phase.

374
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,430
The Book of Liquor is really mysterious.

375
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,780
Why didn't Master Baili let me drink the amazing Starry Nights?

376
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,120
I've asked him before.

377
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,580
He said the liquor alone can't increase the power.

378
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,690
It's also related to the person's state of mind.

379
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,830
I'm not sure about the specific details.

380
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,940
Anyway, the Book of Liquor is well worth studying.

381
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,690
Yes, Master.

382
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,690
- How is he doing, Divine Healer? 
 - It's indeed a heart disease.

383
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,090
- Can you cure him? 
 - Yes. But...

384
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,780
There's no but. Don't keep us guessing at a time like this.

385
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,700
You interrupted me first.

386
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,080
But it'll take time.

387
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,780
- How long? 
 - One month.

388
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,890
Fine. Well, in this month, the imperial physicians will be at your disposal.

389
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,810
- We're willing to help you, Divine Healer. 
 - We're willing to help you, Divine Healer.

390
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,320
You've flattered me, Seniors. I'm not a divine healer.

391
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,180
By the way, I've got a question for you.

392
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,430
Go ahead.

393
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,930
When will the meal be served? I'm hungry.

394
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,570
Li Changqing, you're the captain of the Tiger Soldiers, the leader of the Imperial Guards.

395
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,930
How could you allow an assassin to sneak into the palace?

396
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,710
What were you doing?

397
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,200
It was remiss of me.

398
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,760
Who was the assassin? When did he enter the palace?

399
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,200
It was the night when you left.

400
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,090
 I didn't notice it at first.

401
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,400
But he ran into the Head of the Five Great Eunuchs. The assassin was very agile.

402
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,530
After being attacked by the Head Eunuch, he was still able to leave the palace.

403
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,820
His Majesty has just collapsed.

404
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,170
It seems like someone in Tianqi City can't hold it any longer.

405
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,000
Something was suspicious.

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,230
The Head Eunuch found the assassin in an abandoned cold palace.

407
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,140
I guess the person wasn't trying to assassinate His Majesty.

408
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,560
Stop guessing.

409
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,510
Lead the Tiger Soldiers and guard Tai'an Hall well.

410
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,220
- If anything happens, I'll have you beheaded. 
 - Yes.

411
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,675

412
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,990
 Sir, why do you enter the palace at this late hour?

413
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,810
 How did you find me?

414
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,870
 Even if an ant enters the palace, I will know.

415
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,580
 It seems like this ant can't leave here today.

416
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
 This is where the Emperor stays.

417
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,340
 How can I allow an outsider to stay here?

418
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,230
Xiao Se. When will you get back?

419
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,480
I've helped you many times.

420
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,380
You should come and help the poor Wu Xin.

421
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,540
I've witnessed the Beauty of Four Seasons.

422
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,650
It's time to go back.

423
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,920
He has left.

424
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,870
Just as you predicted. Emperor Mingde is severely ill.

425
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,530
And with the one-year promise, he's finally made up his mind.

426
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,870
Besides, he left with his horse just like this, without saying a word.

427
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,460
He was taught by Xiao Ruofeng and Ji Ruofeng.

428
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,890
I know him.

429
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,030
It's just that since the day Xiao Se returned to Xueyue City,

430
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,070
there have been many people guarding there.

431
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:37,450
Now that he has left, this news will soon spread throughout the entire Beili.

432
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,260
Explicitly or implicitly, there are many people trying to kill him.

433
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,030
I wonder how he's supposed to go back alone.

434
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,370
I don't know.

435
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,580
But Xueyue City is known as the First City in the Martial Arts World.

436
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,030
We don't like fighting with others. But...

437
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,210
we'll never be a sitting duck.

438
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,030
Cheng Luoying's army is on the north side.

439
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,590
Over the years, he's been silently supporting Prince Chi.

440
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,270
No one knows about it.

441
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,980
But in order to stop Xiao Se from returning to Tianqi, he'll take risks and reveal this.

442
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,080
Luckily, I've been staying in Luo City instead of returning to Tianqi.

443
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,570
That's how I avoided the lockdown of the city.

444
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,060
Otherwise, I'd be bored to death.

445
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,650
But His Highness Prince Chi doesn't make it easy for me.

446
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,300
Is he sure he wants to take such a risk?

447
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,320
His Highness has written everything he wanted to say in the letter.

448
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,380
It's a serious crime to kill a prince.

449
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:56,860
Besides, he is His Majesty's favorite prince.

450
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,970
The patrols of the Sixteen Guardians of Nanjue will show up at the place where they're supposed to be.

451
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,970
Exterminating the enemy's patrols is the duty of the general.

452
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,990
When it's done, you'll be greatly rewarded by the Imperial Court.

453
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,870
Wushuang City is on the northeast side.

454
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,390
Prince Bai is not as brutal as Prince Chi,

455
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,140
but if Xiao Se returns to Tianqi, it'll affect his interests too.

456
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,200
He'll take action as well.

457
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,320
Are you frustrated that we didn't let you leave the city?

458
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,170
I'm the hole card here. How can I show up easily?

459
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,630
I understand this logic.

460
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,740
It's not that. We didn't let you go because we were afraid you might get the wrong person.

461
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,250
I remember his look. We've met before.

462
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,330
His Highness Prince Bai demanded that everything must be done without fail.

463
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,470
But I'm not very confident about it.

464
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,160
We heard that he travels alone.

465
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,270
But Xueyue City has well-established capabilities.

466
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,110
They might've kept a card up their sleeves.

467
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,460
You're scared even before departing. Just give up, then.

468
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,230
You brat! You're putting on the airs of a city lord.

469
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,980
Senior Brother, you're wrong.

470
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,290
I'm the City Lord to begin with.

471
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,920
All right, City Lord.

472
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,640
I'll get going.

473
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Dark River will rush over from the southwest.

474
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,170
They'll send the most elite killers over.

475
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,110
And the little dots on it,

476
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,950
they're the forces that Prince Bai and Prince Chi have spread in Beili over the years.

477
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,350
Half of these forces will participate in this assassination.

478
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,620
You have gathered the other half?

479
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,810
Since the day Xiao Se came to Xueyue City, I've started to plan for this.

480
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:08,670
It's time for them to know why Xueyue City claims to be the First City in the Martial Arts World.

481
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,880
Luoxia, issue Qiancheng Token, the Crimson Red Emergency Token.

482
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,460
Noted. It's also time to show the two princes of Tianqi City

483
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,120
why Xueyue City doesn't fear to reject them.

484
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,070
Father.

485
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,500
Go ahead.

486
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,800
I once said you'll stay by his side when he returns to Tianqi on his own.

487
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,300
But from this day forward, you have to say that title loud and clear.

488
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,700
Vermilion Bird, Sikong Qianluo.

489
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,800
The title of Vermilion Bird really fits you.

490
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,700
Go, my child.

491
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,200
I know it's very dangerous.

492
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,530
But I'm also aware

493
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,490
that I can't stop you.

494
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,350
Father.

495
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,500
Father, I'm leaving.

496
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Do you feel lonely too, as you haven't fought for years?

497
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,900
Changfeng, what do you need me to do this time?

498
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm afraid the youngsters might be in danger.

499
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You and all the elders stay in Xueyue City.

500
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,700
I'll be the only elder who goes there.

501
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,000
You...

502
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,900
Where are you going?

503
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,110
There will be a person on the west side.

504
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,700
He's the martial brother of the consort in the palace.

505
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,200
Luo Qingyang?

506
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
He hasn't left Muliang City for years.

507
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,120
Will he intervene in this matter?

508
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,400
I don't know. But I've got to try it.

509
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:47,100
I know there is hardly anyone in this world who can stop him.

510
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,580
I have no confidence either.

511
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,600
It's Qiancheng Token of Xueyue City.

512
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Yes.

513
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,400
I didn't expect this to come so soon.

514
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,710
Are you ready?

515
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,800
I'm ready. Right on time.

516
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
Go on.

517
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,090
Tang Clan and I will wait for your return.

518
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,850
Master, take care.

519
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,650
It's such a big firework.

520
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,000
Why is it coming so soon?

521
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,090
What do you mean?

522
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,360
Leave the tomb.

523
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,700
Sister, didn't you say I can only leave the tomb after becoming a sword deity?

524
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,900
Why are you asking me to leave now?

525
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,100
I don't want you to leave, either.

526
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,600
But if you don't leave now,

527
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,300
I'm afraid your best friend will die.

528
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,620
Xiao Se?

529
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,770
Actually, I lied to you.

530
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,100
Staying at Sword Heart Tomb won't help you become a sword deity.

531
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,800
If you want to reach a higher phase, you must go through life and death.

532
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,030
Go now.

533
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,860
 Two!

534
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,800
His Majesty has decreed that the second-rank officers and above can't leave their residences.

535
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,200
The General is trapped in Tianqi City as well.

536
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,960

537
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,700
Well, we can only hold our positions.

538
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,900
 Gather, Ye Battalion!

539
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,400
It's the young lady. Hurry and gather Ye Battalion.

540
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,920
Yes.

541
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,000
Now that Xiao Chuhe, Prince Yong'an, is in trouble,

542
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,100
we should help him since we serve the imperial family.

543
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,600
Here's the order from General Ye Xiaoying. Save Prince Yong'an from danger.

544
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Soldiers, will you join me in this?

545
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
 Yes, we will!

546
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,720
 We will, we will!

547
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,570
Marquis, you might need to make a run again.

548
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,220
State Preceptor, I'm His Majesty's anointed Director of Nation.

549
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,080
I should stay in Tianqi City and manage the national affairs.

550
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,790
Why must I run errands all the time?

551
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,720
Besides, I just brought the Divine Healer back.

552
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,830
Just let me take a break.

553
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,290
That person just left Xueyue City.

554
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,060
What?

555
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,700
He left alone.

556
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,840
The people from Xueyue City didn't accompany him.

557
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,600
Whether it's the Martial Arts World or the Imperial Court,

558
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,280
many people are taking action in secret.

559
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,660
Li Changqing!

560
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,980
Marquis.

561
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,410
Let me ask you this.

562
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,270
How many people are there in Tiger Soldiers?

563
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,560
There are 112 elite guardians and 1,300 soldiers.

564
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,460
Great.

565
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,870
I'll give you 3,000 imperial guards. You lend me 800 Tiger Soldiers.

566
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,270
I need to go out of the city.

567
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,590
800 Tiger Soldiers?

568
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,630
Your Highness, do you know what you're saying?

569
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,660
Of course, I know what I'm saying.

570
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,780
Don't worry.

571
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,200
His Majesty won't blame you for lending me 800 Tiger Soldiers when he wakes up.

572
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,840
He'll even give you a promotion.

573
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,390
But...

574
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,360
Rest assured, Captain Li.

575
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,640
Golden Marquis Lanyue keeps his word.

576
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,810
He won't lie to you.

577
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,500
Your Highness, go to the Tiger Camp and select the soldiers.

578
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,670
Your Highness, choose only 800 Tiger Soldiers as we agreed.

579
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,600
You must leave the other 500 soldiers to me.

580
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,170
Look how petty you are.

581
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,360
Don't worry. I won't take more than that.

582
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,900
State Preceptor, is Marquis Lanyue going out of the city again?

583
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:39,110
Head Eunuch, do you know why all the princes were granted titles and sent to the fiefs?

584
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,500
Yet, His Majesty only allowed his youngest brother to stay here?

585
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,200
He has been His Majesty's favorite brother since childhood, and everyone knows it.

586
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,090
Why does His Majesty like him so much?

587
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,320
What do you mean by this?

588
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:04,840
Because Marquis Lanyue certainly doesn't want to become emperor.

589
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:14,030
Twenty-three years ago, your ancestors escorted His Majesty to Tai'an Hall.

590
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,690
Many people died in that bloodbath,

591
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,410
but their glory remains in the world!

592
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,200
This kind of glory runs in your veins.

593
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,850
Let me ask you this.

594
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,770
Will you make a way for Prince Yong'an who returns to the city alone?

595
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,760
 We will!

596
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:52,040

597
