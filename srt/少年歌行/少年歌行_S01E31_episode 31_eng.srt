♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,020

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,970

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,920
How about this?

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,130
Instead of fighting, let's make a bet today.

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,680
I bet that Second Brother's eyes will be healed today

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,260
and that the Divine Healer will be fine too.

28
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,850
Sure. What do you want to bet on?

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,520
Let's bet on Tianqi City.

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,440
That's too much of a major bet.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
Xiao Chong's eyes aren't worthy of Tianqi City.

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,140
It's still too early to bet on it.

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,460
How about we bet on something smaller for starters?

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,390
If I win, your Snowfall Mountain Villa will be mine.

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,560
Since you were young, you loved to take things from me.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,040
It's just a villa. But you're still so obsessed with it.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,150
As I said back then, I would take it back one day.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,040
I would take back everything.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,590
Then what if I win?

40
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,970
Tell me then.

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,090
If I win, give me the information about my friend.

42
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,040
Sixth Brother, you're still as smart as ever.

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,860
Let me ask you again.

44
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,920
Are you going to take the bet or not?

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,090
All right. I'll play with you.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,980

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,150
Who are they? They don't feel any pain, and they can't get tired.

48
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,730
I can't fight anymore, and they're getting stronger and stronger!

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,820
You should be grateful that the head of the Su family has chosen to stop.

50
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,600
Otherwise, we would have already lost.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,570
 Su Changhe. What did he do to the disciples of Dark River?

52
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,160
Let's go!

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,600
This...

54
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,410
Are they ghosts? Are we fighting with ghosts tonight?

55
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,060
Master, save me.

56
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,620
Looking at the time, the Divine Healer is going to be done with her treatment soon.

57
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,210
 According to Night Crow, these imperfect, drugged assassins can only fight for around an hour.

58
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,810
Looks like something interesting is bound to happen tonight.

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,210
Go and end this interesting show at Prince Bai's Residence.

60
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,030
 Why does that person look so similar to Wu Xin?

61
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,120
We were almost killed by these nameless assassins.

62
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,620
That would've been embarrassing.

63
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,650
You're Wu...

64
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,000
You...

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,590
Master! Run!

66
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,520
Wu Xin! Look who's in front of you!

67
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,750
It's Xiao Se! Your friend!

68
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,540
It's pointless. He's like those five assassins just now, his consciousness is gone.

69
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,120
It's one against four! He's even more powerful than a sword deity!

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
Wu Xin!

71
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,520
Wu Xin?

72
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,180
Why are you here? What happened to you?

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,100
What... did you call me just now?

74
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,860
Wu Xin.

75
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,460
I should've listened to the Ghost Physician. It was still too early to put him to use.

76
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,130
Wu Xin.

77
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,330
Step back.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Xiao Yu. Is this your doing?

79
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,670
I don't have to answer your question.

80
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,290
Although I'm the one who won this bet,

81
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,100
you already know the answer to your question just now.

82
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,040
You should be grateful.

83
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,960
But your Snowfall Mountain Villa is mine now.

84
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,060
Oh, really?

85
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,210
How are you so sure that you've won?

86
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,180
Second Brother is totally unharmed.

87
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,490
Is that so?

88
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,130
What a pity. He was my best-hidden pawn.

89
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,610
At first, I wanted to use him at the last possible moment.

90
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,900
What?

91
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,260
Second Brother is a smart person.

92
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,350
But he has a weakness. He trusts others too easily.

93
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,230
The person he trusts the most is going to be his downfall.

94
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,820
Xiao Jingxia.

95
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,640
Don't move.

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,850
Xiao Jingxia has always been cruel and vicious since he was young.

97
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,340
None of the princes like him. Only the compassionate Second Brother is willing to talk to him.

98
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,400
All these years, everyone thinks that Xiao Jingxia has changed because of Second Brother.

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,420
But actually, I'm the one who hid this poisonous scorpion next to Second Brother!

100
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,810
Xiao Chuhe! You've lost!

101
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,980
Seventh Brother... save me.

102
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,880
Did I lose?

103
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Let's go.

104
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,210
Do we go after them?

105
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,370
We should look at the bigger picture. Let's check on Second Brother.

106
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,230
Divine Healer! Divine Healer!

107
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,540
How are you feeling?

108
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,610
What is that?

109
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,320
The hidden weapon of the Tang Clan.

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,770
 Golden thread robe?

111
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,190
Is this what Senior Brother gave you when he left Xueyue City?

112
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,770
This is called the Three-Cun Territory.

113
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,790
It's a rare, hidden defense weapon of the Tang Clan.

114
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,980
When you're attacked in your sleep, the mechanism of this weapon will be triggered,

115
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,130
and it can kill your enemy in the blink of an eye.

116
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,220
Back then, when he secretly contacted Dark River,

117
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,270
I sent a message to Chong'er to warn him to stay vigilant.

118
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,130
But he told me that his brother would never do that.

119
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,150
He treated his brother so kindly.

120
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,270
But he never thought that next to him was a poisonous scorpion!

121
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,370
So, he was the one who colluded with Dark River.

122
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,920
Now, he's been killed by Senior Brother's hidden weapon. He deserved it.

123
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,730
Mu Chunfeng should be fine. What about the Divine Healer?

124
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,810
I can't save her. She needs to be treated by a physician at once.

125
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,460
Take her back to Snowfall Mountain Villa first.

126
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,950
It would be better to send her to the Imperial Medical Academy, right?

127
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,350
No.

128
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,550
We can't let Tianqi know that the Divine Healer has been seriously wounded.

129
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,540
What about Wu Xin?

130
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,310
Let's go back to Snowfall Mountain Villa first.

131
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,130
Even if we can get him back now, we can't save him.

132
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,970
Why couldn't I kill Xiao Chong? Why?

133
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,240
I planned it for so long. It was supposed to be a perfect plan.

134
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,120
But Xiao Chuhe still managed to find a way to ruin my plan!

135
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,470
Calm down, Your Highness.

136
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,720
Prince Bai's Residence is the only residence right now that is protected by two sword deities.

137
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,890
If he can see now...

138
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,650
But those two sword deities aren't as powerful as the world's best swordsman.

139
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,640
How about we...

140
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,060
It's not the right time yet, but we can't wait anymore.

141
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,480
Send a message to that person in the palace. Tell him to come to me at once!

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,560
How could the Scholar Sword Deity bear to part with your martial arts world

143
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
to visit me at Qingyun Hall?

144
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,130
I'm tired of traveling around the martial arts world.

145
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,760
So, I'm here at Qingyun Hall to get some rest.

146
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,060
But a guest can't come empty-handed.

147
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,050
Of course not. I do have some information that I would like to share with you.

148
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,420
I've run into an extraordinarily talented young man in the Martial Arts World.

149
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,740
That young man was raised by Abbot Wang You of Hanshui Temple.

150
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,720
The last time I saw him, he told me he was coming to Tianqi City.

151
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,410
I'm thinking that if he really is here, the whole city will know his name.

152
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,050
Because with his personality, he'll cook up a storm no matter where he goes.

153
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,790
I noticed him the moment he entered the city.

154
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,030
And I used the Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill to spy on him.

155
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,660
But he saw through it right away.

156
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,830
Then, he disappeared without a trace.

157
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,620
Master.

158
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,020
Young Master Xiao Se has requested to see you.

159
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,180
He's here? What a coincidence.

160
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,050
Invite him in.

161
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,620
Your Highness.

162
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,350
You're here too, Sir Xie Xuan. This is great.

163
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,570
Do you need me to treat someone who's injured again?

164
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,330
It's the Divine Healer Hua Jin.

165
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,760
The Divine Healer?

166
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,730
She was seriously wounded by someone yesterday. And she's still unconscious.

167
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,490
What should we do then?

168
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,040
She's the only one right now who's stopping His Majesty's disease from getting out of hand.

169
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,620
Where is she right now?

170
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,850
She's in my residence, Snowfall Mountain Villa.

171
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,110
Are there any other things that you need from the State Preceptor?

172
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,110
There's one more thing.

173
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,210
All right.

174
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,300
Both of you talk then. I'll check on the Divine Healer first.

175
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,170
I'll take my leave now.

176
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,260
Please take a seat, Your Highness.

177
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,720
I know that the Directorate of Astronomy only conveys the divine message and doesn't take part in political affairs.

178
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,170
That's why I haven't paid you a visit.

179
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,250
But lately, I've encountered something that I have to trouble you with.

180
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,680
Go ahead.

181
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,130
I have a friend who's said to be a genius.

182
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,460
But lately, he has lost consciousness and has become even more powerful.

183
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,520
Even when we fought him together, we couldn't defeat him.

184
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,140
Are you talking about that young man, Wu Xin?

185
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,270
Exactly.

186
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,250
Where is he now?

187
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,000
He's with Prince Chi, Xiao Yu.

188
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,740
We all think that Prince Chi is controlling him.

189
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,820
Controlling him?

190
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
I've heard something like this from my master before.

191
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,780
I suspect that it is the Art of Drugs from Western Chu.

192
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,820
But a rare and evil technique like this is unknown even to the Bai Xiao Sect.

193
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
That's why I'm here at the Directorate of Astronomy to ask for any answers.

194
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,870
After Western Chu was destroyed,

195
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,820
I think only the Medicine Valley kept a secret record of how to make that drug.

196
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,200
Xin Baicao would never do this.

197
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,820
And Miss Bian passed away a long time ago.

198
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,830
Could it be that... Night Crow is still alive?

199
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,290
I knew it.

200
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,620
But even if she knows the Art of Drugs, it's not for certain

201
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,250
that she's the drugged subject's master.

202
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,630
- What do you mean by that? 
 - All drugged subjects have a master.

203
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,700
The person who makes the drug needs to use blood as a medium.

204
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,130
And that drop of blood needs to be the blood of the subject's family.

205
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,630
The most perfect way is to use the blood of the subject's biological parents.

206
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:56,180
Without this medium, the drugged subjects are highly vulnerable to backlash from it.

207
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,560
No wonder those people died.

208
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,260
But Wu Xin seemed different from them.

209
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,510
He didn't look dead.

210
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,420
But whose blood can be used as a medium to make that drug for him?

211
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,090
Consort Xuan.

212
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,320
Consort Xuan is Wu Xin's biological mother.

213
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,680
If they need to use the blood of a family member as the medium,

214
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,940
Consort Xuan is the only possible choice.

215
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,950
fIf you want to break this Art of Drugs,

216
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,320
you need to get that same drop of blood from his family member.

217
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,810
So... if we want to save Wu Xin, we just need to find Consort Xuan?

218
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,710
We need Consort Xuan's blood.

219
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,680
Do we just need one drop of blood?

220
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,340
After you get the blood, just give it to the Divine Healer

221
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,000
and it should be easily taken care of.

222
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,050
Thank you for answering my question.

223
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,520
Let's go.

224
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,360
Brother Fansong! Brother Feixuan! Why are you in Tianqi?

225
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,890
Lei...

226
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,720
Feixuan. He's the younger brother of our master's wife.

227
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,040
How should we address him?

228
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,620
According to seniority, you need to call him Uncle.

229
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,580
And I should call him Granduncle.

230
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,690
Uncle Lei.

231
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't call me uncle! It makes me sound old!

232
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,290
Forget it.

233
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,960
I'm quite happy to see familiar faces in Tianqi City.

234
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,480
By the way, why are you here at the Directorate of Astronomy?

235
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,430
I'm the one who asked them to come.

236
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,610
So, when can I see him?

237
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,990
Who?

238
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,920
Dark River's leader, Su Changhe.

239
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,710
He showed up yesterday.

240
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,050
- He's working under Prince Chi, Xiao Yu, now. 
 - What?

241
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,420
Besides, with your current swordsmanship, you aren't his match.

242
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,660
We need to plan this out.

243
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,350
Don't worry. My master has passed down his Scholarly Sword Technique to me.

244
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,590
And I've been practicing it all day long. I'm no longer the same person.

245
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,000
The Scholarly Sword Technique?

246
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,010
He's learning the Scholarly Sword Technique from Sir Xie Xuan now.

247
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,630
I see.

248
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,930
You've been taught by two sword deities!

249
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,920
You'll be a great swordsman in the future!

250
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,850
Why choose the future when I can be great now?

251
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,390
All right.

252
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,020
When the time comes, I'll inform you two.

253
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,330
- Farewell for now. 
 - All right.

254
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,120
Divine Healer Hua didn't come today?

255
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,150
Your Highness, Divine Healer Hua caught a cold yesterday.

256
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,520
She's worried she would infect you and worsen your illness.

257
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,870
So, she sent her disciple, Mu Chunfeng, to check on you.

258
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,020
Then, he'll report it to the Divine Healer to plan for the next step of treatment.

259
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,870
Is it serious?

260
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,790
Your Majesty. It was... quite serious yesterday.

261
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,770
But a physician came today to check on her.

262
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,930
According to him, she'll be fine.

263
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,660
She'll be able to enter the palace in a few more days.

264
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,760
That's good.

265
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,870
What about Chong'er's eyes?

266
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,300
His eyes have already been treated.

267
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,670
His Highness just needs to rest for a few more days, and he'll be able to see again.

268
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,090
Does Divine Healer Hua's illness... have anything to do with this?

269
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,190
Your Majesty. I didn't want you to worry about this.

270
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,210
That's why I hid this from you.

271
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,190
Who did it?

272
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,920
The Ninth Prince.

273
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,330
After he injured Divine Healer Hua Jin, he tried to kill the Second Prince too.

274
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,990
But in the end, he was killed by a trap in Prince Bai's Residence.

275
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
The Ninth Prince?

276
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,260
He had always been close to the Second Prince, no?

277
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,420
We don't know why he did that, either.

278
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,140
Your Majesty. My deepest condolences to you.

279
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,080
Ninth Prince...

280
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,550

281
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,060
Your Highness.

282
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
Zang Ming.

283
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,540
You should've told me that beforehand.

284
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,890
If I really had told you, you would have said no.

285
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,550
I've been with you for so many years.

286
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,890
Do you think I don't know you well?

287
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,290
But even if I can regain my eyesight, losing you,

288
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,330
means I lose another person that I can trust.

289
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,850
Now that you've regained your eyesight, it's like you've regained your wings.

290
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,460
You'll be able to fly high now.

291
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,610
It doesn't matter for you to lose a useless guard like me.

292
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,520
So... what happened that day?

293
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,820
That day, I was stuck at Jingtai Palace and couldn't leave because of a decree.

294
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,640
Obviously, it was Prince Chi's doing.

295
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,460
After that, the assassins of Dark River snuck into Prince Bai's Residence.

296
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,440
Luckily, Prince Yong'an managed to send his men here in time.

297
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,650
And thus were unsuccessful.

298
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,660
It was the Ninth Prince who betrayed you.

299
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,090
And he even attacked Divine Healer Hua Jin.

300
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,680
Luckily, your eyes have recovered now.

301
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,140
And those who wanted to kill you were defeated by Prince Yong'an and his men.

302
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,830
Ninth Brother?

303
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,780
Why was it him?

304
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,720
Second Master. Where is Ninth Brother?

305
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,090
He was killed by the trap set by Prince Yong'an and his men.

306
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,980
Ninth Brother...

307
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,110
Ninth Brother is dead.

308
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,580
Before coming here, I saw Prince Yong'an.

309
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,350
He told me about what happened that night.

310
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,190
I'm curious.

311
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,380
Why did Prince Yong'an help you?

312
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,840

313
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,280
He treats me as his brother.

314
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,580
Although we both fight for the crown prince position, he doesn't see me as his enemy.

315
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,860
The crown prince is just a position.

316
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,320
But brothers are brothers.

317
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,380
When it comes to this, none of the other princes are as good as him.

318
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,190
His body has been sent to the Court of Justice.

319
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,420
His Majesty has appointed Marquis Lanyue to investigate the matter.

320
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,960
Second Master.

321
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,190
Tell Marquis Lanyue that Xiao Jingxia died

322
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,380
because he accidentally

323
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,190
activated the trap.

324
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,760
Your Highness.

325
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,570
There's no need to say more.

326
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,050
Thank you for treating Hua Jin, Senior Xuan.

327
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,880
You're welcome.

328
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,940
Before she got hurt, she inserted a line of silver needles into her body.

329
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,080
That is a secret skill of Medicine Valley. The Seven Soul-Preserving Needles.

330
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,820
Senior Xie Xuan.

331
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,640
How is Divine Healer Hua?

332
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,360
She's fine now.

333
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,270
You've saved us multiple times from danger.

334
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,290
I'm very grateful to you.

335
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,960
I didn't do anything much.

336
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,660
You are too kind.

337
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,520
If it weren't for the Nameless Book you gave us, all of us would have been killed by the Dark River.

338
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,370
Normal people wouldn't be able to understand the essence of a book.

339
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,090
But you can because you have that capability.

340
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,120
How is it going with the book that I gave you last time?

341
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:40,310
Senior, the Late Snow that you gave me can be bought for three wen on the street.

342
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,120
They aren't the same.

343
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,880
The one that I gave you is the uncut version.

344
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,800
- There's only one copy of it. 
 - What?

345
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,640
I added a lot of extra scenes to it. It's really interesting.

346
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,390
Senior, if there's only one copy of it, why do you have it?

347
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,140
Well...

348
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,760
Who's the author of Late Snow?

349
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,100
The talented woman of Jiangnan, Xie Feixuan!

350
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,680
What's my name?

351
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,430
Your name is Xie...

352
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,760
Xie Xuan?

353
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,860
Then... Then, the legendary woman of Jiangnan with both beauty and talent... is you?

354
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,620
It's me.

355
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,190
It's a little gross.

356
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,370
You want to pay a visit to Consort Xuan in the harem?

357
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,040
Do you know what kind of person she is?

358
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,540
I only know that she's imperial father's most beloved woman.

359
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,890
Your father has loved only two women in his entire life.

360
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,600
One of them is your mother.

361
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,690
But unfortunately, she passed away shortly after giving birth to you.

362
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,910
The other is Consort Xuan.

363
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,760
But Consort Xuan is not just a beautiful woman.

364
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,290
Besides your father, there are two more powerful men who would be willing to die for her.

365
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,960
One of them is the previous head of Tian Wai Tian, Ye Dingzhi.

366
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,740
And the other man is Luo Qingyang, who's first place on the Top-Rank List.

367
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,120
Consort Xuan has lived in the palace alone for so many years.

368
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,560
She finally gets to see Wu Xin.

369
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,760
And you're going to tell her that he has turned into a drugged subject?

370
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,860
But I need her blood.

371
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,290
Wu Xin is her child and my friend.

372
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,090
I knew it!

373
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,080
Once you've made up your mind, no one can change it!

374
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,090
Imperial Uncle, you know me well.

375
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,420
I've looked into it.

376
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,360
It was a drug from Prince Chi.

377
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,950
He has agreed to it.

378
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,180
But was it really the Art of Drugs?

379
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,650
Hadn't it gone extinct for many years?

380
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,080
The Art of Drugs. Back then, we all saw the effects of it.

381
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,410
The situation I saw at Prince Bai's Residence was the same as back then.

382
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,060
And I'm sure you know how a drugged subject will end up.

383
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:07,210
He once said that he would lead us into the light so that we would never be seen as assassins.

384
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,950
But why has he turned into this now?

385
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,880
His desire is too strong.

386
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,130
Sometimes, our desire can push us to improve ourselves.

387
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,730
But sometimes,

388
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,090
it can lead us to our demise.

389
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,350
Back then, you said that you wouldn't let Dark River get involved in this.

390
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,440
But now, there's no turning back for us.

391
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,860
I can only help you get in. I can't get you out.

392
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,310
But I'll prepare a carriage for you at the east corner of the wall.

393
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,000
Remember, you need to return in two hours. Otherwise, your ride will be gone.

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,620
Understood.

395
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,410
These are the outfits that I've prepared for you. Change into them later.

396
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,420
Why do we have to get changed?

397
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,860
Xiao Se is a prince, right?

398
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,890
I can just follow him in.

399
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,270
You don't have to get changed during the day. But it's night now.

400
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,090
After the curfew, no one is allowed to enter.

401
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,830
Moreover, you're going into the harem.

402
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,840
And he's a prince. He needs to be even more careful.

403
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,420
All right then.

404
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,980
Why are these women's clothes?

405
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,380
I told you just now, right?

406
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,970
You're going into the harem.

407
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,210
You need to dress up as the palace maids in order not to draw any attention to yourselves.

408
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,630
But won't it be even more obvious for two men to dress up as palace maids?

409
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,080
Xiao Se.

410
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,060
Why do you look like you're looking forward to it instead of dreading it?

411
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,620
Why are you so noisy?

412
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,890
Talking so much means that you're excited.

413
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,600
Does wearing women's clothes make you that excited?

414
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,180
If I had known, I would've asked Senior Sister Qianluo come.

415
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,940
Xiao Se. You really look good in this!

416
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,390
Shut up, you moron.

417
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,210
You're not allowed to tell anyone about this!

418
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,110
This is bad, Xiao Se.

419
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,210
- What's wrong? 
 - Look at her. She's not that much older than we are.

420
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,260
How can she be Prince Chi's mother?

421
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,270
I'm not wrong, she just looks young.

422
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,250
But she's almost 40 already.

423
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,410
I didn't ask for you two.

424
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,570
Why did you come in?

425
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,990
Let's go in.

426
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,930
Are you the new palace maids from Jingtai Palace?

427
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,530
Why haven't I seen you two before?

428
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,060
Both of you are quite pretty, but you're quite big.

429
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,290
Like men.

430
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,040
What a pity.

431
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,530
Consort Xuan.

432
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,890
Are you going to drop the act now?

433
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,960
Xiao Se. She saw through us so quickly...

434
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,620
The consort is Luo Qingyang's martial sister.

435
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,090
And she's also the daughter of the head of the Shadow Sect.

436
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,510
The Shadow Sect is the master of disguise.

437
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,170
Even if we can fool others, we can't fool her.

438
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,590
You look like your father and your mother.

439
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,630
Prince Yong'an.

440
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,430
Consort, sorry for this.

441
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,090
Greetings, Consort Xuan.

442
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,380
Prince Yong'an. You snuck into the harem at night

443
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,080
and brought an out of the ordinary friend with you.

444
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,930
Are you here... to kill someone?

445
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,660
- No. 
 - N-No...

446
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,590
We just want a drop of blood from you.

447
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,720
A drop of blood?

448
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,750
Why?

449
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,200
I have a friend who was poisoned lately.

450
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,100
And he was poisoned because of a drop of your blood.

451
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,900
For the same reason, if I want to cure him, I'll require a drop of blood from you too.

452
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,030
Before, Yu'er came to get a drop of blood from me too.

453
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,730
Is that related to this matter?

454
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:32,420
I wonder why my blood can be made into poison and an antidote.

455
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,740
That drop of blood that Seventh Brother got from you is the poison that I'm talking about.

456
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,040
As for why your blood can be made into poison and an antidote,

457
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,620
it's because that person who was poisoned has the same blood as you.

458
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,290
What is the name of your friend?

459
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,880
He's the son of the previous head of Tian Wai Tian, Ye Anshi.

460
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,980
He came?

461
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,180
You didn't know?

462
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,770
I haven't left this place for a long time now.

463
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,050
No one tells me about what goes on outside the palace.

464
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,140
And I don't want to know.

465
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,890
To this world, I'm already dead.

466
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:28,300
Your Highness. I have no right to know about what happened between you, Ye Dingzhi, and my imperial father.

467
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,200
But in this world, someone remembers you and misses you.

468
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:39,590
A person will only truly be dead when no one in this world remembers that person.

469
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,260
But this friend of mine thinks of you all the time and even visited you.

470
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,360
 His eyebrows are as nice as yours.

471
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,050
 What is the name of your child?

472
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,900
 His name is Ye Anshi.

473
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,730
 That's a nice name.

474
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,850
That was him?

475
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,630
Well... Your Highness.

476
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:19,050
Your Highness, we don't have much time...

477
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,740
Please, Your Highness.

478
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

479
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,660
Hold on.

480
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,810
If you see him again,

481
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,700
ask him not to visit me anymore.

482
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,840
I understand.

483
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,840
Yu'er?

484
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,070
Mother.

485
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,960
That day, you said that you wanted to pray for me at the Directorate of Astronomy.

486
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,990
And you wanted to use my blood for the talisman.

487
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,820
I knew that you weren't telling the truth,

488
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,430
but I gave you my blood anyway.

489
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,560
However, I never thought

490
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,520
that you would use it to harm your own brother!

491
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,020
You already know.

492
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,810
But I don't have a brother.

493
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,520
He's just another child of yours.

494
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,560
We don't have the same blood running inside us.

495
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,510
Why do you have to harm him, then?

496
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,320
If I don't do that,

497
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,630
then he'll help those two who came just now to harm me.

498
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,490
Do you want to kill your child to save another child of yours?

499
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,420
Move aside!

500
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,250
Please don't step out of this room!

501
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,310
I just want to live.

502
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,230
And I promise you that your other child will live too.

503
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,470
But it has to wait until everything has ended.

504
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,120
Look. We've changed back into our outfits.

505
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,860
And the rain has stopped!

506
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,850
Let's hurry up and leave now.

507
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,350
There'll be more people moving about in the palace soon.

508
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,660
Why did we get changed then?

509
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,020
We'll stand out even more now.

510
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,260
Since we've gotten what we want,

511
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,830
if we were to be found, it's better if it's not in those outfits.

512
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:48,020
If someone sees us, you can stop them while I run away.

513
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,540
Wait, no.

514
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,040
You're a prince.

515
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,850
You should be the one to stop them while I run away.

516
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,370
It shouldn't be the other way around.

517
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,260
I'm a prince.

518
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,400
If someone finds me in the harem, it'll ruin my reputation.

519
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,940
But you're not afraid of that, right? What about me?

520
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,740
What will happen to me if they find me here?

521
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,250
You're a commoner.

522
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,460
You'll be killed for sneaking into the harem.

523
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,460
You don't even have to go through a trial. You'll just be killed.

524
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,560
You really are a good friend.

525
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,810
Xiao Se. Someone really has found us.

526
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,610
Who are you?

527
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,130
I'm here to kill you.

528
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,140
It's you.

529
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,940
Why are you in the palace?

530
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,070
Xiao Se!

531
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,150
Xiao Se!

532
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,290
This kind of technique. This kind of power.

533
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,100
I'm not wrong.

534
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,750
Eunuch Jin Yu?

535
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,410
Consider it returning a favor on behalf of Chong'er.

536
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,910
Hurry and go.

537
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,610
Let's go!

538
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,390
Who are you?

539
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,970
The Art of Detachment?

540
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,740
But my master is dead.

541
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,240
I did the autopsy on his body.

542
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,530
Who are you?

543
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,700
Why do you have to insist on knowing?

544
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,660
When we fought for the first time,

545
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,670
I already knew that I was no match for you.

546
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,470
But you knocked off my mask.

547
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,420
Now, I can't spare your life even if I want to.

548
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,330
Is he really worth your sacrifice?

549
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,740
He will be a good emperor.

550
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,250
You studied too much.

551
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,630
There's no such thing as a good emperor.

552
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,500
There will always be good men in this world.

553
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,940
Only villains don't believe that.

554
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,590
Then let this villain take the life of this gentleman.

555
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,720
Chong'er... I won't live

556
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:45,900
to see the day when you become the emperor...

557
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,210
Xiao Se.

558
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,650
Who was that person just now?

559
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,120
He's the one who destroyed my martial arts skills back then.

560
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,910
It's someone from the palace?

561
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,840
I will never forget that creepy internal energy of his.

562
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,830
Who is he exactly?

563
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,410
For him to be there with such powerful internal energy that has yin characteristics,

564
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,610
he has to be one of the Five Eunuchs.

565
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,220

566
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,520
There's no wound on his body.

567
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,640
And his face is in a resting state.

568
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,560
He wasn't killed by anyone.

569
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,430
It's a natural death.

570
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,560
This is the conclusion from the Imperial Medical Academy?

571
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,450
No one understands Jin Yu's martial arts skills better than us.

572
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,120
I'm afraid the murderer's internal energy is more powerful than the three of us.

573
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,330
Who was it that shattered his meridians?

574
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:58,750
Or maybe that person practices the art of gentle internal energy.

575
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,690
The Art of Detachment.

576
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,850
But our master is dead.

577
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,660
Those who can perform the Art of Detachment no longer exists.

578
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,740
Really?

579
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,610
I don't think so.

580
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,830
All these years, none of us have given up on learning this technique.

581
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,680
Our master left behind an incomplete book back then.

582
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,830
Except for Jin Yu, none of us have stopped practicing it.

583
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,790
But as for how much we've learned and to what extent,

584
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,820
we're probably the only ones who know.

585
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,730
Are you saying

586
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,790
that one of us killed Jin Yu?

587
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,900
You can't say that.

588
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,470
I'm not Director Zhuoqing's disciple.

589
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,400
I don't know anything about the Art of Detachment!

590
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,970
If you don't believe me, you can test me.

591
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,680
But your master isn't dead.

592
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,910
He's Zhuoqing's martial brother.

593
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,940

594
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,000
