00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:16,040

2
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,792
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,280
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,400
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,480
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,580
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,720
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,000
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,080
♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
♫  With one smile there's understanding  ♫

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,584
♫  Singing about our journey  ♫

14
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:17,400
♫  Pursuing the dream of our youth  ♫

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,560
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,400
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,720
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,800
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
♫  We must do what we can in the world  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,180
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,050

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,514

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,520
Xiao Se! I've already heard it!

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,120
So, the person you wanted the Baixiao Sect to find is Wu Xin.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,484
Why did you make it so mysterious?

27
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,050
How did it go? Where is he?

28
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,310
Wu Xin!

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,250
Sect Master Ye!

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,860
Lower your voice.

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,520
Wu Xin has a special identity now.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,690
Don't yell like that.

33
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,546
Oh, right.

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,640
Xiao Se, where is Wu Xin?

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,500
I haven't heard from him.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,520
I thought you said you found him?

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,960
He said he would come see me after he entered the palace,

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,004
but he hasn't come yet.

39
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,020
Eunuch Jade Deity sent us a message.

40
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,640
He said Wu Xin went missing after entering Jingtai Palace.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,931
He didn't show up at the meet-up place and leave the palace as originally planned.

42
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,612
Was he discovered?

43
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:51,180
But Eunuch Jade Deity said that the palace was very quiet yesterday.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,310
There wasn't any assassin found.

45
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,920
That should mean that Wu Xin hasn't been caught.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,360
It's very likely that he's still in Jingtai Palace.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,508
Just as I expected.

48
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,476
He still wants to take Consort Xuan out of the palace.

49
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:06,050
He's looking for the perfect opportunity.

50
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,934
But this is too dangerous.

51
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:13,140
Wu Xin hasn't been caught, so at least he's safe.

52
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,740
I've already asked for Eunuch Jade Deity's help.

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,272
If there is any news, he'll inform us immediately.

54
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,786
That's good.

55
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:22,680
By the way, Young Master Mu sent us a message.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,028
Hua Jin has agreed to Prince Bai's request.

57
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:29,620
After her consultation with His Majesty this afternoon, she'll go to Prince Bai's Residence.

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,720
Looks like I've come at the right time. You're all here.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,140
You're going to treat Prince Bai's eyes, but before you go,

60
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,960
there's some important information for you.

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,660
Here it is.

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,540
The Martial Arts World is quiet,

63
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,310
martial artists are ranked in the Golden Ranking?

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,582
So, this is the Golden Ranking?

65
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:51,250
When the ranking was renewed last time, I was at sea.

66
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,840
This time, I finally get to see it with my own eyes.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
But you have to be prepared.

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,150
Once you open the Golden Ranking, the news will be spread throughout the world.

69
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,360
Right now, you still have the right to choose to seal the list.

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,050
And the biggest favor I can do for you is to give you a choice.

71
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm never afraid to make a decision.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,124
So, you want to know what position you're at now.

73
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:17,002
Please unveil the list for us personally then.

74
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,310
As you wish. Then, please announce the ranking.

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,520
The first ranking of Golden Ranking is the Weapon Mastery Ranking.

76
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,710
The first ranking has never changed.

77
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,110
The top six sword deities.

78
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,860
Xueyue Sword Deity, Lei Hong.

79
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,320
Weapon, Thunder Blast.

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,976
Master Lei Hong has become a sword deity too?

81
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,470
Wushuang Sword Deity, Wushuang.

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,270
Weapon, Wushuang Sword Box.

83
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,770
Wow, this brat has become a sword deity too.

84
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,014
Amazing.

85
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,264
You really have a big heart.

86
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,350
They've gotten so far ahead of you.

87
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,010
Not only are you not worried, but you're actually happy about it.

88
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,320
It is a blessing to have respectable adversaries among swordsmen.

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
If he's one step ahead of me, I'll just hurry and catch up!

90
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,990
The Blade Deity Ranking is still occupied by Nanjue.

91
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,310
Liquor Deity Baili Dongjun has retired and withdrawn from the ranking.

92
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,010
Is it necessary to make that public?

93
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,800
Temporary seclusion means that he can return at any time.

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,270
It's kind of a threat.

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,290
If I didn't write it like that, people in the Martial Arts World would think he's dead.

96
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,100
This could be detrimental to the status of Xueyue City.

97
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:27,278
Xiao Se, the Jade Ranking is still here!

98
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,600
Eighth place, disciple of Xueyue City, Xie Yanshu.

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
Seventh place, Wen Liang of the Wen family.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,910
Sixth place, disciple of the Tang Clan, Tang Ze.

101
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,880
Fifth place... fifth place, disciple of Xueyue City, Sikong Qianluo!

102
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,060
Good for you, Senior Sister!

103
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,520
The fourth place, disciple of Mount Wangcheng, Li Fansong.

104
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,370
He has improved pretty fast too.

105
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,570
Third place, disciple of Xueyue City and Sword Heart Tomb, Lei Wujie of Lei Fortress.

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,270
I've got such a long title.

107
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,560
Isn't that great?

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,060
Am I awesome or what?

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,782
I'm in third place.

110
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,340
Do you regret putting him in the Jade Ranking?

111
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,880
Maybe Bai Xiao Sect should consider an Idiot Ranking?

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,248
He'll win first place.

113
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,620
He's got a young heart. He should be promoted.

114
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,844
I think that, too!

115
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,360
There's no second place.

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,590
First place, disciple of Xueyue City, Luo Mingxuan.

117
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,180
Has he mastered the Liubo Puzzle?

118
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,368
I think so.

119
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,670
There's a tie for first place.

120
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,986
Disciple of Xueyue City...

121
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,500
Xiao Se, it's you!

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Hey, I only made it to the Jade Ranking?

123
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
I fought with you before.

124
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,230
It's a shame that you're only good enough for the Jade Ranking.

125
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,860
How boring.

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,700
I've finally got back into the Martial Arts World and someone outperformed me.

127
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,350
I suppose the former first place on the Jade Ranking,

128
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,230
who has just become a sword deity, has made it to the Top-Rank List now.

129
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,710
Where did he come in?

130
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,856
Keep reading, and you'll find out.

131
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,990
Since City Lord Baili has withdrawn from the ranking,

132
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,160
Immortal Mo Yi, who has gone into seclusion, would have withdrawn too.

133
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
Since both of them have withdrawn from the Top-Rank List, who will take their places?

134
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,200
In fourth place on the Top-Rank List, Yan Zhantian, Tantai Po, Lei Hong, and Wushuang.

135
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,840
Master Lei Hong really is amazing.

136
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,052
He's on Top-Rank List and the Weapon Mastery Ranking too.

137
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:21,300
In third place, Xie Xuan, Lord Zhaiyue, and Lei Yunhe.

138
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,684
In second place, Tang Lianyue and Sikong Changfeng.

139
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,810
My father has made it into second place.

140
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,830
What's wrong? Are you not happy that Third City Lord made it into second place?

141
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,010
After we returned from the island, he often went into seclusion for training.

142
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,620
He said that the Second City Lord is seriously injured, and no one knew when First City Lord would return,

143
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,860
and he is only in third place.

144
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,451
He isn't strong enough to uphold the title of Xueyue City as the First City in the World

145
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,114
and needed to improve.

146
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:55,519
- It's just that... 
 - It's just that although he has won second place,

147
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,860
the person who was in it is now no longer in place now.

148
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,348
The first place on the Top-Rank List, Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

149
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,570
Immortal Mo Yi will go into seclusion for ten years.

150
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,570
He won't be seen in the Martial Arts World again.

151
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,680
Baili Dongjun is with him. He won't return either.

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Is there really no one else in the world who can defeat the Melancholy Sword Deity?

153
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,376
At least not for now.

154
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:28,959
On these five rankings, we still have the upper hand.

155
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,760
It's just that Lei Fortress' ancestral teaching won't allow the Leis to join Tianqi.

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,560
The Tang Clan's relationship with us now is very delicate.

157
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,490
It'll be hard for us to use these two powers well.

158
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,440
There is another important problem.

159
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Among the Six Sword Deities, Thunder Sword Deity is forbidden to join the Imperial Court by his ancestors,

160
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,264
and Scholar Sword Deity is a half-recluse.

161
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,370
Xueyue Sword Deity is severely injured.

162
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,566
Although she's on the list, it's an accident.

163
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:58,760
The remaining three people who can take part in the Battle of Tianqi aren't all our people.

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,840
That's right.

165
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,760
All the masters on the Top-Rank List together aren't stronger than the one who won first place.

166
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,814
Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

167
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:14,670
You have to start preparing now because this ranking will be shared with people everywhere in two days.

168
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,574
I understand.

169
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,490
As for the rest, I can only tell you about it.

170
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,750
We leave then.

171
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,490
I suggest you not to go to Prince Bai's Residence.

172
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:34,630
Why?

173
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,570
Currently, Prince Bai is the only one who has two sword deities helping him.

174
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,092
Once Prince Bai regains his sight, he might go against you.

175
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,688
All people seek advantages and avoid disadvantages,

176
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:51,220
but I, Xiao Se, am not a common man.

177
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,694
So, I have to help Second Brother,

178
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,250
whether it's good for me or not.

179
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:03,832
Because you've always felt guilty about what happened back then.

180
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,808
Second Brother has done many things these past few years

181
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:11,390
that I don't approve of, but he doesn't deserve to be blind.

182
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,480
I have to help him.

183
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,130
I suppose I already guessed your answer.

184
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,850
I came to tell you this just so that you can be prepared in advance.

185
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,410
All right.

186
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,620
Master.

187
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,690
We are going to treat someone's illness, not kill someone.

188
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,670
Why do we need a sword?

189
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,180
We are not going there to kill anyone, but we have to guard against others from killing us.

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,710
Tianqi City really is quite a headache.

191
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,350
I really hope all this will be over soon.

192
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,750
Then, I can go to Penglai Island to find deities.

193
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,386
If you're going to Penglai Island, you have to bring me along.

194
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,450
Only our Mu family Cedar Longship in Qingzhou can get there.

195
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,260
You should improve your medical skills first, or the deities likely won't even see you if you go.

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,920
This Divine Healer really is a problem.

197
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,876
She isn't supposed to be here, and it's time for her to disappear.

198
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,272
What do you think, Leader?

199
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,210
Sure.

200
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,690
When you said you would help me get rid of the Lei Clan, you also said, "Sure."

201
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:51,166
A few days ago, when I asked you to kill Grand Preceptor Dong, you said, "Sure," too.

202
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,820
But the Lei Clan is still here, and Grand Preceptor Dong is also still alive.

203
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,916
Leader, perhaps the assassins of Dark River need to become stronger?

204
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:11,040
Your Highness, are you saying that we from Dark River haven't done our best?

205
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,990
No.

206
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm saying that I have a way to make Dark River's assassins stronger.

207
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,745

208
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:25,766
Master, you're finally back.

209
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,898
So, did you find out who the Dark River assassins are working for?

210
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm guessing that it was just a show staged by Xiao Chuhe.

211
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,252
It wouldn't be Chuhe. It has to be Seventh Brother.

212
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:47,080
Is Prince Chi really that capable?

213
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,236
Jingxia, I've said many times already,

214
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,256
don't underestimate Seventh Brother.

215
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:57,498
So, are things terrible now?

216
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:01,384
Originally, most of the ministers in the court supported me,

217
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:07,320
but after Chuhe came back, the Director of Nation and the State Preceptor made their attitudes clear.

218
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,040
They're closed and turning away visitors.

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,320
They won't switch sides immediately, but they're taking stock of the situation.

220
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,990
As for the Martial Arts World, Tang Clan and Dark River no longer support me.

221
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,230
The only force left is Wushuang City.

222
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,990
Your Highness, the Divine Healer is here.

223
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,016
- Let her in. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

224
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,566
Mountains Mover.

225
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,940
Sword of Dominion.

226
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,110
What's wrong?

227
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,710
Master, this man is the Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian.

228
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,470
We're just here to provide medical consultation.

229
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,586
Is it necessary to bring a sword deity here to protect him?

230
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,240
You...

231
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,490
My master just happened to return today.

232
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,610
Please don't take it personally.

233
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,030
It's fine. It's just that I don't like outsiders around when I examine my patients.

234
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,270
You can let one person stay, Your Highness.

235
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,060
Can you see some light?

236
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,760
Yes.

237
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,880
How about now?

238
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,600
How are his eyes, Divine Healer?

239
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,670
It's fine.

240
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been blind for so many years already.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,736
I'm used to it.

242
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,850
I just wanted to give it a try.

243
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,202
Even if you can't heal me, it's fine.

244
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,330
It's as I expected.

245
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,802
Your retinal veins are normal, but your eyeballs are dead.

246
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,924
I know all that.

247
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,742
But it's still treatable.

248
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,572
Divine Healer, you just need to tell us if you can treat him or not.

249
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,370
Leave the rest to us.

250
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,260
No matter how expensive the herbs are, we'll get them.

251
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,612
No matter how much money you want, we'll prepare it.

252
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,340
Are you sure...

253
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,300
I really can be treated this time?

254
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,400
In the name of the 11th generation of the Medicine King of Medicine Valley, I can tell you, it's treatable.

255
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,370
Thank you... Divine Healer.

256
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,880
You're welcome, Your Highness. Please get up.

257
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,730

258
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,380
- As for the method... 
 - You can discuss the methods with me.

259
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,880
Prince Bai's Residence will fully cooperate.

260
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,150
All right.

261
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,220
It does require some complex preparation.

262
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,710
I'll discuss the details with this gentleman.

263
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,060
I'll take my leave, Your Highness.

264
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,000
A moment, Divine Healer.

265
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,188
I have a question.

266
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,570
Go on.

267
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,848
Did you come because my sixth brother,

268
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:33,400
or Xiao Se, as you call him, asked you to come?

269
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,550
I did ask him. He said it would be fine.

270
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,770
I see.

271
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,510
I won't forget this favor.

272
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,962
But it wasn't his words that really brought me here.

273
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,150
What was it then?

274
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,620
Because someone else asked for my help too.

275
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,380
 Divine Healer, you're so young.

276
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,228
 Would you be willing to stay at the Imperial Medical Academy?

277
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,100
 Your Majesty, the healers of Medicine Valley are forbidden to become officials.

278
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,440
 This is an ancestral teaching.

279
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,910
 Why is there such an ancestral teaching?

280
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,880
 Great Master, our great-great-great grandfather, said

281
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,910
 the Medicine Valley offers our services to the world, not just one person.

282
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,710
 But I'm the Emperor.

283
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,910
 Healers don't care about that.

284
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,662
 Only a mind of such magnificence

285
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:31,934
 can have such wonderful medical skills.

286
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,370
 But before you leave Tianqi,

287
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,760
 I'd like to ask you to check on one more patient for me.

288
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,690
 Is that all right?

289
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Imperial Father...

290
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,720
What I'm about to say may be a bit complicated, and I can't explain it well.

291
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,800
Disciple, you tell him.

292
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Got it, Master.

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,260
My master is trying to say that, Prince Bai,

294
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,080
please stop associating my master's medical treatment here with certain interests.

295
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,200
Why can't you just consider that she is doing it for the sake of your family?

296
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,840
Your brother and your father both want you to be able to see again.

297
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,702
One of them is your brother, and the other is your father.

298
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,310
It has nothing to do with anything else.

299
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,388
I understand.

300
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,620
Thank you for enlightening me.

301
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,180
It's my disciple who said it well.

302
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
Before I became blind as a child,

303
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,642
I once ate a pastry.

304
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:38,360
Later, the Imperial Medical Academy diagnosed that the poison in the pastry

305
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,759
was the cause of my blindness.

306
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,952
And I snatched

307
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,916
this pastry from sixth brother.

308
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,709
This has always been bothering me.

309
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:55,578
My instinct and rationality tell me that it had nothing to do with him,

310
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:58,620
but I've never been able to fully accept it.

311
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,208
You definitely shouldn't doubt Xiao Se on this.

312
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:05,578
Actually... he has always felt guilty about it,

313
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,440
especially since he thinks that the pastry wasn't meant for you.

314
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,529
Therefore, he really wants to cure your eyes.

315
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,750
Are you saying that...

316
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,140
That's all I have to say.

317
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,300
Master, let's go.

318
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,060
All right.

319
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,820
I'll walk the Divine Healer out.

320
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,880
What are you trying to do?

321
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,704
Can Chong'er's eyes be cured?

322
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes.

323
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
Thank you.

324
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,970
I've always heard that the Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian, respects neither gods nor demons.

325
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,570
I never thought you would care so much about a prince.

326
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,449
Whether Chong'er is a prince or a lord, he's just my disciple.

327
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,740
Of the Five Sword Deities, you're the only one that no one knows if he is good or evil.

328
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,530
You're known for your wrath, and you feed your sword with wrath.

329
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,090
You show no mercy when you kill.

330
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,090
You kill without questioning if it's right or wrong.

331
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,740
You hold the Sword of Dominion, Pojun.

332
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,910
You're also known as one of the Four Demons in the martial arts world.

333
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,948
Yet you can say such tender words.

334
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,900
 Your Highness, he's still alive.

335
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,542
 Water... water...

336
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,850
 - Go fetch him water. 
 - Water...

337
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,350
 All right.

338
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,804
 - Water... 
 - Here's water.

339
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,420
 Although you saved me,

340
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,670
 I won't be grateful to you.

341
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,698
 When I get better, I might even kill you.

342
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,180
 Sir, are you from the Martial Arts World?

343
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,924
 What if I am?

344
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:33,220
 Since you're from the Martial Arts World, you must have seen a lot of beautiful scenery on your journeys.

345
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:38,908
 I was wondering if you would mind telling me about them.

346
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:43,672
 Aren't you afraid that I would really kill you?

347
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:48,768
 I can tell that you're a heroic man.

348
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,520
 Nonsense. You clearly can't see anything.

349
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,120
 Although I won't be grateful to you,

350
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,292
 I don't want to owe you a favor, either.

351
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,990
 I'll teach you sword practice.

352
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,900
 Thank you, Sir.

353
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,280
Save your nonsense!

354
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,130
The point is, I've expressed my gratitude.

355
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,710
If you need any help in the future, just come to me.

356
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,210
All right.

357
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,570
He's an interesting man too.

358
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,170
Master, if he had drawn that sword in his hand,

359
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,872
you wouldn't feel the same way.

360
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,150

361
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,410
If there is anything you need me to do, just tell me.

362
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,620
When I was talking about the cure, you interrupted me.

363
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,192
Did you already know about this method?

364
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,930
To cure His Highness's eyes, I have searched through ancient books and looked for famous physicians.

365
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,326
I've only found one method, but no one could do it.

366
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,720
And no one dares to do it.

367
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,388
When you said there was a way today, I figured out the method you had in your mind.

368
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,460
All right. I'll just say it then.

369
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,360
To cure His Highness, I need to replace eyes with eyes.

370
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,684
Replace eyes with eyes?

371
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
It is necessary for the person whose eyes will be removed to be sincere and willing.

372
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,700
If he has even the slightest hesitation, he'll lose his eyes.

373
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,292
I understand.

374
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,120
So I want to meet the person who's willing to give his eyes.

375
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,660
First, I need to know if he's innocent.

376
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,950
I don't want to save a person but harm another.

377
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,390
Second, he has to give up his eyes willingly.

378
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,660
I don't want to have a failed surgery.

379
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,280
Do you have a person for this?

380
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,564
Yes, Divine Healer.

381
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:59,230
You answered so quickly.

382
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,498
Because this person is standing before you right now.

383
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,640
You?

384
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,454
I can only count on you.

385
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:14,340
I understand your loyalty, but you really don't want to reconsider it?

386
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,676
This isn't a decision to be made lightly.

387
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,660
I have followed His Highness since I was little.

388
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,770
Things have changed in the Imperial Court.

389
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,280
Why not use my eyes to let His Highness regain his sight?

390
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,392
This way, Prince Bai's Residence will be able to turn things around.

391
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Once you agree to the surgery, you can't change your mind.

392
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,828
I don't read much,

393
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:41,772
but Sir Shao Han once said, "if the ruler treats me as a pillar of the nation,"

394
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,540
"I'll make a contribution expected of a pillar of the nation."

395
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,660
When I first met Prince Bai, I was just a non-lineal son from a fallen family.

396
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,390
His Highness gave me the opportunity to see the world.

397
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,142
Now the world is changing, yet there's nothing I can do.

398
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:09,002
I just hope my eyes can help His Highness to rise to power.

399
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,950

400
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,800
I have a distinguished guest here

401
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,700
who has been staying for quite some time already.

402
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,424
You can probably guess who she is.

403
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,800
This must be the leader of Dark River, Sir Su Changhe.

404
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,840
Ghost Physician Night Crow. I've heard a lot about you.

405
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,140
Since I'm not doing something honorable, I was embarrassed to light too many candles.

406
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,642
I hope you don't mind.

407
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,660
This way, please.

408
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,080
Back then I liked to test my medicine on humans,

409
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,940
but my fellow disciples in Medicine Valley couldn't accept it.

410
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,620
Over the years, I've traveled around the Martial Arts World.

411
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,820
Fortunately, Prince Chi took me in.

412
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,950
I have lived here for over a decade.

413
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,500
Now, I've finally achieved something.

414
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,760
Leader, he's my most perfect piece of work.

415
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,620
I've seen him before.

416
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,860
He's strong, but not that strong.

417
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,300
My medicine will make him even stronger,

418
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,610
because his heart is gone.

419
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,622
He no longer has any worries.

420
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:33,030
A beast that's not shackled is the most powerful.

421
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,670
Leader, this pill is to be taken once daily for three days.

422
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:43,240
Bring your men to me, and I'll give you the most powerful Dark River.

423
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,422
And turn my men into living dead like him?

424
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,010
You want to be the best in the Martial Arts World.

425
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,910
A dozen men is a small price to pay.

426
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:03,742
Not to mention, these men will become your sharpest blade in the future.

427
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:06,194
They'll never betray you.

428
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,800
Why did Bai Xiao Sect use the dove to send us a message again?

429
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Aren't they afraid that the message will be intercepted?

430
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,990
They are not worried that this information might be intercepted.

431
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,030
How so?

432
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,470
I already know that Dark River is working for Prince Chi.

433
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,220
It really was that guy.

434
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,392
When I saw him in Qianjin Gambling House, I knew he wasn't a good guy.

435
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,250
The Divine Healer sent us a message.

436
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,190
She's confirmed that Prince Bai's eyes are treatable.

437
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,690
And she has set a date, it's in three days.

438
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,380
Have our men been sent to keep an eye on her?

439
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,780
Don't worry.

440
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,290
I've sent secret bodyguards to protect Miss Hua Jin already.

441
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,990
However, these secret bodyguards can't enter a prince's residence.

442
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,500
Therefore, that day will be the most dangerous at Prince Bai's Residence.

443
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,240
Second Brother possesses both ability and integrity.

444
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,480
He has gained a lot of support in the Imperial Court.

445
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,220
If he hadn't been blind, he would have been as good as Father was back then.

446
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:14,460
Now that he's going to regain his sight, there is no way Seventh Brother will let it happen.

447
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:17,700
They'll kill Hua Jin?

448
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,800
If he kills Hua Jin, not only will Prince Bai's eyes not be treated...

449
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,730
But His Majesty will also die.

450
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,800
And he can blame everything on me easily as well.

451
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,728
After all, I'm the one who sent Hua Jin over there.

452
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,990
I'll go and protect Hua Jin!

453
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,890
I can as well.

454
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,850
Inform Zang Ming that I would like to join forces with Second Brother this time

455
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,420
to get rid of the mastermind once and for all.

456
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,940
I'll make the arrangements right now.

457
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,080
I'll walk Miss Ye back.

458
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Qianluo, go back and rest early.

459
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,880
All right. I'll practice with my spear for two more hours before I go.

460
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,190
Why have you been working so hard lately?

461
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,450
You're working harder than you were when Third Master was around.

462
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,404
Because there's another great battle coming in three days.

463
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,230
It's been hard on you.

464
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,860
When will these kinds of days be over?

465
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Trust me, soon.

466
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,296
When it's over, will you come back to Xueyue City with me?

467
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,348
Why are your eyes closed?

468
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:38,840
Why won't you answer my question?

469
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,876
I'll answer you, but not right now.

470
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:50,764
Do you know why I've been practicing with my spear so hard?

471
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:52,810
Because I want to be stronger than you.

472
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,718
That way, if you don't come with me then, I'll tie you up and take you away.

473
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
They all say you're going to be the Emperor.

474
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,860
But what's the fun of being an emperor?

475
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,410
Look at your father. He's led such an exhausting life.

476
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,764
- Besides, Tianqi City—  
 - All right.

477
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,590
I know.

478
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,420
Then, will you...

479
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,690
You're laughing at me.

480
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,290
Lei Wujie, actually, you didn't need to walk me back.

481
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,330
I'll take the General's carriage. No one would dare stop me.

482
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,800
You don't know that for sure!

483
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,120
They even dared to assassinate the Grand Preceptor!

484
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,230
Assassinating the Grand Preceptor would shock the Imperial Court.

485
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,360
But if they kill me, my father would destroy Tianqi City without a second thought.

486
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,500
Is your father that powerful?

487
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,090
Not as powerful as your father.

488
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,482
When your father was alive, my father could only be in second place.

489
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,634
But my father passed away too early.

490
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:02,606
I don't remember much about him.

491
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,040
My father said you two are very much alike.

492
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,472
He was like me?

493
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,530
He couldn't have been that strong then.

494
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,630
You have so little confidence?

495
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,190
I had a lot of confidence when I first explored the martial arts world.

496
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,738
It's just that I've been so beaten up that confidence is gone.

497
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:22,190
My father said General Lei was a very interesting man.

498
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,950
You are too, Lei Wujie.

499
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,290
So this is why we're alike?

500
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,774
However, isn't interesting just a nice way of saying I'm silly?

501
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,990
You really are silly.

502
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,892
Well... Ye...

503
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,140
You're stammering.

504
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,360
What do you want to say?

505
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:53,374
Did you love Xiao Se in the past?

506
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,120
Yes.

507
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,460
Before he left Tianqi City, I've always really liked him.

508
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,860
My father almost proposed marriage to him for me.

509
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,988
W-What about now?

510
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,890
I don't like him anymore.

511
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,514
Why not?

512
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,890
I was young then. I didn't know what it was like to like someone.

513
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,960
When I look at him now, I feel like I'm looking in a mirror.

514
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,496
I don't get it.

515
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:35,259

516
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,420
Eunuch Jin Yu isn't going?

517
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,010
He was the one who asked me for the favor.

518
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,420
Jingtai Palace has an important matter he needs to handle.

519
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,470
I'll escort you there alone today.

520
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,126
Jingtai Palace?

521
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:50,370
Isn't that the residence of Prince Chi's mother?

522
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,940
- Master, this— 
 - Don't speculate about the affairs of the palace.

523
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,420
All right. I'm ready.

524
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,500
We can depart now.

525
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,200
Second Brother, are you nervous?

526
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,150
A little bit.

527
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,320
What about you?

528
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,128
I'm... not nervous.

529
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,450
You've been like this ever since you were little.

530
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,250
Your palms sweat when you're nervous.

531
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,050
Don't worry.

532
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,046
Zang Ming, why do you look so calm?

533
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:36,698
Because I know... that everything will go smoothly today.

534
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,630
Second Brother, when your eyes are healed,

535
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,650
what do you want to do the most?

536
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:50,830
I want you two to ride on horseback with me,

537
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,000
and really explore Tianqi City.

538
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,820
Please.

539
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:05,915

540
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,330
It's you.

541
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,550
Divine Healer, I'm going to undergo medical treatment soon.

542
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,878
I still don't know what I need to do.

543
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:27,570
You don't have to do anything.

544
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,800
When the time comes, I'll insert ten needles into your body.

545
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,024
And you'll lose all consciousness.

546
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:36,990
When you wake up, you'll be able to see again.

547
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,910
Divine Healer, I still don't understand how you're going to make that happen.

548
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,790
It's a secret method. I can't tell you.

549
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,080
Your Highness, please.

550
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,172
Zang Ming, are you nervous?

551
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,640
Yes.

552
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,048
It's normal.

553
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:06,346
If I were you, I'd be so nervous.

554
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:09,072
I'm not nervous about myself.

555
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:15,108
I'm just worried if His Highness really can see again after today.

556
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,744
His Highness is unconscious now.

557
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,056
Are you ready?

558
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:25,294
I can only count on you, Divine Healer.

559
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:27,050
Let's get started.

560
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,890
You'll be unconscious like His Highness later,

561
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,780
but the difference is that he'll see again when he wakes up,

562
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,780
while you'll never see the world again.

563
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,320
Would you like to take a longer look at it?

564
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
It's fine.

565
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,826
I'm not a sentimental person.

566
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:47,272
My friend, I admire your courage.

567
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,850
My dream is that one day, His Highness will be riding the horse in front,

568
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,758
and I'll be following behind, wielding a sword.

569
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,690
Perhaps I can't keep up with His Highness in the future,

570
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,550
but I really hope he can move forward step by step.

571
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,176
As you wish, then.

572
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,880
Your Majesty.

573
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,248
Is Hua Jin not here?

574
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:22,430
Divine Healer Hua Jin came early this morning.

575
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,670
She's at Prince Bai's Residence now.

576
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,360
She has gone to Chong'er's place.

577
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,436
Hua Jin's medical skills are excellent.

578
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:37,502
She may really be able to cure Chong'er's eyes.

579
00:36:37,502 --> 00:36:40,090
As for my illness,

580
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm afraid it can't be cured.

581
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,690
Your Majesty, you mustn't say that.

582
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,394
- Changqing. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

583
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:55,150
Go and tell Marquis Lanyue to go to Prince Bai's Residence.

584
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,164
Your Majesty, Marquis Lanyue is already there.

585
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:07,094
Tianqi City isn't the same as it was back then.

586
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:11,048
Your Highness, who are we waiting for?

587
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:16,000
We're waiting for the demons that want to take lives and souls that are wandering.

588
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,340
 I brought the Divine Healer to Tianqi,

589
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,880
 so of course I have to get her out of Tianqi safely.

590
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,780
I don't care about other people's lives.

591
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:31,050
But if they want to kill her, they will have to ask my blade first.

592
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,360
Your Highness, the demons have arrived.

593
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,460
I haven't drawn my blade for a long time already.

594
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,240
This is Savage Blade from Falling Dust, the best blade wielder of Beili.

595
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,076
Today, it'll kill the demons and fight until the death.

596
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,100

597
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,510
Umbrella-Holding Demon Su Muyu, we met again.

598
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,050
Lei Wujie.

599
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,690
You know my name?

600
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,260
You have a nice sword.

601
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,160
Like Jinwei, Bearer of Sword, you are both swordsmen who deserve to be remembered.

602
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,618
The best swordsman of Dark River, you are worthy of me drawing my sword.

603
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,320
You came.

604
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,912
It's a peaceful and clear night to kill.

605
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:20,484
Are you here to join me for a good show

606
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,480
and a good cup of tea?

607
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,016
I thought you would be doing it yourself today,

608
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:30,972
but I didn't expect that you would find such a place to enjoy tea.

609
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,816
Watching the show is much more interesting than doing it myself.

610
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,820
Come. I've saved a good spot for you.

611
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,040
I remember him.

612
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,468
He wanted to kill you back then, but Wu Xin stopped him.

613
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:58,454
Leader of Dark River.

614
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,960
You've been going against me ever since we were little.

615
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,128
I've always lost to you,

616
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,892
but you won't win this time.

617
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:15,598
Second Brother's eyes won't be healed today.

618
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:20,968
That Divine Healer you invited won't step out of that door alive.

619
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,322
The Leader of Dark River is very powerful.

620
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,346
Are you confident that you'll win?

621
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:32,810
Do you have any idea how many martial arts masters I have here?

622
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,614
Can this young girl next to you deal with that many people by herself?

623
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,060
Are you even a match for Dark River's leader?

624
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,800
You're right.

625
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,620
It's true that the current me can't kill him,

626
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,816
but there's a master I know who's qualified to fight against him.

627
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,210
Now this is getting interesting.

628
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,370
Our fight here is going to be a lot more exciting than the fight at Prince Bai's residence.

629
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,394
How about this?

630
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:10,608
Instead of fighting, let's make a bet today.

631
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:30,000

632
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,000
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

633
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,280
♫  We still have a long way to go in the martial arts world  ♫

634
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,500
♫  Outside the snow is falling  ♫

635
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,950
♫  Only clouds know the warmth of the cold moon  ♫
