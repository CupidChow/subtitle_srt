00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,080
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,780
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,120
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,340
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,360
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,420
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,560
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,940
♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  The journey to seek glory and justice is not in vain  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,340
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,560
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,640
♫  Life teaches us with every struggle  ♫

20

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,020
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,040

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,980

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,760
It's called the Tide-Watching Inn, yet it's so far away from the sea.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,020
And the building is short.

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,660
Forget about watching the tides, I doubt they can even hear them.

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,540
It doesn't live up to the name at all.

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,200
Do you hear yourself?

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,940
Your Snowfall Mountain Villa has broken walls and a leaking roof.

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,840
The snow blows in all the time.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,260
Its name certainly befits its condition.

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,580
Compared to who he was months ago,

33
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,340
not only is he a better swordsman,

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,920
but he's also quite the talker now.

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,560
But of course. I learned from the worst.

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,440
I kind of miss Snowfall Mountain Villa.

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,080
Yeah, I wonder if it's still open.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,100
Just kidding.

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,880
By the way, Miss Zhenzhu said the fish market has the biggest crowd this time of the day.

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,740
Let's hurry over. I'll lead the way.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,140
Young Master Lei.

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,600
Young Master Lei, over here.

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,880
- Over here! 
 - Zhenzhu!

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Let me introduce you.

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,940
These are my friends, Xiao Se and Tang Lian.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,660
I asked about that boat for you.

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,600
It's a major commercial ship from Qingzhou.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
They are looking for medicine in the deep sea.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,940
For this operation, they are hiring 60 people.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,220
The whole trip will take about four months.

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,720
Four months? That's a long time.

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
So at first, no one wanted to go.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,620
But according to the Mu family, each person will be paid 20 gold taels.

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,880
- Twenty gold taels? 
 - That is about what a fisherman makes in a decade.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,480
They even pay you upfront.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,920
Everyone's gone to interview.

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,240
How many have been recruited?

58
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,340
They only hired two or three people this morning.

59
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,020
Only two or three people?

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,180
What kind of people do they need?

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,600
Is it about swimming and catching fish?

62
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,720
They're right up front. Why don't I take you there?

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go. Let's go!

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,720
- Come on. 
 - Sure.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,860
This is it.

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,720
Young Master Lei. I have fish to catch and money to make.

67
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,880
What kind of snake is that?

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,340
It looks so aggressive.

69
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a gold-thread viper.

70
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,320
Its venom is lethal.

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,440
The extracted venom can become an antidote for all venoms.

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,720
Therefore, it's priceless in Beili.

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,180
A small cup of its venom is worth almost 100 silver taels.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,840
I know where this boat is headed.

75
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,140
Sanshe Island.

76
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,820
The place is crawling with gold-thread vipers.

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,440
This is the snake catcher, also known as a snake master.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,920
Their clothing is covered in a special powder that repels snakes.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,660
See? He's fine now.

80
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,620
He failed the test.

81
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,640
He gets 30 copper coins as compensation.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,060
Dismissed.

83
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,200
- What? 
 - He still gets paid.

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720
Anyone else care to give it a try?

85
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,100
I'll do it!

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,740
Money really does make the mare move.

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,200
They can catch fish, but snakes?

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
It's out of their league.

89
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,780
The Mu family is cunning.

90
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,100
They are rich cowards who buy human lives with money.

91
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,460
The rich are all the same.

92
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,200
I didn't mean you. I meant the Mu family.

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,460
The Mu family is the bad guy.

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,360
It cannot be tamed.

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,280
- It must die. 
 - Wait!

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,780
I'm Liang, the steward of the Mu family.

97
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,960
The commotion startled the gold-thread viper and nearly put you in harm's way.

98
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,580
Seeing how hard it is to raise a gold-thread viper,

99
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,840
please have mercy on it.

100
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,840
Since you asked nicely, how can I not spare it?

101
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,820
Wait.

102
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,980
You witnessed what my friends were capable of just now.

103
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,000
Did we pass the test?

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,340
Well...

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Seems it wasn't enough.

106
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,280
Lei Wujie.

107
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,660
I can tell right away this hero's sword is a fine sword.

108
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,260
There is no doubt you're a masterful swordsman.

109
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,300
If you all would join the Mu family's operation, you would be of great help.

110
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,360
The young master asked for you.

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,680
A fateful day indeed.

112
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,720
Our master wishes to meet you in person.

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,780
Pleasure to meet you.

114
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,340
I'm Mu Chunfeng.

115
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,960
How may I address the three of you?

116
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,220
Xiao Wuxin.

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm Lei...

118
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,320
Lei Zhenyu. 
  (*thundershower)

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,380
Thirteenth Tang.

120
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,560
If you want to lie, at least put some effort into the names.

121
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,740
Xiao Se. He saw right through us.

122
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,460
There's no point in putting up an act now.

123
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,880
Otherwise, it'll seem weirder.

124
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,580
I am Lei Wujie.

125
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,020
 I travel the martial arts world righteously.

126
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,680
 It's wrong to use a false name.

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,180
I am Xiao Se.

128
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,140
 How silly of me. I'm already using an alias anyway, why bother making up another?

129
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,500
I am Tang Mohe.

130
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,720
 Who doesn't know my real name in the martial arts world?

131
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,920
Nice names.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,380
Take a seat.

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,600
Gentlemen, you don't look like locals.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,080
May I know why you've come to this remote village?

135
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,080
We train under the same master.

136
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,980
I'm their elder martial brother.

137
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,000
We are here on our master's order.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,520
They came with me to see the world's majestic peaks and vast oceans.

139
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,700
Heaven meets the ocean at the horizon, clouds enshroud the great mountains.

140
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,080
To see the edge of the ocean, only our Mu family's Cedar Longship can take you there.

141
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,860
However, I need the gallbladders of three snakes.

142
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,340
You seem agile enough.

143
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,320
Could I ask a favor of you?

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,200
What snakes do you need?

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,500
A gold-thread viper, a silver-shroud viper, and an iron-glass viper.

146
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,980
All highly venomous snakes.

147
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,040
Why do you need them?

148
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,460
I'll be honest with you all.

149
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,620
I have a friend who is suffering from a strange sickness.

150
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,640
No physicians can heal him.

151
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,340
I came across a formula in an old tomb.

152
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,780
It says the medicine needs the gallbladders of these three snakes.

153
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,560
What sickness is that?

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,160
Peach blossoms showering down, promises of love can wait.

155
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,980
Unrewarding intimacy in the ornate tent, the peach blossoms' affection goes to waste.

156
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,260
Nice poem. Nice poem, indeed.

157
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,140
But... what does it mean?

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,800
There's nothing nice about it.

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,140
If you don't understand, don't compliment randomly.

160
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,580
He's trying to make an aphrodisiac.

161
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,880
Brother Xiao is straightforward, but you're right.

162
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,060
Is that friend of yours

163
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,420
actually you?

164
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,760
Of course not!

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,620
Getting the gallbladders is no easy feat.

166
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,200
You would take the risk to help your friend.

167
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,580
It's hard not to suspect that you want them for yourself.

168
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,400
I'll tell you the truth.

169
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,280
It's my elder brother who needs the medicine.

170
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,920
We came here to find a cure for my elder brother and to find some herbs.

171
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,400
Is it hard to cure this sickness?

172
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,380
Do many get it?

173
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
You're too young. You don't understand.

174
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,580
I don't understand either.

175
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,160
So I'm the only one who knows?

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,760
Both of you are making it really awkward for me.

177
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
Actually, I read a lot, that's all.

178
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,440
If you're all willing to help, I'll even help you reach the edge of the world.

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,760
Is that so?

180
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,960
The place we're headed for is indeed at the edge of the world.

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,400
Further than Sanshe Island?

182
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,660
How about this, Young Master Mu?

183
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,020
When we reach Sanshe Island, we'll get the gallbladders for you.

184
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,820
Leave a small boat for us.

185
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,760
We'll meet up again after seven days.

186
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,960
How does that sound?

187
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,080
What if you don't come back after seven days?

188
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,880
There's no need to wait any longer then.

189
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,960
You'd take great risks only to get to the edge of the ocean?

190
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,840
We get to see what no other humans can.

191
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
Is it not worth it?

192
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,800
It is.

193
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,500
- When will we set out? 
 - In three days.

194
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,720
After we've recruited enough snake catchers, we set out.

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,960
Very well.

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,100
See you in three days.

197
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
Wait.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,220
According to my subordinate, Brother Lei has a powerful inner force.

199
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,840
Even the gold-thread viper feared him.

200
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,880
Brother Tang is ever more formidable.

201
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,380
His finger skills were just as extraordinary.

202
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,160
But I haven't heard... what you are capable of, Brother Xiao.

203
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,780
Truth be told, I'm not as capable.

204
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,680
But my two friends are willing to follow my lead.

205
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,160
Is that enough?

206
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,040
Very well.

207
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,140
Fish for sale! Fresh catch of the day!

208
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,420
Brother Mu agreed in quite readily.

209
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,140
- Is there a catch? 
 - No.

210
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,700
Why not?

211
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,360
I've met plenty of young masters from rich families.

212
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
They all think of themselves as outstanding gentlemen,

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,540
but they all lack shrewdness.

214
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,480
After I told him we were going to the edge of the ocean,

215
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,540
he thought he'd found a soulmate and told us everything.

216
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
It was easy to swindle him.

217
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,160
Xiao Se. Was that how you saw me?!

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,540
I made a mistake and was wrong about you.

219
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,520
I thought you were pretending to be poor, but turned out you really are poor.

220
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,120
All right. We got ourselves a ship for the journey anyway.

221
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,980
Next we should...

222
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,040
Look at Senior Brother...

223
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,060
Lei Wujie.

224
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,820
I got us a free ride.

225
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,520
Perhaps we can have a decent meal tonight.

226
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,320
Then I'll invite Miss Zhenzhu and get a grouper!

227
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
Good.

228
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's go.

229
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,280
Hanyi. When will you stop searching?

230
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
Get out of my way!

231
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,780
Take a closer look.

232
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,560
It's me, Lei Hong.

233
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,980
- Lei Hong? 
 - Yes.

234
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,940
I am Lei Hong. Look at me.

235
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,900
Do you recognize me now?

236
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,220
Lei Hong.

237
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,520
If you and your brother hadn't gone to Mount Wangcheng for the challenge,

238
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,900
Yuzhen and I would have been together.

239
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,580
If I hadn't been going to the Lei Fortress to see you,

240
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,720
Yuzhen wouldn't have left the mountain... and wouldn't have died.

241
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,060
Lei Hong, time to die!

242
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,560
Hanyi!

243
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Why must I always come to the rescue of those in dire situations?

244
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,060
Is this really my destiny?

245
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,720
Perhaps I'm destined to descend to the Mortal World and bring light to the people.

246
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,180
I didn't want to become a deity, but I was forced to become one.

247
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,700
Who are you?

248
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,820
I am Wu Xin.

249
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,660
The Young Sect Master of the Demon Sect?

250
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,360
That's Wu Xin from Tian Wai Tian.

251
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,780
The Wu Xin from Beili is a mere monk of Hanshui Temple.

252
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,900
Thank you for saving me.

253
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,680
But I didn't need it.

254
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,740
You should leave.

255
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
You got it all wrong.

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm here looking for someone.

257
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,800
I was only saving you along the way.

258
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,060
What do you want?

259
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,160
She's crazy and on a rampage. She is as strong as you!

260
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,360
I learned from my master how to subjugate and exorcise demons.

261
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,120
I'll chant some calming incantations to help the Xueyue Sword Deity regain some consciousness.

262
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,820
I forgot the line.

263
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Sorry. It's been some time. I'm rusty.

264
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,720
Forget it. I'm not following in my master's footsteps anyway.

265
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,860
Sir Lei Hong. Stall her for me.

266
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,160
- I need an opening. 
 - Okay.

267
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,580
Now!

268
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,500
The first strike resolves the heart, the second strike breaks the karma,

269
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,760
the third strike quenches the evil,

270
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,940
the fourth strike vanquishes,

271
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,920
the fifth strike exorcises,

272
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,740
the sixth strike quells the darkness,

273
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,880
and the seventh strike brings forth the light!

274
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,980
Hanyi! Hanyi!

275
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,200
It was worth it to secretly learn this purification technique from my martial brother.

276
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,840
A rampage?

277
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Let's call it a day.

278
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,460
Who are you?

279
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm Wu Xin from Hanshui Temple.

280
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,060
You're Ye Dingzhi's son.

281
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,580
Yes.

282
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,820
You're nothing like your father.

283
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,700
Is that so?

284
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,680
Your father, regardless if it was his appearance or demeanor, was always heroic.

285
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,780
Many said he didn't look like a martial artist, but a ruler.

286
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,420
But you're different.

287
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,760
I see no competitiveness in you.

288
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,940
Judging by your tone, you and my father knew each other a long time ago.

289
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,480
When I met him, he was merely wandering in Jiangnan.

290
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,000
He taught me a few sword techniques.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,260
When I met him again, he was already the Sect Master of the Demon Cult.

292
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,340
Is that why you killed him?

293
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,400
If you're asking, it means you're sure that I didn't do it.

294
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,780
If I killed him, it would be between righteousness and evil,

295
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,860
and I would be doing the right thing.

296
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,460
Who was the last person to have seen my father?

297
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,080
A woman.

298
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,660
She and the Lone Sword Deity got there ahead of us.

299
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,220
She whispered some words to Ye Dingzhi.

300
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,160
Then, he slit his own throat.

301
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,600
I knew it.

302
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,540
I checked your pulse.

303
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,820
You have only less than 20 percent of your power left.

304
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,480
It'd be unwise to let your enemies know that.

305
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,320
Therefore, return to Xueyue City and recuperate.

306
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,880
Where are you going?

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,740
Somewhere I should be.

308
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,180
Sorry.

309
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,160
I touched your swords without your permission.

310
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,680
They were dirty, so I cleaned them for you.

311
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,060
Thank you.

312
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,140
It's been a long time.

313
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,660
If you don't turn around, then you haven't seen me yet.

314
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,980
Because after so many years,

315
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,720
I didn't change for the better.

316
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,540
I'm not a shallow person.

317
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,040
But I am.

318
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,000
The moment I first laid my eyes on you,

319
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,920
I had fallen for you.

320
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,920
That said, I've been there too.

321
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,140
Back on Mount Wangcheng, I asked to meet again after you became the greatest swordsman.

323
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,120
I didn't know that promise would cost you so many good years of your life.

324
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,420
Good years...

325
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,820
Over the years, you could have met a lot of people.

326
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,440
Some you would like, and others, you would dislike.

327
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,040
Some... who would stay by your side forever.

328
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,820
Meeting you is more than I'll ever need.

329
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,140
But I've already married him.

330
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,680
If I was the first to have met you,

331
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,840
would things be different now?

332
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,260
No.

333
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll always have met him first.

334
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,020
There are some things we can never change.

335
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,340
I went berserk, but I remember what I said to you.

337
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,740
I didn't mean what I said.

338
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,920
None of that was your fault.

339
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,140
Instead, I should thank you.

340
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,920
But I stand by what I said.

341
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,180
There are some things we can never change.

342
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,060
Farewell.

343
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,580
No news from Hanyi?

344
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,740
I wish I could go after her myself.

345
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,520
The series of incidents lately indicate that someone is trying to bring down Xueyue City.

346
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,440
The Tang Clan's stance is unclear right now.

347
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,280
The Lei Fortress has suffered heavy losses.

348
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,700
It will take some time for them to regain their strength.

349
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,880
While the Wen family isolates themselves from the world and never gets involved in conflicts.

350
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,360
All three of our biggest allies are unreliable.

351
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,300
Two of our city lords have gone missing.

352
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,760
If you left, Xueyue City would fall apart in no time.

353
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,580
In this game, we are all pawns.

354
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,480
Indeed.

355
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,500
But sadly, the player is already dead.

356
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,540
He's bound Xueyue City and Xiao Chuhe tightly together.

357
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,000

358
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,960
Is the attack on the Lei Fortress connected to Wushuang City?

359
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,400
I doubt Song Yanhui would get involved.

360
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,960
But the martial arts world is a small place.

361
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
With Xueyue City losing its influence,

362
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,800
Wushuang City naturally stands to benefit from it.

363
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,960
So I think they could be involved.

364
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,240
But in any case, Xueyue City is bound to battle Wushuang City.

365
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,320
I'll to my best to prepare when it comes to that.

366
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,340
Until then, Xueyue City needs you to maintain order.

367
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,940
Understood.

368
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,640
We are going out into the sea soon!

369
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm so excited!

370
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,900
Keep it down.

371
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,220
People might think we're a bunch of bumpkins who haven't seen the sea before.

372
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,060
Sounds like you've been there.

373
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,700
No.

374
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,220
You haven't been there either?

375
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,440
Life is somewhat lacking for those who have never seen the vast sea.

376
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
Young Master Mu.

377
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,200
Young Master Mu, taking a walk on the street?

378
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,060
It seems you've found your snake catchers.

379
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,220
Almost.

380
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,260
Gentlemen, get ready.

381
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,000
We'll be setting out soon.

382
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,060
All right!

383
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,900
I'll head back to the inn and start packing now.

384
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,320
Hold on. I'll come with you. I want to visit the fish market along the way.

385
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,260
Sure, let's go!

386
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,960
Maybe we should grab a meal before leaving.

387
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,260
We're broke.

388
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,560
No worries. I can pay.

389
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Brother Mu, you are too polite.

390
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,220
Then I should invite Miss Zhenzhu.

391
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,820
She's been really helpful.

392
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,660
We should return the favor.

393
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Sure.

394
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,000
Who is that?

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
He doesn't seem like those from Dark River.

396
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,700
A purple python robe.

397
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,880
It's the livery of eunuchs.

398
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,280
He works in the palace.

399
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,200
Good guess, Young Master Mu.

400
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,120
He is one of the Five Eunuchs.

401
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,420
The Bearer of Sword, Eunuch Jin Wei.

402
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,560
One of the Five Eunuchs?

403
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,840
Is he a friend of yours?

404
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,100
Is he coming with you?

405
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,200
That would be a great honor for my ship.

406
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,620
Unfortunately, no. He is here to arrest me.

407
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,100
You?

408
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,840
Xiao Se...

409
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:14,820
Young Master Mu, I won't keep it from you. My master is Tianqi City's Eunuch Jade Deity, the Incense Bearer.

410
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,240
Unfortunately, I wasn't interested in learning martial arts, and I didn't want to become a eunuch.

411
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,160
After a fallout, I fled Tianqi City.

412
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,780
I met my two friends on the road.

413
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,040
Without them, I wouldn't have made it here.

414
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,760
What a shame.

415
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,380
Someone is here to stop us again.

416
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,220
I've heard of the great power the Five Eunuchs hold.

417
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,120
But this is unacceptable.

418
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,820
It's fine that you forced him to learn martial arts.

419
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,300
But you actually wanted to force him to become a eunuch, too?

420
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,840
- Right. 
 - Yes.

421
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,360
Simply outrageous.

422
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,660
Brother Xiao. You are boarding my ship, that makes you one of us.

423
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,080
I will keep you safe.

424
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,440
Many thanks, Young Master Mu.

425
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,760
Young Master.

426
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,080
Come with me back to Tianqi.

427
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,860
If he goes with you, then wouldn't the young master become a eunuch.

428
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,500
Who are you?

429
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm Mu Chunfeng, the third son of the Mu family from Qingzhou.

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,100
A young master from the Mu family.

431
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,980
I have no intention of obstructing your family business.

432
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,500
However, one of your comrades is a runaway who fled from his home.

433
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,840
I must take him with me.

434
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,680
Hope you don't mind, Third Young Master Mu.

435
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,780
What if we refuse to let you take him?

436
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
That sword...

437
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,880
I know it! The Eye of Abyss.

438
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,040
It's slain too many people and is now too violent.

439
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,160
So it's not listed on the Records of Famous Swords.

440
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,940
It was one of the swords of the late Emperor.

441
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,000
Not on my watch!

442
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,540
Young Master Mu!

443
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,820
Stop.

444
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,480
Mountains Mover.

445
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,740
Mountains Mover?

446
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,440
One of the ten famous swords, that Mountains Mover?!

447
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,820
You wear a robe of golden threads and wield Mountains Mover.

448
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,740
The Mu family sure is wealthy.

449
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,160
Seems Eunuch Jin Wei has no intention to kill.

450
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,560
It's pointless to continue fighting.

451
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,080
How about this?

452
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,400
We'll speak in private.

453
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,100
It's been years.

454
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,000
Eunuch, you still haven't taken up smiling.

455
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,160
I came to Dongji Sea City for some official work.

456
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,260
But a few days ago, I received a message.

457
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,320
It said you'd be setting out to sea from this town.

458
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,380
If one were to think of the most stoic person in Tianqi City, they would say it's you.

459
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,320
But think about it.

460
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,920
The heir of the Heart Sword is with me.

461
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,400
He got his mastery from Lei Hong and Li Hanyi.

462
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,660
He is one step away from reaching the Carefree Phase.

463
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,880
Also my eldest martial brother from Xueyue City is one of the finest young warriors.

464
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
Not to mention I have the Mu family's backing.

465
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,420
It won't be easy for you to take me away.

466
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,500
Do you really think I came alone while doing business?

467
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,120
Is it necessary to make this battle that big?

468
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,260
I believe the order from your superiors was to operate in secrecy.

469
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,540
What do you have in mind then?

470
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
How about this?

471
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,740
Let's both take a step back.

472
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,080
We will have a duel by the seaside in three days.

473
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,720
I'll only send Lei and my Senior Brother to the fight.

474
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,900
You only bring yourself.

475
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,540
If you manage to beat them, I'll go with you.

476
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,120
Three days?

477
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,380
It's fine if you don't trust my seventh brother because he never plays by the rules.

478
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,920
You can't trust my second brother either.

479
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,360
He is too shrewd and cunning.

480
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,840
But you can trust me.

481
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Who am I?

482
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,900
You Highness is a man of his word.

483
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,480
Everyone in Tianqi City knows that.

484
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
Very well.

485
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,200
I'll hold you to this promise and see you in three days.

486
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,520
See you then.

487
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,620
Xiao Se, what did you promise Eunuch Jin Wei?

488
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,600
A duel by the seaside three days from now.

489
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,740
A duel?

490
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,100
He bought that?

491
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,600
In his eyes, I'm the trustworthy Prince Yong'an.

492
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,620
He didn't think I'd resort to such petty deception.

493
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,180
Now I kind of pity him.

494
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,940
Not bad, Xiao Se.

495
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,660
You used the same trick on me too, didn't you?

496
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,860
There is no turning back now.

497
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,140
If we did, that eunuch would take Xiao Se away.

498
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,820
Qianluo. I sent you back to notify the Third Master, didn't I?

499
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,160
Why did you follow us?

500
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,020
I could send a message with a pigeon.

501
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,300
Why should I travel all the way back?

502
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,860
Besides, you promised to wait for me here.

503
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,440
Lucky for me, I didn't fall for it like Eunuch Jin Wei did.

504
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
Xiao Se, you're a liar!

505
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Lei Wujie. Apprehend your martial sister.

506
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,220
- Ask the Mu family to send her back on another boat. 
 - All right!

507
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,940
Dream on!

508
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,360
Let's forget it...

509
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,300
Coward.

510
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,800
You know each other?

511
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,060
I should ask you the same thing.

512
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,880
You know each other?

513
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,560
Actually, not really.

514
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,800
We met on the road.

515
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,540
Miss Qianluo said she wanted to see the sea too. So, she tagged along.

516
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,440
Did you agree to let her tag along because you found her pretty?

517
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,860
Not at all.

518
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,360
I admire her for her wish to travel the sea at such a young age.

519
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,620
I am impressed.

520
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,240
If Qianluo weren't the beauty she is, would you have brought her along?

521
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
Probably not.

522
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,700
It's a long journey after all. One more passenger is another mouth to feed.

523
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,980
Do you know that she didn't come along to visit the sea, but to meet someone?

524
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,440
Who is it?

525
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,860
Him.

526
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,000
All right, cut it out.

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
You're making fools of yourself.

528
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,920
Perhaps I got ahead of myself.

529
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh right, Brother Mu, what were you wearing back then?

530
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,280
You took a slash from Eunuch Jin Wei, but you weren't hurt at all.

531
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,260
It was our Mu family's golden thread robe.

532
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,760
Gold... Golden thread robe?

533
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,440
The golden thread robe. Treasure of the Mu family.

534
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
It cannot be pierced and is impregnable.

535
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,000
It can fit either a child or a strong soldier without any issues.

536
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,980
That sounds amazing.

537
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,760
I've never heard of it before.

538
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,140
Because it costs so much that no one can afford it.

539
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,340
Its maker, Wu Liujia, and the Jiguan Sect went bankrupt.

540
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,600
Mountains Mover forged by Li Suwang, and golden thread robe forged by Wu Liujia.

541
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
The Mu family of Qingzhou sure is wealthy.

542
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,380
Money is only a worldly possession.

543
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,840
Only the rich say that.

544
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,220
All right.

545
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,500
It's time... we have the conversation.

546
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,940
About what?

547
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,220
About your true identities.

548
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,520
We've told you who we are.

549
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:55,240
A Lei, a Tang, and a Sikong. There is also a Xiao among you.

550
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,140
These surnames belong to reputable families of Beili.

551
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,660
My elder brother thought I was too much of a book worm, but I'm no fool.

552
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,760
How much do you know?

553
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,000
I know the Third City Lord of Xueyue City is Sikong Changfeng.

554
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,320
He wields a spear.

555
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,100
Therefore...

556
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,340
I'm guessing you're his daughter.

557
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,140
Everyone knows Sikong Changfeng has a daughter.

558
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,960
But she has never left Xueyue City.

559
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,740
That's right.

560
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,760
So Tang Mohe is certainly not your name.

561
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,840
You're the eldest martial brother, Tang Lian.

562
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,100
You know quite a few things.

563
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,020
I didn't think I'd meet so many famous figures all at once.

564
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,480
I know who you are.

565
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,560
Your fame isn't on par with the other two, you're lesser-known, but I'm more interested in you.

566
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,980
Because your master is an unmatched beauty.

567
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,040
You know that too?

568
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,660
So, tell me, who am I?

569
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,120
You are Luo Mingxuan!

570
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm not that gambling addict!

571
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,720
I'm Lei Wujie! From the Lei Fortress!

572
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,980
My master is Li Hanyi, one of the five sword deities,

573
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,060
the Second City Lord of Xueyue City!

574
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,980
Your master is Li Hanyi?

575
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,740
Are you telling the truth?

576
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,540
Don't worry.

577
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,900
We've hidden our identities for so long.

578
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,580
If you hadn't gotten on his nerves,

579
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,420
this fool wouldn't have told you the truth.

580
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,540
- Then you must be... 
 - Enough guessing.

581
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,680
I'm a disciple from Xueyue City, but I don't know martial arts.

582
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,100
I don't have a reputation in the martial arts world.

583
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,080
I have some idea about why you were in Xueyue City.

584
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,900
You guessed that too?

585
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,240
Everyone knows Sikong Changfeng

586
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,480
studied under Medicine King, Xin Baicao.

587
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,080
He is the best healer in the world.

588
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
You went to him for treatment.

589
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,140
But it looks like he didn't cure you.

590
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,200
Because from the moment I met you,

591
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,940
I could tell you're dying.

592
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,060
What do you mean?

593
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,760
I grew up studying medicinal knowledge.

594
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,520
I know I'm not wrong.

595
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Is he... telling the truth?

596
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,280
Yes.

597
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,640
I thought we could return to Tianqi City

598
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,620
if the journey was fruitless.

599
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,460
But it seems failure would mean the end of you.

600
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,320
I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice.

601
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,020
You went on this voyage to search for one place.

602
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,800
And in that place lives someone who can save you.

603
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,240
I advise you to put an end to your speculations here.

604
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,220
I'm not a prodigy, but I have medical knowledge.

605
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,840
Perhaps you've already found the person who can save you.

606
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,780
This is extraordinary.

607
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,600
She is better than me.

608
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,780
She is Medicine King, Xin Baicao's apprentice and his heir.

609
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,560
The heir of Medicine Valley.

610
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,620
No wonder she's so skilled.

611
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,860
Brother Xiao. I have a favor to ask.

612
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,460
When you return to Beili,

613
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,240
could you... could you recommend me to her,

614
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,480
so I can become her disciple?

615
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,340
I've always admired Medicine Valley.

616
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,440
Sadly, Medicine King, Xin Baicao, is always traveling.

617
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,020
His whereabouts are unpredictable.

618
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,860
But the honor of studying under his apprentice

619
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,160
is more than enough for me.

620
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,600
No problem.

621
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,660
But Young Master Mu, can you still treat me?

622
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,420
If I continued the treatment,

623
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,440
it would only do you more harm.

624
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,660
I got ahead of myself earlier.

625
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,680
I am embarrassed. Truly embarrassed.

626
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,420
But Brother Xiao, why didn't you bring the Divine Healer with you?

627
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,500
If she were here, she could extend your life.

628
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
The voyage is full of perils.

629
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,340
She's done enough for me already.

630
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,840
I can't put her in harm's way again.

631
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,360
Even though we've only just met,

632
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,680
I wish we had met sooner.

633
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,400
If you were well, I'd really like to have a drink with you.

634
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,440
Qianluo.

635
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,480
It's getting late. Young Master Mu's treatment could take a lot longer.

636
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,500
- Go back inside and rest. 
 - No.

637
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,520
Xiao Se had better not know about this.

638
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,660
No one can get rid of me tonight.

639
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,020
I must keep watch.

640
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,560
- Senior Sister... 
 - Lei Wujie.

641
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,700
Xiao Se is going to live, right?

642
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,960
Yes. He will live.

643
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,560
After all, no one else in the entire world would befriend

644
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,500
someone as petty and stingy as him.

645
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
Xiao Se, you're finally out!

646
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,900
You little airhead.

647
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,020
When you couldn't pay for your noodles,

648
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,340
it was me who took you in.

649
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,720
Well? Did Young Master Mu cure you?

650
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,160
I overestimated my skill.

651
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,940
The Divine Healer had treated him.

652
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,380
My skill is insignificant compared to hers.

653
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm not dying anytime sooner. Young Master Mu.

654
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,220
Yes?

655
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,920
We agreed to have a drink. Let's get that done.

656
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,400
Certainly.

657
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,080
Third City Lord.

658
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,020
The Second City Lord is back.

659
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,480
Hanyi. Sit.

660
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,060
Hanyi. Who got rid of your demonic aura?

661
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,520
Wu Xin.

662
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,040
Why has he come back?

663
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,420
He wants to know who Ye Dingzhi met before he died.

664
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,340
Did you tell him?

665
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,840
My guess is his next destination is probably Tianqi City.

666
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,360
Should we inform Lanyue?

667
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,380
Don't worry, I'll see to it.

668
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,920
Come.

669
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,420
Well?

670
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,240
The old injury isn't fully healed.

671
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,420
The new injury sent her berserk.

672
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,520
She barely has any inner force left.

673
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,400
Hanyi. It might take longer

674
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,100
than three years to regain your strength as a sword deity.

675
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,400
You must be prepared.

676
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,220
From now on, don't return to Mount Cang.

677
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,260
Stay in Xueyue City.

678
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,860
- Sikong... 
 - Hey.

679
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,920
There is no room for discussion.

680
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,840
I wanted to ask how Xiao Jie and Xiao Chuhe were.

681
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,760
Qianluo sent a letter.

682
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,000
They are on their way to the celestial mountain in the sea

683
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,940
to find a cure for Xiao Chuhe's sickness.

684
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,560
Judging by the time, they should be arriving very soon.

685
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Do you know how much time we've spent on the sea?

686
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,640
No idea.

687
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,840
All I know is I've spent each day doing mostly nothing.

688
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,500
We'll reach Sanshe Island soon.

689
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,980
Already?

690
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,880
I calculated as much.

691
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,260
We'll soon part ways for some time.

692
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,140
I've invited you all to have a drink, consider it a farewell dinner.

693
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,780
When we leave this time, we might not come back alive.

694
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,060
Don't jinx yourself during a goodbye on the sea.

695
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,220
Young Master Mu.

696
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,960
You once took a slash from the Bearer of Sword for us.

697
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,440
Yes. He wanted to take you back just to make you a eunuch.

698
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,100
I couldn't tolerate that or bear it!

699
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,860
I lied.

700
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,780
- Xiao Se. 
 - Xiao Se!

701
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,900
It's fine.

702
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,540
Young Master Mu has helped us too many times along the way.

703
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:06,260
If he was put in harm's way for helping me,

704
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,220
I'd never forgive myself.

705
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,900
Does that mean you're a person of great status?

706
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,640
Your name is Xiao Se. Xiao...

707
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,960
You're from the imperial family?

708
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,400
Correct. I'm from the imperial family of Xiao.

709
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,340
My real name is Xiao Chuhe.

710
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,860
Xiao Chuhe?!

711
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,620
Prince Yong'an?!

712
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,880
- Do you have to overreacte? 
 - How can I not?

713
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,860
It's too late for you to get rid of us now.

714
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,220
You are the Prince Yong'an who accepted his punishment

715
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,340
and lost his title for defending Prince Langya?

716
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,460
The one who would rather wander the world than go back?

717
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Great! Wonderful!

718
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:59,830

719
