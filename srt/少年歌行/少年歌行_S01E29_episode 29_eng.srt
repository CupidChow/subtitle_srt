00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,140
♫  The blade dance causes ripples to spread across the lake  ♫

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,792
♫  Waving the banner admist the storm and rain  ♫

4
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,380
♫  The snow is not bothered by sadness or joy  ♫

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Blazing through the desert with the reins in hand  ♫

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  Young and inexperienced, it is apparent  ♫

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,380
♫  Noble aspirations met with recklessness  ♫

8
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,380
♫  No fear of fate's intricate design  ♫

00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,520
♫  Overcome all the obstacles that fate presents  ♫

♫  Through trials and hardship spawns vast courage  ♫

♫  We take everything as it comes  ♫

♫  The distant land might be dangerous  ♫

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,300
♫  But what's life without an adventure?  ♫

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,620
♫  The youth are supposed to dream big and be sharp  ♫

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,384
♫  Together, another journey awaits  ♫

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,120

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,419

24
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,860
I wasn't certain if I should agree.

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,404
I asked Marquis Lanyue, and he asked me to seek your opinion.

26
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,210
Who does he want you to treat?

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,780
According to him, it's a blind patient.

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,060
When he was young, he ate a snack he got from someone.

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,900
He lost his sight after that.

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,820
It's been 20 years. I'm uncertain if it can be cured.

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,360
Can you treat it?

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,570
If he hasn't been blind for long, I could remove the toxin with acupuncture.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,150
But he's been blind for 20 years.

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,530
Maybe he'll need to get a new pair of eyes.

35
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,860
Wait. Divine Healer, are you kidding?

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,304
A new pair of eyes?

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,660
Just one word, yes or no.

38
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,382
You're the healer.

39
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:34,530
Saving lives is your duty.

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,090
Besides, this person is wealthy.

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,110
He can afford the medical fee for sure.

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,710
So yes, you can treat him.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,040
Xiao Se.

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,352
But remember to say that it was I who asked you to treat him.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,380
You're good-looking but not intelligent.

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,990
You came to Snowfall Mountain Villa at night.

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,700
- Yet you wore an all-white outfit. 
 - Vermilion Bird?

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,760
You, Dark River, like to give yourselves code names and call others' code names?

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,210
I'm White Tiger.

50
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,540
White Tiger?

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,724
This name doesn't sound...

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Wait.

53
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,510
You're White Tiger?

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,354
What are you two doing?

55
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,960
Qianluo, stop.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,180
Why didn't you ask her to stop first?

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,240
Well, Ji Xue, stop.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,610
Are you giving me an order?

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
Both of you are very childish.

60
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,990
You're either surrounded by a silly child like Lei Wujie or an impulsive young lady like this.

61
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,454
Xiao Chuhe, is there no other ordinary guardian around you?

62
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,240
You could've come in through the front door.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,290
Why must you sneak in here? You can't blame anyone for this.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,860
Come in through the front door?

65
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,590
Do you know how many people in Tianqi City are having their eyes on this door?

66
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,270
As long as the misunderstanding is cleared up.

67
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,670
You must be the daughter of Bai Xiao Sect's head, Ji Ruofeng.

68
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,590
Finally, there's someone smart here.

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,380
Since you have a guest, we should leave first.

70
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,300
Her presence resembles that of an elegant soaring swan.

71
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,760
Gracefully, she moves like a dragon in flight.

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,060
Prettier than the autumn chrysanthemum. More vigorous than the pine in spring.

73
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,920
Mysterious as the moon covered by clouds.

74
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,300
Extraordinary as snow whirled by the driving wind.

75
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,200
What are you murmuring?

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,528
Miss, I'm the apprentice of Divine Healer Hua Jin, Mu Chunfeng.

77
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,270
I know.

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,638
I didn't know I was so famous.

80
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,540
But I don't know who you are.

81
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,140
Ji Xue.

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,710
I'm 21 years old.

83
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,510
How old are you? Are you married?

84
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,530
- I'm still single. 
 - See you around.

85
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,386
You should've inquired about her beforehand.

86
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,460
Qianluo.

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,440
Are those two close to each other?

88
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,488
It feels like she has an affinity for Xiao Se when she talks to him.

89
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,080
They've known each other since childhood.

90
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,580
Ji Xue's father is Xiao Se's master.

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,230
He is the closest person to Xiao Se in this world.

92
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,320
He's even closer to him than His Majesty is.

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,572
That's why it's different.

94
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,642
But he does act differently around you.

95
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,092
Does he?

96
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,640
Chunfeng, we should get going.

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,856
Master, let's stay a little longer.

98
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,510
Young Master Mu, is this Miss Ji Xue really that pretty?

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,400
Among the women in the world, I've never seen someone refined like her.

100
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,732
Her smile stands out among other ladies as if there's nothing.

101
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,318
Nothing?

102
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,750
Nothing.

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,580
- Let's go. 
 - Master, let's stay a little longer.

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,090
Just go.

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,220
How's the investigation going?

106
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,710
I've found the person you asked me to look for.

107
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,610
Where is he?

108
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,906
He's hiding in plain sight.

109
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,620

110
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,920

111
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,876
Long time no see, Boss Xiao.

112
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,120
You already knew that I'd come.

113
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,060
Bai Xiao Sect has been looking for me everywhere.

114
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,900
I can see that they're exhausted.

115
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,600
So I developed compassion and deliberately went downstairs to buy a vegetable bun.

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,320
This inn is a long street away from my Snowfall Mountain Villa.

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,580
Since you knew I sent someone for you, why didn't you come over sooner?

118
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,496
I would've like to try your royal banquet that contained 15 appetizers.

119
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:12,780
I would've also liked to see how commanding and majestic you were at Qianjin Gambling House.

120
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,420
Unfortunately, you hadn't entered the city before I went on the retreat.

121
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,792
You had already left when I finished the retreat.

122
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,620
Retreat?

123
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,016
Were you injured?

124
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,740
I nearly became a cripple.

126
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,860
Who did that to you?

127
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,888
Head Eunuch Jinxuan.

128
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,480
What's wrong?

129
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,704
Every time when you're in danger, I would be there and save you.

130
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:53,256
But when I was in danger, you didn't show up.

131
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,912
So you feel guilty and want to avenge me?

132
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,300
You were injured by Jinxuan because you entered the palace.

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,380
So I was right.

134
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,260
You came to Tianqi for Consort Xuan.

135
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,780
You've changed, Boss Xiao.

136
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,660
You've become straightforward.

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,420
You knew that I didn't want to talk about this.

138
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,760
You should've pretended not to know about it.

139
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,120
You shouldn't have underestimated those skilled fighters in the palace, especially the Five Eunuchs.

140
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,164
None of them is easy to deal with.

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,700
And there are many Imperial Swordsmen.

142
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,740
Even I have never met them before.

143
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,800
I understand. I'll be careful next time.

144
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,612
Next time?

145
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,960
Wu Xin,

146
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,448
as you're eager to see Consort Xuan,

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,164
are you trying to ask her questions or get her out of there?

148
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,952
Will she leave with me?

149
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,260
She lives an extravagant life in the palace.

150
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,888
Unlike Tian Wai Tian, it's actually an infertile land.

151
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,060
Your Highness, it's getting late.

152
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,080
It's time to rest.

153
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,340
Your Highness.

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,688
Why did Yu'er suddenly

155
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,188
mention Shi'er today?

156
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,212
Did he have news from Shi'er?

157
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,860
Maybe it was just an innocent question.

158
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,300
Don't mind it, Your Highness.

159
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Right.

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,448
It's been years.

161
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:53,464
Maybe Shi'er has already forgotten about me, his unfit mother.

162
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:58,756
What right do I have to see him again?

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,616
Actually, Consort Xuan is not what you thought she was.

164
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:07,132
She's an outcast in the palace.

165
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,448
She never attends any party,

166
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,900
and she doesn't interact with the people in the palace.

167
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,300
I remember when I was a child,

168
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,460
I once barged into her courtyard.

169
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,220
She gave me a piece of pastry and enjoyed the sky view with me all afternoon.

170
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,500
All afternoon?

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,632
She said it'd be nice if she could become a bird.

172
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:31,168
So that she could fly,

173
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:33,384
fly over the walls,

174
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,740
fly over the mountains,

175
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,224
and even fly to the far south.

176
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,120
South?

177
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,060
I didn't understand it when I was little.

178
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,408
I left after staying there all afternoon.

179
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:53,180
Until Imperial Uncle Langya told me about her story.

180
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,784
It made me wonder if the place Consort Xuan wanted to go

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,544
was the hut outside Gusu City.

182
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,092
After all, she and Ye Dingzhi have stayed there for a long time.

183
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,540
Also, it was where they gave birth to you.

184
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,500
You're saying that she actually has no choice?

185
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,632
I'm saying that this is your hardship.

186
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,540
You must take good care of yourself.

187
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,092
Everything I said is what I saw.

188
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,820
Forget it.

189
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,604
Actually, I also don't know why I want to see her.

190
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,660
Maybe I'm just wondering how she's doing now.

191
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,356
I'd like to ask her if she remembers that I'm her son.

192
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Or maybe I just want to see her one last time

193
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,780
before I go back.

194
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,452
Then, she can stay in Beili as Consort Xuan.

195
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,540
I'll return to Tian Wai Tian and be the Young Master.

196
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,780
I can't believe there's something you don't know.

197
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,772
Everyone has their own worries.

198
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:23,920
If you just want to see Consort Xuan, maybe I can help you.

199
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Or else, no one in Tianqi City can help you.

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,248
As expected, you care for me.

201
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,680
I just want you to solve your problems sooner.

202
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,104
And don't get me in trouble.

203
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,376
You speak with a forked tongue.

204
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,940
These are the fragrances I collected from everywhere.

205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,024
You are welcome to take them if you like.

206
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,540
Sixth Prince, why are you being so generous?

207
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,412
I'm flustered.

208
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,672
Just get to the point.

209
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
All right.

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,464
Eunuch, whose side are you on in the current Tianqi City?

211
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,164
Must I pick a side?

212
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,744
In this war, only the winning side can survive.

213
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:32,148
It's impossible to stay neutral in this matter.

214
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,580
Your Highness, you must be well aware that no matter whose side we're on,

215
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,099
if His Majesty dies, the Five Eunuchs will have to guard the mausoleum.

216
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,988
Are you willing to do it?

217
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,040
To me, it doesn't make any difference.

218
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,580
Even now,

219
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,140
all I do is just chant, pray, and blend fragrances.

220
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,132
The Blizzard Sword Shen Jingzhou that I know is not like this.

221
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:06,148
He used to yearn for the martial arts world.

222
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,000
Though I can't go around the world, it's more liberal than staying in Tianqi City.

223
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,332
Eunuch Jade Deity, I won't beat around the bush.

224
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:26,248
I can assure you that you can go anywhere you like after leaving Tianqi City.

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,136
In the name of Lord Yong'an?

226
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,980
It's in the name of Xiao Se.

227
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,108
As long as you believe that I can do it.

228
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,504
Why me?

229
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,140
When you entered the martial arts world, you claimed yourself as Blizzard Sword.

230
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,240
Your integrity showed when you swung your sword.

231
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,700
I believe in my judgment.

232
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,416
Please have faith in me and give me a helping hand.

233
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,139
Every time I walk in here, this is the sound I dislike hearing the most.

234
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,600
This means that you're conscious

235
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,920
and by my footsteps, you can figure out who I am.

236
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,688
You really are a strong woman.

237
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,960
Just like your pretty face.

238
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,852
I couldn't forget about it ever since the first time I met you.

239
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,748
I won't let you have your way.

240
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:48,932
Do you know how I convinced Minghou to be the drug tester?

241
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,052
I told him if he resisted, you'd forever be locked in here.

242
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:59,480
With the stinky smell of blood, the bodies of rats,

243
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,872
and the insects' bites, your body will slowly rot.

244
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,780
You vile man!

245
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,620
No. You've misunderstood me.

246
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,420
I was just helping him.

247
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,700
Minghou won't listen to you.

248
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,440
You're wrong. He agreed without hesitation.

249
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,660
But he got a low adaptive capacity.

250
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,680
We were only halfway there.

251
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,260
Unlike you,

252
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,388
you're way better than him.

253
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,420
Yueji, you were born to be a killer.

254
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,716
But a killer can't have a heart!

255
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,216
I've found a perfect weapon.

256
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,248
Soon, he'll become just like you.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,100
Yueji, you don't have much time left.

258
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,600

259
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,860
Stop!

260
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,400
Why are all of you entering the palace?

261
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,840
Eunuch Jade Deity wants to hold a Fragrance Ceremony for His Majesty.

262
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,120
These eunuchs will burn incense for each palace.

263
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,680
An assassin sneaked into the palace several days ago.

264
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,220
Those who enter the palace must undergo body searches.

265
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,400
How dare you!

266
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,900
Lingjun.

267
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,900
Eunuch.

268
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,320
This is His Majesty's decree.

269
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
Just let them check it.

270
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,440
- Thank you, Eunuch. 
 - Yes.

271
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,420
Wait.

272
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,140
Head Eunuch.

273
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,468
Why are you here so early today?

274
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,420
Old people need less sleep.

275
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,200
Sometimes, I can't sleep.

276
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
So I get up and walk around

277
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,780
in order to allow His Majesty to sleep peacefully.

278
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,508
Are they your new apprentices?

279
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
Yes.

280
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,644
They don't look familiar.

281
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,080
They just entered Hongqing Temple this year.

282
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,064
I think they're young but smart and agile.

283
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:50,980
They won't neglect their masters of each palace.

284
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,632
Is there any problem, Head Eunuch?

285
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,320
With you in charge, I'm at ease.

286
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,360
Go on.

287
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,900
Let's go.

288
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,780
Go to the palace you're assigned to.

289
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,860
Remember to be careful.

290
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,248
No mistake is allowed.

291
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:34,920
- Noted. 
 - Noted.

292
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,056
Consort Xuan's Jingtai Palace is at the northwest corner.

293
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,420
Thank you, Eunuch Jade Deity.

294
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,540
The palace gate will be closed at the hour of Xu. 
  (T/N: between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.)

295
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,932
- Leave before that. 
 - Understood.

296
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,640
Also, remember that it's me who brings you here.

297
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,420
Don't do anything illegal in here.

298
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,120
Otherwise, I'll bring you to His Majesty.

299
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,124
I understand.

300
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,824
You're so nagging it's annoying.

301
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,732
I don't know if I'm helping him

302
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,900
or getting him killed.

303
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,652

304
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,260
Your Highnesses, please go back.

305
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,580
His Majesty is not feeling well.

306
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,360
When His Majesty wants to see you, he'll ask me to inform you.

307
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,880
We just want to see our father. I can't believe it'd be this hard.

308
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,120
Please mind your words, Your Highness.

309
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,240
I'll excuse myself first.

310
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,284
If imperial father wants to see us, please let us know, Captain Li.

311
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:43,180
No problem, Your Highness.

312
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,200
Her Highness always burns incense and chants here.

313
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,060
Prepare everything. I'll ask Her Highness over.

314
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,240
Thank you.

Since you're here to burn incense, I'll count on you.

00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,250
Yes.

325
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,340
♫  Wandering around the world with you until the moon descends below the horizon  ♫

326
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,620
♫  Wish you spend the rest of your life with me  ♫

327
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:22,408
♫  My heart acts as a shield and protects you  ♫

328
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,252
Your Highness set up this prayer hall to eliminate karma

329
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:11,960
and accumulate good fortune for the person on the tablet?

330
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,080
How dare you!

331
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,800
Who gave you permission to ask this?

332
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,992
You're right.

333
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:23,580
You should put down the prayer beads and walk out of this hall.

334
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,040
Your Highness, this eunuch is getting outrageous.

335
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,740
Never mind.

336
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,916
Let him finish.

337
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,660
It's easy to chant.

338
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,780
The difficult part is to focus.

339
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,788
Staying focused is not as hard as forgoing the desire for love.

340
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,300
Your Highness is confused.

341
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,560
Why make things difficult for yourself?

342
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,780
You should let go of it sooner.

343
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,436
How do you know that I'm confused?

344
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,292
I knew it as soon as I entered the courtyard.

345
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,640
Was it because of the fallen leaves?

346
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,160
It was me who asked them not to clean it.

347
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,480
Leaf litter is a natural phenomenon.

348
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,740
It's unnecessary to dispose of them.

349
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,480
But why do you make this payer hall spotlessly clean?

350
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,950
What's the difference between the fallen leaves and the dirt?

351
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,116
What's your name?

352
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,360
Wu Xin.

353
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,084
Wu Xin?

354
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,700
Lift up your head.

355
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,720
Let me have a good look at you.

356
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,384
Your eyes look familiar.

357
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:52,516
It seems like fate brings us together.

358
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,016
You said your name is Wu Xin.

359
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,092
Who gave you that name?

360
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,396
My master did.

361
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:06,304
Master said one is clear-minded, selfless, and won't go astray

362
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,108
without a heart.

363
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:11,488
One will be free without a heart.

364
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,076
I guess you've got a good master.

365
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,720
He is the best master in the world.

366
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,704
Your Highness, Prince Chi is here to greet you.

367
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,208
You wait here.

368
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,460
Yes.

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Mother.

370
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,724
Why are you here so early?

371
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,240
I made you upset that day.

372
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,236
I felt sorry when I went back.

373
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:59,528
After greeting imperial father today, I rushed over to see you.

374
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,660
I know you don't like Eight Treasures Tea.

375
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,456
I asked someone to bring new tea leaves over from the outside.

376
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:09,320
You can try it. See if it fits your taste.

377
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,720
- I... 
 - Go brew it.

378
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,300
Who is he?

379
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,460
He's a eunuch from Hongqing Temple. He's here to burn incense for your father.

380
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,620
He came here early in the morning.

381
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,132
The figure of this eunuch looks familiar.

382
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,100
You've seen many people.

383
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,660
Maybe they just look alike.

384
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,040
You're right.

385
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,388
Go clean up the prayer hall.

386
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,460
Yes.

387
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,236
Please, Mother.

388
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
The color looks nice.

389
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,244
I guess it'll taste good.

390
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,560
It's nice.

391
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,261
Does Prince Chi always come to visit Consort Xuan?

392
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,340
He only came here often the past two days.

393
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,620
Sometimes, he doesn't show up for two weeks.

394
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,684
Has Consort Xuan always been alone like this?

395
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:58,460
She wasn't alone at first.

396
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,620
Back then, His Majesty always came to visit her.

397
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,884
She was frequently rewarded.

398
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,860
Then, something happened.

399
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,360
His Majesty never came again.

400
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,040
She got no further reward.

401
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,696
Over time, others have stopped coming too.

402
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,240
Consort Xuan doesn't like troubling others.

403
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,912
As they didn't come, she didn't go out.

404
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:22,324
I haven't seen her talking so much with someone else for years.

405
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,248
Imperial father has been troubled by a matter lately.

406
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,780
Do you want to know what it is?

407
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,664
I'm not interested in something that doesn't concern me.

408
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,248
What if it is about your other son?

409
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,224
Why do you mention him again?

410
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,940
Don't do anything rash.

411
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,040
I didn't say anything.

412
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,476
Why did you scold me?

413
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,480
I just want to remind you that you can play any trick you like to get what you want.

414
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,920
But there's someone that you can't lay a hand on.

415
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,748
Play any trick I like?

416
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,080
Mother, if it wasn't for the trouble you made out there,

417
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,780
why would I have to play tricks?

418
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,092
You used to be imperial father's favorite consort.

419
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,644
I was imperial father's favorite son.

420
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:29,772
I could've gotten everything I wanted.

421
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:34,900
If it wasn't for you and Ye Dingzhi, I wouldn't have ended up like this.

422
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,020
Over the years, I've been ridiculed, left out, and mocked.

423
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,100
What about you? You lived isolated.

424
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,076
What would you know?

425
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,536
But judging from your look,

426
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:58,316
it seems like you're still deeply in love with Ye Dingzhi.

427
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:02,944
Even his son is more important than me.

428
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,324
Well, I'll wait and see what will happen to you two.

429
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,328
Your Highness, do you want to go back and get some rest?

430
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,872
You must've heard about my story outside the palace.

431
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,908
It's all an urban legend.

432
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:50,900
I won't take it seriously.

433
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
Take a seat.

434
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

435
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,816
Tell me about it.

436
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,980
Your Highness

437
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,596
was married to His Majesty when he was still Prince Jingyu.

438
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,300
Then, you were set up and abducted by Ye Dingzhi, the Head of Demon Sect.

439
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,819
In the end, Demon Sect lost, and you successfully escaped.

440
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,312
Then you got rescued and returned to the palace.

441
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,500
Pretty much what I had expected.

442
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,220
It has protected his reputation as the Emperor.

443
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,628
Isn't this a fact?

444
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,096
Are you curious?

445
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:46,060
If you knew it, it might get you killed.

446
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:53,020
Everything I heard here at Jingtai Palace will stay here for sure.

447
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
In fact,

448
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,948
the rumor out there is mostly true.

449
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,280
Except for one thing.

450
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,556
I left with Ye Dingzhi of my own free will.

451
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,512
We only parted as we were set up by the bad guys.

452
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,072
They lied to me that Yu'er was severely ill.

453
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:25,844
They got me back to Tianqi City

454
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:31,496
and made Ye Dingzhi think that I abandoned him for an extravagant life.

455
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,936
Before he died, I finally got to see him.

456
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:39,220
I told him that we should escape to Nanjue

457
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,280
and get away from the disputes.

458
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,320
He said he did many wrong things.

459
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,836
He couldn't leave just like that.

460
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,128
Only his death can protect his peers.

461
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,520
In the end,

462
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,860
he committed suicide.

463
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,880
So, what you wanted to say to him, in the end, was to leave with him?

464
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,588
But it was too late.

465
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,352
The wrong step I took was the reason that everything happened.

466
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,100
Then, why did you return to the palace?

467
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,772
I have two children.

468
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:30,208
One of them was trapped in the palace.

469
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,020
I couldn't leave him behind.

470
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,844
So you gave up on the other one.

471
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,200
Xiao Ruojin wouldn't make things difficult for my other son

472
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,048
only if I returned to the palace.

473
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:52,840
The imperial family always attaches great importance to their reputation.

474
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,060
If I came back, he would keep his promise.

475
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,624
Now, that son of mine has gone to the coldest land.

476
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,440
But I'll soon leave this place.

477
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,480
Unknowingly, I've told you a lot of things.

478
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,680
Maybe it's because you look a lot like him.

479
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,740
Ye Dingzhi, the Grand Master of Demon Sect?

480
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,792
His eyes looked as pretty as yours.

481
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:42,028
I suppose my child is about your age.

482
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,228
What is your child's name?

483
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,836
His name is Ye Anshi.

484
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,584
It's a good name.

485
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,788
I think those few years were the happiest in my life.

486
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:09,156
It was also the first time I found the world likable.

487
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:12,716
That's why I gave him this name.

488
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,668
I see.

489
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,264
Tell me about you.

490
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,180
What about you?

491
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,220
Wu Xin, tell me about you.

492
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,608
About me?

493
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,660
Yes.

494
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,340
Where are you from?

495
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,468
Where did you grow up?

496
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:38,468
How did you come to Tianqi City?

497
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,768
I lived in chaos before I met my master.

498
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,424
But I was happy.

499
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:52,080
In my memory, there were my mother, father,

500
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,500
and...

501
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,932
many uncles who loved me.

502
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,636
But then they passed away.

503
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,600
I was lucky to meet my master.

504
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,160
We lived together and relied on one another.

505
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,140
Then, my master also passed away.

506
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,300
After that, I've been through ups and downs.

507
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,720
Eventually, I came to Tianqi City.

508
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,992
I didn't expect you to experience so much at such a young age.

509
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,140
Your Highness, are you tired?

510
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,224
Don't call me that.

511
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,472
I don't like being called by this title.

512
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,040
Wu Xin, you may leave first.

513
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,300
Talk to me some other time.

514
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,724
But there's not much time left.

515
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,452
I'll leave here soon.

516
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,180
Consort Xuan?

517
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,880
Consort Xuan?

518
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,300
Mother?

519
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,572
Xiao Yu, this jerk!

520
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,952

521
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,240
What are you thinking?

522
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,200
Wu Xin should be in the palace now.

523
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,180
Wu Xin?

524
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,900
You've found him?

525
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,900
He has entered the palace once before.

526
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,200
But he was injured by Jinxuan.

527
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,740
He's been recuperating lately.

528
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,940
I went to Jade Deity a few days ago.

529
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,200
I asked him to get Wu Xin into the palace.

530
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,348
Did he want to see his mother?

531
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,056
But this is too risky.

532
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:11,572
The Wu Xin I know is the smartest person I've ever met.

533
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,060
He won't do something silly.

534
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,640
Everyone would.

535
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,120
It's when they encounter the person and the matter they care about the most.

536
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,140
Keep an ear out for the news from the palace.

537
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,440
Sure.

538
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,980
Xiao Yu, why would you poison your own mother?

539
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,484
So what?

540
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,000
Anyway, the poison won't kill her.

541
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,760
Besides, you're here to remove the toxin from her body.

542
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,928
She'll be all right.

543
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:49,240
This is the Toxin-Reversing Technique of Medicine Valley.

544
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,440
When you mobilized qi to remove the toxin,

545
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,684
the toxin has already been transferred to your body.

546
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,660
Then, why did you do this?

547
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,876
It's all because of you, my dear brother.

548
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:24,196
You're a martial arts expert, and you're smart.

549
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:29,252
What kind of situation can make you let your guard down?

550
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,599
It's a great honor to have the Head of Bai Xiao Sect here

551
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,624
to deliver messages to me every time.

552
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,800
Many people are keeping an eye on Prince Yong'an's Residence.

553
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,680
Without martial arts, I wouldn't have gotten in here.

554
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,080
This is for you.

555
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,020
This is the name list you want.

556
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,000
The toxin-making experts who entered Tianqi City and haven't left in the course of the year.

557
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,140
As expected of the Bai Xiao Sect.

558
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,480
There are seven people from the Tang Clan, 13 people from the Wen family,

559
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,480
three people from the Five Poisons Clan, four people from Liusan Sect,

560
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,380
and some small sects.

561
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,040
I don't know which one you're looking for.

562
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,932
Ghost Physician, Night Crow?

563
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,400
I knew this name would catch your eye first.

564
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,428
Hasn't this person disappeared for a long time?

565
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,480
The three experts in Medicine Valley were Medicine King Xin Baicao,

566
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,680
Divine Healer Bian Suchen, and Ghost Physician Night Crow.

567
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,140
Ghost Physician Night Crow was the youngest among them.

568
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,820
But the medicine she used was the strangest among them.

569
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,420
And because of this, she studied secret techniques

570
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,100
and was evicted from the sect.

571
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,060
Then, it was said that the medicine backfired on her, and she died from it.

572
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,732
But Bai Xiao Sect found her whereabouts in Tianqi about six months ago.

573
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:47,360
Where is she now?

574
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,837
Do you know why her name is Night Crow?

575
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:53,440
Besides being a drug expert, her lightness technique is excellent as well.

576
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,660
We lost track of her.

577
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,812
So her current whereabouts are still unknown.

578
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:01,952
We must tell Hua Jin about this.

579
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,176
Are you sure it's her?

580
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:06,864
Medicine King Xin Baicao once said

581
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,512
that only an heir of Medicine Valley can render

582
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,724
another heir of Medicine Valley helpless.

583
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,168

584
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,484
Great.

585
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,728
I finally got my perfect creation.

586
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:08,080

587
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,900
♫  The temple is extremely quiet  ♫

588
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,280
