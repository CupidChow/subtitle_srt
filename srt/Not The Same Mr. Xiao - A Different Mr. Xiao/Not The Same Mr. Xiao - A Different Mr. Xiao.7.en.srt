What do you know about love?

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,900
You don't learn well.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,979
You damaged the power system.

Can you afford the compensation?

00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,940

There are no vacancies for the hospital consultation or campus tour,

You can choose this restaurant when you order takeout.

I was signing up for the public welfare week.

That's my last chance to get extra credits.

it was a disaster.

If I can't sign up for the public welfare week,

I can't get enough credits.

If I don't have enough credits, I can't take the internship exam.

Can't you tell the teacher of the Teaching Affairs Office

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,230
to give me a chance to learn?

59

Why would I do that?

60
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,650
Because you promised Grandpa to take care of my study.

61

Besides,

62
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,900

Why?

159

Because Song Yiju is like a bomb,

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,610
and we don't know when she will explode.

161

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,010
This is the only thing Professor Song asked me to do.

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,670
I can't just leave Song Yiju alone, right?

166
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,490
We are different now.

Although adding one more place

169
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,930
is not a big deal,

170
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,810
it still has changed her fate.

171
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,230
Have you forgotten

172
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,470

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,120
to tell them you are a highly skilled doctor.

347
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,690
What are you thinking?

348
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,220
I didn't.

349
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,390
I really don't know him.

350
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,790
You don't know him? Look how he acted.

351
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,510
I don't.

352
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,970
Fine.

353
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,750
I'll pretend you didn't come today.

354
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,200
Senior.

355
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,620
Please give me another chance.

356
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,770
I really need the credits.

357
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,030
Otherwise, I can't be an intern.

358
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,430
Senior.

359
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,850
It's true.

360
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,920
Want an ice lolly?

361
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,600
Who on earth are you?

362
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,430
Well. I'm sorry.

363
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,840
Actually, my plan was not...

364
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,620
Forget it.

365
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,290
Even without you,

366
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,770
I would be wasting time there.

367
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,460
It's also my fault. I'm not skilled.

368
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,590
I'll take it as a favor.

369
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,860
Are you thanking me?

370
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Treat me to dinner then.

371
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,160
Let me see what to eat.

372
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,240
How about

373
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
introducing a doctor to you

374
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,450
to do a thorough examination?

375
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,210
Mr. Xiao.

376
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,700
You are not getting changed, right?

377
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,530
If not, I'm coming in.

378
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,410
I'm coming in.

379
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,280
Didn't you participate in the public welfare week?

380
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,380
What are you doing here?

381
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,480
The public welfare week.

382
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,350
I can do charity everywhere, right?

383
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,330
It doesn't matter.

384
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,610
What matters is

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,140
the small teapots specially made by Orange.

386
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,690
Don't you love drinking tea the most?

387
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,860
They suit you a lot.

388
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,670
There is something else.

389
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm sure you'll love it.

390
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,000
Game CDs

391
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,520
with blue-ray quality.

392
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,290
They are the final editions. I bought them through a foreign friend

393
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,700
who I haven't contacted for years.

394
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,800
Just get to the point.

395
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,780
This is really not necessary.

396
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,750
What you said sounds like I'm a snob.

397
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,740
I'm just

398
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,440
a little unfamiliar

399
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,950
on the way to be kind.

400
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,570
But

401
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,300
I'll be familiar the next time.

402
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,680
Are you touched?

403
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,010
No.

404
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,190
What's wrong?

405
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,070
You don't like them?

406
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,260
If there's nothing else,

407
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,430
I'm getting off work.

408
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't. Don't.

409
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,590
There is something.

410
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,310
I participated in the public welfare week today.

411
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,390
I was working hard.

412
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,770
But suddenly a child came.

413
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,210
I don't know if he's sick.

414
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,400
Maybe he's really sick.

415
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Anyway, I think

416
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,010
there is something wrong with his brain.

417
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,500
Then,

418
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,010
there was

419
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,620
some misunderstanding.

420
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,020
So, can I

421
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,090
do charity

422
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,040
in the hospital?

423
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,430
No, no way.

424
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,110
Please. Just take me as free labor force.

425
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,210
I can do anything.

426
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,210
Look at me.

427
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,380
You can't even do a good job in the public welfare week.

428
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,900
Do you think it's easy to work in the hospital?

429
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,830
Mr. Xiao.

430
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,260
A patient wants to give up treatment.

431
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,690
Giving up treatment?

432
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,330
Mr. Xiao,

433
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,520
please get me discharged.

434
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,460
Your condition is not optimistic.

435
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,240
If you want to be discharged,

436
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,850
maybe

437
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,920
you'll die in a few days.

438
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,140
I know.

439
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,650
Did your family agree?

440
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,920
You are my patient now.

441
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,480
I need to be responsible for your condition.

442
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,650
If

443
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,970
you insist on giving up treatment,

444
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,420
your family must give us a notification.

445
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,590
We have no right

446
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,700
to make this decision for you.

447
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,200
Really?

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,890
Okay.

449
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,360
Have a good rest.

450
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,900
Call me

451
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,260
if anything happens.

452
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,010
If Zhang Jilong makes such an unreasonable request again,

453
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,180
just refuse him.

454
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,130
No need to tell me.

455
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,170
Okay.

456
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,290
Well...

457
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,580
Why did you refuse him without asking why?

458
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,520
Is the reason important?

459
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,940
Of course.

460
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,110
How could a person

461
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,910
just give up treatment for no reason?

462
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,590
The hospitalization expenses are high.

463
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,770
He's not confident. He doesn't want to receive treatment anymore.

464
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,210
There are so many reasons.

465
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,990
Should I ask him one by one?

466
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,990
Do you know

467
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,930
what his reason is?

468
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,110
It's none of your business.

469
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,390
Obviously, that man wanted to say something just now.

470
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,050
Don't turn him down so quickly.

471
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,950
How about

472
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,370
hearing his thoughts?

473
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,750
I'm a doctor who saves people.

474
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,830
If I agree to give up his life,

475
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,950
do I still deserve to be a doctor?

476
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,060
And

477
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,500
his request only shows his irresponsibility

478
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,860
for himself and his family.

479
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,770
Has he ever thought about how painful

480
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,120
it would be for his family to lose him?

481
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,680
Family members' thoughts are important,

482
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,410
but aren't the patient's thoughts more important?

483
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,200
If everyone

484
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,760
can give up their lives easily,

485
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,360
what are doctors needed for?

486
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,570
You don't even have the basic professional quality.

487
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Go home early.

488
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,260
What did I say wrong?

489
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:19,420
[The Way of Being a Man and Doing Things]

490
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,150
Mr. Zhang.

491
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,680
Uncle Zhang.

492
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,790
Have some fruits.

493
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,180
Miss.

494
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,480
Who are you?

495
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,640
I...

496
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,500
I'm a medical student who will graduate soon.

497
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,970
I'm not that capable,

498
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,430
but you can tell me if you have any questions.

499
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,840
My grandpa is a highly skilled doctor.

500
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,940
Even if Hua Tuo was alive,

501
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,690
he couldn't cure me.

502
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,610
I know it.

503
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,150
They say on the Internet

504
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,310
if

505
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,720
a doctor practicing traditional Chinese medicine asks you to go to a doctor practicing western medicine,

506
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,740
it means you need a major surgery.

507
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,860
If a doctor practicing western medicine asks you to go to a doctor practicing traditional Chinese medicine,

508
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
it means you can't be cured. Right?

509
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,620
That's not quite true.

510
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,180
Western medicine has quick effect.

511
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,720
Traditional Chinese medicine

512
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,830
focuses on both internal and external adjustments.

513
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,340
It addresses both symptoms and root causes.

514
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,430
Look.

515
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,820
I've become a specimen.

516
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,570
The cancer

517
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,270
has spread all over my body.

518
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,390
Actually,

519
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,740
I've accepted it in my heart long ago.

520
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,850
But there's one thing

521
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,170
that I can't let go.

522
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,880
What is it?

523
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,320
Miss.

524
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,570
In fact, I'm not local here.

525
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,430
I've been away from my hometown for decades.

526
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,410
I have never gone back.

527
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,040
When my parents passed away,

528
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,570
I didn't go back either.

529
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,820
I'm unfilial.

530
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,820
Falling leaves return to their roots.

531
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,470
I know I'm being supported

532
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,890
by the medicine of the hospital

533
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,070
in my last days.

534
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,080
But I

535
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,090
don't want to

536
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,510
die in a foreign land.

537
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,690
So

538
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,510
you want to give up treatment

539
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,840
and go back to your hometown?

540
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,880
This is also my last wish.

541
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,680
I also want to go back to visit my parents,

542
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,610
so that

543
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,920
when we meet in heaven.

544
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,680
they won't blame me.

545
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,310
I'll help you.

546
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,980
Why did you go to the ward?

547
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,780
I...

548
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,950
I just wanted to

549
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,210
know a little...

550
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,060
Don't disturb the patients.

551
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
The hospital is not a place for you to mess around.

552
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,890
I didn't.

553
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,830
You know nothing.

554
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,070
Uncle Zhang's business

555
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,240
is my business now.

556
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,460
What?

557
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,140
Listen.

558
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,430
Illness is not just about diseases.

559
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,290
Mental anguish is also a disease that can't be easily cured.

560
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,900
You don't even want to listen to the patient's thoughts.

561
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,690
What kind of good doctor are you?

562
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,410
I don't want to waste my time on you.

563
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:55,440
[You should seek freedom.]

564
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,440
♫Farewell day is a special day♫

565
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,000
♫Farewell makes a day special♫

566
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,820
♫In ordinary times, at street corners♫

567
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,270
♫The one awaited doesn't appear♫

568
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,890
♫Like a derailed shooting star♫

♫Descends inexplicably and then disappears suddenly♫

570
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,650
♫Afterward, endure a period of neglect♫

571
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,810
♫Can you chase after it in the light?♫

572
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,910
♫Today I forgot again♫

573
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,870
♫The emptiness in my chest♫

♫Where has the heart fallen?♫

♫The appearance of others♫
