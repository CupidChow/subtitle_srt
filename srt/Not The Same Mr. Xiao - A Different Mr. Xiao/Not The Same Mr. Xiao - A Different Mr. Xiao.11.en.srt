Oh no.

173
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,780
Oh no.

174
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,660
Get off.

175
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,660
Hey, what's wrong with you?

176
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,170
Get off.

177
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,220
Why did you slam on the brakes?

178
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,180
What...

179
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,980
What a coincidence.

180
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,300
Did you make it look like a coincidence?

181
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,180
No, no.

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,220
We're going to see Big Orange.

183
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,100
I'm afraid she's in danger.

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,540
You can't even find a better excuse.

185
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,660
She's an adult. How could she be in danger?

186
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,300
Well, you don't know what happened.

187
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,980
She was framed in the campus.

188
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,780
They said she secretly changed academic records

189
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,980
and is in a relationship...

190
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,980
in a relationship

191
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,260
with her teacher.

192
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,460
Song Yiju?

193
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,180
Hm.

194
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,380
Well. You really...

195
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,340
I was in a hurry.

196
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,860
And you slammed on the brakes.

197
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,500
You...

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,500
Hello, Jinquan.

199
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,100
A fool hit my car.

200
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,180
Come and get my car.

201
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,700
Well.

202
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,850
If you...

203
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,900
If you

204
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,860
didn't call me a fool, I can...

205
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,220
Well. This is my car.

206
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,580
And it can only accommodate two people.

207
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,620
If you get in...

208
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,660
You two leave.

209
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,220
I can only take a taxi.

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,100
Well. You can drive my car.

211
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,620
Li what?

212
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,420
Madam, what?

213
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,260
Are you serious?

214
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
We are dating. Why do you care?

215
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,660
Does your girlfriend know

216
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,420
what you did to Song Yiju?

217
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,820
What did I do?

218
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,020
Where is the evidence?

219
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,180
Do you have proof?

220
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,220
Besides,

221
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,380
my doubt is reasonable.

222
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,340
Anyway, the college

223
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,780
has established an investigation team.

224
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,020
How do you know I don't have proof?

225
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,540
I was there the whole time that day.

226
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,500
Everything that happened has been recorded clearly.

227
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,220
Even if Song Yiju can't clear her name,

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,420
you can't get away with it.

229
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,140
I wonder whether it will have an impact on your internship

230
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,380
if these videos and photos are uploaded.

231
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,180
Sister.

232
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,220
I just locked her in the classroom

233
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
and let her admit that she played tricks.

234
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,820
I didn't do anything

235
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,740
to hurt her.

236
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,220
You forced her to confess to false charges.

237
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,740
Song Yiju gained an advantage through her connections first.

238
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,020
We were just upholding justice.

239
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,020
That's right.

240
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,900
You took those photos, right?

241
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,100
And you wrote the note in the locker, right?

242
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,930
Orange recognized your handwriting.

243
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,300
But she didn't report you.

244
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,940
So what?

245
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,130
Stop pretending.

246
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,660
If she's really kind,

247
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,100
give me back the place.

248
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,820
That's right.

249
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,460
Have you record it?

250
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes.

251
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,260
I got the evidence.

252
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
You tricked...

253
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,180
me.

254
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,060
The world is dangerous.

255
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,540
I just taught you a lesson.

256
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,820
I know you still have power.

257
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Don't play dead.

258
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,660
If you want to waste time, I'll accompany you.

259
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,180
I know you still have power.

260
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,220
And you just drank cola?

261
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,740
Three.

262
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,900
Two.

263
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Show yourself.

264
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,260
I'm just a robot without any strength.

265
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Right.

266
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,980
You've learned to change results.

267
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

268
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,620
It's exciting,

269
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,180
amazing,

270
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,580
and...

271
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Exciting!

272
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,300
Do you know what you did?

273
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,860
What did I do?

274
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,020
I just changed Song Yiju's academic records.

275
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,460
Isn't that a good thing?

276
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,620
If she passes the exams, she can start her internship

277
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,420
and graduate successfully.

278
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,100
And you will also have more time and energy.

279
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,420
It's a win-win situation, right?

280
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,180
And you are blaming me.

281
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,100
If it can be solved by changing her academic records,

282
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,290
why did I bother to be her tutor?

283
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,380
Because you are bored.

284
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,980
Considering Song Yiju's ability,

285
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,780
you think she can take the fifth place of the college?

286
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,420
The whole college is talking about it.

287
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,890
We don't know what will happen.

288
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,060
Do you think you did it without anyone noticing?

289
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,180
Did... Did

290
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
someone find out?

291
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,180
Why did you play dead if you are not afraid?

292
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,820
Just wait.

293
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,060
Wait for what?

294
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,340
Wait for someone to arrest me?

295
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,140
Xiao Jing. Xiao Jing. Help me.

296
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't want to be arrested by the people of the Time Management Bureau.

297
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,620
I don't want to be formatted.

298
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,700
Thank you for today, Ouyang.

299
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm going to face the difficulties alone.

300
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,060
Let me accompany you.

301
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,540
No need.

302
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,020
I've caused you enough trouble today.

303
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,580
Besides, who am I?

304
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,180
I'm not afraid of him.

305
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,780
Then come on.

306
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,620
Then I...

307
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,610
Come on.

308
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,820
I believe you.

A handsome man and a beautiful woman

368
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,980
are lovesick.

369
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,460
Is this really something

370
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,580
a robot can see?

371
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,940
Hey.

372
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,380
Are you in love with Song Yiju?

373
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,740
Since when?

374
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,100
Since

375
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,100
you moved into her house?

376
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,140
Or since you became her tutor?

377
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,820
Or...

378
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,500
Why are you so gossipy as a robot?

379
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,420
A robot should be gossipy.

380
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,380
Robots need to know more information.

381
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,260
Hey, don't go.

382
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,340
Let me out!

383
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,380
Hey!

384
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,820
Song Yiju. What are you thinking about?

385
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,340
That hug

386
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,940
just...

387
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,900
What? You've started to use reduplicated words.

388
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
Although he's a man,

389
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,500
you bent your arm

390
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,380
around Mr. Smart

391
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,220
and Ouyang Yu's shoulders.

392
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,340
Right?

393
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,780
So you can't take it seriously.

394
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,900
Although Xiao Jing is getting more handsome

395
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,020
and considerate...

396
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,420
Stay sober!

397
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,260
What are you thinking about?

398
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Xiao Jing is a devil.

399
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,380
This time,

400
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,300
he just

401
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,980
felt guilty.

402
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,460
So the hug just now

403
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,340
was

404
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,460
to express his apology.

405
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,380
Right.

406
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,620
A little care

407
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,900
and comfort.

408
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,820
That's right.

409
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,420

411
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,380

K?

413
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
Where are you?

414
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
I'm so worried.

415
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,220
At home.

416
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,130
Is Mr. Xiao also at home?

417
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
Don't mention him to me.

418
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,780
What's wrong?

419
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,460
What happened between you two again?

420
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,260
What?

421
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,100
Nothing.

422
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,940
That's good.

423
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,140
Right.

424
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,340
I've sent you the questions and answers.

425
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Don't care too much about it.

426
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,220
Don't worry.

427
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,410
I just want to check my answers

428
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,980
and see how many points I can get.

429
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,140
Hm.

430
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,100
Tell me if you have anything on your mind.

431
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:45,980
OK.

432
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,260
Bye.

433
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm checking now.

[Comprehensive Ability (Traditional Chinese Medicine) Test Questions]

435
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,620
She didn't tell you again?

436
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,540
Why is she always like this?

437
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,780
She never tells us about sad things.

438
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,460
Luckily, I know her best.

439
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,020
Otherwise, she would be desperate, right?

440
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,820
Right.

441
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,340
The classmates spoke ill of her,

442
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
but she just put up with it.

443
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,020
Even I couldn't stand it.

444
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,210
She didn't tell me when I asked her about Mr. Xiao just now.

445
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,860
Looks like Mr. Xiao really hurt her this time.

446
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,780
Do you think

447
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,140
she is crying in her bed?

448
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,820
No way.

450
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,060
Your smile is a bit creepy.

Otherwise, Li Xinghe wouldn't have admitted it even if we beat him to death.

From today on,

I will

let go of our grudges.

467
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,100
I won't.

468
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,740
Hey.

469
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,180
What's wrong with you?

470
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,660
I...

471
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,780
Can't you just do that considering what I did?

472
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,860
What

473
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,900
did you two do?

474
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,620
Something like this.

475
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,500
We...

476
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,660

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,380
good friends.

478
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,100
Good friends.

479
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,500
Come on. Drink. Drink.

480
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,380
Come on.

481
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,580
What?

482
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Are you sure

483
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,850
you want to give up your place for internship?

484
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,500
Yes.

485
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,740
No matter why

486
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,500
my name is on the intern list,

487
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
it's true that

488
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,820
I don't deserve it.

489
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,300
After I checked my answers,

490
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,780
I don't think I can get such good results.

491
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,260
So

492
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,700
this opportunity should be

493
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,780
given to future doctors

494
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,980
who need it

495
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,900
and who are needed by patients.

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,620
Where is he going?

497
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
He resigned.

498
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,740
-He resigned?
-Look.

499
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,260

[Wanye College of Traditional Chinese Medicine]

502
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
made a statement

503
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,180
about yesterday's rumored grade cheating

504
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,940
in the Internship Qualification Exam

505
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,540
involving Song Yiju, a student of Year 2019.

506
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,330
Mr. Xiao Jing said...

507
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,900
The rumor is not true.

508
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,140
I made a huge mistake

509
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,340
when I input the grades.

510
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,410
That's why Miss Song's grades

511
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,740
don't match her real grades.

512
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,020
I made a big mistake,

513
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,770

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,820
And it's strobilanthes dyeriana.

684
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,580
Let me see.

685
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,340
I've always wanted to get a batch of reduced ones to try the color.

686
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,620
Did you make all the pigments

687
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,340
by yourself?

688
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,260
Yes.

689
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,100
I like studying these.

690
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,020
Every time I make a unique color,

691
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,180
I feel very accomplished.

692
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,180
I haven't seen you drawing.

693
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,180
You never wanted to talk about this with me.

694
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,340
Besides,

695
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
you are not interested in drawing, right?

696
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,900
Hm.

697
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:49,860
Well.

698
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,700
I suddenly became interested.

699
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,420
Actually,

700
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,810
I like a cartoonist a lot from your era.

701
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,780
But

702
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,300
I can't find her anywhere.

703
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,460
Every time I was on a mission back then,

704
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,100
I liked reading her creations.

705
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,300
You said "from your era".

706
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,180
It sounds like

707
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,020
you're not from this era.

708
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,020
What's her name?

709
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
I'll help you ask around.

710
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,060
Smile Like Spring.

711
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,340
Do you know her?

712
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,060
Smile Like Spring.

713
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,180
Never heard of her.

714
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,940
If I don't know her,

715
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,420
she's definitely not famous.

716
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,180
♫I wonder if there is a way♫

717
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,460
♫To let me gradually get closer to him♫

718
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,150
♫Should I pretend that I don't care at all?♫

719
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,850
♫Looking at the book in my hands and lowering my head♫

720
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,910
♫Oh right, he can play guitar and let me think♫

721
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,960
♫I learned a song and let him accompany me with music♫

722
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,030
♫Want to ask him about weekend plans♫

723
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,100
♫Facing him, I become tongue-tied♫

724
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,540
♫Afraid he might reject me♫

725
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,970
♫I cried my heart out by myself♫

726
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,130
♫No, I've been listening to hip-hop recently♫

727
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,130
♫Being cool is just a façade♫

728
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,130
♫Actually, I can't help it♫

729
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,030
♫Hiding my love for you♫

730
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,080
♫I want to know if what you said is from your heart, so agree♫

731
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,580
♫Otherwise, I can't focus on class♫

732
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,950
♫Give me a surprise quickly, don't always give me blind boxes to open♫

733
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,910
♫I searched for clues to get closer to you♫

734
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,620
♫The hints are too subtle, and I can't contact you♫

735
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,940
♫I received a message, waiting for your response♫

736
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,600
♫I know I'm thinking of you, and you're thinking of me too♫

737
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,750
♫We have a telepathic connection but can't express it♫

738
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,920
♫I want to see you but I'm afraid my classmates might see♫

739
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,890
♫If I stand farther, I can't see your face clearly♫

740
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,920
♫I wish every day could be Sunday♫

741
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,940
♫Holding hands forever♫

742
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,140
♫First, ask for your willingness♫

743
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,510
♫Don't worry because it will always be sunny♫

744
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,610
♫My smile will make it happen♫

745
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,600
♫Take you to the horizon line in the geography book♫

746
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,640
♫Accompany you throughout my life♫

747
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,280
♫Hey, you are so serious♫

748
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,910
♫I'm almost distracted, looking silly♫
