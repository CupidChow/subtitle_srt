Whoa.

24
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,310
You have all the ingredients.

25
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,470
What are you cooking?

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,630
Chinese herbal chicken soup with lotus seeds.

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,190
Do you need my help?

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,100
No need.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,150
You go rest first.

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,580
Just wait until the meal is ready.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,990
If there is anything you can't find,

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,860
just tell me.

33
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,900
It's so easy to get it.

34
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,840
Looks like we're destined to leave tomorrow.

35
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,840
Make me spicy strips.

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
They said it's the taste that the people of this generation can't forget.

37
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,550
Tomorrow,

38
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,610
if he asks me to lead the investor team,

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
I won't be able to leave.

40
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,780
So I have to lead the college team.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,760
But Song Yiju is in the college team.

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,730
Aren't you afraid?

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,830
As long as I put the pawn

44
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,850
where she should be,

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,010

[Episode 5]

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
As a boss,

48
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,170
you don't even know the name of your staff.

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,440
Mr. Shen,

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,790
you're being too perfunctory.

51
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,079
Oh?

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,640
Her name is Song Yiju, right?

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Shen.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,590
Boss.

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,770
I got the information.

56
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,160
Her name is Song Yiju.

57
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,170
I know.

58
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,970
Grandpa.

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,579
Hm. Orange. You are back.

60
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,030
Look at you.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,650
You are not sitting properly.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
Stand up and do some exercise

63
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,960
to refresh yourself.

64
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,060
Grandpa.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,060
I have a reason to doubt that

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,970
the teacher is trying every means to trick us.

67
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,560
We're going to the base tomorrow.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,300
And we were asked to write a report.

69
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,110
Grandpa.

70
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,240
Do you think this is reasonable?

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,450
Why not?

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,010
My base

73
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,020
is a very good place.

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,620
You can't learn it even if you go there several times.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,230
Of course.

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,570
There must be treasure

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,370
in this base.

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,050
Otherwise, why would they want to go there?

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,930
Especially Xiao Jing.

80
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,430
Oh my!

81
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,470
Grandpa.

82
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,330
You can see him?

83
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,590
I'm old.

84
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,700
But I'm not blind.

85
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,300
Who told you to speak ill of him behind his back?

86
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,700
You must have a guilty conscience, right?

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,110
Wash your hands and eat.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,290
Jing has got the meal ready.

89
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,060
No way. So...

90
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,570
After lunch,

91
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,380
we will go to The Ritz-Carlton Spa with Miss Weiwei.

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,090
And dinner will be at Huai's Cuisine.

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,700
We will enjoy a show at Today's World Theater.

94
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,490
In the end, we will drink in a bar.

95
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,030
No need to follow me. I'll go by myself.

96
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,659
Silly.

97
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,010
Do you think you're inviting a wolf into your house?

98
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,530
I think you are.

99
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,440
Don't be stubborn.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,320
A new waiter?

101
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,390
A new boss.

102
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,740
I am the boss.

103
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,080
I gotta go.

104
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
I have an important client, and...

[Song Yiju]

106
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,040
Who is Song Yiju?

107
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,410
One of

108
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,300
my fans.

109
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,040
Her taste is not good.

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
The authentic British style.

111
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,540
Just like my bar.

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,790
You don't even know where...

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,250
She knows this place better than me?

114
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,510
Why are you here?

115
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,320
You have achieved your goal, right?

116
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,260
What happened before was a misunderstanding.

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,360
I really want to help you.

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,470
Is there anything

119
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,650
that can make me trust you now?

120
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,080
It's for mutual benefits.

121
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,090
If you tell your grandpa

122
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,200
to let me lead the college team during tomorrow's visit,

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll make a list of the key points of the report for you.

124
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,000
What do you think?

125
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,490
Since you don't like social engagement,

126
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,640
why don't you

127
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
just write the report for me?

128
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,650
Forget it if you don't agree.

129
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,060
I think

130
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,560
investors are not as troublesome as you.

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,370
Jing.

132
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,780
Do you need help?

133
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,680
No, it's done.

134
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,370
Right.

135
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,020
Okay.

136
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,020
Think about it.

137
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,920
Come on.

138
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,090
Orange.

139
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,040
Come and try the soup made by Jing.

140
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,520
Grandpa.

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,530
Will you be at the base tomorrow?

142
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,130
Yes.

143
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,530
But there will be a teacher leading us, right?

144
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,920
Of course.

145
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,240
You should listen carefully tomorrow.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,020
This will be good for

147
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,930
your internship in the future.

148
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,840
Is it Miss Yang that will lead us and explain to us?

149
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,590
I think she's so nice.

150
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,790
She's so considerate, gentle, and thoughtful.

151
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,780
Orange.

152
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,120
Have some soup.

153
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,400
Why is it so bitter? Is it Poison?

154
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,060
Jing specially made

155
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,530
this chicken soup with lotus seeds.

156
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,200
You should drink two bowls now

157
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,220
to reduce your internal heat.

158
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,030
Eat.

159
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,740
Okay.

160
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,860
Then

161
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,640
what will Brother Dong do tomorrow?

162
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,630
I'm thinking

163
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,040
if I should ask him to lead the investors.

164
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,430
You students will be noisy

165
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,780
if you go there.

166
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,640
He might not be able to handle you guys.

167
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,750
How come?

168
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,730
We are so obedient.

169
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,540
We're not noisy.

170
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,350
Song Yiju.

171
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,080
I think you should finish the soup.

172
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,030
It's good for your brain.

173
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,990
Grandpa.

Take the medicine since you are awake.

It's too bitter. I don't want to drink it.
