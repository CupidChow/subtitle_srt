00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,100
Orange.

173
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,020
Your extreme training is so effective.

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,180
Look at your result.

175
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,180
On your left.

176
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,300
The left.

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,060
More to the left.

178
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,270
[3 Gu Xiaoxiao]

179
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,220
Xiaoxiao.

180
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,100
You only got the third place?

181
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,420
Look at yours.

182
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,550
[5 Song Yiju]

183
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm the fifth.

184
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,300
Great.

185
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,100
I didn't expect that I have such potential for studying.

186
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,900
Yes.

187
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,620
Aren't you always at the bottom?

188
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,860
Guys, let me say something fair.

189
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,140
You don't know

190
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,540
her grandpa is our externally contracted professor.

191
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,290
I see, no wonder.

192
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,380
How could she manipulate the internship exam?

193
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,420
That's too much.

194
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,180
This is how it should be.

195
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,340
Your result this time

196
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,540
is very important.

197
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,900
Yes.

198
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,460
Who did you say cheated?

199
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,540
Xiao, let's go.

200
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,980
Let's go hold a meeting.

201
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,460
That's the truth.

202
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,900
Look, Xu Ling ranked 51st.

203
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,980
Her grades are usually much better than yours.

204
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,090
For this exam,

205
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,820
she prepared for an entire semester.

206
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,020
How could she not be as good as you?

207
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,860
That's right.

208
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,900
They'll only choose 50 students for the internship.

209
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,380
If you get the position through connections,

210
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,820
you're going to take up our spots.

211
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,420
Yeah.

212
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,780
You're really something.

213
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,180
Studying has its techniques.

214
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,580
If you have my notes,

215
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,820
I believe you will do better.

216
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
You've also dropped from No.1 to No.3.

217
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,420
We don't talk to petty people. Let's go.

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,100
I got it through hard work.

219
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,340
Move aside.

220
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,820
-Why are you leaving?
-Don't go.

221
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,970
You feeling guilty?

222
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,340
Orange, stop thinking about it.

223
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,020
Ignore those who envy you.

224
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,900
Our little Orange is a good person.

225
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,780
If a person's good, they'll be lucky from time to time.

226
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,980
But I think

227
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,940
what they said makes sense.

228
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,380
I've only been studying for a few days.

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,420
How could I have such a good result?

230
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,900
My accuracy is too high.

231
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,850

232
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,620
It's okay, Xiaoxiao.

233
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,260
I'm not afraid of them.

234
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,380
Song Yiju.

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,740
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,580
Was it because of me?

237
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,140
It has nothing to do with you.

238
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
You don't have to apologize to me.

239
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,460
Maybe they thought

240
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
it was not fair

241
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,220
for me.

242
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,100
That's why...

243
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,660
We're speaking according to our scores.

244
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,420
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

245
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,260
You're right.

246
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,140
I didn't do well this time.

247
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,700
Orange, don't mind what they said.

248
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,020
Wait.

249
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,220
Open the door for me.

250
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Use the back door.

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,220
Don't you like the back door?

252
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,380
You're the one who likes the back door.

253
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Let me in and talk face to face if you dare.

254
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,140
Talk about what?

255
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,100
Everyone...

256
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,860
Let's go.

257
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,980
Hey, you...

258
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
What do you want?

259
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,860
I'm sorry

260
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,500
for what happened last time.

261
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,300
I acted on impulse.

262
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,620
Art is an act of impulse.

263
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,940
Thank you for giving support to our art.

264
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,220
But

265
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,620
maybe I'm not the one you should apologize to,

266
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,220
it's Song Yiju.

267
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,140
You may think painting

268
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,540
is very simple.

269
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,260
But I know

270
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,020
how much hard work she put into it.

271
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,980
If she gives up painting

272
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,820
because of you,

273
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,380
I don't think you'd also want

274
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,620
to see such a thing happen.

275
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,460
You drew all of them?

276
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,700
It's her.

277
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,180
Does she still draw now?

278
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,340
She has rejected my studio's invitation.

279
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,300
Artists

280
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,500
are sensitive

281
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,940
and fragile.

282
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,780
Orange, I'm going to work.

283
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,100
Come find me later.

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,140
Open the door.

287

Come on.

288
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,020
Just confess.

289
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,780
I'll open it for you if you do.

290
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,690
Did you manipulate the results of the exam?

291
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,700
I didn't do anything. Why should I admit it?

292
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,380
Stop pretending.

293
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,180
Everyone knows.

294
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,660
Tell us,

295
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,730
then we'll open the door and let you out.

296
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,340
Open the door!

297
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Are you angry?

298
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,540
Hey.

299
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,100
Don't go.

300
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
I told you, if you confess,

301
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,540
I'll unlock the door and let you out.

302
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,260
Hey, don't go.

303

Come here, okay?

304
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,780
Come here.

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,500
Childish.

307
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,250
Don't go.

308
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,420
Song Yiju?

309
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,220
Hey, you two.

310
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,650
Who is this?

311
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,060
Let's go.

312
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,300
Do you know him?

313
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,900
Yes.

314
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,900
This is my...

315

classmate.

316
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,180
Did you hear that?

317
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,580
She said you are her classmate.

318
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,220
Is this how you treat your classmate?

319
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,540
No, miss.

320
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,580
You don't know what happened in our school.

321
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,010
She manipulated the exam two days ago.

322
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,140
Do you have evidence?

323
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,340
Hand it in if you do.

324
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Don't do something so cowardly.

325
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
No, we're not...

Let's go.

327
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,060
This way.

328
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,020
This is the most

329
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,620
high-quality milk tea of our school.

330
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,340
Why are you so timid in school?

331
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,020
Well,

332
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,740
the boys in our school like

333
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,340
playing pranks.

334
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,300
Was that a prank? That was...

335
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,060
It was nothing.

336
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,450
What brings you here?

337
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,580
I...

338
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,940
I...

339
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,820
I'm just asking if you're still painting.

340
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,820
Recently...

341
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,300
I stopped.

342
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,460
Why?

343
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,700

If it weren't for you,

Actually,

358
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
you should have told me clearly at the bar,

359
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,100
then there wouldn't be so many misunderstandings.

360

No.

♫The one awaited doesn't appear♫

517
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,440
♫Like a derailed shooting star♫

518
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,699
♫Descends inexplicably and then disappears suddenly♫

519
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,199
♫Afterward, endure a period of neglect♫

520
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,370
♫Can you chase after it in the light?♫

521
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,460
♫Today I forgot again♫

522
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,420
♫The emptiness in my chest♫

523
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,989
♫Where has the heart fallen?♫

524
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:50,210
♫I can only imitate with all my strength♫

525
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,139
♫The appearance of others♫

526
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,870
♫Trying to smile in the same way♫

527
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,910
♫If at the exit♫

528
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,870
♫You're waiting♫

529
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,580
♫If I had compromised at the time♫
