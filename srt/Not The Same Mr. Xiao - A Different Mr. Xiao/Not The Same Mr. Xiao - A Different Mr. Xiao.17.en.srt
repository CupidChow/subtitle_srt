I'd better go to the canteen for breakfast.

Take it. You'll be fine after taking it.

515
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,610
The rain is really...

516
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,340
Professor Song, you are ready so soon?

517
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,020
Yes.

518
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,350
-Then let's go now.
-Let's go.

519
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,180
-Okay.
-Let's go.

520
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,820
Let's go now.

521
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,900
Hurry.

522
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,620
Get on the bus.

523
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,380
The adenophora tetraphylla we received last year

524
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,100
was quite good.

525
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,820
Yes.

526
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,090
The villagers speak highly of

527
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,980
Professor Song's idea.

528
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,420
It has increased the output.

529
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,380
In addition, the ecological system

530
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,020
can help improve quality.

531
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,300
Not really. Man proposes, God disposes.

532
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,460
There is always a way.

533
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,020
That's why we invited you here to help us.

534
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,420
I'm going to answer the call.

535
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,340
Hello? Who is it?

536
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,820
What?

537
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,460
Is there anyone trapped?

538
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,620
Did you ask for help and call the police?

539
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay, I'll be right there.

540
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,980
What's wrong, Secretary Liu?

541
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,900
A mudslide occurred

542
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,380
at the existing warehouses in our town.

543
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
Professor Song. I have to be there now.

544
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,020
A mudslide? Any casualties?

545
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,260
The villagers are cleaning up the road.

546
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,380
They haven't arrived at the scene yet.

547
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,860
They don't know about the situation.

548
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,860
What about the medical team?

549
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,220
The roads over there are blocked.

550
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,420
They can only take a detour from here.

551
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,180
They probably haven't arrived yet.

552
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,260
Let's go there too.

553
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,220
We're doctors after all.

554
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,260
Professor Song.

555
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,980
Thank you so much.

556
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,090
It's my duty.

557
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,220
Let's go to the scene.

558
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,400
[Spec]

559
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,300
Emergency news.

560
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,540
At 3 p.m.,

561
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,660
a mudslide occurred in Shaohe County.

562
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,380
The local rescue team went to the scene immediately.

563
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,300
And medical teams there also went there for emergency rescue.

564
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,340
You played a pivotal role this time.

565
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,860
You haven't experienced this, have you?

566
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,620
Back then, your parents

567
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,820
had this kind of experience every day.

568
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,300
Professor Song.

569
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,220
The rescue team will be here soon.

570
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,300
Get ready to evacuate.

571
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,020
Okay.

572
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,340
Let's pack up and get ready to leave.

573
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,060
Okay.

574
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,220
Professor Song, thank you.

575
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,140
It's my duty.

576
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,820
This way, please. Be careful.

577
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,660
Okay.

578
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,780
After you go back,

579
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,730
what

580
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,300
are you going to do?

581
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,380
After I go back,

582
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm going to rest.

583
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,180
Do you

584
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,380
want to enjoy fireworks with me?
