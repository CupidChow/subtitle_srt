00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,100
Boyfriend?

175
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,980
Straighten your leg.

176
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,010
Yes.

177
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Lean more on me.

178
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,100
Like this?

179
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,900
Yes.

180
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,860
OK.

181
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,900
We're almost there.

182
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,500
I need support.

183
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
Here we are.

184
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,820
I need support.

185
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,060
The doctor said

186
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,620
your leg

187
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,900
needs to be elevated a bit.

188
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,860
This will help reduce swelling.

189
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,100
One more layer.

190
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,660
No, no, no.

191
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,460
How about this?

192
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,420
Have a rest. I'll clean up your room.

193
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,460
Have a seat.

194
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
Don't bother.

195
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,980
Just send me home.

196
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
I have a professional doctor at home.

197
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,820
It's not troublesome.

198
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,300
You have to trouble someone anyway.

199
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,540
Why don't you trouble me?

200
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,660
And you have to change your dressing tomorrow, right?

201
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,580
But it's bothering you too much.

202
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,700
Tell people you're safe.

203
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,300
How do you know I want to use a phone?

204
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
599374.

205
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,620
You don't know numbers?

206
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,260
I don't remember a single phone number.

207
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,220
Do you remember your phone number?

208
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,700
Yes.

209
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,970
I can log to WeChat.

210
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,260
WeChat.

211
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,410
[Verification code]

212
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
A verification code is required.

213
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,820
Log in via your password.

214
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,150
[Wrong account or password. Please fill it out again.]

215
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,540
I don't remember my password either.

216
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,420
I'd better go tidy up your room.

217
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,250
Where is she?

218
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,620
Did you find her?

219
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,260
Don't worry. She's not seriously injured.

220
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,620
Her boyfriend took good care of her.

221
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Who took Song Yiju away?

222
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,100
Slowly.

223
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,100
OK.

224
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,220
If you're bored,

225
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,540
you can draw here.

226
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,580
I can help you with your theme.

227
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,460
No need.

228
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,300
I've decided on

229
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,420
my theme.

230
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,020
You have?

231
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,780
It's profound,

232
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,900
philosophical

233
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,250
and classy.

234
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,180
OK, I won't ask anymore.

235
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,140
I'll wait for Miss Song's work to amaze me.

236
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,860
You draw here. I'm going to the supermarket.

237
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,020
What do you want to eat?

238
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,740
I want to go too.

239
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,700
With your leg like this,

240
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,180
if you don't take a wheelchair,

241
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,700
you want to jump there?

242
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,660
I'll figure out a way.

243
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,060
Is this your plan?

244
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,700
Plans change all the time with Song Yiju.

245
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,690
Hey.

246
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,780
Slow down.

247
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,500
This way.

248
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,980
Hold tight.

249
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,620
Stop.

250
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,180
Are you scared?

251
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,420
If so, let me pull you.

252
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,700
No.

253
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,450
In that case, you would be like a dog pulling a plow.

254
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,340
I'm just a little unfamiliar.

255
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,980
Let me get used to it.

256
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,180
If I master the technique,

257
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,420
I can be your helm.

258
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,020
Let's go slowly this time.

259
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,060
Let's go.

260
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,619
Go!

261
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,819
Left. Left. Left.

262
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,050
Left.

263
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,260
This way.

264
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,620
Hello?

265
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,500
Dr. Xiao.

266
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,540
The base needs you. Please come back soon.

267
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,700
Got it.

268
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,790
[Time Knows the Taste]

269
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,620
Hey, why did you jump the queue?

270
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,100
We've been waiting for a long time.

271
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,280
Line up.

272
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,390
Young man.

273
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,020
Sorry to keep you waiting, Orange.

274
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,580
Slowly.

275
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,620
With so many shops around here,

276
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,780
why did you choose to line up at this one?

277
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,620
You know nothing about the power of the old brand.

278
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
I'll show you how powerful it is later.

279
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,540
So amazing?

280
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,740
Of course.

281
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,260
Be careful.

282
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,610
Why should I work overtime with you?

283
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,980
I promised to accompany my boyfriend today.

284
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,650
If your love can last for a long time,

285
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,220
you don't need to be together all the time.

286
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,100
What do you know?

287
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,980
Long-lasting love is formed

288
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,620
by every day and every moment.

289
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,900
That's just what women think.

290
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,820
Do boys like to be together all the time?

291
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,100
Why not?

292
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,900
Dr. Xiao.

293
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,930
Dr. Xiao.

294
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,620
Do boys also need company when they're in love?

295
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,460
Dr. Xiao, you must have been busy in the hospital today.

296
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,060
Sorry.

297
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,780
It's OK. Hurry up and organize.

298
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,140
Dr. Xiao, since you're here,

299
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,580
I won't bother you here.

300
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,340
I'll go back now. Thank you. Bye.

301
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,670
Bye.

302
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,060
You're still up?

303
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,780
I can't digest the meal from the old brand yet.

304
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,020
Listen to the doctor and rest early.

305
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,580
Well.

306
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,380
Leave me alone.

307
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,860
Go and get some rest.

308
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm leaving.

309
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,060
I'll bring you breakfast tomorrow morning.

310
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,900
Don't stay up late.

311
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,140
Where are you going?

312
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,900
We're both single.

313
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,660
Now we're in the same room.

314
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,420
Beneath the seducing moonlight,

315
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,340
the gentle breeze blows...

316
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,500
Fine.

317
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,380
Go out and rest.

318
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,300
Speed up.

319
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Bye.

320
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
I'll bring you delicious food tomorrow morning.

321
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,340
OK.

322
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,980
Smart.

323
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,580
Did you go shopping again?

324
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,580
Look at our business when you have time.

325
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,020
We're about to close down.

326
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

327
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,580
Uh?

328
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,420
I have quite a big business.

329
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,580
What's the big deal about buying these?

330
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,620
To me, it's like a drop in the bucket

331
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,020
or the tip of the iceberg.

332
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,300
Close down?

333
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,700
Bro, I mean

334
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,660
if it doesn't work, you should tell me in advance

335
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,820
so that I can find a new job.

336
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,300
Otherwise, my girlfriend will feel uneasy.

337
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
Your girlfriend?

338
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,020
Who?

339
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,220
The online friend from last time.

340
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,780
You two are together?

341
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,060
We love each other very much.

342
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,220
Well,

343
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,380
how did you confess your love?

344
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,540
I was passive.

345
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,100
But I did my best.

346
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,700
