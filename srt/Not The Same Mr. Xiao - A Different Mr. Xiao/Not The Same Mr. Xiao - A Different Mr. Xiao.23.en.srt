Yes.

want to give her a grand proposal ceremony.

348
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,300
Oh.

349
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,460
So I want you

350
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,460
to help me.

351
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,500
If you help me,

352
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,300
you'll have somewhere to go during the daytime.

353
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,020
And

354
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,700
you'll have more time to visit your grandpa.

355
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,460
So

356
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,180
it's a win-win situation, right?

357
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,860
But now,

358
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,220
I don't want to witness other people's love.

359

Orange's grandpa is hospitalized.

She went to take care of her grandpa.

363

Grandpa is hospitalized?

364
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,100
Is this the time to stare at the computer now?

365
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,940
You should go find Song Yiju.

366
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,860
When you went to the hospital just now,

367
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,580
Professor Song said she left long ago.

368
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,660
But she didn't come to work.

369
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,900
Where did she go?

370
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,340
Aren't you worried?

371
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,540
Maybe

372
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,700
she wants to be alone.

373
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,940
If I knew you are this kind of person,

374
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,130
I should have stayed in the factory.

375
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,060
You leave when a girl says no.

376
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,220
You clap your hands when a girl blames herself.

377
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Since you are so noble,

378
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,980
why haven't you become a time-space manager?

379
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,420
Then what do you want me to do?

380
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,780
How should I explain to her?

381
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,220
No matter what I say,

382
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,140
it would be an excuse to her.

383
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,580
I did come here for Dioscorea nipponica Makino.

384
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,380
She should

385
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,820
blame me.

386
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,060
Back then, I told you

387
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,860
she should be with Ouyang Yu.

388

There are more than ten days left.

Aren't you going to find Song Yiju?

393
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,100
Won't you regret it?

394
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,580
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,980
It's not the opening hours.

396
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,660
Why did you come here?

397
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Are you here to ask me to change the medicine for you?

398
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,740
You just won't give me a break even I have asked for a leave.

399
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,850
Didn't Xiaoxiao change it for you?

400
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,660
She changed it for me. And I took the medicine.

401
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,340
That's why I know you are here.

402
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,140

403

am fine.

405

Now,

people already know that you're sad.

410
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,210
Don't worry about Grandpa.

411
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,700
Just wait until we know the results of the comprehensive examination.

412
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,740
If you are worried now,

413
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,500
but eventually, you find out that Grandpa is healthy,

414
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,900
you would be worried for nothing.

Why can't I do anything right?

689
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,210
We must find him.

690
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,660
I want to see him alive

691
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,420
or dead.

692
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,380
On August 15,

693
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,340
the fruit is ripe.

694
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,820
There is a crack in time.

695
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,370
This method is practical.

696
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,300
Dioscorea nipponica Makino

697
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,780
has been cultivated successfully.

698
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,060
Why are you here?

699
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,980
Bro...

700
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,380
Sir.

701
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,980
You are here.

702
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,420
Orange

703
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820
has left?

704
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,460
She just left.

705
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,850
She went to get my medical examination report.

706
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,900
I'm discharged today.

707
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,300
Let's go home together.

708
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,540
Okay.

709
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,140
Let me do it.

710
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:54,860
Okay.

711
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,580
The doctor said she got the medical examination report long ago.

712
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,580
Where did she go?

713
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,260
I'll go find her.

714
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,660
Sir.

715
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,020
Don't worry.

716
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,260
You just got discharged.

717
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,700
I'll ask someone to take you home.

718
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,540
I'll go find her.

719
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,220
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

720
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,090
Did Orange contact you?

721
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,820
No. What happened?

722
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,980
Okay. I know.

723
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,780
Mr. Xiao.

724
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,780
Did you see Orange?

725
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,540
No.

726
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,740
I've searched everywhere.

727
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,580
But I still couldn't find her.

728
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,460
[Dong Yunfeng: Come to Zhongtang Building.]

729
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,420
Move.

730
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,180
Let go!

731
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,220
Let go!

732
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,140
Don't do anything stupid.

733
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,620
Don't move.

734
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,410
Ask your grandpa

735
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,300
to take Dioscorea nipponica Makino here.

736
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,140
Impossible.

737
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,260
Speak.

738
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,220
Speak.

739
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,810
Speak.

740
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,180
Do you want to die?

741
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,300
Get down!

742
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,660
Down!

743

Don't come over!

745
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,820
Xiao Jing.

746
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,860
I'll throw her down if you come any closer.

747
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,860
Calm down.

748
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,030
-Xiao Jing.
-Calm down?

749

Dong Yunfeng.

750
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,980
Isn't this what you want?

751
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,340
I'll give it to you.

752
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,460
Give it to me.

753
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,500
Give it to me.

754
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,220
Don't give it to him.

755
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:05,950
Don't.

756
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,620
Orange!
