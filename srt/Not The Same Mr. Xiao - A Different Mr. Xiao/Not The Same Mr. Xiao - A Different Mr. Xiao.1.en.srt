Yes.

343
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,820
I learned a lot.

344
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,050
That's good.

345
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,700
How is the sketch I asked you to design last time?

346
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,360
What sketch?

347
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh. It's almost done.

348
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,190
I'll show it to you later.

349
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,880
OK.

350
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,900
Let's go to the base the day after tomorrow

351
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,030
to check the growth of Dioscorea nipponica Makino.

352
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,760
Okay.

353
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,570
Aren't you the supervisor of the exam in the college this afternoon?

354
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,770
Just go.

355
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,490
Okay.

356
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,130
Keep an eye on Little Orange for me.

357
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,500
Don't let her cause trouble again.

358
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,460
Okay.

359
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,450
You have 90 minutes.

360
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,390
You are not allowed to submit the paper in the first 70 minutes.

361
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,490
This make-up exam is very important.

362
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,670
I hope you can take it seriously.

363
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,130
Here, Song Yiju.

364
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,830
Put away everything unnecessary.

365
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,200
Of course they are necessary.

366
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,260
Just do your exam paper.

367
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,550
Why is there someone there?

368
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,120
Is she going to jump?

369
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,970
What is she doing?

370
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,020
Calm down.

371
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,890
Sorry.

372
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,710
Why are you doing this again?

373
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,040
Great.

374
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,420
The exam...

375
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,490
Your grandpa will scold you again, right?

376
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,010
What must be

377
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,330
must be.

378
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,500
There is nothing I can do.

379
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,890
You used your secret signal to communicate with Mr. Xiao, right?

380
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,770
Yes.

381
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,190
I'm also wondering.

382
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,170
I told him the secret signal several days ago.

383
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,190
He knew, and I warned him.

384
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,510
I didn't expect to be fooled by his kind appearance.

385
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,010
I let my guard down.

386
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,370
Oh no.

387
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,690
[Xinya]

388
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,360
Nice

389
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,570
figure.

390
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,700
You still haven't updated

391
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,210
the information on that woman?

392
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,340
You can't blame her.

393
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,730
Even in 2223,

394
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,060
there are people who don't surf the Internet.

395
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,370
I'm blaming you.

396
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,830
Your hands are clumsy?

397
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,850
You're not dressed yet?

398
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,390
Since you saw, you should go out.

399
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,440
Fine. I don't want to talk about this now.

400
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,390
Let's talk about my thing first.

401
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm sorry.

402
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,480
What happened today

403
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,080
was purely an accident.

404
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,630
I really didn't mean it.

405
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,250
You are generous.

406
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,830
Please forgive me.

407
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,880
Hm.

408
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,570
Okay.

409
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,700
I've apologized.

410
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,060
Let's talk about my thing now.

411
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,700
What is this?

412
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,810
What is this?

413
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,410
And what is this?

414
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,250
An eraser.

415
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,180
Then this

416
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,600
is just a normal box of colored pens?

417
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,860
What else could it be?

418
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,870
This represents A, this represents B, this represents C, and this represents D.

419
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,780
Blue represents 5-45g from light to dark.

420
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,840
Green represents 50g-450g from light to dark.

421
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,490
This represents ginseng. This represents rhino horn.

422
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,070
This represents sword beans. This represents rheum officinale. This represents pseudo-ginseng.

423
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,510
You don't know? Are you stupid?

424
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,540
I haven't started to know these yet.

425
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,510
You are doing this on purpose.

426
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,670
You are not Xiao Jing.

427
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,880
Who on earth

428
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,220
are you?

429
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,750
♫Farewell day is a special day♫

430
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:55,310
♫Farewell makes a day special♫

00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:01,130
♫In ordinary times, at street corners♫

♫The one awaited doesn't appear♫

♫Can you chase after it in the light?♫

437
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,210
♫Today I forgot again♫
