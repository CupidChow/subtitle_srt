00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
Come with me.

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,500
Okay.

176
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,780
Don't worry.

177
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
You transformed

178
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,100
the greenhouse, right?

179
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,020
Yes.

180
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,380
Did you let anyone intervene?

181
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,100
Actually,

182
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,260
I found something was wrong

183
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,900
when you sent the seeds and soil back.

184
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,660
Then I checked the process,

185
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,060
from Dong Yunfeng's packaging and delivery,

186
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,100
to Liang Xueyan's receiving the package,

187
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,820
and to Yang Jingyi's making an inventory.

188
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,780
Every one of them

189
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,900
is not very satisfactory.

190
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,500
When I told you last time,

191
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,580
you also confirmed

192
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,940
the scrappage is within the acceptable range.

193
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,460
There's a case today.

194
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,890
They suspect that the patient was poisoned by Dioscorea nipponica Makino.

195
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,650
[Clinic Medical Record of Xinya Hospital The food poisoning is caused by Dioscorea nipponica Makino.]

196
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,700
Dioscorea nipponica Makino is not mature.

197
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,180
How could the patient be poisoned by it?

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,020
The only seedling

199
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,490
still needs at least three weeks to grow.

200
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,300
Unless...

201
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,980
Unless

202
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,860
someone violated the rules to accelerate its growth

203
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,060
and didn't dry it.

204
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,220
And the toxin was used clinically

205
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,340
before being stabilized.

206
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,660
So

207
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
who do you suspect?

208
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,540
I watched them grow.

209
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,420
I don't want to suspect any of them.

210
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,740
Orange.

211
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,460
Don't just stand here and be anxious.

212
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,580
Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao.

213
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,460
Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao.

214
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,460
What should I do?

215
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,740
Do you think Grandpa has found out I'm in a relationship with Xiao Jing?

216
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,140
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

217
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
I just want to do this step by step

218
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,220
and tell you some of it every day.

219
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,940
I was worried that you can't accept it.

220
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,060
Do you think

221
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,140
Grandpa will kick Xiao Jing out of the hospital?

222
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,820
No, no, no.

223
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,340
After all, Xiao Jing got admitted by himself.

224
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,460
Do you think

225
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,180
Grandpa will use his power on this matter?

226
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,570
No, no, no.

227
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,220
Do you think

228
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,820
Grandpa will kick Xiao Jing out of their research team?

229
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,700
Xiao Jing cares about it so much.

230
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,660
What should I do?

231
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,180
Then tell me...

232
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,980
Orange.

233
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,700
Stop worrying about it.

234
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,060
Professor Song likes Mr. Xiao so much.

235
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Even if he finds out,

236
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,620
you're the one who'll get fired.

237
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,340
Grandpa.

238
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,340
I was wrong.

239
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,580
What did you do wrong again?

240
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,980
I...

241
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,140
I didn't...

242
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,060
I didn't study hard.

243
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,100
I feel like an idiot

244
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,700
when I can't think of the knowledge needed.

245
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,020
I really want to be an intern in the hospital.

246
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,860
Grandpa, please don't fire me.

247
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,940
Let me walk you out.

248
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,420
Okay.

249
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,500
What's wrong?

250
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,140
Dong.

251
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,540
You did the analysis of the nutrient solution and nutrient soil

252
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,619
for me last weekend.

253
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,780
Did you give it to me this morning?

254
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,980
I just went out.

255
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
I forgot to give it to you.

256
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,540
-Here.
-Great.

257
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
I need to put it in the archive now.

258
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,700
Otherwise, I can't find it again.

259
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,940
What now?

260
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,420
I lost my key.

261
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,460
What are you looking for?

262
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,780
I lost the key of the archive.

263
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,220
Use mine first.

264
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,820
Thanks.

265
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,860
Why does she always lose things?

266
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,820
I'm used to it.

267
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,780
Aren't you used to it?

268
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,860
Are you getting off work?

269
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,780
Yes.

270
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,860
I need to go to the base.

271
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,220
You can get off work too.

272
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,660
I'll go with you.

273
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,020
You'd better not go to the base recently.

274
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,620
It's inconvenient.

275
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,020
Go there later.

276
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,860
You promised to go on a date with me.

277
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,500
Now you won't even let me go to the base.

278
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,740
I've played at the base for 20 years.

279
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,980
What's inconvenient?

280
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,420
Hello, Jingyi.

281
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,540
Wait for me.

282
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,380
I'll be right there.

283
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,380
So you have an appointment with Miss Yang.

284
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,580
"I'll be right there."

285
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,500
"Wait for me."

286
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,340
Keep acting.

287
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,180
Is it

288
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,460
because I just hit you?

289
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,220
Let me see. Come on.

290
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,250
It's okay.

291
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,380
Is this

292
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,180
a gunshot wound?

293
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,700
Why are you so paranoid?

294
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,380
A few days ago, I was accidentally poked by a reinforcing steel bar

295
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,540
when I was transforming the greenhouse.

296
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,860
That's why I don't want you to go to the base.

297
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,820
So

298
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,660
because I hit you just now,

299
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,460
you experienced wound dehiscence,

300
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,100
right?

301
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,260
No.

302
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,460
It'll heal soon.

303
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,580
Don't worry.

304
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,380
Then don't go to the base.

305
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,620
There are so many of them.

306
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,420
I believe someone can help do your work.

307
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,420
Brother Dong has been working with Grandpa for so many years.

308
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,780
I'm sure he knows everything.

309
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,300
I'll call him and ask for a leave for you.

310
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,940
Don't.

311
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,060
Professor Song has a new project.

312
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,260
He just gave it to me.

313
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,820
This is my chance.

314
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,820
Be good. Just go home.

315
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,660
After I finish the work at the base,

316
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,980
I'll come to you

317
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,250
if it's still early.

318
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,940
No.

319
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,820
Go home and rest

320
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,620
after you finish the work at the base.

321
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Okay?

322
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,540
Are you feeling better?

323
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Then one more time.

324
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,100
It hurts again.

325
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,420
Stop lying to me.

326
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,660
Does it hurt?

327
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,100
Let me blow on it for you.

328
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,820
Get lost.

329
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,700
I told you your healing capability is not as good as before.

330
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,540
And you're still acting tough.

331
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,940
Look at you. You were poked through.

332
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,490
You should also be careful these days.

333
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,700
Don't let Orange notice anything.

334
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,900
I don't want her

335
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,540
to be sad so early.

336
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,340
What is missing?

337
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,020
Mr. Xiao, you're finally here.

338
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,500
I think my key of the archive is missing.

339
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,140
When I put files in the archive,

340
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,180
I found that the manual was gone too.

341
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,370
[Experimental Archival Record]

342
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,900
How many people have a key

343
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,820
of this archive?

344
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,620
Liang Xueyan and I.

345
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,460
I came to work overtime last weekend.

346
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,020
And I have never seen my key

347
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,620
since that.

348
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,460
Was Liang Xueyan here last weekend?

349
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,340
Liang never works overtime.

350
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,500
She goes on a date every weekend.

351
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,020
Dong and I were the only ones working overtime last weekend.

352
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,580
Professor Song also came to plant some flowers.

353
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,780
Which one should I buy for him?

354
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,620
There are so many things for lazy guys.

355
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,900
Who ordered takeout for me?

356
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,580
Well.

357
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,460
It's in the middle of the night.

358
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,060
Why didn't you knock on the front door? Are you pretending to be a spider man?

359
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,960
Shush.

360
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,300
Keep your voice down.

361
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,500
Don't disturb Grandpa.

362
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,580
Just say it.

363
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,060
Come downstairs.

364
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,580
I want to discuss something with you.

365
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,700
What is it?

366
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,740
I want to discuss something with you.

367
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,780
Can you come downstairs and go to my bar?

368
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,060
Then let's discuss something.

369
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,540
I have no money.

370
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,100
Haha. Seriously?

371
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
When did you ever have money?

372
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,130
Come downstairs now.

373
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,060
Please.

374
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,180
Please.

375
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,620
Wait there.

376
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,700
I'm coming.

377
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,420
Let's go.

378
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,140
From what you know about Wei,

379
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,740
should I make the proposal

380
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,060
warm

381
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,980
or grand?

382
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,620
Indeed,

383
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,660
adults' love

384
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,500
starts with action.

385
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,740
I'm charming.

386
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,300
In my opinion,

387
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,340
Wei is not an ordinary woman.

388
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,860
Who is she?

389
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,620
Who?

390
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,860
The lady of the Wei family.

391
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,660
A lady.

392
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,140
What does she want?

393
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,540
Grandeur, momentum,

394
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
and dignity.

395
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,820
Dignity. Yes.

396
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,220
Listen.

397
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,140
Start with

398
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,340
trivial matters first.

399
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,140
Trivial matters.

400
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,460
Take care of everything to win her heart.

401
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,500
Win her heart.

402
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
Then give her a grand proposal.

403
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,900
A grand proposal.

404
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,300
And you'll succeed, I think.

405
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,820
Okay.

406
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,540
A proposal.

407
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,580
Hey.

408
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,620
If you still think it's not enough,

409
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,340
give her a big surprise in the next few days.

410
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,500
A big surprise.

411
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,740
As the saying goes,

412
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,300
tough women

413
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
are afraid of clingy men.

414
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,580
My investment in your romance comics

415
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,820
is not in vain.

416
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,260
Think about it.

417
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,020
Okay.

418
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,380
Make a PPT and let me take a look later.

419
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,100
Okay.

420
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,780
Propose a plan.

421
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,180
Implement the plan.

422
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,500
Solve the problem.

423
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,060
Okay.

424
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,660
In love,

no one

426
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,100
can easily succeed.

427
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,780
Great.

428
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,900
Remember that.

429
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,290
Great.

430
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,260
Great.

[Proposal Plan]

432
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,740
First,

433
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,900
what did she say?

434
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,900
Hey.

435
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,060
I know

436
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,300
you're not lazy.

437
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,940
These are not for lazy people.

438
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,420
But

439
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,420
this is a special period.

440
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,300
You should save your strength.

441
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,900
We can't let your wound reopen again.

442
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,300
Okay?

443
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,820
He's here?

444
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,860
Grandpa.

445
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,420
I'm back.

Xiao Jing.

447
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,420
Shouldn't they be cooking in the kitchen

448
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,460
at this hour?

449
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,620
I understand what you mean.

450
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,850
But I still can't rule out Liang Xueyan as a suspect.

451
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,340
Every time when she walked in...

452
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,140
Who is he talking to?

453
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,620
Doesn't this show her guilty conscience?

454
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,140
Orange. You are back.

455
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,300
Are you hungry?

456
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,540
Orange?

457
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,460
What's wrong?

458
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,700
If you're hungry,

459
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,820
order takeout yourself.

460
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,020
Xiao Jing and I have something to discuss.

461
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,700
Order takeout?

462
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,860
Let's go.

463
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,700
He asked me to order takeout?

464
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,340
I just went to the base.

465
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,540
Yang Jingyi said

466
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,820
the manual is missing.

467
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,700
She also lost her key of the archive.

468
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,300
This is very strange.

469
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,260
Judging from the patient's symptoms,

470
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,220
they are indeed caused by Dioscorea nipponica Makino.

471
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,340
Although Yang Jingyi

472
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,260
is a little careless,

473
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,340
she has no evil intentions.

474
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,100
When she was an undergraduate,

475
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,940
I was her teacher.

476
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,540
I know

477
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
clearly about this.

478
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,570
Sir.

479
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,980
Some people don't have evil intentions in the beginning.

480
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,500
But once they do,

481
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,220
they are scarier than outsiders.

482
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,820
You're right.

483
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,970
I would rather believe a thief broke into the base.

484
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,180
Look.

485
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,330
There is also something missing

486
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,740
in the notebook in my study.

487
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,860
Aren't you a student of Professor Song?

488
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,620
Others can do well in the experiment.

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
