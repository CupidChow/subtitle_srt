[A Different Mr. Xiao]

3
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,220
It's really Xiaoxiao this time.

4
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,700
Really.

5
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,260
Okay.

6
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,500
I didn't ask well.

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,860
Next.

8
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,220
You.

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,820
Me?

10
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,340
Hey.

11
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,900
Wait.

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,460
Let me say something.

13
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,500
Well...

14
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,500
Let me say something.

15
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,740
I take you to play games

16
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,700
to liven up the atmosphere,

17
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,740
not for you to flirt with someone.

18
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,740
Don't flirt with someone, okay?

19
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,980
Let's get this straight, okay?

20
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,340
Go on.

21
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
Hurry up. Go on.

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,900
I knew it.

23
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,020
It won't be anything good.

24
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,980
I want to hear it.

25
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,380
I want to hear it.

26
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,890
I asked her

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,740
who the greasiest one here is.

28
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,020
Hey.

29
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,300
Is this greasy?

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,860
It's a pure British style.

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,980
British style.

32
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,700
Okay, next question.

33
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,420
Tell me. What did he say about me?

34
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,050
Your feet stink.

35
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,460
How do you know my feet...

36
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,100
Yeah, how do you know his feet stink?

37
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,700
Are you starting to make personal attacks?

38
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,660
Okay.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,220
Just wait.

40
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,540
Her.

41
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,620
I want to know.

42
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,020
Tell me.

43
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,820
He just asked me

44
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,060
who

45
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,500
among us

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,580
has the biggest breasts but is the dumbest.

47
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,100
You...

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,180
I didn't.

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,100
I was asking who has the best figure.

50
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Don't go too far.

51
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,380
What? If you don't agree, then compete with me in drinking.

52
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,660
Do you dare?

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,900
Can you outdrink me?

54
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,060
Let's go.

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,780
Huh?

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,020
Didn't you promise to go somewhere with me tonight?

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,980
But...

58
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,620
Let's go.

59
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,340
They...

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,900
They both are good at drinking, look.

61
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,820
Are you okay?

62
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,620
You're not young anymore.

63
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,860
Your combat power isn't sufficient anymore,

64
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,700
and your recovery ability is lacking as well, right?

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,460
No need.

66
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,980
Instead of competing with Ouyang Yu,

67
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,380
you might as well spend some time to confess your love.

68
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
You're right.

[Episode 20]

70
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,810
Let me tell you.

71
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,980
I owe you a sincere apology.

72
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,420
If I drink myself to death here today,

73
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,340
I'll consider it adding to your enjoyment.

74
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
Let me tell you.

75
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,660
I also owe you an apology.

76
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,140
I admit

77
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,020
that when I was feeling the worst,

78
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,540
you were there for me.

79
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,020
Last time we met,

80
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,900
I felt that I couldn't

81
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,180
show weakness in front of you.

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,380
I understand. You thought you'd lost face.

83
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,020
Back then, in front of me, you were...

84
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,700
Stop drinking. You're drunk.

85
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,220
Stop drinking.

86
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,900
Smart, stop drinking.

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,820
Stop drinking.

88
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,540
I'm really fine.

89
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,300
You guys drink.

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,380
I'm leaving.

91
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,980
You were embarrassed that day.

92
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,100
So you dropped the friendly facade.

93
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,800
Right?

94
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,260
Mr. Xiao.

95
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Are you

96
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,580
done?

97
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,340
Orange left with Ouyang Yu.

98
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
You...

99
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,900
Where are we going?

100
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
We're almost there.

101
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,380
Here we are.

102
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Here we are?

103
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,980
Where are we?

104
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,820
The place where I'll confess my love to you.

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,820
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,740
Be serious.

107
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,220
I like you.

108
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,540
Since you taught me how to repair my work,

109
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,700
I've fallen in love with you.

110
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,220
This feeling is strange.

111
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,620
I like sculptures.

112
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,620
I like drawing.

113
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,140
I enjoy what is referred to as artwork.

114
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,940
But my feelings towards these things

115
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,620
are different from my feelings towards you.

116
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm quite certain

117
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,220
that I like you.

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,340
I like your kindness.

119
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,700
I like your quirkiness.

120
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,780
So I must do something for you

121
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,740
to earn points in your eyes.

122
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,260
Even though

123
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,780
I don't know if today's efforts will be enough,

124
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,940
I still want you to know my intentions.

125
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,900
You don't have to give me an answer today.

126
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,180
Take your time to think about it

127
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
before you answer me.

128
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,220
It's okay.

129
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Anyway,

130
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,580
having a one-sided love for you

131
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,380
is my own business.

132
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,020
Actually,

133
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,420
I...

134
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Don't take it seriously.

135
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,500
I knew it.

136
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,580
Gosh.

137
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm okay with one-sided love.

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,820
I didn't want to make you feel awkward

139
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,820
by expressing my feelings.

140
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,300
You can

141
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,140
treat me just like usual.

142
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,220
I...

143
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,100
I will be just like this...

144
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

145
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,860
I really need to go.

146
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,900
It's urgent.

147
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,940
I'll go to the bathroom.

148
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,420
Wei, you said you have no friends.

149
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,900
You can talk to me.

150
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,100
I can be your friend.

151
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,580
I really don't have any friends.

152
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,620
Orange has Ouyang Yu and Xiao Jing, but I don't have anyone.

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,980
Well.

154
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,420
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

155
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,100
I was wrong. I made you angry.

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,780
I'll punish myself with a drink.

157
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,860
-I'll drink as a punishment.
-You're drunk.

158
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,530
You're drunk.

159
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,380
How about we go back and charge up for a bit?

160
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,980
I'll turn on the CCTV for you.

161
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,860
Go back by yourself.

162
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,460
I must find her.

163
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,460
Can I make it back alive?

164
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,620
How did I not see that?

165
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,930
Indeed,

166
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,820
it's an intellectual love battle between geniuses.

167
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,940
You came out for a walk too?

168
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,460
Yes.

169
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,420
Are you okay?

170
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,580
Xu Huaicong is very boring.

171
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,100
He likes to tease people.

172
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,140
It's okay.

173
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,100
Okay.

174
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,300
You're going for a walk somewhere else, right?

175
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,660
Well,

176
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,860
I'll leave you alone.

177
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,340
Actually,

178
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,260
I'm grateful to Xu Huaicong.

179
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,820
He made me realize

180
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,420
that I'm curious about everything related to you.

181
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm curious

182
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,100
about Ouyang Yu's position in your heart.

183
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm curious why you kept pointing at him.

184
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm curious

185
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,860
about the time you spend alone together.

186
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm also curious

187
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,660
about what you think when you're alone,

188
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,780
whether you eat well,

189
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,540
whether you rest properly,

190
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,980
and whether...

191
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,380
You miss me.

192
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,300
Aren't you curious

193
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,140
how I feel

194
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,490
when you're with Luo Lingli?

195
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,660
Aren't you curious

196
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,620
if I would be sad if you moved out of my house?

197
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,460
Aren't you curious if I'd be sad when you shielded me from the attack?

198
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm not curious,

199
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,420
because I know you must be sad.

200
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
That's why I've been trying so hard to control myself

201
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,900
from thinking about you,

202
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,220
otherwise, all my previous efforts would be in vain.

203
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,220
So,

204
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,100
did you really plan to leave me?

205
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,980
Yes.

206
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,140
I was wrong.

207
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,380
Are you going to Luo Lingli

208
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,020
after you leave me?

209
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,420
If you like the Lolita type so much,

210
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,900
just say it.

211
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,460
It's not like

212
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,180
I can't dress up like that.

213
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,900
Okay.

214
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,260
You can change your style anytime.

215
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,580
I'm offering you a way out, and yet you're pushing your luck, aren't you?

216
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
I won't.

217
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm good now.

218
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,860
You're really good.

219
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
You don't need to change.

220
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,620
I don't want you to change.

221
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,610
I hope

222
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,820
every day we spend together in the future

223
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,860
can become our beautiful memories in the future.

224
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,140
Fireworks.

225
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,940
There are really fireworks today.

226
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,060
There are fireworks here too.

227
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,819
The fireworks are so beautiful.

228
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,109
♫Let him accompany me with music♫

229
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,420
Last time I couldn't take you to see the fireworks,

230
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,250
♫Want to ask him about weekend plans, but facing him, I become tongue-tied♫

231
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,380
I'll make it up to you today.

232
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,810
♫Afraid he might reject me, I cried my heart out by myself♫

233
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,280
♫Being cool is just a façade♫

234
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,620
I want us to be together.

235
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,180
♫Hiding my love for you♫

236
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,230
♫I want to know if what you said is from your heart, so agree♫

237
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,730
♫Otherwise, I can't focus on class♫

238
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,090
♫Give me a surprise quickly, don't always give me blind boxes to open♫

239
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,060
♫I searched for clues to get closer to you♫

240
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,770
♫The hints are too subtle, and I can't contact you♫

241
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,090
♫I received a message, waiting for your response♫

242
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,750
♫I know I'm thinking of you, and you're thinking of me too♫

243
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,900
♫We have a telepathic connection but can't express it♫

244
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,070
♫I want to see you but I'm afraid my classmates might see♫

245
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,030
♫If I stand farther, I can't see your face clearly♫

246
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:18,090
♫I wish every day could be Sunday, holding hands forever♫

247
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,290
♫First, ask for your willingness♫

248
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,660
♫Don't worry because it will always be sunny♫

249
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,760
♫My smile will make it happen♫

250
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,740
♫Take you to the horizon line in the geography book♫

251
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,790
♫Accompany you throughout my life♫

252
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,100
Coming.

253
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,060
Coming.

254
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,700
Coming.

255
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,980
Coming.

256
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,740
Coming.

257
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,460
Where is he?

258
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,210
Xiao Jing.

259
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,180
Morning, Orange.

260
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,410
Why are you here?

261
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,540
Did anyone see you?

262
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,780
Young people should not be

263
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,180
so high-profile when dating.

264
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,500
Would you

265
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,300
keep your promise

266
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,780
from yesterday?

267
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,980
Of course.

268
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,980
I'm afraid

269
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,060
that the sweet moments of our relationship will be used up all at once.

270
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,340
How about this?

271
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,820
I'll set a KPI.

272
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll make you feel sweet five times a day.

273
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,300
Only five times?

274
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,340
Go ahead and eat.

275
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,620
I'm not hungry.

276
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,580
I usually can't eat at this hour.

277
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,460
Are you on a diet?

278
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,980
Of course not.

279
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,300
Look at me.

280
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,580
Do I need to?

281
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,580
Have some watermelon.

282
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,620
I think

283
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,420
we should

284
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,220
tone it down a bit for now.

285
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,060
After all, dating is something between two people.

286
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Public displays of affection

287
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,740
are immature.

288
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,700
Moreover,

289
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,380
we're all out here for fun.

290
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,100
Our relationship

291
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,460
will affect the group's unity.

292
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,980
Are you

293
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,420
going to hold a group wedding in the future?

294
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,100
What are you talking about?

295
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,340
You don't understand the bond between best friends.

296
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,980
I have to prevent any potential risks.

297
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,900
Orange.

298
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,700
Something urgent came up at home.

299
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,980
You guys eat. Bye.

300
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,970
What's so urgent? I don't even know.

301
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,380
How could she have something even I don't know about?

302
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,330
Everyone, stop.

303
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,180
I'll pay for everything

304
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,060
you've had today.

305
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,940
Did you win a lottery?

306
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,620
Huh?

307
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
He did win.

308
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,300
Later,

309
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,980
you all should hurry back home.

310
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,980
Don't interrupt my vacation with my sweetheart.

311
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,740
It's okay to have fun together,

312
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,420
but we still want to experience the night scene here.

313
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,780
Did you two

314
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,740
eat a rapper or something?

315
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,980
Do you want to finish this small watermelon?

316
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,380
And then turn into your little fool?

317
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,420
Is it good, little fool?

318
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,020
I've already become a little fool.

319
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,340
Why are you giving it to me?

320
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,260
I worked hard last night, exhausted physically,

321
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,460
weak in the limbs, and mentally distracted.

322
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,810
So you drive.

323
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,460
I can't drive your car.

324
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,540
What's so hard about driving an automatic transmission car?

325
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,740
I don't know how to drive at all.

326
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,940
Is this

327
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,180
a self-driving car?

328
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,900
Are you okay?

329
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,620
We're home safe. See you.

330
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,900
Let's go.

331
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,500
Dr. Xiao.

332
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,540
Can I take your car back?

333
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,820
No.

334
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,380
Aren't you supposed to be on duty?

335
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,780
I am.

336
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,740
But I don't want to share a ride with him.

337
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm going to the hospital.

338
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,460
You did it.

339
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,140
It's beyond expectation.

340
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,020
Have you figured out a way out?

341
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,060
You entrusted her to me

342
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,260
because you didn't have the confidence in taking care of her, right?

343
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,180
I didn't think it through before.

344
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
I thought

345
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,300
leaving her was the best choice.

346
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,740
But after the mudslide incident,

347
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,580
I found that

348
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,620
no one can take care of her

349
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,340
better than myself.

350
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,580
So no matter what happens,

351
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,740
all I can do

352
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,540
is fight with all my might.

353
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,780
Do you think I won't fight with all my might with you?

354
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,660
I don't think it'll be your turn to punish me.

355
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,940
If I disappear one day,

356
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,340
that means I lost the fight

357
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,740
and lost my life.

358
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,220
What is this?

359
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,180
Corn silk.

360
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,500
Corn silk?

361
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,220
Yes.

362
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,420
Are you sure she likes this?

363
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,850
Isn't she fond of sweet things?

364
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,580
Isn't this one of the few sweet traditional Chinese medicines?

365
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,460
Compared to sweet corn silk,

366
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,420
isn't sweet corn even better?

367
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,620
You don't understand, do you?

368
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,700
This helps with diuresis, gallbladder function, blood pressure, and lowering cholesterol.

369
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,100
It's good for her health.

370
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,220
You're right.

371
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,860
After all, you two have become overly sweet.

372
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,900
I can preserve them for a long time by turning them into dried flowers.

373
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,860
But he gave me flowers.

374
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,980
Should I

375
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
give him something?

376
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,780
Apart from me,

377
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,700
what else does he like?

378
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,520
[Xiao Jing]

379
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,260
Why is there nothing in his Moments?

380
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,460
I'll just ask him.

381
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,490
We haven't seen each other for four hours.

382
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,820
So there's no need to send any messages?

383
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,140
He doesn't miss me at all.

384
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,540
Grandpa, you're back.

385
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,300
Are you waiting for someone?

386
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,420
No.

387
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,260
Why are you unhappy seeing me?

388
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,860
Well, I thought you might have brought back some delicious food.

389
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,930
Am I not as good as delicious food?

390
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,980
It's not like that.

391
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,380
Professor Song.

392
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,940
Orange.

393
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,660
Why are you here?

394
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
I came

395
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,580
to bring some delicious food to Professor Song.

396
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,020
You know Orange so well.

397
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,340
As an old man,

398
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,620
I don't have the allure of delicious food, huh?

399
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,980
Why are you here?

400
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,580
I missed you.

401
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,500
You're saying it now.

402
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,090
You didn't even send me a single message before.

403
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,620
Grandpa, do you need any help?

404
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,380
No, no.

405
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,380
I'll still need to use my kitchen in the future.

406
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,380
Sir, I'll tidy up a bit and then help you.

407
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,540
Okay.

408
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,100
Your courage is quite something.

409
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,460
This is my home.

410
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,860
If I weren't courageous,

411
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,530
♫You're like a petal falling into my heart♫

412
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,490
how could I like you?

413
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,340
Let me warn you,

414
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,140
♫Unknowingly influencing my every expression♫

415
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,580
my grandpa is...

416
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,130
♫My heart beats under the romantic sunset♫

417
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,180
At the kitchen.

418
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
The warning is invalid.

419
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,610
♫As the sweet kiss approaches, love melts into the wind♫

420
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,890
♫The scenery looks best with you beside me♫

421
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,160
♫You're like a firefly that ignites my joy♫

422
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,520
♫I want this wonderful moment to last forever♫

423
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,840
♫Feeling happiness and sweetness when we are together♫

424
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,120
♫I want to start this romance with you♫

425
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,480
♫With only your recognition, I become brave♫

426
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,790
♫You're like the dazzling stars appearing before me♫

427
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,150
♫I want to watch the fireworks with you♫

428
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,429
♫I want to start this romance with you♫

429
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,830
♫As long as you're by my side, it's worth remembering♫

430
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,110
♫I want to create a good ending with you♫

431
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:24,030
♫Every color is filled with the warm feeling of love♫
