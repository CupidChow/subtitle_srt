Come on.

4
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,979
Has your body degenerated

5
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,540
because you've been in this era for too long?

6
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,180
You use whatever you learned from Master.

7
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,500
Don't you make improvements?

8
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,420
Do you think everyone is like you?

9
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,180
You know you shouldn't do it, but you just won't give up.

10
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,060
They stop when they receive the warning.

11
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,020
Really?

12
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,060
You can't even dodge that?

13
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,140
Again.

14
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,540
Go away. It's nothing.

15
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,580
Why didn't you dodge?

16
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,900
What?

17
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,700
You will go back with me if I dodged?

18
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,540
I have to get some evidence to report.

19
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,180
You...

20

Well.

21
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,140
Why have you become like an old man

22
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,500
since you came here?

23
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,090
Well...

24

Just say it.

Tell me.

28
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,260
If the future can really change the past,

29
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,620
our decisions will be

30
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,860
dynamically open

31
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,210
instead of being closed, right?

32
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,060
And there won't be any wrong choice, right?

33
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,060
You just

34
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,020
do whatever you want.

35
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,620
Anyway,

36
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,580
you'll regret no matter what choice you make.

37
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,340
Fate is always intertwined.

38
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,180
Hey.

39
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,540
Enough. When do you plan to go back?

Soon.

what about the people here?

I thought

45

I could have everything well under control.

46
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,140
But

she has her own ideas, right?

48

If the ending is destined to be bad,

49
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,580
why don't we make the process pleasant?

50
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,700
I want to make wonderful memories with her.

If you have a problem, you can drive.

I'm just fully charged. I haven't recovered yet.

I opened the gate of time and space for you.

But you were in a coma, and I was not charged for three days.

Do you think Ouyang Yu can borrow that trolley?

I think he can.

69

After all, he's so charming.

Right.

He also helped me solve the problem of the comics competition.

Do you think

76
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,980
I should add an awning to his motorbike

77
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,810

You saw her?

What animal?

Is this the table you prepared?

Are these the chairs you mentioned?

Look at them.

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm the kid who holds an empty pot.

176
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,740
Besides, considering

177
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,540
what happened to Mr. Xiao recently,

178
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
I feel the pressure is all on me.

179
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,580
Do you want me to help you with something?

180
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,980
That's very kind of you.

181
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,100
Can you help me with the analysis

182
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,740
of the nutrient solution and nutrient soil?

183
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,740
Okay.

184
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,980
I'll give it to you when I come to work on Monday.

185
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:29,880
Okay.

186
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,100
Professor.

187
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,060
Hey, Dong.

188
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,370
Why are you here?

189
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm here to help Yang...

190
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,020
This kid...

191
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,620
Professor.

192
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,099
How is your health?

193
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
I'm fine.

194
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,579
You saw the examination report, right?

195
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm good.

196
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,540
It's easy to have a relapse.

197
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,020
You should rest well.

198
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,260
I will.

199
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,099
Look at you guys.

200
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,700
You don't even rest on weekends.

201
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,900
And you always ask me to rest.

202
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,900
Fine.

203
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,619
I'm going to rest.

204
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,020
Be careful. Professor.

205
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,740
Okay.

206
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
I'm leaving these to you.

207
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,300
There are more.

208
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,300
Get started.

209
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,620
You don't know how to do it?

210
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,660
Why should I?

211
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,220
Aren't you running a restaurant?

212
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Stores opening at night are not necessarily restaurants.

213
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Yes. They could be night entertainment venues.

214
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,460
They all sell snacks, right?

215
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,940
The stores selling snacks are called snack stores,

216
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,100
or snack shops.

217
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,650
What's the difference?

218
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,900
There's a big difference.

219
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
You must be hungry.

220
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,780
Let me cook.

221
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,260
You?

222
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Cook?

223
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,060
What?

224
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,180
You think I'll poison you?

225
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,140
It's possible.

226
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,500
Orange, let me help you.

227
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,100
You can cook?

228
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,740
No.

229
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,780
You don't need this?

230
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,580
Then you won't be alone even if you fail.

231
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,100
Even if we fail,

232
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,900
it is the responsibility of the two of us.

233
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,500
Then you should take the main responsibility.

234
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,450
Okay.

235
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,820
Which one do you like?

236
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,720
Here.

237
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,780
Let's start with chicken feet.

238
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,100
I love chicken feet.

239
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,900
Like this.

240
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,180
Be careful. Don't poke your hands.

241
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,900
One more.

242
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,820
Does it look like your hand?

243
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,380
No.

244
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,980
One more.

245
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,300
Chicken feet with fish tofu.

246
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,500
Treasure in the palm.

247
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,420
Like this.

248
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,260
What is this? Treasure in the palm?

249
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,460
Treasure in the palm.

250
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,580
Look.

251
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,020
This is

252
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,700
Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.

253
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,460
What?

254
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,300
Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.

255
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,180
You're indeed an artist.

256
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
You're special even when you are making food skewers.

257
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,420
I didn't even realize it myself.

258
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm making another treasure in the palm for Smart.

259
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,940
Ouyang Yu.

260
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,700
Come with me to get coal.

261
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,540
Let's go.

262
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,420
Kitty.

263
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,300
What should I do?

264
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,380
Why did you come back suddenly?

265
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,340
I regret it.

266
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,020
Regret?

267
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,980
Yes.

268
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,170
It's an important matter. You think I'll pretend nothing happened just because you regret it?

269
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,340
Do you know how sad she was because of you?

270
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,940
I'll make it up to her.

271
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,700
Make it up to her?

272
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,500
How?

273
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,060
Cry for her for three days and nights?

274
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,580
Do you have a heart? Tell me.

275
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,060
You can't deny that I'm also a carbon-based creature.

276
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,820
My heart is right here.

277
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,260
It's too late to regret.

278
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,500
Can't you see my relationship with Orange has improved a lot?

279
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,980
Tonight,

280
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,180
I will confess my love to her.

281
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,820
Then I'll do my best to turn the tide.

282
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,100
Let's wait and see.

283
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,340
Orange.

284
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,820
Mr. Xiao saved you.

285
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
And you accompanied him for so long.

286
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,060
Now he is here for you.

287
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,380
Why are you cold to him?

288
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,290
This is a deal with the demon.

289
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,340
You won't understand even if I tell you.

290
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,900
Show yourself.

291
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,060
Nephew?

292
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,580
Why are you here?

293
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,700
East, West, South, North, and Red. The good wine is in Shandong.

294
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,820
Good.

295
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,620
One more glass.

296
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,860
Good.

297
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,140
I'll count to three.

298
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,740
Let him sleep a little longer.

299
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,860
Three.

300
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,740
Two.

301
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,100
Hi.

302
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,980
Aren't you drunk?

303
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,820
What can I do for you?

304
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,930
What are you doing?

305
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,380
Thank you.

306
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,820
Everyone.

307
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,460
Actually, I'm not good at these things at all.

308
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,220
What I'm best at

309
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,420
is making a fire.

310
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,860
Can't you just sit quietly?

311
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
There will be something missing every time you move.

312
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,660
Look, it's empty here.

313
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,970
You heard her.

314
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,700
Don't say I don't work

315
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,020
and only know eating.

316
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,300
Stop running if you dare.

317
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Don't run.

318
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm speechless.

319
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,220
You can't do things well, but you eat a lot.

320
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,700
I'm cheap, right?

321
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,980
Who asked you to choose me?

322
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,540
Who asked you to come out?

323
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,260
Go back now.

324
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
I was worried that you are alone.

325
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,490
So I came out to support you.

326
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,540
I can liven it up.

327
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,580
Eat this.

328
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,980
Xiaoxiao.

329
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,500
Did you tell Xiao Jing

330
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,140
I'm here?

331
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,060
Then tell me

332
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,980
who you'll choose

333
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,420
between Ouyang Yu and Mr. Xiao.

334
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,580
What kind of question is this?

335
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,660
I don't want to talk to you.

336
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,860
Hey.

337
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,900
Can we stop talking separately?

338
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's play a game together.

339
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,140
Okay?

340
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,460
Well.

341
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
I'm not going to tell you the rules now.

342
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,980
But listen.

343
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,500
The seating

344
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,460
is very important in this game.

345
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,020
Now, I'm going to

346
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,540
make the seating arrangements

347
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,460
in the most scientific way.

348
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,420
That is,

349
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,220

00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,860

355
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,020
Let me tell you the rules first.

356
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,380
For example,

357
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,260
he asked me a question

358
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,580
in a secret way.

359
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,300
Everyone here may be the answer.

360
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,700
And I will use this

361
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,540
to point at the answer.

362
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,500
If you

363
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,900
are curious about the question,

364
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,820

You need to pay for it.

370
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,420
Okay, let's

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,620
get started.

372
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,500
You are going to

373
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,860
become an unscrupulous merchant.

374
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,900
Shut up.

375
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,420
What did he say?

376
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,300
Nothing.

377
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,460
Wait.

378
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,690
I want to know the question.

379
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,420
Oh my gosh.

380
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,300
I didn't expect Mr. Xiao

381
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,180
is the best at livening up the atmosphere among us.

382
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,220
You should learn from him.

383
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,540
I'll pour the wine.

384
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,980
Okay. Now,

385
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm going to tell you the answer.

386
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,580
The question I asked Big Orange is

387
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,700
who she thinks

388
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,660
was the most disobedient in school.

389
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,900
Okay. I'm going to ask the next question.

390
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,620
Xiaoxiao.

391
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
You have to be honest.

392
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,580
Be honest. Honest.

393
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,780
It's not you anyway.

394
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,460
I want to know.

395
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,380
I'll pour the wine.

396
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,980
He's a real man.

397
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,020
I didn't expect that.

398
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,580
The second question I asked Big Orange is

399
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,700
who she thinks

400
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,420
has been asked for the phone number the most frequently by people of the opposite sex.

401
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,940
I told you.

402
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,900
He is

403
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,580
very boring.

404
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,820
Am I boring?

405
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,100
Am I boring?

406
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,660
Next question.

407
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,940
I want to know.

408
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,660
I want to know.
