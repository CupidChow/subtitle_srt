Isn't it just

178
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,970
a simple relationship with a patient?

179
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,300
Yes.

180
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,540
Just a simple relationship

181
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
that is between doctors and patients.

182
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,860
Don't think too much.

183
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
Do you think

184
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,980
I arranged you to be with him

185
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,340
because I was jealous?

186
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,300
Am I wrong?

187
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,820
You even became green-eyed with jealousy.

202

and leave yourself a way out?

203
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,420
Why is your thinking logic so weird?

204
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,100
If only you could

205
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,740
think so meticulously in your profession.

206
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,620
Don't worry.

207

I won't do such stupid things.

I'll get better soon.

Then will you get better faster like this?

214

If as you said,

215
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,980
you won't be friends with the opposite sex,

216
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,060

218
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,700
A pet.

220
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,380
Okay.

She was hungry and came to eat with us.

Why didn't she ask me?
