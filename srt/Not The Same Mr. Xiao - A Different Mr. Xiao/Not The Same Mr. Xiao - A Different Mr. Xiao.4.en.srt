Of course,

57
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,470
I was afraid you'd get caught.

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,840
How about I send you back now?

59

To study, right?

66
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,260
Top students like you love doing this.

When others drink, you study.

69

let's discuss about it.

72
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,840
Should we cover for each other

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
or die together?

74
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,960
Then my flowers...

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,180
Think carefully.

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,980

Why are you picking up trash?

I'm reusing it and turning trash into treasure.

I'm not the kind of person to waste Chinese herbs.

84

and extract the freshest color from it.

86

87
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,760
Yes.

88
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,560

should be the color of spring.

341
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,610
But it feels a little cold.

342
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,360
Especially the insects waking from hibernation.

343
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,110
So I added some here.

344
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,270
It looks good, right?

345
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,390
On the basis of a clean painting,

346
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,300
you also put in some memorable characteristics.

347
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,500
You really gave me a big surprise.

[Nurturing Persicaria Hydropiper]

350
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,780
Have you found it, Jing?

351
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,480
It’s easy to find the code of this file, right?

352
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Yes, it's easy to find.

353
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,520
I found them all.

354
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,030
Sir,

355
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,020
did you organize

356
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,430
all of these files by yourself?

357
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,380
I only focused on doing one thing in my life.

358
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,320
Of course I should organize them well.

359
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,240
Take your time to read these documents.

360
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,130
Okay.

361
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,880
Are you free tonight?

362
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,660
Why don't you go home with me?

363
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
Orange doesn't have night class today.

364
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,030
Let's go back early.

365
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,130
Okay, I'll make dinner.

366
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,270
Let's go.

367
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,370
Add some Reseda luteola for me.

368
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,890
What did you call this color?

369
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,960
I don't call this "a colour",

370
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,670
I call it "an ingredient".

371
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,170
Reseda luteola.

372
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,400
Doesn't this smell like...

373
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,450
You... Wait.

374
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,840
Let me help you wipe it.

375
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,500
What are you doing?

376
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,840
Are you here for Shen Zhengping?

377
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,450
Yes, Manager Shen asked us to pick out a painting.

378
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,100
He's not here today.

379
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,530
Come back another day.

380
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,260
Hold on.

381
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,630
We can talk about

382
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,900
your company's calendar first.

383
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,580
This is also a business project that Ms. Wei

384
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,690
asked us to do with your company.

385
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,650
Ms. Wei thinks highly of your ability.

386
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,530
So I hope you can think of some ideas

387
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,820
for this calender.

388
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,690
I thought you were my fan.

389
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,460
I really appreciate your work.

390
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,240
The company happened to have this kind of business.

391
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
Your work touched me.

392
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,770
Thank you.

393
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,170
I happen to have a painting,

394
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,040
you can take a look.

395
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,340
It's amazing.

396
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,410
That's to be expected from you.

397
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,010
It's the artwork of a new member of our studio.

398
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,860
Hi.

399
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,650
You have a good eye.

400
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,990
We get along so well.

401
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,150
Why don't we have dinner tonight

402
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,030
and discuss about your next exhibition?

403
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,370
Our company wants to invest in it.

404
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,590
Since it's a business gathering, I won't attend.

405
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,370
You can wait for Shen Zhengping.

406
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,460
I'm leaving.

407
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,320
Go ahead.

408
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,200
I'll walk you out. Let's go.

409
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,730
Sit down.

410
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,180
Did I not make myself clear?

411
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,730
Find out who that woman is.

412
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,340
Yes.

♫In ordinary times, at street corners♫

♫The one awaited doesn't appear♫

417
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,850
♫Like a derailed shooting star♫

418
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,110
♫Descends inexplicably and then disappears suddenly♫

♫Afterward, endure a period of neglect♫

420
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,780
♫Can you chase after it in the light?♫

421
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,880
♫Today I forgot again♫

422

♫The emptiness in my chest♫

♫The emptiness in my chest♫

♫I can only imitate with all my strength♫

♫The appearance of others♫

♫If at the exit♫

428
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,280
♫You're waiting♫

429
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,000
If I had tolerated

430
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,040
the ending would be different

431
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,930
They all know how to put it down

432
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:27,070
Actually I'm very forgetful
