You all saw it, right?

Out of the instinct for survival,

even those who are seriously ill

27

still possess the consciousness to live on.

Therefore,

when we face sudden illnesses,

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,000

Have you seen enough?

Are you possessed by a demon?

Or have you gone mad, become foolish, or lost your memory?

Don't take it to heart.

What do you want to tell Professor Song?

65

Faking illness to skip exams, setting up formations during make-up exams, confronting teachers on campus,

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,650
or bursting into the office while the teacher is changing clothes?

67
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,890
You're exaggerating too much.

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,909
You can go, but leave the umbrella.

In the last class, I just talked to you about the history of present illness.

71

In this class, let's discuss the clinical manifestations.

72

Didn't Mr. Xiao know you caught a cold?

73
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,170
Why didn't he bring you ginger soup?

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,700
I caught a cold because of him.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,170
No way.

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,190

Ju, what are you talking about?

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,190
I don't know either.

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,570
I'm just annoyed.

84
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,390
Come to think of it,

85
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,530
Mr. Xiao does seem different lately.

86
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,700
He's not even wearing glasses.

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,930
Right?

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,010
What do you think is different about him?

89
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,870
He seems...

90
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,630
More handsome.

91
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,570
I mean it.

92
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,510
I don't recall Mr. Xiao

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,390
ever wearing black clothes before.

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,190
That's because he used to say black absorbs heat,

95
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,400
so he didn't like wearing it.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,370
I didn't expect it suits his temperament.

97
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,820
Mr. Xiao,

98
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,280
you've worked hard.

Thank you for the class.

100
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,380
I bought this orange juice for you.

101
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,610
As a token of my respect.

102
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,140
Thank you.

103
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,159
Oops. Mr. Xiao.

104
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,130
I forgot you are allergic to orange juice.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,730
Oh.

106
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,970
I got it wrong.

107
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,450
You're not allergic to orange juice.

108
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,610
You are allergic to peach juice.

109

Peach juice.

110
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,120
Peach juice.

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,210
Peach juice. Haha.

Mr. Xiao,

115

weren't you afraid of spiders?

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,190
You even called me to your house

117
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,860
in the middle of the night to catch a spider for you.

118
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,159
It's been a long time.

119
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,630
I'm not afraid anymore.

120
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,150
What?

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,290
Don't do evil if you're timid.

122
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,940
Have you experienced any exclusion in the research lab?

123
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,640
Just ask whatever you want.

124
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,490
Don't beat around the bush.

125
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,640
Let me ask you.

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,860
How old were you when you wanted to become a doctor?

127

128
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,490
Why?

Car accident.

130
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,680
Your Ph.D. qualification and your language ability...

GRE score of 335.

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,640
When did you first come to my house?

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,680
On the day of my Ph.D. interview.

134
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,680
What color clothes was I wearing that day?

135
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,340
I'm not interested in you.

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,679
How can you say that?

138
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,400
You also said

139
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,059
you like yellow the most.

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,720
You asked me for the link.

141
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,090
Did you lose your memory and use your brain too much?

142
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,330
Your brain is completely new.

143
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,220
Let me ask you.

144
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,370
Yes?

145
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,390
How did you manage to score 16 points

on the makeup exam?

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,820
Aren't you responsible for my score?

148
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,230
Are we exposed?

149
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,040
We might be ruined by this girl

150
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
if we don't be careful.

151
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,430
She's

152
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,780
probably trying to easily obtain credits.

153
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,180
Then you should give in to her.

154
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,440
The more friends, the more options.

155
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,420
The more enemies, the more obstacles.

156
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,070
Just do as she says.

157
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,410
Why do you become as shrewd as her?

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,560
You told me to get to know her.

159
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,170
Now you're scolding me?

160
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,920
I asked you to get to know her, not to surpass her.

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,070
Her information.

162
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,710
I've tried my best.

163
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,160
Really.

164
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,140
How about

165
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,620
we kill her?

166
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,060
Let's choose a dark night

167
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,880
to sneak into her house.

168
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,610
And then...

169
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,020
I haven't finished yet.

170
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,130
The techniques used in this artwork

171
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,940
are derived from traditional Chinese ink painting.

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,350
It captures the essence of the countryside.

173
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,810
It includes vivid portraits

174
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,970
and various trees.

175
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,540
Yes.

176
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,430
Sure.

177
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,490
Yes.

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,740
It's OK.

179
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,080
Hello.

180
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,960
Excuse me,

181
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,390
where is the sculpture "Radiance" being exhibited?

182
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,110
Oh, the artist's design.

183
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,600
To make sure the exhibition is unique,

184
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,230
the works we show every day

185
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,450
are different.

186
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,950
But I'm here for it.

187
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,850
You can take a look

188
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,080
at the works we presented today.

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,380
They are all good.

190
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,910
Thank you.

191
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,570
Don't put the stuff there.

192
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,490
Hurry up.

193
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,620
Don't let tourists in.

194
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,970
You're done.

195
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,470
You're done.

196
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,740
You're done.

197
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,610
Do you know whose work this is?

198
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,760
OY's.

199
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,880
So you know?

200
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,410
Since you know,

201
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,310
do you also know that by making that move just now,

202
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,710
you would risk losing everything you have?

203
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,490
Losing everything...

204
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,450
If it weren't for you bumping into me...

205
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,750
Don't worry.

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,330
Look at you.

207
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,020
You're getting impatient.

208
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,300
I'm here.

209
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,520
Give it to me.

210
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,140
Give me a razor.

211
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,040
It's unlucky. Give me another one.

212
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,400
Come on.

213
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,070

No.

Didn't she say that it wouldn't be exhibited?

259
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,620
It's amazing.

I don't know why they chose this body.

Because according to data analysis,

this person's physical features

He is the one around Professor Song who's the most similar to you.

just because of such a trivial matter.

Bye.

How about I introduce you to a blind date?

532
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,740
Don't be angry.

It's dark and windy.

534

This is really dangerous for me

I'm exhausted.

538
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,210
Why did you go for a night run in the middle of the night?

539
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,360
What night run?

540
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,710
Xiao Jing, why are you in my house?

541
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,040
How dare you call him Xiao Jing?

542
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,590
How rude.

543
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,440
It's all thanks to him.

544
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,370
He went to so many places to find you and bring you back.

545
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,250
It's OK.

546

Professor Song, don't blame her.

547
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,230
She ran back at night because she was afraid you would worry.

548
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,180
This way, it helps her sober up and clears her mind.

549
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,150
Since Orange is back,

550
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,240
I'm relieved.

551
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,890
I've prepared the materials.

552

I'll go back now.

553
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,910
OK. Go back and rest.

You have to go to the base tomorrow.

OK.

Don't drink so much from now on.

It's bad for your health.

And don't play until so late.

559
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,490
Yes, you're a grown-up. You still make me worry.

560

Blind dates?

567
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,960
You showed no mercy to me first,

568
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,600
so don't blame me for treating you unfairly.
