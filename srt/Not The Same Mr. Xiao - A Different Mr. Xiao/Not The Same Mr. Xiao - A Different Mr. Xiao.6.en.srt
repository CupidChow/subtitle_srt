[A Different Mr. Xiao]

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,870
Are we going on a trip?

24
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,300
I think you need a space travel.

25
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,500
Since we're here,

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,120
we should give the seed

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,860
some time to grow.

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,900
We're supposed to

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,570
have been back to 2223

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,699
and given the medicine to the doctor.

31
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,389
Jing may have been awake now.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,750
My calculation is right.

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,320
Time travel is risky.

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,140
Besides, people from the Time Management Bureau have reminded us.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,290
But we just need it.

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,730
Now tell me

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,660
what I should do.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,810
Well...

39
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,940
You won't act rashly, will you?

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,910
If you really want to do something

what if something goes wrong again?

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,910
I think

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
we'd better stay here for three months.

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,560
Our time visas have expired.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,650
Well,

47
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,560
it'll be illegal for us to stay here from tomorrow onwards.

48
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,210
We must be more careful.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,540
We can't expose any advanced technology

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,380
or change anything in this time.

51
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,190
Then why should I keep you?

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,500
Are you going to throw me away?

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,540
I can still be helpful.

I remember she lived 200 years ago.

Okay.

Here's the thing.

Based on my understanding last time,

They want me to check it.

Besides,

127
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,930
they provided me with soil in different regions

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,010

on our Dioscorea nipponica Makino,

132

Actually,

136
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,580
I'm most worried about Little Orange.

137
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,990
I'll be away

It's not realistic to bring her along.

That's it.

If there's anything inappropriate, I'll ask them to adjust it.

I said it's my treat tonight.

166
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,929
I can't hold my liquor as well as you.

167
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,390
Fill it up.

Tell me.

169
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,140
Why can't he be nicer to me?

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,180
If he can't see such a beautiful lady,

this person

172

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,590
I didn't expect you to be so smart.

175
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,240
Come and work for me.

176
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, boss.

177
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,420
It's hard to meet someone

178
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,490
who you can hit it off with.

179
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,630
One more.

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,140
The vibe is so good.

181
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,030
Anyway,

182
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,200
I've done my job.

183
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,190
Where's the surprise?

184
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,700
Hold on.

185
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,200
What's the hurry?

186
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,190
It's in this pocket.

187
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,910
Wait.

188
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,280
It's not over yet.

189
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,360
We're here.

190
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,470
Is it here?

191
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Is this your house?

192
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,530
Really?

193
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,620
Cheers.

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,630
Fingerprint lock. Fingerprint lock.

195
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,080
Come on, try it.

196
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,190
No, not this.

197
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,950
Not this one.

198
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,890
Not this one either.

199
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,420
What are you doing?

200
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,650
I'm gonna go.

201
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,740
Take care of your God.

202
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,540
Well, Orange.

203
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,260
It's late.

204
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,240
It's not safe for a boy to be outside.

205
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,090
I don't know about other boys,

206
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,830
but you can handle this.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,300
Big Orange!

208
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,590
I hate you.

209
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,610
Orange loves sweets.

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,290
Don't throw away the coke in the fridge.

211
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,340
Okay.

212
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,870
It's just that

213
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,580
you need to take it out first

214
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,100
then put it in when she comes back.

215
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,060
Don't let her drink something too cold.

216
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,320
Don't stop her

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,860
when she pulls up

218
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,810
the milk tea she orders.

219
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm afraid she'll lose her temper

220
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,530
and something bad might happen to you.

221
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,390
Okay.

222
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,280
Do you think I'm naggy?

223
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,300
No.

224
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,520
You dote on your granddaughter.

225
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,640
Everyone knows it.

226
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,430
Actually,

227
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,120
Orange looks like an outgoing person,

228
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,430
but she lives a hard life.

229
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,300
We're home.

230
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
I don't need your help.

231
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,280
Have a seat.

232
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
What are you doing?

233
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,340
We don't know each other well.

234
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,450
We're home.

235
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,760
Hang in there.

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,710
No, no, no.

237
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,840
If you keep doing this, I...

Song Yiju.

239
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,830
Are you a pervert? Why did you stalk me?

240
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,050
I stalked you?

241
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,320
You told me your address.

242
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,770
We two sent you back, okay?

243
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,710
You two?

244
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,540
Where are the other one?

245
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,920
You were here.

246
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,250
She was there.

247
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,260
Get out!

248
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,590
You need to be reasonable.

Song Yiju.

250
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,220
You owe me a slap.

251

Grandpa, I'm back.

252

Grandpa.

253
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,550
Why are you at my home this late?

254
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,900
What did you do to my grandpa?

255
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,240
Hey.

256
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,690
Orange, you're back.

257
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,540
I'm going on a business trip for a few days.

258
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,670
I invited Xiao Jing over

259
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,780
to supervise you.

260
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,750
Listen to him.

261
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,970
We all have faith in you. We look forward to your results.

262
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,980
Good luck.

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,110
All the best.

264
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,069
Grandpa, why don't you reconsider it?

265
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,109
I really don't need anyone to take care of me.

266
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,930
I can do it myself.

267
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,280
You didn't listen to me

268
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,880
when I was at home.

269
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,250
What would you do

270
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,690
after I leave?

271
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,140
Professor.

272
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,760
Everything's almost packed up.

273
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,369
Okay.

275
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,599
Yes.

She has the most tricks.

277
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,920
You have to pay attention.

278

Before the internship exam,

279
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,570
keep an eye on her study.

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,060
Don't let her be late for class.

281

Okay, don't worry.

282
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,860
Okay.

283
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,740

Come back early. I'll miss you.

I'm warning you.

288
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,440
Leave me alone.

289
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
As long as you can follow the rules.

290
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,460
I won't mind your business too much.

291

[Rules of Peace between Xiao Jing and Song Yiju]

293

It'd be better if you could put effort into helping me,

294
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,540
instead of turning against me.

295
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,770
This is too harsh.

296
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,600
I must go home before nine?

297
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm an upcoming college graduate anyway.

298
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,570
That's why I didn't write eight o'clock.

299

Well…

300

Rejected.

302
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,700
This rule that I need to get up early even there's no class

303
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,520
is an insult to a day off.

304
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,580
Objection overruled.

Please explain.

314
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm very sensitive to noise,

315
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,480
so don't make any noise.

316
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,670
It'll have a great impact on me.

the head of this family asked me

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,690
to supervise you here.

322
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,910
Rejected.

323
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,170
This contract gives me no rights but responsibilities.

324
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,890
It's invalid.

325

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,950
Please raise your request.

I can't promise that.

Otherwise,

there'll be a risk of breaking the law next.

333

This is unfair.

334
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,120
A contract is a two-side agreement.

Have you heard of the rumors in our neighborhood?

520
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,489
In our neighborhood,

521
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,940
when the electricity was first connected,

522
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,530
someone found

523
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,230
a girl's dead body.

524
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,570
It was a rainy day

525
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
with thunder and lightning.

526
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,909
A lightning appeared.

527
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,800
Someone

528
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,860
saw

529
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,730
a woman

530
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,420
with her face covered by her hair.

531
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,430
Song Yiju.

532
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,980
I love you.

533
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,320
♫Farewell day is a special day♫

534
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,880
♫Farewell makes a day special♫

535
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,700
♫In ordinary times, at street corners♫

536
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,150
♫The one awaited doesn't appear♫

537
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,760
♫Like a derailed shooting star♫

538
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,020
♫Descends inexplicably and then disappears suddenly♫

539
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,520
♫Afterward, endure a period of neglect♫

540
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,690
♫Can you chase after it in the light?♫

541
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,790
♫Today I forgot again♫

542
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,750
♫The emptiness in my chest♫

543
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,310
♫Where has the heart fallen?♫

544
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,540
♫I can only imitate with all my strength♫

545
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,460
♫The appearance of others♫

546
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,190
♫Trying to smile in the same way♫

547
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,230
♫If at the exit♫

548
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,190
♫You're waiting♫

549
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,910
♫If I had compromised at the time♫

550
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,950
♫The outcome would have been different♫

551
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,840
♫We both know when to let go♫

552
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,980
♫Actually, I'm very forgetful♫
