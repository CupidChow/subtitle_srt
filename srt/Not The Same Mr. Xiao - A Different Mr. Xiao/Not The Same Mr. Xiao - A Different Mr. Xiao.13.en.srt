Orange, the doctor said

5
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,100
Jialu became this

6
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,060
because of allergy.

7
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,940
It's because of the cheese bread I prepared.

8
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,620
It's all my fault.

9
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,540
I asked her to eat it.

10
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,010
It's my fault.

11
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,820
How about this?

12
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,940
Don't think too much.

13
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,820
The most important thing now is to save Jialu,

14
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,500
okay?

15
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,860
I'm going to get everything prepared.

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,610
Contact Jialu's parents

17
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,020
and ask about their intention of the surgery.

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,579
Actually, we've been contacting her parents.

19
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,740
They are abroad.

20
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,700
So they can ignore her just because they are abroad?

21
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,380
Surgery is the best choice.

22
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,820
Why would they choose conservative treatment?

23
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,220
I'm going to contact them now

24
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,900
and ask her mother to sign and fax it.

25
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,980
Okay.

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260

I'm really sorry.

32
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
Why are you here again?

33

I'm sorry.

34
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,660
I really didn't know you had an allergic history.

35
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,380
I know.

36
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,779
That's why I ate it.

37
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,100
What?

38
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
So you ate it on purpose?

39
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,810
Yes.

40
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,340
Then why did you do that?

41
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,380
This can prove that you're not suitable for taking care of me,

42
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,820
so that they will fire you.

43
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,380
If you hate me,

44
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,820
you can tell the doctor

45
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,409
that you don't need me to take care of you.

46
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,060
You can also tell on me.

47
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,780
You can even...

48
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,180
You can even slander me.

49
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
But you hurt your body.

50
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,940
Is it worth it?

51
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,180
Of course. I just need an emergency treatment.

52
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,860
What's the big deal?

53
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,180
Then you're joking with your body.

54
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,780
You're making everyone worried about you and busy with you.

55
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,260
If anything

56
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,180
happens to you,

57
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,060
your family members

58
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,500
will be very worried and anxious.

59
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
That would be great.

60
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,020
Maybe Mom can come to see me.

61
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,620
I know what you're thinking.

62
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,860
When I

63
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,060
was your age,

64
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,220
I also wanted to pester my parents all day.

65
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,370
At that time,

66
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,730
my parents were busy with work

67
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,659
to save people around the world.

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,340
Just like you,

69
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,460
I tried every means to draw their attention.

70
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,700
For example,

71
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,980
I deliberately failed my exams.

72
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
I pretended to be sick to make Grandpa worried.

73
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,060
I even

74
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,540
hid in the trunk

75
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,340
because I wanted to go on a business trip with my parents.

76
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,580
But in the end,

77
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,260
they saw through my tricks every time.

78
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,820
Your methods were too stupid.

79
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,020
No wonder they saw through your tricks.

80
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,980
What happened later?

81
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,940
Later?

82
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,780
Later,

83
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
my parents passed away.

84
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,530
They saved people all over the world,

85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
but they couldn't be with me to see me grow up.

86
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,700
Are you mad at them?

87
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,180
Why?

88
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,860
Because I know

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,580
when I was missing them,

90
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,620
they were also

91
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,540
missing me a hundred, a thousand times more.

92
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,580
It must be like this.

93
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,900
Hm.

94
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,180
So

95
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,620
we must make ourselves better

96
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,100
when they are not with us.

97
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,620
We should let them know

98
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,660
as long as they love us,

99
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,700
we will grow up healthily and happily.

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,460
We should also let them know

101
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,820
we are never their burden

102
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,420
and we can be good kids that make them proud.

103
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,500
How can I make them proud?

104
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,860
First,

105
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,409
you need to recover.

106
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,580
Understand?

107
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,340
Mom said when I recover,

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
I can dance with her

109
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,260
and I can become the chief in the future.

110
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,290
Hm.

111
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,180
You can do it.

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,070
Come on.

113
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,380
They asked you to be a judge in the Nansi Comics Competition.

114
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,740
It's a great opportunity to gain both fame and fortune.

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,820
And you refused without asking me?

116
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,500
Do you still take me as your agent?

117
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,260
Nansi contacted me again just now.

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,340
What's wrong?

175
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,900
Too spicy.

176
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,100
Look at you. You can't handle too spicy food, but you still like eating this.

177
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,690
Drink this to help with the spiciness.

178
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
She said...

179
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,060
I can't believe she said I'm not suitable for being a doctor.

180
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,900
That kid...

181
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,420
She was

182
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,220
right about me.

183
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,410
If you are not suitable for being a doctor,

184
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,770
why did you study medicine?

185
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,020
Because I promised my parents.

186
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,940
Look.

187
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,300
In terms of keeping promises,

188
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,620
even without supervision,

189
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,420
you can stick to your principles.

190
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,340
That's exactly what doctors do.

191
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,540
Of course.

192
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,700
My parents saved so many people.

193
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,260
I must do what they said.

194
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,420
And before they passed away,

195
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,460
they told my grandpa

196
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,980
to let me study medicine.

197
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,700
Even if

198
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,220
I can't help others,

199
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,860
I must be able to protect myself.

200
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
Who said you can't help others?

201
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,980
You can draw, right?

202
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,500
Draw?

203
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,300
Can

204
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,180
I save people by drawing?

205
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,860
Yes.

206
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,900
Who told me

207
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,260
mental anguish is also a disease?

208
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,060
If you make someone sad

209
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,620
become happy again through your works,

210
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,900
that means you've healed his wounded heart, right?

211
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,010
Let me take another example.

212
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,020
I understand.

213
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,260
It's like this.

214
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,300
Kids who don't want to communicate with others

215
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,980
can express their perception of the world

216
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,380
by drawing pictures.

217
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,820
So drawing is a bridge

218
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,100
for them to communicate with the outside world.

219
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,220
Then I can do better

220
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,500
than my mom's wish.

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,380

How is the patient in the No. 13 bed now?

224
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,380
High pressure is 140, and low pressure is 95.

225
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,220
It's still a bit high.

226
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,980
Okay, I'll pay attention to it.

227
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,740
I've delivered the medicine three times in the morning.

228
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,060
The patient just can't drink it.

229
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,060
She would vomit once she drank it.

230
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,580
I have no other way.

231
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,660
Why don't you check on her later?

232
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,620
Okay, I know. I'm going to check on her.

Playing games is not good for the stability of blood pressure.

I suggest you quit.

247

Of course I want it to recover.

These are healthy dishes that the hospital gave you.

As long as you exercise properly,

you can metabolize it even at your age.

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,380
But I need them to take care of me.

345
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,940
After I came back,

346
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,100
I saw the changes of my hometown.

347
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,300

348

349

can still make me cry.

350
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,700
I seized time to search for a land and build a tomb.

351

all thanks to you two.

354

that I can die with a smile.

356

I hope you two

357

358
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,820

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,620
What? Are you sleepy?

515
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,300
Nothing.

516
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,700
Come back quickly.

517
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,060
I'm on my way to the bus station.

518
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,860
Orange?

519
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
Orange?

520
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,500
He hit someone.

521
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,660
He ran away.

522
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,380
Is she okay?

523
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,140
-Call an ambulance now.
-What a jerk.

524
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,260
He ran away.

525
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,860
This man is so immoral.

526
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,380
Call an ambulance now.
