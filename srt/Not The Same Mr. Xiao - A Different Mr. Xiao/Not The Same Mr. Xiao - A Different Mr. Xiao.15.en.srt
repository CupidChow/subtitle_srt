The deficiency of lung Qi. The stagnation of Qi and blockage downward.

174
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,580
So what's wrong with me, Mr. Xiao?

175
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,180
Let me make it easy for you to understand.

176
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,140
It's the deficiency of kidneys.

177
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,420
Didn't you just say lungs?

178
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,620
Why are you talking about kidneys now?

179
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,900
There is a problem with his kidneys.

180
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,250
Let's talk about lungs then.

181
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,500
In terms of warming the lungs, moistening the lungs, ventilating the lungs, and purging the lungs of pathogenic fire,

182
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,900
where are we now?

183
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
He doesn't want a doctor.

184
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,380
He's only been here for two days.

185
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,020
He only asked for Miss Song.

186
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,340
Ouyang, that's not good.

187
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,180
Don't think I have solid basic knowledge

188
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,100
just because I'm a graduate.

189
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,180
Speaking of improving health,

190
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,820
Mr. Xiao is really good at it.

191
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,020
Take him back to drink medicine first.

192
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,820
Then I'm going to make up a prescription.

193
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,220
Fine.

194
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,900
Orange.

195
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,620
Hm?

196
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,700
Deliver the medicine to me later.

197
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,220
Sure.

198
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,060
Mr. Xiao,

199
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,220
what medicine should we give to Ouyang Yu?

200
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I know why there is a problem with his lungs.

201
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,860
He must have inhaled too much paint.

202
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,740
Look at those geniuses.

203
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,619
They are so smart

204
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,780
and they still work so hard.

205
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,819
How are ordinary people like us supposed to catch up with them?

206
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,339
I don't need to know

207
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,060
why he's sick.

208
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,220
Oh.

209
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,740
Lingli.

210
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,700
Let go of me.

211
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,090
No.

212
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,580
Let go!

213
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,180
Lingli.

214
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,620
Didn't you say you're here to recharge me?

215
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,060
It's almost the deadline of the comics competition.

216
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,380
I'm so busy.

217
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,210
I saw OY is a participant.

218
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,860
He must be the winner.

219
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,020
Then what are you busy with?

220
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,860
Lingli.

221
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,980
Why would we invite an artist to compete with you?

222
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,060
We invited him to be a judge.

223
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,660
But he refused.

224
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,380
Then

225
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,620
why has he signed up for the topic selection?

226
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,100
He signed up for his friend.

227
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,620
Her name is Song Yiju.

228
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
He signed up for her.

229
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,020
Song Yiju?

230
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,740
Yes, it's her.

231
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,020
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

232
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,020
I was so worried.

233
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,060
But Lingli,

234
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,580
you have to take it seriously this time.

235
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,970
Don't let your guard down.

236
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,020
What do you mean?

237
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,140
Although Song Yiju is a medical student,

238
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,540
her works submitted in the preliminary contest...

239
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm not an expert in this.

240
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,660
But Nansi said she might be a dark horse.

241
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Let's go eat.

242
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's go.

243
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,860
Don't blame me. This is all your fault.

244
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,180
If I hadn't been surrounded...

245
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,180
Be careful.

246
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,010
Dead, huh?

247
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,620
I'll drive in the next round.

248
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Gosh.

249
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,260
Did you draw these?

250
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,660
Thank you.

251
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,620
They are not very impressive.

252
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,980
What?

253
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,740
Do you think

254
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,380
drawing is all about expressing?

255
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,540
You don't care about basic skills at all.

256
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,180
You are just exaggerating.

257
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,300
Look at the lines.

258
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,660
It's horrible.

259
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
But

260
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,980
this is the best I can do now.

261
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,860
If I were you,

262
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,940
I would have given up

263
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,420
if this is the best I can do.

264
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,100
Well.

265
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,740
Who are you?

266
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,460
-Pay close attention to this patient.
-Miss Zhang.

267
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,980
Our hospital is totally in a mess now.

268
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,860
That patient named Luo Lingli

269
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,260
doesn't want to put on the hospital gown.

270
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
She

271
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,940
is

272
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,260
a patient?

273
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,020
I wonder

274
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,820
why these comics boys and girls

275
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,460
came here for health preservation.

276
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,940
Maybe it's because of love.

277
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
She kept asking me

278
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,620
about Ouyang Yu in the VIP ward.

279
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,460
Orange.

280
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,140
Aren't you familiar with Ouyang Yu?

281
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,140
Why don't you deliver the medicine for me later?

282
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,180
I really can't bear to see that scene.

283
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,460
What scene?

284
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,540
You'll know when you get there.

285
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,900
I'm going to take a look

286
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,780
at the medicine.

287
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,060
You...

288
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,780
Ouyang Yu.

289
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,100
Do you like me?

290
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,020
Do you become shy when you see me?

291
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,820
I like you?

292
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm afraid of you. How could I like you?

293
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,460
I got hurt.

294
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,060
Won't you help me relieve the pain?

295
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,300
We are in a hospital.

296
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,980
It's easy to get a thorn out.

297
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,140
Ouyang Yu.

298
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,180
You're funny.

299
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,500
You are exactly the type of people I like.

300
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,740
Don't move.

301
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,020
If you take another step, I'll call the police.

302
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,860
I'll help you call the police.

303
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,900
You...

304
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,580
What are you doing?

305
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,530
Which law says I can't like you?

306
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,460
Ouyang Yu.

307
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,980
Time to drink medicine.

308
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,060
Here comes a professional doctor.

309
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,340
Help her get a thorn out.

310
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
You are a doctor?

311
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,900
My finger is pricked. Take a look.

312
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,900
Let me see.

313
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,970
What are you doing? It hurts.

314
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,540
Are you okay?

315
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm okay.

316
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,900
You got scalded...

317
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,700
Stay away.

318
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,380
You kept harassing me. I tolerated it.

319
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,860
But you hurt someone, you know?

320
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,460
I hope you know what you're doing.

321
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,500
Get out.

322
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm also a patient here.

323
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,820
Why can't I stay here?

324
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,900
I'm asking you to get out.

325
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,580
Are you okay, Orange?

326
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,100
I'm fine. I'm not that fragile.

327
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,620
I'll deliver another bowl of medicine to you later.

328
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,690
How do you know that girl?

329
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,370
She's a painting expert?

330
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Her?

331
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,050
When I was queuing...

332
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
It's nothing important.

333
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,940
How's your leg?

334
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,660
I've recovered a long time ago.

335
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,700
I can jump very high.

336
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,260
Don't jump.

337
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,220
Song Yiju.

338
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,980
What?

339
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,810
How many times have I told you?

340
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,460
Don't disturb patients in the ward.

341
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,420
Since I'm a patient,

342
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,300
why can't Song Yiju take care of me?

343
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,850
She's just an intern.

344
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,780
She can't take care of patients alone.

345
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,020
What if

346
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,940
I want to give a chance to this intern?

347
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,100
I'm sorry.

348
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,420
As her supervisor,

349
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,660
I don't allow my intern to make any mistake.

350
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,460
The medicine...

351
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,860
Let Yu Xinxin do it.

352
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,500
Which part is not good?

353
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,660
Which part is wrong?

354
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,260
Which part is not good?

355
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,700
Which part is not good?

356
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,900
Everything is great.

357
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,860
Well.

358
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,290
The authentic works

359
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,860
are even more impressive than the illustrations you sent me.

360
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,380
Are you sure you're not comforting me?

361
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,220
I want you to modify them for me.

362
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,380
Great Artist.

363
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,660
Don't.

364
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,660
You're a great artist now.

365
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,820
Here.

366
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Have some snacks.

367
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,260
Let's eat while talking.

368
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,860
These are all my favorite snacks.

369
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,610
How do you know what I like?

370
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,620
Well.

371
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,300
You stayed at my house for two days.

372
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,900
If I don't know what you like to eat,

373
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,260
I would be too stupid, right?

374
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,940
Good for you.

375
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,460
How did you come up with this idea?

376
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,380
You drew life and death together with the universe.

377
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,740
Well.

378
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,420
It's not just my idea.

379
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,860
I was inspired by someone.

380
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,220
Who?

381
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
Song Yiju.

382
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,260
Are you planning to establish a studio here?

383
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,060
Sir,

384
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,260
from now on,

385
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,420
please don't disturb my intern when she's studying and working.

386
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,180
Mr. Xiao is so strict.

387
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,580
An intern doesn't even have time for lunch?

388
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,100
Is this the lunch you prepared?

389
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,900
Of course not.

390
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,380
Orange.

391
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,570
Didn't you say the mutton in the third canteen is delicious?

392
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
I'm going to buy it for you.

393
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,260
What?

394
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
It's true that we can't just eat snacks for lunch.

395
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,420
It's not healthy.

396
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,060
Mr. Xiao.

397
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,420
I just...

398
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,540
It's almost the deadline.

399
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,140
I just wanted to ask his opinion.

400
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,900
I promise

401
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,620
it won't influence my work.

402
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,860
You can draw in the office in the future.

403
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,210
No one will disturb you.

404
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,460
What?

405
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,500
What you drew

406
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,220
is great.

407
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,860
It should still be popular in many years.

408
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,810
How do you know

409
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,820
it will still be popular in many years?

410
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,500
I

411
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,540
guessed.

412
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,980
Let's go.

413
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,340
Okay.
