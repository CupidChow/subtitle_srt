a candlelight dinner on the lake.

178
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
Then I'll set off fireworks.

179
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,980
What do you think?

180
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,780
Bocui Fireworks Festival?

181
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,890
Who says guys don't like romance?

182
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,900
They just like

183
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,380
bigger flowers.

184
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,100
So,

185
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
setting off fireworks

186
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,580
is the best choice.

187
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,220
You also think this is good?

188
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,940
Yes.

189
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,980
I'll pick you up at the hospital tomorrow

190
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,860
and you help me set up the place.

191
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,980
No problem.

192
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,340
It's decided. Cheers.

193
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,820
Okay.

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,700
One is controlled at 23 to 25 degrees

195
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,780
and the other is at 25 to 28 degrees.

196
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,940
Don't worry, Professor Song.

197
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,860
Dr. Xiao.

198
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,020
You're still here?

199
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,060
Why are you back?

200
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,460
I was going home,

201
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,660
but I forgot to bring the rent renewal contract back.

202
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,300
I have to bring it back to the landlord.

203
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
I'll talk to you later.

204
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,540
I'm leaving.

205
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,220
Okay.

206
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,820
Was that her?

207
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,420
Wei, you can count on me.

208
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,100
I’m an expert

209
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,580
in this.

210
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,540
Okay?

211
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,820
Morning, Orange.

212
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,460
Morning.

213
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,020
How is it? Are you busy today?

214
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,540
I'm busy tonight.

215
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,500
I brought you something good today.

216
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,420
What is it?

217
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,140
So mysterious.

218
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,340
You'll definitely need it today.

219
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,540
Underhanded trick.

220
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,300
This...

221
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,420
It's...

222
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,140
a perfume sachet pendant?

223
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,540
Yes.

224
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,370
A pendant for the sachet.

225
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,060
You hang it to the sachet.

226
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,100
You made an entire set.

227
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,580
It's quite good.

228
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,100
But there's no need to give me a little every day.

229
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,180
It's quite good.

230
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Quite good.

231
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,660
Thank you.

232
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,020
Sit down.

233
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,340
On the table.

234
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,860
Yes.

235
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,770
I said

236
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,780
you will need it today.

237
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,660
There's no mistake.

238
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,100
Why is it gone?

239
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,500
Orange.

240
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,740
Actually, that gift. I...

241
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,700
I...

242
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,780
I know, I understand.

243
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,980
-Wei.
-Orange.

244
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,460
Ouyang Yu.

245
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,020
Hello.

246
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,460
Why are you here?

247
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,099
I'm here to recuperate.

248
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,980
Are you going out together?

249
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,020
I'm going to confess my feelings

250
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,300
and Orange is helping me set up the place.

251
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,180
Confess your feelings?

252
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,460
Then I'll help too.

253
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I'll give support to your romance.

254
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,099
Okay?

255
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,020
Get in.

256
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,859
With more people, we can work faster.

257
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,900
Why are you here?

258
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,940
The VIP patient left the hospital without permission.

259
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,500
I have to make sure he's safe.

260
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Your appearance is much scarier.

261
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,260
Let's not talk about unrelated stuff.

262
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,260
-Go!
-Let's go.

263
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,020
[Xinya Hospital]

264
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,220
For this...

265
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,650
you should measure the distance.

266
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,700
Make sure they're the same distance apart.

267
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,020
No, no.

268
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,900
You should...

269
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,380
move it more to the front.

270
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,500
Ouyang Yu,

271
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,540
how do you open that sculpture?

272
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,460
I want to put my wrist watch inside.

273
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,100
Wait, let me take a look.

274
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,940
It's... almost done.

275
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,100
I think it's almost done here too.

276
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,540
Let's go to the lake

277
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,620
and decorate it.

278
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,020
Let's go.

279
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,420
Look.

280
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,900
I pulled this hand

281
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,420
and moved the crown.

282
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,140
I even rotated this ball.

283
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,700
But I can't open it.

284
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm going to find Orange.

285
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,980
So stupid.

286
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,340
Hey.

287
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
What are you doing here?

288
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
What are you wearing?

289
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,420
I...

290
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
Can't I come?

291
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,540
We need to prepare more cakes.

292
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,540
She likes them. You should bring them to her later.

293
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,100
Okay.

294
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,460
Take this to Hall 1 later.

295
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,820
And the wine glass. Make it cleaner.

296
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,900
That's all.

297
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,380
Orange asked you to help out, right?

298
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,420
What are you performing?

299
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,220
Acrobatics.

300
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,140
Am I funny?

301
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,060
Why is Orange here?

302
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,780
She doesn't know Drizzle.

303
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,700
Boss,

304
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,300
are you going to prepare this nice-looking champagne

305
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,100
or this nice-tasting champagne?

306
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
You're preparing champagne?

307
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,860
Do you know Drizzle?

308
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,100
Ridiculous.

309
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
You're Mr. Smart?

310
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,500
Yes.

311
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,820
You are...

312
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,740
Drizzle?

313
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,980
You're right.

314
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,460
The risk of online dating is too high.

315
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
You liar, why did you pretend to be a sweet guy?

316
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,410
How am I a liar?

317
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,140
I didn't pretend to be a sweet guy.

318
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,740
When we were talking,

319
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
didn't you also pretend

320
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,940
to be gentle?

321
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,810
If I knew it was you, I wouldn't have pretended.

322
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,340
See? You admit it.

323
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,620
You deceived a good guy.

324
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,260
You're a good guy?

325
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,620
You're just cosplaying Black and White Impermanence.

326
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,500
Black and White Impermanence have feelings too.

327
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,100
You deceived my feelings.

328
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,780
Deceived your feelings? Bah!

329
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,250
I'm telling you, I'll beat you

330
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,260
every time I see you.

331
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,580
Then I'll...

332
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,130
avoid you every time I see you.

333
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
Hello.

334
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,340
You're here.

335
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,580
I still have a lot of things to do.

336
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,060
Give me some time.

337
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,140
I know you haven't finished your task.

338
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,380
That's why I turned a blind eye

339
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,820
to your expired visa.

340
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,140
But Xiao Jing,

341
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,890
I'm a civil servant of the Time Management Bureau.

342
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,020
I'm not a shepherd.

343
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,380
Look.

344
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,820
How many times did I let you go?

345
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,540
You're going too far.

346
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,820
The magnetic field is getting worse.

347
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,180
I came here because I had no choice.

348
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
I...

349
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,140
I'll try to be careful.

350
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,180
You must be careful.

351
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,220
You're an illegal time-traveler now.

352
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,380
Don't forget your mission

353
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,420
and your sister.

354
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,300
I think

355
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,740
you're too deeply involved now.

356
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,580
No.

357
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,540
You can't continue to affect this place.

358
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,980
No matter if it's the celestial phenomena

359
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
or the people

360
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,530
and their fates.

361
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,050
I don't need to remind you about the consequences.

362
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,100
Bo Yan.

363
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,100
Do you know something?

364
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,700
Did you know I was destined to come here early

365
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
and meet her?

366
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,530
Tell me.

367
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,340
What happened

368
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,940
between me and her?

369
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,340
Did I affect her

370
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,380
or did she affect me?

371
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,740
Maybe

372
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,260
it's something that escaped from space and time.

373
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,100
I can't see what is going to happen

374
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,420
between you two.

375
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,010
However,

376
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,660
you won't bring her any good result.

377
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,660
Don't forget.

378
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
You are going back.

379
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,100
If you tell me

380
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,580
you want to play with her feelings.

381
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,340
Fine.

382
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,020
I have no objections.

383
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,770
But don't get yourself involved.

384
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,290
You still have one and a half months.

385
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,300
If you trigger these phenomena

386
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,420
before the mission is completed,

387
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,660
I'll have to take you back

388
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,060
and make you guard the space-time rift.

389
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,620
I'm going.

390
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,050
Orange.

391
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,620
She's fine.

392
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,620
Who are you?
