in 100 different ways.

177
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,820
Right?

178
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,980
Look.

179
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,380
You just found you have 100 weak points

Fine.

186
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,660
Let's start with what you're good at.

187
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,100
What are you good at?

188
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,940
Massage, acupuncture,

189

190
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
You studied Chinese Medicine for five years

192

I...

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,900
I like legally abusing bodies.

194

Can't I?

195
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,620
Fine.

196
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Ask the nurse for a set of needles.

197
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,260
Let's see what you're good at.

Why did you get me out?

Aren't you afraid of me being caught?

202
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,060
What's wrong with a patient being seen?

203
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,540
Patient?

204
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,820
Who is the patient?

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,260
Me?

206
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,420
Otherwise, how can Song Yiju show her talent?

207
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,220
You want Song Yiju to insert needles into my body?

208
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,180
Look.

My perfect artificial skin technique.

210
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,020
Look at my flexible skin.

211
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,220
Look at my smooth skin.

212
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,540
Can you bear to see it?

213
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,660
Enough.

214
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,260
If you get hurt,

215
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll get you a new skin.

216

Really?

217
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,970
I want the BI014 newly released at the press conference.

218
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,980
I heard that the new skin

219

220
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,660

These topics are so similar.

228

Are you also the candidates?

229
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,100
Yes.

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,700
Sort of.

Nansi is so weird this time.

There are only 20 of us,

Everyone has a topic.

235
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,100
Isn't that unfair?

236
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,260
If someone gets a good topic,

237
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,700
the score will be higher.

238

That's why they have these similar topics.

239

The difference in between

240

is for the candidates to show their capabilities.

241
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,060
So,

which topic do you want to choose?

It doesn't hurt anymore.

Should I pull it or not?

I'll choose Wind Chasing.

Let's go. Let's do the rounds.

My good friend is here.

What's going on?

356
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,580
Good friend?

357
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,100
I heard you didn't take your medicine today.

358
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,580
It's because you didn't come to see me this morning.

359
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,580
That's because I was in a consultation today.

360
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,420
I also needed to supervise my intern,

361
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,220
but I didn't send the medicine.

362

He's so gentle.

363
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,020
But the medicine they got me is bitter than the medicine from you.

364
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,540
It must be because you didn't take it in time.

365
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,980
The medicine will be bitter when it's cold.

366
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,700

367
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,260
take a big sip of it,

368
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
then it won't taste bit.

371
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,060

00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,660
Dr. Xiao is your good friend.

525
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,500
Dr. Xiao is yours, okay?

526
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,820
Smile.

527
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,140
Don't cry.

528
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,500
Smile.

529
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,460
Devil.

530
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,780
Song Yiju.

531
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,900
Song Yiju.

532
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,100
Xu Jialu is looking for you.

533
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,820
Coming.

534
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,460
She messes up with me every day.

535
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,340
No. 8 is calling.

536
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,700
No. 8 is calling.

537
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,220
I want to have every one of them.

538
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,180
Coming.

539
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,620
Miss, this is for you.

540
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,380
What now?

541
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,220
I think the temperature is too low.

542
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,540
I'm a little cold.

543
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,500
What is this?

544
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,500
Remote control.

545
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,900
Like this.

546
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,780
And this.

547
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,340
Is it difficult?

548
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,380
No.

549
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,900
But if I go like this,

550
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,660
I'm afraid I'll have irregular heartbeat.

551
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,739
Have you heard

552
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,060
the story of Wolves Are Coming?

553
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,100
Lady.

554
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,780
Your story is really old.

555
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,860
Yes.

556
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,260
Hello?

557
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,100
Mr. Smart, where are you?

558
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,820
Come to the hospital to pick me up.

559
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,219
I'm going to drink until dawn.

560
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,300
I quit.

561
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,500
I quit.

562
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,780
Why don't you pull over closer?

563
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,580
Isn't this the pick-up point?

564
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,500
Everything is not going well.

565
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,020
What's happening now?

566
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,820
You don't understand the world of the poor.

567
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,380
Take me to vent.

568
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,580
Let's go.

569
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,300
She's going out at this hour.

570
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,020
I'll see if she can come back at nine.

571
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,270
[9:00 p.m.]

572
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,260
Do you think

573
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,010
she wants to come back at nine?

574
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,530
Why?

575
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,100
Then why did you let her serve that devil during the day?

576
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,060
Because she went on a date with Ouyang Yu during the day.

577
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,340
I thought she was not busy enough.

578
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,140
Boss.

579
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,380
It was her lunch break.

580
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,580
She could also have lunch with me

581
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,620
during lunch break.

582
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,660
Interesting.

583
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,500
Have you seen any employee having lunch with the boss?

584
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,370
Have you seen any student having lunch with the teacher?

585
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,700
Have you seen any…

586
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,260
I'm not leaving.

587
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,980
I won't get out!

588
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,260
I won't get out! I won't get out!

589
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,340
Xiao Jing, are you a human?

590
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,460
Hasn't he gone too far?

591
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,020
Yes, he's gone too far.

592
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,860
[Mr. Smart: Drizzle hasn’t been updated for days. Are you preparing a surprise for your fans?]

593
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,300
Why do you think he's gone too far?

594
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
He's just done it.

595
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,660
We have to teach him a lesson.

596
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,820
Really, he's gone too far. If I…

597
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,100
I've ordered. Use my card.

598
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,660
I won't need it anymore anyway.

599
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,020
Hey.

600
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,220
This is not a fraud shop.

601
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,970
You can return the card.

602
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,720
[Drizzle: Nothing.]

603
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,660
Boss.

604
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,300
Can we

605
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,940
get drunk today?

606
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,260
It's easy for you to get drunk,

607
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,420
but it's hard for me.

608
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,180
I don't know

609
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,360
[Mr. Smart: Drizzle is indeed a heroine.]

610
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,380
how many times you got drunk with me.

611
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,020
Today is my thanks party.

612
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,180
Thank you two for helping me at school.

613
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,390
[Mr. Smart: You have to throw bowls when you drink.]

614
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,940
So, can you two

615
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,780
stop fighting today?

616
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,820
Stop fighting!

617
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,940
Stop fighting!

618
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
[My friend is in trouble. I need to help her.]

619
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,210
[Drizzle: What?]

620
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,910
[Drizzle: You think there's a filter for me? Am I actually Lu Zhishen?]

621
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,970
[Smart: I don't think so. Don't think too much.]

622
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,220
Let me tell you.

623
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,860
[Others can tell at a glance.]

624
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,580
I finally experienced

625
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,410
[Our Drizzle is a beautiful lady.]

626
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
the hardship at work today.

627
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,580
What's wrong with kids'

628
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,060
aesthetics nowadays?

629
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,700
[Mr. Smart: I just want to say you are loyal to friends.]

630
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,300
I can't believe she likes Xiao Jing.

631
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,900
I mean, she likes Xiao Jing.

632
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,380
Xiao Jing is handsome.

633
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,580
When did you turn blind?

634
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,980
Come to our hospital.

635
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:44,900
It's free.

636
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,440
[Drizzle: That's true. I'm with a friend now.]

637
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
Nonsense.

638
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,330
[She seems angry.]

639
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,500
Look at you.

640
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,380
What?

641
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
Have you fallen in love?

642
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,010
[I don't know how to persuade her.]

643
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,970
Bah!

644
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,650
I...

645
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,740
Let me tell you

646
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,880
[Don't try to comfort her.]

647
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,300
Can you

648
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,860
get the key point here?

649
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,980
Am I talking about his looks?

650
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm talking about

651
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,460
his…

652
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,700
[Mr. Smart: Isn't Drizzle staying with her the best comfort?]

653
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,660
The whole

654
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,780
attitude.

655
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,740
Right.

656
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,820
His attitude.

657
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,860
It's about his attitude.

658
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,580
Is his attitude worth complaining about?

659
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,100
Isn't it?

660
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,460
Yes.

661
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,780
As Orange's friend,

662
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,060
I must punish him.

663
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,980
That's right.

664
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,620
Flattering.

665
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,500
Don't think you can work your way up

666
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,940
by flattering like this.

667
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
We've been friends for more than ten years.

668
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,760
[Mr. Smart: It's a blessing to be friends with Drizzle.]

669
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,900
You can't make new friends if you've already had old friends.

670
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,260
Everyone only accompanies each other for a journey.

671
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,620
We never know when it's time for you to get off.

672
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,500
What did you say?

673
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,700
I said you're almost there.

674
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,220
I'll pull you off when I get there.

675
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,160
[Drizzle: Not everyone is as considerate as you.]

676
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,870
[Drizzle: You're a nice person and you're good at comforting others.]

677
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,060
[Wouldn't it be happier to be your friend?]

678
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,650
[Then try it.]

679
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,850
[Sure.]

680
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,500
Can you two

681
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,660
put down your phones?

682
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,180
Are your phones planted in your hands?

683
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,740
Can't we talk face to face?

684
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,510
[There's someone I dislike in front of me right now.]

685
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,060
You wanna talk?

686
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,730
[Drizzle: Want to be saved.]

687
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,130
[Mr. Smart: Leave it to me! I have a friend. A real friend.]

688
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,040
[He runs a restaurant.]

689
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,450
[Drizzle, when are you free? I'll take you there.]

690
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,260
What's so great about you?

691
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,100
Do you think you can handle everything

692
