00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,520
Yes.

175
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,380
Yes.

176
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,820
Yes.

177
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Very reminiscent.

178
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,560
Don't worry.

179
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,030
I will go to your son and daughter again today.

180
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,620
I will persuade them.

181
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,640
It's enough for me to just look at it.

182
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,850
I...

183
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,720
I won't be able to go back.

184
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,890
I won't be able to go back.

185
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,320
I won't.

186
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,870
With your father's current condition,

187
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,520
maintaining it is the main purpose.

188
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,190
In terms of maintaining it,

189
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,860
all hospitals can do it.

190
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,190
I can help you

191
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,340
contact the No.1 People's Hospital in your hometown.

192
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,530
Then your father

193
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,320
can fulfill his wish

194
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,950
while receiving treatment.

195
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,890
What do you think?

196
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,810
Actually,

197
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,630
about my dad's wish...

198
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,480
I...

199
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,350
I always

200
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,760
know it.

201
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,970
But...

202
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,710
But it's a long journey.

203
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,910
I'm afraid...

204
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Don't worry.

205
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,670
We'll have a medical team to escort him.

206
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,820
The basic safety can be guaranteed.

207
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,350
Dad.

208
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,730
Dad.

209
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,760
Let's go home.

210
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,990
Dad.

211
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,880
Let's go home.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,350
Going home?

213
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,490
Let's go home.

214
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,760
Son.

215
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,120
Let me go home.

216
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,690
Come and sit.

217
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,140
Not bad, Xiao.

218
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,490
You're a good helper.

219
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,230
Am I a helper?

220
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,790
I'm the main player, OK?

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,240
Yes.

222
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,960
Dr. Xiao is wise and powerful.

223
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,950
You set a good example for us.

224
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,810
Your painting

225
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,750
is good.

226
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,630
This is the first time I've heard you praise me.

227
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,590
Can you praise me again?

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,650
Just praise me again.

229
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,610
I didn't hear you clearly.

230
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,800
How about I praise you first,

231
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,290
then you praise me again?

232
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,610
Dr. Xiao, you're great.

233
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,530
You're so handsome.

234
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,230
You're amazing.

235
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,060
Praise me.

236
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,710
[Trust yourself. No matter what,  I'm supporting you.]

237
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,510
[Don't think about others first. Ask yourself how you feel. If you can't satisfy both sides, don't hurt yourself]

238
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,090
Thank you.

239
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,850
You seem to know me the best in the world.

240
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,420
Great.

241
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,500
Sorry, Ouyang.

242
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,650
I'm late.

243
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,910
Are you ready for the surprise?

244
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,630
Wow.

245
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,180
Oh my god.

246
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,950
Did you do this?

247
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,630
You're amazing.

248
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,190
It's you who's amazing.

249
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,260
These are all your works.

250
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,290
What do you think?

251
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,940
Do you like it?

252
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,380
No.

253
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,390
How can you just ask whether I like it?

254
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,750
I'm about to fall for it.

255
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,170
I've never seen my work

256
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,860
in such a big exhibition hall.

257
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,430
There's a small model inside.

258
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,430
Go find it.

259
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,010
There's more?

260
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,530
I'll go take a look.

261
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,170
OK.

262
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,380
Yes.

263
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,500
We've hired a rookie,

264
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,410
but the main curator is still OY.

265
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,380
That hasn't changed.

266
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,590
But I made a deal when I invested.

267
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,380
I only invested in OY,

268
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,410
A.K.A. Ouyang Yu.

269
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,240
I didn't expect you to use my investment to cultivate a rookie.

270
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,900
We didn't cultivate the rookie.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
We absorbed her creativity.

272
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,570
I don't care.

273
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,690
At today's exhibition, not a single mention of Song Yiju's name

274
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,520
can be found.

275
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,550
We have never thought about monopolizing

276
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,950
or directly using other people's ideas.

277
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,740
If we can't report

278
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,770
the name of the creator,

279
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,460
I don't think we need to hold this exhibition.

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,190
OY.

281
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,920
If you leave with her now,

282
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,150
I won't invest anymore.

283
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,050
Let's go.

284
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,859
Let's go. It's OK.

285
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,320
Hello, Professor Song.

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,230
Xiao Jing.

287
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,300
The plan has changed.

288
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,850
I can't go back on time.

289
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,030
Little Orange's exam is coming.

290
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,290
Keep an eye on her for me.

291
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,090
OK.

292
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,040
Don't worry.

293
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,930
What's wrong with my brain?

294
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,430
You're obviously

295
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,390
a pioneer artist.

296
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,730
Well...

297
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,630
Orange.

298
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,350
I...

299
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,930
didn't mean to hide it from you.

300
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,030
No.

301
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,310
I was too ignorant.

302
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,340
I even taught you to fix the color before.

303
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,000
I was showing off my skills to a master.

304
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,670
It was my fault.

305
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,500
I didn't tell you in time,

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,780
causing you financial difficulties

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,860
and making you work.

308
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,830
But you

310
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,550
gave me a chance to work

311
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,900
and made me earn a lot of money.

312
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,610
Did you give me your portion to me?

313
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,350
How is that possible?

314
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,690
No.

315
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,170
That's good.

316
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,740
To be honest, I'm sorry

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,530
for causing you so much trouble.

318
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,570
Not at all.

319
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,080
I really think your drawing is good.

320
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,050
And you have a good perception.

321
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,430
What?

322
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,100
You don't trust my taste?

323
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,140
No.

324
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,560
I simply feel that my abilities

325
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,730
fall short of working at your OY Studio.

326
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,300
But now I'm taking this shortcut.

327
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,110
No.

328
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,220
Look.

329
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,530
You just approved my taste, right?

330
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,020
Actually, I'm here to tell you this.

331
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,740
Through this calendar project,

332
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,420
I think your understanding of color

333
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,070
is exactly the same as mine.

334
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,500
I've talked to Shen Zhengping.

335
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,940
I hope you can join our studio.

336
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,910
Oh no.

337
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,690
Hurry up.

338
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Wouldn't you stop?

339
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,510
Then let's make a closure today.

340
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
Open them.

341
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,820
What?

342
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,690
Open them all.

343
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,710
Open them all?

344
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,500
Open the wine.

345
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,860
[OY Studio Employment Agreement]

346
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,780
I know

347
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,520
you just want to help me.

348
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,320
But you don't have to

349
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,500
ruin your reputation

350
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,560
because you want to help me.

351
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,720
I do like drawing,

352
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,220
but I also know

353
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,730
that liking something and having the ability

354
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,120
are not necessarily connected.

355
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,660
It's like

356
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,580
some people like singing,

357
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,880
but they can't sing well.

358
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,750
Some people like dancing,

359
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,860
but they lack coordination in their limbs.

360
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,370
I like drawing.

361
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,800
Maybe if I work harder,

362
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,230
I can become someone

363
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,050
who can draw.

364
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,840
But

365
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,010
compared to a genius player like you,

366
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,090
I'm not at the same level.

367
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,390
Orange.

368
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,770
You're really good at drawing.

369
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,020
Thank you.

370
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,270
Everyone in school

371
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,290
knows

372
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,880
my grandpa is a Chinese medicine professor.

373
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,850
He always had all kinds of expectations on me.

374
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,270
So I've been taking shortcuts.

375
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,440
I've been thinking about

376
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,320
how to muddle through

377
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,350
and get the graduation certificate.

378
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,710
But these are just to get by.

379
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,720
But painting

380
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,230
is the only thing

381
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,070
that I can prove with my strength.

382
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,470
I want to see

383
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,130
how far I can go with my ability.

384
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,760
Anyway,

385
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,250
thank you

386
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,470
for these days.

387
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,820
Come on.

388
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,490
What did you pour?

389
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,370
What did you pour?

390
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,490
Are you...

391
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,820
OK?

392
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm the king.

393
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,140
Everyone

394
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,250
lists ten strengths about me.

395
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,640
You.

396
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,200
Beautiful, kind, fair.

397
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,620
You have a tall nose and a small mouth.

398
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,430
Your legs go on for miles.

399
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,860
The green pants look great.

400
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,470
You add on.

401
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,630
Your...

402
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,200
Eyebrows are very dark.

403
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,260
Very dark.

404
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,980
I'll drink.

405
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,100
I remember it seemed...

406
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,410
Someone said

407
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,850
if she comes to my bar again,

408
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,460
she'll dance on the stage.

409
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,440
Could it be

410
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,170
that someone's words

411
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,480
don't count?

412
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,360
Move.

413
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,790
Don't move.

414
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,740
OK, I won't move.

415
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,850
I won't move.

416
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,390
Let me help you.

417
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,800
Be good.

418
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,910
Your foreign wine

419
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,590
is pretty good.

420
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,340
Hey.

421
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm the king now.

422
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,220
Everyone, listen to me.

423
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,280
The two people

424
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,580
holding the five of spades and the five of hearts

425
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,020
should kiss each other.

426
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:17,570
Kiss.

427
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,430
How about

428
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,980
we play a different game?

429
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,110
Bravo!

430
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,750
Bravo!

431
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,780
Stop reheating it.

432
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,320
How many times did you reheat it?

433
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,540
What time is it? Why isn't she back yet?

434
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,530
It's not midnight yet.

435
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,690
Midnight?

436
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,370
Is she planning to return only by midnight?

437
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,590
She didn't answer my calls or reply to my messages.

438
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
What if she gets drunk

439
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,460
in the bar?

440
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,080
What if she runs into a bad guy?

441
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,850
What if she is cheated?

442
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,340
What if...

443
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,820
What if she meets someone she likes?

444
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,370
Not going home tonight,

445
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,400
laughing heartily tomorrow.

446
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,620
Hey.

447
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,490
Are you too concerned?

448
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:25,990
I...

449
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,430
I'm following Professor Song's plan.

450
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,580
Professor Song didn't say that she's not allowed to go out and have fun.

451
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,170
Who are you?

452
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,090
Who are you?

453
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,220
♫Farewell day is a special day♫

454
