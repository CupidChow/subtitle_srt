00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,020
Why are you here?

6
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,010
Is it appropriate to make a girl drunk like this

7
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
at night?

8
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,180
You are

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,980
in a girl's house at night.

10
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,300
Do you think it's appropriate?

It's my treat today.

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,260
Leave the rest to me.

19
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,820
You can go out now.

20
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,100
I'm her teacher.

21
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,180
I don't want to have a class.

22
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,220
Shouldn't

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,450
a teacher be in the college?

24
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,460
What?

25
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,580
Do college students need tutors now?

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,140
Her grandpa asked me to take care of her.

27
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,820
Then I'll take care of her with you.

28

After all,

29
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780
she drank wine at my place.

30
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,300
It's good that you've realized your mistake.

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,460
Don't take her to drink so much next time.

32
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,380
Maybe Mr. Xiao is old.

33
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,100
You can't remember some things clearly.

34
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,220
At our age,

35
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,780
drinking is for celebration,

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,500
not for getting drunk.

37
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,020
Is there anything that is worth celebrating?

38
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,860
She can't even get enough credits.

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,500
Or in the eyes of delinquents like you,

40
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,540
everything is worth celebrating. Huh?

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,860
That makes sense.

42
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,620
After all, you are a college teacher.

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,780
You deal with so many students every day.

44
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,300
It's normal that you don't understand students.

Then please don't harass her.

49

Sure.

You can't.

as a teacher,

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,940
I can give you some pocket money.

You think it's bitter no matter what you eat?

101
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,340
It's because of the hangover.

If this continues,

You're really a good helper at home and during travel.

It's good you're awake.

126
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,460

You can be with him.

132
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,860

137
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,100
But now you are

138
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,980
criticizing me for my taste.

139
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,140
What do you mean?

140
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,220
I mean you have a bad taste in men.

Ouyang Yu?

144
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
He is not an ordinary person.

Do you know OY?

146
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,660
He is OY,

147
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,180
the first Chinese who can

148
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,700
exhibit his works at Saatchi Gallery at the age of 20.

149
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,540
And he

150
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,900
has never encountered any creation bottleneck.

151
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,340
You can never know

152
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
what is in his head.

153
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,180
If

154
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,700
you still don't feel anything for him,

155
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,900
it must be because

156
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,580
you haven't seen his exhibition.

157
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,940
As long as you go to his exhibition once,

158
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,300
you will definitely fall in love with him.

159
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,460
What's wrong?

160
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,820
Get off.

161
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,380
I'm asking you to get off.

162

Xiao Jing,

163
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,620
if you apologize to me now,

164
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,580
I can reluctantly forgive...

165
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,370
Three times.

166
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,300
Three times!

167
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,300
I will change my family name if I ride in your car again.

168
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,540
Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed?

169
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,740
Why do you care so much?

170
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,940
I think

171
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,380
Ouyang Yu is a nice guy.

172
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,380
Besides,

173
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,620
if Song Yiju is with Ouyang Yu,

174
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,740
we can stay away from her, right?

175
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,260
You get off too.

176
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,860
Xiao Jing.

177
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,340
How am I supposed to live without you?

178
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,820
Do you want some water?

179
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,220
I'm going to get you a glass of water.

180
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,740
Bye.

181
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,260
Actually, I think

182
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,460
we should

183
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,780
talk.

184
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,500
What's there to talk about?

185
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,900
We both are adults.

186
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,220
It's normal.

187
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,540
No. No. No.

188
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,860
Actually, I am

189
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,740
a man of virtue.

190
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,380
Although

191
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,420
I can't compensate you

192
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,540
physically or mentally,

193
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,940
if you need anything,

194
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,460
just come to me.

195
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,700
Who asked you to be responsible?

196
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,820
Why should you compensate me?

197
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,860
I was heartbroken yesterday and used you to relieve my boredom.

198
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,660
Think about how I should compensate you.

199
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,300
Well. It's a deal then.

200
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,500
No one should compensate anyone.

201
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,500
Xiaoxiao.

202
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,820
Xiaoxiao.

203
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,210
Orange, what took you so long?

204
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,780
I was dropped off again.

205
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,340
Xiaoxiao. Come on.

206
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,420
I've saved a seat for you.

207
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Excuse me.

208
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,450
Do you have your student ID card and ID card?

209
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,700
My student ID card. My student ID card.

210
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,339
Really? I reminded you.

211
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,339
I...

212
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,220
I used it to borrow some books from the library the day before yesterday.

213
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,220
And then...

214
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,819
I forgot what happened yesterday.

215
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,020
Think if it's somewhere else.

216
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,900
I'll get it for you.

217
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
I don't remember.

218
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,380
Where is your student ID card?

219
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,220
I...

220
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,620
Madam, what time is the deadline?

221
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,580
12:00.

222
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,060

-12:00?

[Sign-up Site]

224
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,300
How about this?

225
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,860
You queue here.

226
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,220
I'm going to the counselor. I'll help you.

227
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,980
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

228
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,140
Please move aside and keep looking, okay?

229
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,740
Okay.

230
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,500
Come on.

231
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,460
So handsome.

232
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,660
Okay.

233
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
It's almost the deadline.

234
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,780
You guys, come here.

235
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,500
Okay.

Have you found it?

238
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,820
It's almost the deadline.

239
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,260
No. Think again. Where did you put it?

240
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,460
I really don't remember where I put it.

241
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,620
Song Yiju from Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

242
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,540
Thank you.

243
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,060
Madam. I'm coming to sign up.

244
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,820
My handsome boy belongs to someone else.

245
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,420
You must try this dish.

246
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,820
It's my favorite.

247
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,260
And this.

248
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,460
It's Xiaoxiao's favorite.

249
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,820
You can try it too.

250
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,700
This one.

251
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,860
It's vegetables.

252
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,300
But in our canteen,

253
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,180
it has a special flavor.

254
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,180
Do you eat mutton?

255
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,380
The stewed mutton

256
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,900
in our No. 3 canteen is quite delicious.

257
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm going to get it for you.

258
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,100
I can't taste all the delicious food in one day.

259
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,700
I'll come to you and taste it next time.

260
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,380
Deal.

261
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,700
That's too little.

262
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm going to get you more.

263

Excuse me.

Which department are you from?

265
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,050
The galaxy.

266
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,020
The shredded potatoes are really good too.

267
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,780
Orange.

268

This is your extra meal.

269

Xiaoxiao, let me introduce.

270
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,660
This is my friend, Ouyang Yu.

271

This is my best friend, Gu Xiaoxiao.

272
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,100
Hello.

273
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,860
Xiaoxiao.

274
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,220
Sit down and eat with us.

275
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,860
No, I have a part-time job.

276
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,820
You guys eat.

277
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,380
Eat more.

278
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,900
Fine.

279
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,980
You know what?

280
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,500
You really impressed me today.

281
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
You were like my savior.

282
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,260
I impressed you?

283
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,500
A lot.

284
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,100
Oh, right.

285
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,140
Why did you have my student ID card?

286
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,930
You dropped it on the ground when you left that day.

287
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,340
I picked it up for you.

288
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,780
I wanted to deliver it to your house that day.

289
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,140
But

290
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,940
I found a man in your house.

291
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,940
He said he is your teacher.

292
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,900
Xiao Jing.

293
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
What kind of teacher is he?

294
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,220
He just gives classes for my grandpa.

295
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,860
What my grandpa did is unnecessary.

296
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,020
He's been on a business trip recently.

297
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,140
He asked his student to take care of me.

298
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,860
I think

299
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
he just wants to supervise me.

300
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,460
And he always plays tricks.

301
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,100
I've been having a hard time these days.

302
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,700
Did he bully you?

303
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,940
It's not that serious.

304
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,340
He's under 30 years old.

305
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,060
Every day,

306
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,140
he eats nutritional supplements

307
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,820
for health preservation.

308
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,700
It's like he wants to live to the age of 100.

309
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,220
And the soup he made

310
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,780
is so bitter.

311
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,180
Next time, throw it away.

312
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,460
Good idea.

313
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,780
Eat.

314
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,380
Okay.

315
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,620
Eat.

316
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,380
Okay. Eat.

317

Look, they are laughing again.

324
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,540
Can telling jokes

325
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,340
make food taste better?

326
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,460
Why don't you enable it on me?

And your eyes too.

329
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,140

Look at you.
