00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,890
This ticket has expired.

349
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,860
You even helped me wash my clothes.

350
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,540
You're so sweet, Xiaoxiao.

351
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,220
Wait.

352
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,780
Isn't this the ticket to my resort?

353
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,380
Are you going there?

354
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,980
Your

355
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,020
resort?

356
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,180
Yes.

357
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,280
Yes.

358
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,340
They gave it to me.

359
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,780
I have nothing else to do.

360
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,580
But luckily, it's not that busy.

361
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,380
Unlike my cousin, they are so busy every day.

362
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,020
Awesome.

363
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,700
If you want to go,

364
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,060
just tell me.

365
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,980
You don't need to buy tickets with me around.

366
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,060
Hey, tomorrow is the weekend.

367
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,500
Shall we go together tomorrow?

368
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,100
Okay.

369
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,980
Can I get a refund for the ticket?

370
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Let me love you.

371
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,900
I'll give you all I have.

372
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,140
Let me

373
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,540
love you.

374
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,220
I'll give…

375
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,010
Are you polite?

376
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,100
Obviously you are not.

377
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,220
Do you know what love is?

378
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,420
Obviously, you don't understand

379
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,420
what love is.

380
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,300
You have to be brave and say it out loud.

381
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,140
Love is eternity. Love is jealousy.

382
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,250
Love is rebel.

383
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,660
Let me love you.

384
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,140
I'll give you all I have.

385
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,100
Grandpa, I'm back.

386
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,580
Grandpa!

387
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,860
Orange, I'm leaving for the base.

388
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,300
Remember to have dinner.

389
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,270
♫The weather changed suddenly, and my world changed♫

390
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,620
♫The moment I put you in my heart♫

391
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,880
♫My heart is glowing♫

393

♫I hide those picture albums secretly♫

♫My beautiful dreams I can't afford♫

396
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,900
Hangover soup.

397
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,070
♫Rules have been changed♫

398
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,630

♫Can you look at me just once?♫

406
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,100
Don't buy so many vegetables at once.

407
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,020
We can't finish them all.

408
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,980
I don't want to buy them every day.

409
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,340
You have diabetes. You can't eat too much.

410
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,260
You need to control your diet.

411
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,060
-Do you hear me?
-They're all…

412
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,980
They're all vegetables.

413
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,580
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

414
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,220
Hello.

415
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,300
Hello.

416
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,340
Hold it from the bottom.

417
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,020
Okay.

418
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,980
It's heavy.

419
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,540
I'm carrying it from the top. You help hold it.

420
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,170
Okay.

421
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,700
Why did you buy so much?

422
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,420
Come on.

423
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,420
Thank you.

424
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,820
Xiao, look who's back.

425
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,820
Xiao Jing.

426
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,980
Why are you back?

427
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
I'm off today.

428
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,660
Honey.

429
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,980
Go to the market and buy shrimps.

430
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,380
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

431
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,900
My son loves braised prawns.

432
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,340
Mom.

433
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,340
Wait.

434
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,380
I'll cook you something delicious.

435
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,340
Hey, my son is back.

436
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Are you crazy?

437
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,220
You're so annoying after you woke up in the morning.

438
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,300
Where are you going

439
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,180
in the early morning?

440
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,540
What brings you here?

441
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I heard you were discharged.

442
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,340
I stayed up all night

443
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,140
so I could come to you as soon as possible.

444
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,260
Thank you so much.

445
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,860
I knew you were on a night shift.

446
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,700
Bye.

447
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,340
Wait.

448
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,820
Where are you going?

449
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,380
Why don't you take me out to play?

450
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,340
Big Orange, I'm not complaining.

451
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,500
It's just I found that we're not as close as we used to be.

452
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,580
Today,

453
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,980
no matter what happens,

454
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,460
we must walk around hand in hand.

455
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,260
I just

456
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,660
don't want you to feel awkward.

457
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,100
Are you kidding?

458
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,020
I'll never feel awkward.

459
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,780
Only others will feel so.

460
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,540
Awkward?

461
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,500
Orange.

462
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,540
It's too much. Let me help.

463
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,380
Thank you.

464
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,220
Get in the car first.

465
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,300
Didn't you say that we'll go together no matter what?

466
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,140
Get in the car.

467
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,050
This is awkward.

468
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,020
Are you waiting for me to hold your hand?

469
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,460
Don't you think

470
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,420
you two are a good match?

471
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,860
-No.
-No.

472
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,580
Braised prawns are ready.

473
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,780
You look at the lottery every day but never won.

474
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,690
Stop looking.

475
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,660
Come and eat.

476
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,420
Okay.

477
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,220
Let's eat.

478
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,020
Okay, my son is back.

479
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,740
Let's focus on the meal today.

480
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,380
We can have a drink.

481
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,220
In the past,

482
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,540
we were busy as doctors.

483
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,980
Now you're busy as a doctor.

484
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,820
It's rare for us to have a meal together.

485
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,100
Stop. No drinks.

486
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,260
Your dad has diabetes.

487
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
He needs to control his diet strictly.

488
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,730
Don't drink alcohol. Be good.

489
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,050
We've got an endoscopy doctor at home anyway.

490
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,940
Drink this.

491
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,740
This is for you.

492
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,060
I made vegetable soup for your dad.

493
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,500
Drink this.

494
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,810
I'm retired.

495
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,100
I won't treat him.

496
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,380
Dad, listen to Mom.

497
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,340
Drink this.

498
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,220
-Right.
-Okay.

499
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,460
Drink this.

500
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,740
Son.

501
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,220
You also need to take care of yourself, okay?

502
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,580
Okay.

503
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,620
There you go.

504
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,380
This is your favorite braised chicken when you were young.

505
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,180
Come on, try it.

506
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,340
See if my cooking is good as usual.

507
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,860
Okay.

508
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,900
It's good.

509
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,740
And shrimps.

510
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,180
After you went back,

511
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,220
your mom put too much oil.

512
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,730
If my son doesn't come back,

513
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,420
I won't cook this much.

514
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,780
Stop eating.

515
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,260
You haven't injected insulin yet, have you?

516
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,980
-I forgot.
-Put it down.
-I forgot.

517
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Where is it? I'll get it.

518
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,020
The second drawer of the fridge.

519
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,740
Look at you.

520
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,660
You're just like a child.

521
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,460
Why can't you remember your own thing?

522
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,900
I was so happy about my son's coming back that I forgot it.

523
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Come on.

524
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,340
You often forget it.

525
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,460
You need me to remind you.

526
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,540
You have to pay attention to it.

527
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,250
-Dad.
-Okay.

528
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,660
Let me see.

529
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,860
Look.

530
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,820
Twelve, come on.

531
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,220
-Okay, let's eat.
-Dig in.

532
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,380
Eat up.

533
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,980
My boy, you were too busy to come back.

534
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,420
I missed you so much.

535
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,700
Eat more today.

536
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,020
Mom, you too.

537
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,980
Okay.

538
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,420
Here.

539
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,820
It's not for you. It's for my son.

540
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,780
This is yours.

541
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,500
Son, have you been busy these days?

542
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,330
You didn't answer my call

543
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,900
or reply to my messages.

544
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,260
I missed you so much.

545
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,700
For the past few nights,

546
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,720
[Xiaoxiao: Dr. Xiao, the five of us went to Bocui Resort. 
Orange bought two tickets for the fireworks festival last time. She may have wanted to ask you out.
If you're free, can you come to see Orange?]

547
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,740
I had dreams every night.

548
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,660
I dreamt of you

549
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,620
when you were young.

550
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,900
You've changed a lot

551
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,260
this time you came back.

552
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,620
You're getting more handsome.

553
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,900
Do you have a girlfriend?

554
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,620
Tell me.

555
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,860
If you have a girlfriend,

556
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,540
you must bring her back to me.

557
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,860
Son.

558
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,500
What have you been busy for

559
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,700
lately?

560
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,500
Come on.

561
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,420
Come back with me.

562
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,820
No way.

563
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,980
You've violated Article 9 and Article 1128

564
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,580
of the Time-Space Management Act

565
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,420
by pausing time without permission

566
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,940
and changing others' fates.

567
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,940
I'll go back

568
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
and take punishment

569
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,940
after I get the Dioscorea nipponica Makino.

570
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,180
I warned you last time,

571
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,700
but it won't work this time.

572
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,740
Give me more time.

573
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,220
Are you forcing me to do it?

574
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,460
Bring it on.
