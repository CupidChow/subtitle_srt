00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,530
♫Prove that you were here♫

Hello, Mr. Xiao.

32
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,880
Mr. Xiao is here.

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,770
I didn't know this. You are deep.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,060
Because of you, the price of yellow roses has gone up today.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,480
Xiao Jing.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,150
Come here.

Director.

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,190
Xiao Jing, listen.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,050
Here is the thing.

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,160
I have a niece.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,700
She is about your age.

42
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,380
Do you think you should friend each other on WeChat first

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,360
or should I arrange a meeting for you two?

44
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,180
Is this a task assigned by the college?

45
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,540
Director.

46
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm just here to teach for Professor Song.

47
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,770
What a pity.

48
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,650
What's going on?

49
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,180
I didn't expect

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,910
you have become an Internet celebrity

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,720
after you came to 2023.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,840
An Internet celebrity?

53
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,630
You uploaded a post on the college forum.

54
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,690

Look. It's very fresh.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,920
There is dew on it.

70
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,490
Don't jump the queue.

71
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,170
Can I choose one myself?

72
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,370
Sure. Go ahead.

Give me one.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,790
Okay.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,010
No.

78
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,580
You are doing business here.

79
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,870
Why won't you sell it to me?

80
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm buying all these flowers.

81
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,040
Can't you see there are so many people queuing up?

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,270
Even though you are a teacher, you can't jump the queue.

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,409
You are using me to do business,

84
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,250
and you want me to follow your rules.

85
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,930
Don't you think you are having double standards?

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,510
I think

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,830
it's inappropriate to let you spend money.

88
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
Are they going to kiss?

89
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,870
Then I bought the flower for nothing.

90
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,659
Song Yiju.

91
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,380
You're doomed.

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,860
Look. It's Mr. Xiao.

93
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,770
Miss Song misunderstood me.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,730
I left the homework about rosaceae.

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,010
I just took yellow roses as an example.

96
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,420
If anyone wants to finish the homework with her,

97
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,720
come to her and sign up.

98
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,230
No. No.

99
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,810
Anyone?

100
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,320
Bye, Mr. Xiao.

101
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,130
Don't go.

102
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,410
Xiao Jing.

103
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,630
Clean this place.

104
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,170
It's a mess.

105
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,720
Submit the homework about rosaceae to me

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,200
before noon.

107
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,050
Hey. I...

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,990
Can I return the flower?

109
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,320
Five yuan.

[Episode 3]

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,409
What happened to you?

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,070
It's because of Xiao Jing.

113
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,810
He took revenge on me

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,850
and left me stupid homework about rosaceae.

115
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,040
In order to figure out

116
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,960
the difference between petals' light pink outer edge

117
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,140
and stamens,

118
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,030
I wasted the whole day.

119
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,550
What about you? You spread a rumor about him.

120
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,390
You are even, right?

121
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,240
Xiaoxiao.

122
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,390
You're on my side.

123
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,810
You should support me, right?

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,290
I've been so hard-working.

125
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,340
Why can't I remember the correct answers

126
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,320
and forget the wrong answers?

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,460
The class begins.

128
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,230
Take out The Study of Meridians and Acupuncture Points.

129
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,159
Turn to page 67.

130
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,240
Isn't this for freshmen?

131
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,180
In order to help us review for exams,

132
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,900
Mr. Xiao has decided to emphasize the knowledge points in the class on Friday.

133
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,550
Didn't you hear it in the previous class?

134
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,130
Not just the previous class.

135
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,290
The student who didn't bring the book,

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,340
come up here

137
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,920
as a teaching tool.

138
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,020
Song Yiju.

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,180
I'm talking about you.

140
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,429
Before I start the class,

141
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,880
let's review what I taught in the previous class.

142
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,240
Ouch!

143
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,159
What acupoint is this?

144
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,429
The Shoulder Well acupoint.

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,480
What's the meridian for dredging the meridians and promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis?

146
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,090
The gall bladder meridian.

147
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,690
Yes.

148
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,460
What acupoint is this?

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
What meridian is this?

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,150
Ouch!

151
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,470
What acupoint is this?

152
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,160
The temples.

153
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,110
Wrong answer.

154
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,330
The Middle of the Spine, Reaching Yang, Body Pillar, and Shoulder Well

155
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,910
can effectively improve

156
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,150
the circulation caused by the forward of the upper body

157
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,120
and relieve the pain caused by inappropriate exercise.

158
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,540
The circulation of qi and blood of the human body

159
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,500
is the most effective for self adjustment.

160
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,770
Impressive.

161
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,830
Hm. Good.

162
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,680
Go back to your seat.

163
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,690
How are you? Are you feeling much more comfortable?

164
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,770
Since Miss Song is so active,

165
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,190
you should help sort out the knowledge points in the next chapters.

166
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,510
Let's give her some encouragement.

167
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,020
Okay.

168
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,730
Mr. Xiao asked

169
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,320
you to sort out the knowledge points of qi and blood.

170
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,870
I heard it.

171
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,390
Refill it.

172
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,460
Okay.
