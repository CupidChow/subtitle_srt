00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,095
I'm supposed to interpret for them?
What kind of situation is this...

14
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:44,440
Could I get a discount if I used my VIP card,
coupon, and prepaid card all together?

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,780
Yes, you would receive a discount
for your VIP Gold Card,

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,240
and an additional discount for this coupon.

17

on your prepaid card like cash.

Could you show me how to do that?

21

You can download the "LOTTE DUTY FREE"
mobile app on your phone,

you could get at the off-line shop.

You didn't bring an umbrella, did you?

45
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,799
I didn't.
We just have to get over there.

46
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,910
Should we buy an umbrella?
Or maybe we could go like this...

47

Not at all!
Burgers are my favorite food!

54

What's "burger" in Chinese again?

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,260
"Burger" is "han bao bao".

57
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,275
I guess I tutored him in Chinese.

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,175
Anyway, since it's a student-teacher relationship,

59
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,845
it's unlikely that we'll end up in a kissing situation.

60
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,480
That means I'll get to see him longer.

61
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,055
It's going to be hard to see you next year
since I'll be in China often.

62
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:44,355
Yes, you'll be in China...

63

65
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,830
I started learning Chinese from you
so I could go perform in China.
