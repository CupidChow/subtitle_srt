[Episode 3: That X Who Ruined My Life]

00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,809
Are you really going to drink more?

10
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:31,100
That asshole.

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,350
He's been nothing but a nuisance in my life.

12
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,375
Why did I think of him at that moment?

13
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,834
Maybe he looks like him.

14
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,275
Not at all.

15
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:45,834
Neither his looks, nor his personality.

16
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,417
There's probably something similar about him.

17
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:53,751
Your first love has an impact on you.

18
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:57,292
If your first relationship was with a younger person, you'll find yourself drawn to younger people.

19
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,972
If it was with some trash, you'll probably be attracted to another piece of trash, even if you don't want to.

20
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,918
Ugh! Just thinking about it makes me mad again.

21
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,870
Hey! Where does that little creep live?

00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,667
Do you want me to teach him a lesson?

23
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,734
Why did I make such a stupid mistake?

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,083
Why do you care so much about him, anyway?

25
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,083
You don't have to see him if you don't want to.

26
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:29,417
I... We work at the same place... So...

27
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:37,875
So? What happened?

28
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,250
Did you end up sleeping over?

29

What's up with you?

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,684
Hey! He just doesn't feel the same as other people.

32
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,042
If this was a game, he would be the final boss.

33
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,626

I know, I don't even recognize myself.

He's the complete opposite of me.

38
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:06,284
And his walls are sky-high.

39
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:10,075
But so are your attacks.

40

Or are you not as good as you used to be?

Leave him. Let's just go by ourselves, come on.

If you start seeing someone now,

50
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,094
you'll definitely think of him again.

51

You're getting much better, you know.

52
00:03:56,684 --> 00:04:01,673
It's okay to wait with starting a new relationship until you've gotten over it completely.

53
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,173
Relinquish your feelings for him for now.

- You should have just said it.
- Right...

Oh... Wait, was I that obvious?

Ah, thank you.

Where's the vocal room?

74
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:54,437
There.

75
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,551
You look familiar. But...

76
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,569
Don't I?

77
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,372
Have you been in one of my classes?

78
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,874
No.

79
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,183
O-Or... a different teacher?

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,647
I'm Kim Chan Wu.

I see, I'm Lee Seung Jun.

00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,051
Okay...

Oh! You're...

86
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,138
- Yes! I am!
- You're a bit hot, right?

87
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,183
Did you see him? Did you?

88
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,659
- Did you see him look at me?
- He was looking at me!

89
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:58,972
- No, he wasn't.
- I'm telling you, he was looking at me.

90
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,194
It's him again.

91
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,338
Again?

92
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,914
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

93
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,806
Who is he?

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,028
You know, that guy who's hitting on Hyeon Ji.

95
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,378
He kept calling her up and even went to her house.

96
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:22,114
- What happened?
- She used to hate it so much, but they ended up dating.

97
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:24,403
- Has it been a month now?
- Twenty days.

98
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,655
Boss, I have to go out for a minute.

99
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,013
He's here because he missed me.

100
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,795
All right. Go ahead.

101
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,254
I'll be right back.

102
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:39,960
Does that actually work even when they're not interested?

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,630
I think it depends on the person.

104
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,717
If he seems fine, then it does paint the person in a different light.

105
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,128
Hyeong, why are you so curious?

106
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,920
Are you... interested in Hyeon Ji?

107
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,120
No!

108
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,711
Don't even say that as a joke!

109
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,362
Sorry!

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,212
Oh! I have to go!

111
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:08,161
Hyeong. Hyeong!

112
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:13,045
I'm the only one actually working here.

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,500
I don't know what's gotten into me lately.

114
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,636
Is something wrong?

115
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,147
No, it's nothing.

116
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,992
What was your group's name again?

117
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:40,312
One Point!

118
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,187
I'll make sure to check out your performance clips.

119
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,053
Oh! How... sweet of you.

120
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,770
Remember to review what we talked about today.

121
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,045
Of course.

122
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,478
My singing is a bit lacking because I'm the dancer on the team.

123
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,076
But the company promised me a solo if I improved.

124
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,728
You'll have to work harder then.

125
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:01,436
But won't you be lonely if you switch from a group to being a solo artist?

126
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:04,144
No... Not at all.

127
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,539
I can't wait for my solo debut.

128
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,049
Okay, good work today.

129
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,795
Thank you!

130
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,903
What genre do you think I should do for my solo debut?

131
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,128
I'm so torn between dance and ballad.

132
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,584
You need to practice first.

133
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,443
What song do you want to practice?

134

I...

137
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,686
- Oh! I better get going.
- No! You don't have to!

138
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,354
Stay a little longer.

139
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,519
Someone from my company is here to pick me up.

140
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,778
I'll call you later.

141
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,978
It's... over, isn't it?

142
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:52,108
Hello, CEO.

143
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,962
Oh, here you are.

144
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:56,362
Thank you.

145
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:01,604
- Well done.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,078
You can lean the chair back and relax.

147
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,454
It's all right, CEO.

148
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,287
It's an expensive car, so it's spacious.

149
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,745
Thank you for coming to pick me up.

150
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,298
I'll pick you up every once in a while.

151
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,478
Really? Thank you!

152
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:20,561
Oh, right! How was class today?

153
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,770
Teacher Seung Jun is really sweet.

154
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,562
Yes?

155
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,595
Would you... like to sit for a moment?

156
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,095
Yes...

157
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,511
I thought about you all day, Seung Jun.

158
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,828
How I must have made you uncomfortable by that sudden visit.

159
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,703
And how I'm sorry for making you go to that get-together,

160
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,723
when you don't even like those things.

161
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:07,936
And also that I asked you all those unnecessary questions.

162
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,826
All those things...

163
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,312
It has been bothering me, too.

164
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:25,173
Are you free tomorrow?

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,536
I'm a bit busy nowadays.

166
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:32,442
Vocal lessons, remember?

167
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,495
Don't you owe your driver something?

168
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,125
What?

169
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,650
"I swear... I'll give you vocal lessons!"

170
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,778
- "Promise!"
- Don't talk about that.

171
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,881
All right, I'll give you the lessons.

172
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,542
You promised.

173
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,167
I will...

174
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,290
It's really close by car.

175
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,534
You don't have to accompany me.

176
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,750
Do I make you uncomfortable?

177
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,368
I'll just watch you get on.

178
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,664
I...

179
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,369
It's here...

180
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,562
How quick...

181
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,048
Do you want to get the next one?

182
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,431
No, I'll just get going now.

183
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,161
Seung Jun!

184
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,133
See you tomorrow.

185
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,314
I'll make sure to practice.

186
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,048
Bye!

187
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,360
♫ I'll only look at you. I'll only live for you ♫

188
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,401
Relationships are not for me.

189
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,620
But... maybe we could be friends?

190
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,810
♫ The light that you carry ♫

191
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,570
[Chan Wu]

192
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,281
Yes, Chan Wu?

193
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:31,874
Teacher Seung Jun, I was just talking about my practice song with the CEO, but...

194
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,073
Seung Jun!

195
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,073
How have you been?

196
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:39,848
It took me so long to find you.

197
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,431
See you soon.

198
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,323
I am quite cute.

199
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,997
Why are you doing this to me?

200
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,609
Did you get kicked out?

201
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,198
Please.

202
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,481
Seung Jun, don't worry about me and take your time getting ready.
