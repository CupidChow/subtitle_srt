- Can you write songs too?

Hey, Ho Yeon!

182
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:13,710
♫ A dream we've been hiding for so long ♫

183
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:21,220
♫ You and me. Our hearts, our hopes ♫

184
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,950
♫ I think this will be a long journey ♫

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,300
♫ Even though I was always hesitant ♫

186
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,890
♫ Can I stay by your side now? ♫

187
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,920
♫ Me and you ♫
