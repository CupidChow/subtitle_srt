1
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,916
Dad.

2
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,166
<i>Have you gotten lost?</i>

3
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,333
<i>Have you lost anything?</i>

4
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,458
<i>We keep looking outward.</i>

5
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>Without realizing it,</i>

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>we've let go of the hand</i>
<i>that always held us.</i>

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,041
<i>When we look back,</i>

8
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,291
<i>we realize that</i>

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,208
<i>we've lost something.</i>

10
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,583
<i>After all,</i>

11
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,666
<i>did we lose our lost selves,</i>

12
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,208
<i>or those who have lost their way?</i>

13
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,125
THE PASSAGE OF TIME
IS LIKE A BUTCHER'S KNIFE

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
So,

15
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,458
have your dads ever lost you growing up?

16
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,541
- No!
- If that never happened, raise your hands.

17
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,666
Whoa, that many? Huh?

18
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,500
- Your dads have never lost you?
- Nope.

19
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,708
What? You guys

20
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,833
don't have dads?

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Just kidding!

22
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:23,958
Me?

23
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,875
When I was around six or seven,

24
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,791
I went to a local market
with my dad near our place.

25
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,916
Man, I was so thrilled!

26
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,958
I was checking out everything,
and I had so many questions.

27
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,833
Tons of questions.

28
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,041
But when I turned around,

29
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,458
I only had one question, which was,

30
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,041
"Where did my dad go?"

31
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,625
Dad!

32
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,333
Dad!

33
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,750
Dad!

34
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,916
<i>For a seven or eight-year-old girl,</i>

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,833
<i>it felt like the apocalypse.</i>

36
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,791
Dad!

37
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,583
What really made me mad was,

38
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,750
I finally saw him across the street…

39
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,416
<i>And then he gave me this look.</i>

40
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,541
<i>He lost his daughter over starfruit juice.</i>

41
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,916
<i>I meant less to him</i>
<i>than a cup of starfruit juice.</i>

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,208
And he doesn't behave like a father.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,791
You know, as his daughter,

44
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:24,125
he totally stole the spotlight
on my wedding day.

45
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,541
Honey, watch Shaw for a second.

46
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,625
I'm catching up…

47
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,208
- No, I gotta see Le-le. Hold him.
- Wait.

48
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,000
Listen. Our classmates then are now…

49
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,916
Okay. He's not there?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,750
Okay. I see. Thank you.

51
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,000
It's been a while. Gotta go. Bye.

52
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,041
- Can't find him?
- He's not home.

53
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,333
He left on his bike two hours ago.

54
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,166
Bike? He should be here soon.

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,625
- Bicycle.
- Bicycle.

56
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,041
That'll take longer.

57
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,875
It's okay. Just relax, all right?

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,708
Whoa!

59
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,250
Here we go. Looking good! Wow!

60
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,958
Hey, this one… Chang Kai looks…

61
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,375
Still can't reach him.

62
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,458
I guess his phone's dead.

63
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,875
Everything was going so well until now.

64
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,333
What's going on?

65
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,583
And this one.

66
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,750
Mr. and Mrs. Chang.
Let's have them say hi to everyone.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,750
Your parents must think
this wedding is a mess.

68
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,958
Don't overthink it.

69
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,916
My parents are fine with it.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,708
They're paying lip service.

71
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,875
It's like saying,

72
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,875
"You decide,"
when they really mean, "Do as I say."

73
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,250
Don't stress. Relax, okay?

74
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,791
How can I relax?

75
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,625
In this dress, I really feel…

76
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,125
And my skin feels so dry.

77
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,916
Jeez, what's wrong?

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,916
Why are my bra pads so tight?

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,083
- It's okay.
- Who invented weddings?

80
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,458
- You're gorgeous.
- What's my dad doing?

81
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,458
- You look amazing.
- I'm starving.

82
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,333
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

83
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,000
You have no idea. For your big day,

84
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,375
she's been on a broccoli and chicken diet.

85
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,958
Well? Don't I look good?

86
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,958
Cheng Le-le. You're showing that photo?

87
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,125
You two are taken,
but I'm still looking for someone.

88
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,708
You're not into marriage.

89
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,541
I want to feel desired too.

90
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,458
Why isn't he here yet?

91
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,166
Didn't I tell you
to take your dad with you?

92
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,500
Hey, she's the bride today.

93
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,125
Wonderful! This is such a touching video.

94
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,458
He's not here yet.

95
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,000
Exactly. He's not here yet.

96
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:05,333
Le-le must have some serious good luck
to marry Chang Kai.

97
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,291
What?

98
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,625
Her story is truly inspiring.

99
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,875
<i>The Ugly Duckling </i>and <i>Cinderella</i>

100
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,458
can happen in real life.

101
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,958
Ignore him. It's okay…

102
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,041
Looks aren't everything.
True love conquers all.

103
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,625
Who hired this MC?

104
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,833
Don't hire him for your wedding.

105
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,291
Listen, that table is full of lawyers.

106
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,250
- Call them if you ever get divorced.
- Sure.

107
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,458
Help yourselves to the drinks.

108
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,125
You gotta give
red envelopes first, though…

109
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Keep going. My dad isn't here yet.

110
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,958
What is it?

111
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,291
My dad isn't here.

112
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,708
Just keep going.

113
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,333
Well, there she is.

114
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,791
Ladies and gentlemen.

115
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,500
From here, I can see the bride,
Cheng Le-le,

116
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,708
can't wait to meet everyone already.

117
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:01,583
Make some noise for our bride,
Cheng Le-le!

118
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,125
Give it up, everyone!

119
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,833
I need a drink.

120
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,791
So do I.

121
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,041
- Get me one.
- Okay.

122
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,166
How's everyone doing?

123
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,291
Excuse me.

124
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,833
Well, I'm Le-le.

125
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,958
And thank you for coming to my wedding.

126
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,541
They say that

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,583
if you have lousy parents,

128
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,000
you'll usually end up
being rigorous and responsible.

129
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,916
<i>I'm someone who's organized, reliable,</i>

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,458
<i>and plans everything out.</i>

131
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,666
<i>So you can imagine what my dad is like…</i>

132
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,291
While we're stalling for time,

133
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:57,875
let me introduce
my two besties since college.

134
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,041
Lin Chia-yun and Huang Su-fei.
Thank you, girls.

135
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,291
And my fellow colleagues.

136
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,500
Our round-the-clock work attitude
is like those invincible cockroaches.

137
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,291
What does she do?

138
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,291
You can excel in any profession.

139
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,250
Of course,

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,083
the man who changed my mind,

141
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,041
Chang Kai.

142
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:34,250
Thank you.

143
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,875
Thank you.

144
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,791
My besties can vouch for me.

145
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,250
Before I met him,

146
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,333
I'd never considered marriage.

147
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,791
This is all thanks to my mother.

148
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:57,125
She abandoned me when I was eight
and went traveling in the US.

149
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,750
She taught me with her actions that

150
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,333
marriage is the tomb of love.

151
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,375
Or a mass grave,
if you remarry a few times.

152
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,791
Anyway, this man made me

153
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,166
brave the risks of strewn corpses

154
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,708
to step into the tomb of love together.

155
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,166
Is that how the saying goes?

156
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,166
It seems she's just as clueless.

157
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,083
She doesn't live with her in-laws.

158
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,583
Guess what? She bought a place

159
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,458
for her beloved son.

160
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,833
I know, that's nice. I don't have one.

161
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,750
- It's a rooftop addition.
- What?

162
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,833
I thank him, my dad, Cheng Kuang-chi.

163
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, thanks everyone.

164
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,666
Excuse me.

165
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,125
Hello, was Cheng Kuang-chi admitted?

166
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,125
- Cheng who?
- Cheng Kuang-chi.

167
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,666
K-U-A-N-G C-H-I.

168
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,541
Second bed there.

169
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,208
What's a chicken's favorite trilogy?

170
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,208
Lord of the Wings.

171
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,166
- This one's funnier.
- Cheng Kuang-chi!

172
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,291
Hey.

173
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,958
You're unbelievable!

174
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
Do you know what today is?

175
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,583
This is my daughter, Le-le.

176
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,333
Hey, she got married today.

177
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

178
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,041
You look so pretty.

179
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,333
Thank you.

180
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,541
Where's Kai?

181
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,750
He's the groom at our wedding.

182
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,375
Oh well.

183
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,333
<i>Good things don't come in pairs,</i>

184
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,166
but bad things sure do.

185
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,416
My dad visits the hospital
like it's his backyard.

186
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
It's like his backyard, you know?

187
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,625
Yesterday…

188
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,416
just yesterday…

189
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,916
Tell me,
what's a chicken's favorite trilogy?

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,833
I don't know.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,333
Lord of the Wings.

192
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,041
That's a good one.

193
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,416
How many more nurses
are you telling this lame joke to?

194
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
She's kind and very nice to me.

195
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,250
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

196
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,708
Oh no, you messed up your face this time.

197
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,958
No way.

198
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:57,791
I asked for
the best cosmetic surgeon to stitch me up.

199
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,333
They did a good job. Look, not a scratch.

200
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
How'd you fall this time?

201
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,666
I saw this really cute puppy--

202
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,000
Please stay till
Mr. Cheng's anesthesia wears off.

203
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,958
The doctor will explain later.

204
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,166
- All right, I got it.
- Okay, thanks.

205
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, you just got off work?

206
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,250
Come on.

207
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you, good girl.

208
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,416
- Ms. Cheng.
- Yes.

209
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,791
Well, Mr. Cheng might have
early signs of dementia.

210
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,958
Okay.

211
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,000
We'd advise the family
not to leave him home alone.

212
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,875
When he came in,
he couldn't remember his address.

213
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,208
Luckily, he had your business card.

214
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,750
We suggest that he gets a checkup.

215
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,416
Because he hurt his head?

216
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,875
We examined him for that,
but for now, he seems fine.

217
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,416
But if an elderly person
often trips and falls,

218
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,166
that's a red flag.

219
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,041
Like, they might start getting disoriented

220
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
or have poor coordination.

221
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,708
Next time, we'll do a specific checkup.

222
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,000
Doctor, I think that's unlikely.

223
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,458
You know, my dad's just a goofball.

224
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,041
I'm grateful
I don't have dementia because of him.

225
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,208
A goofball?

226
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, he's putting on an act.

227
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,750
He's always active and tells corny jokes.

228
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,833
Ms. Cheng,
when was the last time you saw him?

229
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,958
About

230
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,375
two to three months, maybe three or four.

231
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,750
You live far away?

232
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,000
Not really, but…

233
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,958
I've been busy.

234
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,250
It's okay. I get it.

235
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,750
Here's some information
on dementia for you.

236
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,083
Sir, don't make yourself at home here.

237
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,708
Hey, that's a good song.

238
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,625
Next time they call you,

239
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,083
just say you're out

240
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,125
or that you're abroad.

241
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,125
When you were a kid,

242
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,375
your school called to say you fell.

243
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,500
I didn't rush over,
but you're still alive and well.

244
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:28,041
How self-righteous.
I wish I'd feel the same for not coming.

245
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,750
You always worry too much.

246
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,583
I'm telling you,

247
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,458
if the sky falls,
tall people will hold it up, okay?

248
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,125
What if they are as unreliable as you
and just duck?

249
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,041
There are aliens too.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,125
You're one of them.

251
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,125
I'm waiting for them to pick me up.

252
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,208
So childish.

253
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,791
It's an achievement
to remain childish for life.

254
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,750
What? I don't need those.

255
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,541
Now you know

256
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,750
why I put the newspaper on the floor
when I poop.

257
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,125
I don't want to know about your poop.

258
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,041
Let's go.

259
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,166
Hey, that optician I went to
for my reading glasses is pretty good.

260
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,666
You should check it out.

261
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,000
Here.

262
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,958
What reading glasses?
I'm just far-sighted. Hey.

263
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,791
Anyway, I've put up his business card
on the fridge.

264
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,000
Forget it.
Let's walk home. There are no cabs.

265
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,458
Come on, it's very close.

266
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,208
But…

267
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,958
Just wait.

268
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,166
- Let me tell you--
- Hold on, I'm texting.

269
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,916
You're busy, huh?

270
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,875
Do you remember

271
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,041
that pink bike you had
when you were little?

272
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Where did it go?

273
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,208
That was ages ago, and… Whoa!

274
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
And that bike was blue.

275
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,375
You…

276
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,916
Taking photos of pigeons but not me.

277
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,458
That bike was definitely pink.

278
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,041
Jeez, you don't remember things.

279
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,916
Your memory's worse than mine.

280
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,375
Why remember unimportant stuff?

281
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,750
I can't even remember things now.

282
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,125
Back then,

283
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,916
your mom and I just split up…

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You mean Wang Hsiao-fang?

285
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,791
She left us. You didn't split up, okay?

286
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,291
At that time,
you didn't speak for six months.

287
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,166
I was freaking out.

288
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,208
I took you to the doctors,

289
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,041
the temples, the hospitals, and churches.

290
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,916
But you only opened your mouth to eat.

291
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,333
Did I?

292
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,791
And then?

293
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,541
I picked you up from school every day.

294
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,375
You picked me up every day?

295
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,500
You probably forgot to pick me up a lot.

296
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,416
Anyway, we'd go for a walk
after I picked you up.

297
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,875
As we walked,

298
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,666
you wouldn't talk, so I kept talking.

299
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,708
You were quiet. I'd talk.

300
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,875
One day,

301
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,125
you suddenly started talking.

302
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,375
What did I say?

303
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,458
Well…

304
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,833
Man, I forgot.

305
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,125
I'll tell you when I remember.

306
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,708
I probably said you were a nag.

307
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,791
You haven't been here for ages.

308
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,041
Not that long.

309
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,125
Make yourself at home.

310
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm gonna cook something in the kitchen.

311
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,500
Don't cook for me.

312
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm leaving soon.

313
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,291
Don't worry, I'm not cooking for you.

314
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,916
Last week, I made plans with Mr. Chang.

315
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,666
I'll bring my signature dish
for his birthday.

316
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,166
You have a signature dish?

317
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,208
Hey, your stuff is piling up.

318
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,125
That's not true.

319
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,208
Dad, Mr. Chang's birthday
was two weeks ago.

320
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,583
No way. You got it wrong.

321
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,083
It's next week.

322
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,000
It's on your calendar. Take a look.

323
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,583
I don't think so.

324
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,291
Mr. Wen told me about it last week.

325
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,541
Mr. Wen died years ago.

326
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,125
What?

327
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,166
Don't put too much in.

328
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,583
Le-le.

329
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,416
Give me a hand.

330
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,125
What?

331
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,750
Here.

332
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,375
Hey, tidy up the table.

333
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,000
Put these two away.

334
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,333
Put them there.

335
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,916
Okay, hold on.

336
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
Oh, you're really…

337
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,958
- The coaster.
- Where?

338
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,208
- Okay, that's good.
- Over here?

339
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,125
Hey!

340
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,958
Didn't I tell you not to cook for me?

341
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,916
I haven't written anything.
I need to write bits.

342
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,458
Well, you have to eat anyway.

343
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,208
You're always having expired food.
That's bad for your health.

344
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
- Right.
- These are for you.

345
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,875
Instant noodles are so healthy.

346
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,666
Wait.

347
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,750
It's okay.

348
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,791
Who can finish such a huge pot?

349
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,458
Just pack it home for Chang Kai.

350
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,375
Right?

351
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,583
Sir,

352
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,500
Chang Kai and I are separated.

353
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,291
You do have senile dementia.

354
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,291
Don't you worry.

355
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,333
I don't need you to take care of me.

356
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,000
I never said that I would.

357
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,166
By the way,

358
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,125
the dining table is for eating,
not for piling stuff up.

359
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,583
Everything's in plain sight, right?

360
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,125
You can grab whatever you need easily.

361
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,125
Am I right?

362
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,750
How is it?

363
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,500
I hate instant noodles.

364
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,500
I'll head back after I finish this.

365
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,375
If I don't finish it tomorrow,

366
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,833
they'll kill me.

367
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,875
Gotta go.

368
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,166
The dishes are done.

369
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,125
Don't stay up watching TV. Bye.

370
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,333
Bye.

371
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>Do the elderly, like my dad</i>
<i>glued to the TV all day, already forget</i>

372
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,208
<i>how busy a 40-year-old would be?</i>

373
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,250
<i>Always rushing here and there.</i>

374
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,125
<i>We don't even have time for coffee,</i>
<i>let alone instant noodles.</i>

375
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,958
<i>Hello, welcome.</i>

376
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Hello. Do you need a bag?

377
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,333
- No, thanks.
- Sure.

378
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,500
Separate receipts.

379
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,916
Well…

380
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Uh… I spoke Mandarin, right?

381
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:51,916
Separate receipts.

382
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,166
You mean for all these?

383
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,458
Yes, all of them.

384
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,666
Sure.

385
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,875
Okay.

386
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,625
Membership or mobile barcode?

387
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,083
0963763441

388
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,541
It's 441, not 411.

389
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,708
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- 441.

390
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,833
Okay. 0963--

391
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,416
- 763.
- 763.

392
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,000
- 441.
- 441.

393
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,541
- 441.
- Okay…

394
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,333
Please confirm it.

395
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,625
- And you're paying with?
- Cash.

396
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,041
I'll issue e-receipts.

397
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,458
- Uh, wait. I have one NT dollar.
- No problem.

398
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,416
Fifty-five NT dollars.

399
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,291
Excuse me. Where's my first receipt?

400
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,541
Well, I just…

401
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,666
I should get a receipt for that.

402
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,500
- Yes, but…
- One receipt for one item.

403
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,166
- You should give me that receipt. Come on.
- I…

404
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,416
The receipt.

405
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,708
The receipt.

406
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,458
Are you out of your mind?

407
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,541
Does the world revolve around you?

408
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,291
Convenience stores are retail,
not service…

409
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,250
…should I get on my knees to ring you up?

410
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,750
<i>Being human,</i>
<i>sometimes you just can't speak your mind.</i>

411
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,541
That's right. I'm a coward.

412
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,791
Sorry about that.
I might have made a mistake.

413
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,708
Let me cancel the purchase
and print the receipt for you.

414
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,791
Is that okay? I'm so sorry.

415
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,208
STORE MANAGER IS WATCHING

416
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,166
<i>My period was on time yesterday for once.</i>

417
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,333
<i>But yours wasn't!</i>

418
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,708
<i>How can you miss out on our Period Club?</i>

419
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,375
<i>My cycle is irregular lately.</i>

420
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,583
Are you pregnant?

421
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,333
Don't jinx it.

422
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,708
I'm looking forward
to the day I stop breastfeeding.

423
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,416
Then I can light up a cigarette.

424
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,000
<i>My dad was hospitalized.</i>

425
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,625
<i>Your dad does break a fall quite well.</i>

426
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,333
Is he okay?

427
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,833
Just a few stitches on his forehead.

428
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:27,000
He even got a cosmetic surgeon
to stitch him up. Isn't that something?

429
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,083
<i>Scars are cool.</i>

430
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,833
He gets it. Luckily, no broken bones.

431
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,541
<i>Hey, Yani.</i>

432
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,541
<i>Don't throw that away.</i>

433
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,833
<i>That's my breast milk.</i>

434
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:42,458
What kind of funny voice was that?
Does Yani understand you any better?

435
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,791
Hey, did you say
you were throwing away breast milk?

436
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,791
<i>No, I said, "Don't throw it away."</i>

437
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,125
It's all your fault.

438
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,375
You made me drink.

439
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,416
Nice.

440
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,750
Bailey's breast milk.

441
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,333
Shut up!

442
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,416
Breast milk is precious, you know?

443
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,083
It's not drinkable,
but I can freeze it and make soap later.

444
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,583
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- That breast milk soap you made was great.

445
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,750
Please make more.

446
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,958
- Mommy!
- It was great, right?

447
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,833
Mommy, play with me.

448
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,375
Wait, I'm on the phone.

449
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,250
<i>Gosh, what's going on?</i>

450
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,250
What?

451
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,083
No, I can't see things up close,

452
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,333
<i>but I can see far away.</i>

453
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,583
<i>Is it presbyopia?</i>
<i>What should I eat to fix presbyopia?</i>

454
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,250
<i>Nothing, it's incurable.</i>

455
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>No way! My kids are still so young.</i>

456
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,666
<i>Just take lutein every day.</i>

457
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,250
<i>Also, omega-3 fatty acids</i>
<i>and DHA to protect your eyes.</i>

458
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>Hold on, I can't remember.</i>

459
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,333
- <i>I'll grab a pen.</i>
- Any recommended brands?

460
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,625
My recommendation?

461
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,791
Trade for soap.

462
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:40,958
Time for work.

463
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,416
I gotta go. Talk later.

464
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,750
- I'm going to eat.
- Okay.

465
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,250
Hello, welcome.

466
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,833
Auntie, can I get a hot latte?

467
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,666
<i>"Auntie"? Who are you calling "Auntie"?</i>

468
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,000
"Auntie"?

469
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,541
Yes, hot latte.

470
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,250
Sure. Large or medium?

471
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,666
Large. Thank you.

472
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,291
Okay.

473
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,666
Thank you.

474
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,500
So many dumb questions!

475
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,958
What questions?

476
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,666
"Daily tour departure time."

477
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,333
"European hotel washing machines."

478
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,000
"European hotel AC not cold."

479
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,208
"No aisle seat."

480
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,791
"Can't sit with a friend."

481
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,458
Why not use your brain
before asking questions?

482
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,541
Seriously?

483
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,541
Calm down.

484
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,291
They say when we lead tours,

485
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,875
we're dealing with
blind, deaf, disabled, and senile people.

486
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,750
But I don't see them that way.

487
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:40,791
You do!

488
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,291
I want to shut them up with pacifiers.

489
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,041
They are all adult babies.

490
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,375
Fish oil.

491
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,333
I'm done cleaning.

492
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,416
- Thank you, Yani.
- No problem.

493
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,958
You took a bit longer today.

494
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,208
Because Mister is home soon,
and Grandma said it's not clean.

495
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,250
<i>I wish Le-le was still a tour guide.</i>

496
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,333
<i>Yeah, she can handle any customer.</i>

497
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:05,916
- Except…
- Except…

498
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:11,041
I heard that she'd take on any tour
to make money.

499
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:12,875
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

500
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,958
She wanted to lead the US tours.

501
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,666
- US tours?
- Yep.

502
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,583
Why?

503
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,416
Why would I tell you?

504
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,375
Come on!

505
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,833
Is it because they pay more?

506
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,166
Here, take this.

507
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,875
US tours are long distance.

508
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,666
- My son puked!
- Your son?

509
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,041
Shit! Gotta pick Shaw up.

510
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,541
En-en, leave the car. Let's pick Shaw up.

511
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,958
Wait…

512
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,875
Wait!

513
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,208
Hey!

514
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,708
- Hello, Mr. Cheng.
- Hello.

515
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,166
Hi.

516
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,500
- Sorry…
- Hurry up.

517
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,250
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,250
The bus never came.

519
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,666
That was ridiculous.

520
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,125
I kept waiting.

521
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,958
Then I just ran here.

522
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,166
Okay, I'm a mess now.

523
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,500
Why don't you work
at a store closer to here?

524
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,833
It's closer to home.

525
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,916
Sorry, what do we need to discuss?

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hand it over.

527
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
The bits highlighted in red aren't good.

528
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,125
The font

529
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,666
looks great!

530
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,625
- Is it size 16?
- Twenty-six.

531
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,500
Wait…

532
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,791
This is my bit tonight.
You want me to change it now?

533
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,833
You sent it to me this morning.

534
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:54,875
I wrote this while restocking.
I did my best.

535
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,458
The dating part isn't edgy enough.

536
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,666
No punchline.

537
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,833
You asked me to do a dating bit.

538
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,583
Because that's tonight's topic.

539
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:06,833
Have you been dating?

540
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,083
Only talk about what you know,

541
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,291
or the audience will see through it.

542
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,083
Your logic doesn't make sense.

543
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,833
RD talked about sexual harassment.

544
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,375
Did he really do that?

545
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,791
Cut the drama.

546
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,875
All right, just tweak it.

547
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:30,583
Sir, I moved her to the fourth slot.
Is that okay?

548
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,666
I don't want to go after RD.

549
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,333
Why not? You think he's too funny?

550
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,916
No, everyone leaves after he's done.

551
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,125
I know. You should be happy about that.

552
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,166
Run your lines with her, then go on.

553
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,875
Yes, sir.

554
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,125
I don't think you're that bad.

555
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,125
You're not helping.

556
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,833
You look great in that outfit.

557
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,541
It's aqua blue. I like it.

558
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,500
Thank you.

559
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,583
Hey, you know what?

560
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,833
Where do boats go when they're sick?

561
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,458
- A boat doc?
- Yeah.

562
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,666
What did the ocean say to the beach?

563
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,250
It just waved.

564
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,333
It just waved!

565
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,708
Where did you learn all this?

566
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,833
Seriously.

567
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,500
- Funny, right?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,500
Why did you ask me out today?

569
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,375
- I…
- Yes.

570
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,541
Are you shy?

571
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,375
We've known each other for so long.

572
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,166
No, I mean…

573
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,791
How should I put it?

574
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:44,125
Hey, let me tell you something--

575
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,958
Hay is for horses.

576
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,708
So what exactly is your problem today?

577
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,041
I…

578
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,958
I'll be honest with you.

579
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,916
We're not getting any younger.

580
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,125
I'm looking for a companion.

581
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,916
Why did you think of me?

582
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,166
Actually,

583
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,041
Le-le wants to take care of me.

584
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,333
She's worried no one will look after me.

585
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:26,958
I don't want her to help me
and mess things up between her and Kai.

586
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,208
If I find someone,

587
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,583
she's off the hook, right?

588
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,583
Cheng Kuang-chi.

589
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,416
Did I hear you right?

590
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:40,708
Are you looking for a companion
or a caregiver?

591
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,250
That's not what I meant.

592
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,166
I mean, we're both old.

593
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,125
- Let's help each--
- Who's old?

594
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,875
Hey, are you mad?

595
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:50,833
Huh?

596
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,291
Okay, next up,

597
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:59,333
I'd like to introduce
the one and only female comic

598
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,583
from our Funny Club.

599
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:05,500
She's also the only one
who's been married and divorced.

600
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,041
Let's welcome Cheng Le-le!

601
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,791
<i>All right, how's everyone doing?</i>

602
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm Le-le.

603
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,583
Man, we're talking about dating.

604
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,000
All I can say is…

605
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,166
Dating…

606
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:24,125
- I haven't been on a date in ages.
- Me too!

607
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,166
Honestly.

608
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:30,250
I mean, don't you think dating is just

609
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,416
way too formal?

610
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,583
Especially for women.
You gotta get up early, shower,

611
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,291
do your makeup,

612
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,833
and find your best outfit.

613
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:46,000
And this whole time,
you have to pretend you never fart.

614
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,708
And then…

615
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,208
Yeah, sex.

616
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,041
What's sex?

617
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,125
I don't know. What?

618
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,708
Synonym, banging.

619
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,208
I don't get it either.

620
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,541
Stuff like that…

621
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,583
At my age, this topic

622
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,375
doesn't interest me, you know?

623
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,583
I'm in my forties. We only talk about…

624
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,916
"When was the first time
you threw your back out during sex?"

625
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,666
Anyone here

626
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,250
who's in their forties?

627
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,916
Looks kinda weak.

628
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,750
That's the kind of reaction
we have at our age.

629
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,250
Me.

630
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,625
I'm old. Seriously.

631
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,708
Dating?

632
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:35,416
Forget about having the courage
to love someone.

633
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,291
I can't even muster the courage
to get out of bed.

634
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,333
I gotta wake up.

635
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,791
Can't just lie here.

636
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,916
I'll have plenty of time to lie down
once I'm dead.

637
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,958
It's not like I have much time left.

638
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,541
Seriously, I'm old.

639
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,791
This afternoon,

640
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,625
a middle-aged woman came to my store.

641
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,291
I work at a convenience store…

642
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,000
<i>As kids, we felt like we had so much time.</i>

643
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:06,625
<i>We couldn't wait to grow up.</i>

644
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,458
<i>But at some point, it suddenly feels like</i>

645
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,125
<i>time is running out.</i>

646
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,416
Thanks.

647
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,958
<i>Chia-yun said, ever since she had kids,</i>

648
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,083
<i>there's never enough time.</i>

649
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,291
Shaw, stay to the side. We gotta…

650
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,666
Hold my hand on the road.

651
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,958
Blood test first.

652
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,291
His kidney levels aren't great.

653
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,166
<i>Su-fei said,</i>

654
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,625
<i>since her cat turned six,</i>

655
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,083
<i>time is running out.</i>

656
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,000
Whoa!

657
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,041
<i>What about me?</i>

658
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,833
<i>I never thought my dad would get old.</i>

659
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,125
<i>But that day,</i>

660
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,166
<i>I saw his back,</i>

661
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,666
<i>and I realized,</i>

662
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,458
<i>people just age in an instant.</i>

663
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,083
Dad! I'm telling you…

664
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:14,083
Hey, why do you keep staring at me?

665
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,000
Smile.

666
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,333
I am smiling.

667
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,666
What's your resting face like?

668
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,250
You don't want to see it.

669
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,708
Well, that was just a suggestion.

670
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,250
A clueless suggestion.

671
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,458
