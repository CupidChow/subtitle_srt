00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,666
FUNNY CLUB TALK SHOW

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,875
<i>I have to say this.</i>

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,750
<i>Usually, when we fall for someone,</i>

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,333
what we like about them
and what we end up hating

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,833
are actually the same.

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,208
When you like them,

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,291
"Wow, my girlfriend is chubby."

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,791
"That's so cute."

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,208
When you hate them,

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,458
"Oh fuck!"

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,666
"Can you get any bigger? I think

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,583
bigger here."

13
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,875
Okay, you're plump in the wrong places.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,625
Okay.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,833
So, I really wanna ask,

16
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,666
is that a double standard?

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,791
Yes!

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,666
Okay.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,458
This gentleman…

20
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:58,083
Is the person next to you
a friend or your girlfriend?

21
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,041
Girlfriend.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,083
- Girlfriend.
- Fiancée!

23
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,375
I think we need to clear this up.

24
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,583
Why is there a double standard
in how you refer to each other?

25
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,625
Congratulations.

26
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,208
Here's something
I want to say to all of you.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,083
I encourage everyone,

28
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,458
including you two,
and those who are in a relationship.

29
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,333
If you're in a relationship,

30
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,416
don't give up easily. Seriously.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,708
Because you might be in a relationship

32
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,708
for way too long,

33
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,958
so long that you've forgotten
that you look

34
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,375
so sloppy

35
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,708
and so ugly.

36
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,833
You know what?

37
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:47,125
If you've forgotten how to evaluate
your looks or current state,

38
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,750
here's a trick.

39
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,958
If you see someone on the street

40
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,958
and that person is you,

41
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,666
ask yourself this,

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,333
"Would I want to date this person?"

43
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,208
Wow.

44
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,208
This silence is upsetting.

45
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,166
I have to say that
letting go is harder than you think.

46
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,708
If you want to find someone else

47
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,916
who will hold your hand again,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,250
that's even harder.

49
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,833
Especially at my age,

50
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,208
this middle age.

51
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,958
Somehow, I always feel emotional

52
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,125
when I see people get married.

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,083
I'd write down those feelings

54
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,625
in the wedding cards.

55
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,041
I'd write,

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,250
"The future won't always be perfect,

57
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,958
so if you feel like scratching his face,

58
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,083
think about why you fell in love

59
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,375
in the first place."

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,125
I'm going to Singapore.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,250
It was decided today.

62
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,708
They want me to manage the firm there.

63
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,291
Can we just

64
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,500
give it another shot?

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,500
FELL OUT OF LOVE?

66
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,958
WHEN DID WE FALL OUT OF LOVE?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,541
Bye-bye!

68
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,416
Excuse me.

69
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,500
"Gang!" That was so funny!

70
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,125
She's drunk.

71
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Cheng Le-le.

72
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,625
Would you like to do another stand-up?

73
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
Sorry. You do mean it.

74
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,583
I'm not drunk.

75
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,125
You've got potential.

76
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,083
Are you stalking me?

77
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,250
No, don't get me wrong.

78
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,166
I was in the audience.

79
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,208
Okay.

80
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,666
I just wanted to come over

81
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,541
and thank you.

82
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,083
What for?

83
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
For making me feel a bit

84
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,750
happier tonight.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,583
You're welcome.

86
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,333
Hello.

87
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,583
Membership or barcode?

88
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,583
Neither.

89
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,583
Okay.

90
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,166
- All good. Thanks.
- Thanks.

91
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,541
- Thank you. Come again.
- I will.

92
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
- Thanks.
- Sure.

93
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,708
Thank you.

94
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,500
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

95
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,583
Good job.

96
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,541
Thank you.

97
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,750
Look at me.

98
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
Look!

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,458
- Yeah?
- He's looking!

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,791
Don't do that. That's so rude.

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,916
CONGRATULATIONS TO CHANG KAI
ON HIS PROMOTION TO PARTNER

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,041
Le-le.

103
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,916
Congratulations!

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,041
Gosh!

105
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,208
Oh my God!

106
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,625
Let me see.

107
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,666
Is that all right?

108
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,250
You're amazing!

109
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,166
You're awesome!

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Attorney Chang, come here.

111
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,166
Here.

112
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,583
It smells like watermelon.

113
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,958
Let's welcome Cheng Le-le.

114
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,458
Hello, I'm Cheng Le-le.

115
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,125
I'm starving.

116
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,375
You scared me.

117
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,583
That was the point.

118
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,666
So much ketchup?

119
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,041
That's right.

120
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,750
- It must be sweet.
- Yeah.

121
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,958
<i>Amidst the simple daily routines,</i>

122
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,625
<i>when did we start to forget</i>

123
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,000
<i>the reason we fell in love?</i>

124
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,041
<i>Thanks, everyone. I'm Le-le.</i>

125
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:15,125
Encore!

126
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,791
<i>I know.</i>

127
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,250
<i>Wait. I'm at my dad's.</i>

128
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,208
I'll be there on time.

129
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,041
That restaurant looks expensive.

130
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,333
That's so stressful.

131
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,708
- The times suggested clashed with my gigs.
- Look who's here.

132
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,000
Can't I come?

133
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,500
- How long have you been here?
- I dressed up.

134
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,750
A lifetime.

135
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
Yes, my dad's home.

136
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,166
- Just in time. Take a photo for me.
- Yes.

137
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
Just a second. My dad is annoying.

138
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,250
- Lower.
- Hold on.

139
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,958
- Full body shot.
- Yes…

140
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,083
Yeah?

141
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,791
- Is it good?
- Done.

142
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,916
Do I look good?

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,708
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

144
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,666
- I got your address.
- Nice.

145
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
Okay.

146
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,958
Bye-bye.

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,000
I bought you something.

148
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,666
It's in the kitchen.

149
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,250
I don't need anything. Just your company.

150
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,041
You're busy, too, all right?

151
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,958
What's up? No more mahjong?

152
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,250
Mrs. Li has arthritis in her fingers

153
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,041
so she can't wear rings.

154
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,708
She says it looks weird
shuffling the tiles.

155
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,625
Then find a new mahjong buddy.

156
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Old chaps like us,

157
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,708
we're used to old pals.

158
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
Getting used to new people takes time.

159
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,000
Forget it.

160
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,291
What happened?

161
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,000
Get some towels! Quickly!

162
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,000
- The big towel in the bathroom!
- Wait!

163
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,250
Here…

164
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,333
- You broke…
- Here.

165
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,250
- Hold on!
- Hurry up! Grab more! Quick!

166
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,458
ARE YOU HERE YET? HURRY

167
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,458
This took a long time to set up.

168
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,458
It's finally falling into place.

169
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,500
You know, this guy's
playing the long game on you.

170
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,791
The reason you made senior partner--

171
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,125
Hold on. Can you actually prove that?

172
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,375
"Playing the long game"? What?

173
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,916
You need solid evidence.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,916
I just think

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,208
that Chang Kai studied abroad.

176
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,750
He knows how to deal with foreigners.

177
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,500
- So…
- So Chang Kai agreed?

178
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,375
Agreed to what?

179
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,000
Today's all about
celebrating the grand opening

180
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,541
of our Singapore branch.

181
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,625
Chang Kai, I'd like to ask

182
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,791
if you're interested in working abroad.

183
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,125
I think I get what you meant.

184
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,166
- Okay.
- So…

185
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,458
I am interested
in expanding our business overseas.

186
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,833
Done deal! He's interested.

187
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,375
It's a deal then.

188
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,875
- No…
- What are you talking about? Cheers!

189
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,125
Thank you.

190
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,208
- Thank you.
- All right.

191
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,416
Ignore those two law nerds.

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,750
They only talk about work.
They're obsessed.

193
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,625
- Great!
- But--

194
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,541
Hold on.

195
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,666
"But."

196
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,625
See?

197
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,416
The most important "but".

198
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,750
But?

199
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,250
But I just got back to Taiwan.

200
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,333
I want to spend more time with my wife
and my father-in-law.

201
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,833
But I'll think about it, okay?

202
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,583
- Thank you.
- Sure.

203
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,625
Is your wife coming?

204
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,625
That's right.

205
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,333
- She bailed a bunch of times before.
- Yes.

206
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,583
Does she work?

207
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,125
Yes, she's been a bit busy lately.

208
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,833
You have to wash

209
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,875
your pots and bowls again.

210
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,125
No, they're fine.

211
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,500
Water from the tap is always clean.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,583
A little dirt won't hurt you.

213
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,916
I'll make time
to have someone check the pipes again.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,791
Stay out of this.

215
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,833
I can handle it myself.

216
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,166
By the way,

217
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,458
next weekend,

218
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,750
I'm camping at the Tamsui-Kavalan Trail
with Mr. Tang for two days.

219
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,458
How old are you? Camping?

220
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,916
I'm younger than you.

221
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,833
Anyway,

222
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,000
pack some noodles
for Chang Kai when you finish eating.

223
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
He said he liked those.

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,541
He was just being polite.

225
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,791
Every son-in-law does that…

226
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,500
Gosh! My goodness.

227
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,541
What's wrong?

228
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,458
Holy cow.

229
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,666
What happened?

230
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,541
I have an important dinner
with Chang Kai today,

231
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,916
and I forgot.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,458
Finish your noodles first.

233
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,708
I can't.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,250
Be careful.

235
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,833
I'll ask Mr. Chao over.

236
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
I'll text you later. Gotta run!

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,833
Jeez, she's always so scatterbrained.

238
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,166
It's driving me nuts.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,958
Kai, I'm sorry.

240
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,708
I'm on the way.
Wait for me. I'm almost there.

241
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,041
What's Jason doing?

242
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,208
What's taking him so long? Come on.

243
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey, just between us,

244
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,291
do you think Jason is top or bottom?

245
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't be silly.

246
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,041
Patricia, our firm is pretty open-minded.

247
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,125
If you're capable, nothing else matters.

248
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,583
No, I think I have a good sense of humor.

249
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,791
But sometimes I don't get his jokes.

250
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,208
Really? I get them.

251
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,833
- Hey!
- Here he is!

252
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,500
- Let me introduce him.
- Hi.

253
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,375
This is my partner, Roger.

254
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,000
- Hi.
- How do you do.

255
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,708
Here, have a seat.

256
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,041
Let's introduce ourselves too.

257
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,291
- Yeah.
- Just call me Patricia.

258
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,458
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,916
This is my humble wife.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,916
Yeah, I'm his humble wife.

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,083
I'm Amy. Hello.

262
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,125
Hello.

263
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,208
Uh… my… well…

264
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,708
- Your wife's not here.
- Yes, she's a bit busy.

265
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,791
- Traffic is bad today. Sorry I'm late.
- All good.

266
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,291
If she doesn't show up,
I'm starting to think she's your beard.

267
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,583
Patricia is your beard.

268
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,916
I am.

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,458
I don't get it.

270
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,416
Uncle, excuse me.
Could you speed up a bit?

271
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
Are you sure you should call me uncle?

272
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,583
Excuse me, sir. Could you speed up? I…

273
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,666
I'm in a hurry.

274
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,666
Okay, I'll try.

275
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>I'm so envious of your lifestyle.</i>

276
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,958
It's so artsy.

277
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,166
That's just a hobby. It's for fun.

278
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,166
If you're so envious,
why didn't you come to my arts talk?

279
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,791
She doesn't have time.

280
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,250
She's been staying up late,
writing up reports to get promoted.

281
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,166
Patricia, you're promoting
to an assistant professor?

282
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,041
Associate professor.

283
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,500
You're really an academic elite.

284
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,708
Here's to you.

285
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:13,250
Everyone's so ambitious.
I'm the only one who wants to retire.

286
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,541
You've made enough?

287
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,166
Then you should retire soon, and live off…
What's his name?

288
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
- Roger.
- Roger, what do you do?

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,166
Wait. Let me guess.

290
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,666
You dress sharp.

291
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,458
Must be art-related.

292
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,583
He just started getting into theater.

293
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,041
- I knew he was into arts.
- I see now.

294
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,291
A friend once asked me to support a play.

295
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,333
I asked around.

296
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,208
I heard theater doesn't make much money
and no one watches it.

297
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,125
What do you know? You don't watch it.

298
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,750
Being an actor is hard work.

299
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,958
They pour their hearts out on stage

300
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,666
and their income is unstable.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
Simon, your friends don't get it.

302
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,583
They're amateurs. They probably think

303
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,666
it's easy for actors
to get on stage and say some lines.

304
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,708
But that requires training, right?

305
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,291
- It's not easy.
- Right.

306
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,875
- Thanks.
- It's tough.

307
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,791
Oh, right. Relocating to Singapore?

308
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,416
I'll think about it.

309
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,875
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

310
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,625
- Here she is!
- I apologize.

311
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,708
Sorry to keep you waiting.

312
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,333
- This is my wife, Le-le.
- Welcome.

313
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,791
How do you do.

314
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,041
- I'll sit here.
- Wait.

315
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,916
Honey, did you rush here?

316
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,791
I think she was in a rush so…

317
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,958
Want to freshen up?

318
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,875
- It's fine.
- Freshen up and join us.

319
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,458
Sorry. Everyone, go ahead.

320
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,875
- Take your time.
- She's meeting you for the first time…

321
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,416
She's leaving already?

322
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,625
Is she okay? Should we check on her?

323
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,875
- She's okay. She'll freshen up.
- Go check on her.

324
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,791
UNCLE CHAO…

325
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,083
UNCLE CHAO PASSED AWAY YEARS AGO
DON'T ASK HIM OVER

326
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,166
- Sorry for being late.
- No worries. Welcome!

327
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,625
Something came up, sorry.

328
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,916
It's late. Are you tired?

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,250
- You must be hungry. Dig in.
- Thanks.

330
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,250
Hold on.

331
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,250
Before we eat, let's celebrate.

332
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,750
It's the first time
all of us are together.

333
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,500
You're late. Have a drink.

334
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
- No problem. I apologize.
- Just a sip.

335
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,666
- Let's all drink together.
- I'll drink with her. Sorry.

336
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,625
We were talking about you.

337
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
Really? What about?

338
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,833
We're curious about you.

339
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,958
What do you do? You had to work so late.

340
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,000
- No, during the day, I work at--
- She works at a bank.

341
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,250
You work at a bank?

342
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,916
- Really?
- Yes.

343
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,958
She got promoted to manager,
so she's busier now.

344
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,583
- Good job.
- You work so hard.

345
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,041
You can ask her for financial advice.

346
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,375
That's amazing.

347
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,041
Le-le, you're amazing.

348
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
I'm bad with numbers.

349
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,083
If we have any questions,

350
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,416
we'll have to consult Le-le.

351
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,708
By the way, we have a book club.

352
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,458
Want to join us?

353
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,000
Share some financial tips with us wives.

354
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,333
That sounds great.

355
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,291
What kind of books do you read
in the book club?

356
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,083
For humble wives like us,

357
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,333
we read books
on parenting, cooking and personal growth.

358
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,333
Sometimes we dive into art books too.

359
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,875
Why don't we all join
when I host the next session?

360
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,583
Le-le and I will make a toast to everyone.

361
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,000
Here's to our overseas expansion.
Le-le, let's make a toast.

362
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,791
Here's to our overseas expansion.

363
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,166
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

364
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,083
Cheers.

365
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,541
Our overseas business…

366
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,708
We're counting on you.

367
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,958
To everyone.

368
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,500
My dad's kitchen pipes burst.

369
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Are they fixed?

370
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,250
Yes.

371
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,041
- They said they'd relocate me to--
- Did I embarrass you?

372
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,291
Is this silent treatment?

373
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
You think staying silent helps?

374
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,625
I think you're emotional.

375
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,375
I can't discuss things with you.

376
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,666
So you're just gonna shut down?

377
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,333
My dad said he and my mom
never fought their whole lives.

378
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,083
No fighting, no talking,
no problem. And what happened?

379
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,250
We're not like your parents.

380
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,458
Yes,

381
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,458
we are just like them.

382
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,125
I know that "no response" look.

383
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,500
How can you avoid confrontation calmly?

384
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,833
Why are you so well-mannered?

385
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,500
Do you know silence is the best way
to show contempt?

386
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,375
Is this really so serious?

387
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,125
You don't approve of my job.

388
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,000
That's not true.

389
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,083
Do you care about how I feel?

390
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,000
Have I ever been your top priority?

391
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,750
I told you about this important event,
but you still forgot.

392
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,208
- I told you, my dad--
- Stop using your dad as an excuse.

393
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,583
You know how much you care about your dad.

394
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,916
Honestly, I've had more meals
with your dad than you have.

395
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,000
You're just like him.

396
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,041
You do your own thing.

397
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,750
You live in your own world.

398
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,458
- I just--
- No.

400
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,125
- It's my fault. I--
- Sorry.

401
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,291
My bad. I shouldn't have been late.

402
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,625
But that doesn't mean

403
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,625
you can humiliate me in front of everyone.

404
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,291
Why would I humiliate you?

405
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,750
Why would I do that?

406
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,041
If my job…

407
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,916
isn't good enough to be a partner's wife,

408
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,000
then I guess we're done here.

409
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,083
Don't do this, okay?

410
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,541
Just think,

411
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,250
you're not in their social circle.

412
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,750
Have you forgotten?

413
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,791
I was invited

414
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,000
to their book club tonight.

415
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,666
- Hey.
- What?

416
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,583
- I gotta pee.
- I gotta pee too.

417
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,625
Never mind. You go first.

418
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:00,708
You go first.

419
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:02,750
You…

420
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,333
Or we go together?

421
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,458
Come on.

422
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,291
It's okay.

423
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,250
All right?

424
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,708
Frankly,

425
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,041
we've been over this many times.

426
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,125
I…

427
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,875
I make enough money for two.

428
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,500
You could get an easier job.

429
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,000
What kind of work is easy?

430
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,208
Not working is the easiest.

431
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,250
I'm not telling you not to work.

432
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,083
You work at a convenience store by day,

433
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,250
and do comedy by night.

434
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,166
Have I said anything?

435
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,208
I never see you when I get home.

436
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,875
I want us to have our own life together.

437
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,166
I also hope

438
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,291
you can slowly
blend into my social circle. Get it?

439
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,958
I know.

440
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,625
But…

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,583
I'm just not used
to those kinds of social settings.

442
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,291
You don't have to be so hostile.

443
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,166
I'm not.

444
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,916
You're not? Are you sure?

445
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:26,583
You're totally judging me
and my colleagues at the firm.

446
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,666
Even if they're being nice to me,

447
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,083
you still think they have motives.

448
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,708
- Don't they?
- Why would they?

449
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,958
They just want to know
what my wife is like.

450
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,791
They want to get to know you.

451
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,750
I doubt they want to get to know me.

452
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,125
Doesn't your dad always tell you?

453
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,291
To treat everyone with composure.

454
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:55,000
Whether they are better than you or not,
you don't have to please them.

455
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,958
So I'm not trying to please them.

456
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,583
You don't have to be defensive.

457
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,791
Why pick such a high-end restaurant?

458
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,291
They wanted to celebrate, of course.

459
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,958
Did you hear
what they were talking about all night?

460
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,000
That's just how their lives are.

461
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,958
So we're on different wavelengths.

462
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,500
Calm down and listen. Look at me.

463
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,750
You're my wife.

464
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,500
You're a big part of my life.

465
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,750
I just want

466
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,458
you to meet them and get to know them.
That's all.

467
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,541
Is that so hard?

468
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,833
Is it?

469
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,166
So am I…

470
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,625
Am I that part of your life
you're too ashamed to admit?

471
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,083
So we're back to this again?

472
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,208
Sometimes, I really…

473
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,666
I really don't think I know you.

474
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,916
You're so humorous and likable on stage.

475
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,541
You're good telling jokes.

476
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:21,166
So you're complaining
about me being boring off-stage?

477
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,458
That's not what I meant.

478
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,583
I just hope
you don't take this so seriously.

479
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,916
So you don't think
what you did today was out of line?

480
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,666
What I did was not okay.

481
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,833
I apologize.

482
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,000
Is this a sincere apology?

483
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,208
What do I need to do
for you to believe I'm sincere?

484
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,625
What do you want me to do?

485
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,375
What do you want me to do?

486
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,750
I don't know.

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,916
I…

488
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,166
I really want to believe you, but…

489
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,625
I work hard every day.

490
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,500
I work hard, but I'm also anxious.

491
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,833
Not everyone is like you.

492
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,583
Your family is wealthy,
and you studied abroad.

493
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,375
Your parents can enjoy
a comfortable retirement

494
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,875
and live carefree every day.

495
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,125
What's your biggest setback in life?

496
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,333
Probably that time

497
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:37,500
when you were sure you'd be made partner
but it didn't happen.

498
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,666
Are you discrediting all my efforts?

499
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,541
Is it my fault the way I was raised?

500
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,083
- That's not what I meant.
- No?

501
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,291
I come from a wealthier family

502
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,375
and had better upbringing.
Is that my fault?

503
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,833
Is that my parents' fault?

504
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,333
You think my life isn't hard?

505
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,791
Even if I put in
double or triple the effort,

506
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,791
people might not acknowledge me.

507
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,666
Do you know that everyone thinks
I was made partner because of my family?

508
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,541
- Because of my parents?
- I said that's not what I meant.

509
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,000
Then what do you mean?

510
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,041
I can tell you loud and clear

511
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,666
that I work harder than anyone.

512
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,833
I work harder than anyone in the world!

513
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,833
I said that is not what I meant!
We all have our difficulties!

514
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,208
What do you mean? Tell me!

515
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,875
You just have it easier than others.

516
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,958
Do you always assume
what people's lives are like?

517
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,666
Can you just try to seriously imagine

518
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,083
what other people's lives are like?

519
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,375
I like your sense of humor.

520
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,291
I really do.

521
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,916
Can you tell me

522
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,041
what about this industry

523
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,333
upset you? What bothers you?

524
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,333
It doesn't upset or bother me.

525
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,000
But…

526
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,958
But I really want to know,

527
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,916
what's the appeal of this job to you?

528
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,125
Can you tell me?

529
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,500
Because it makes me feel like

530
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,708
I'm not the only one
who feels powerless in this world.

531
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,333
When I'm on stage

532
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,916
talking about problems I can't fix

533
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,541
and mocking at my tragedies,

534
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,416
those strangers laughed.

535
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,375
They get it.

536
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,208
Do you get it?

537
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,208
I do.

538
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,958
Can you just…

539
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,166
be honest with me for once?

540
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:14,500
How exactly does this job bother you?

541
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,208
Can you not be a stand-up comedian?

542
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,375
Thank you.

543
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,083
I finally got an honest answer.

544
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,833
Where are you going?

545
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,875
You asked me to be honest.
Now you're leaving.

546
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,875
I'm afraid to say something
that we'd both regret.

547
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,833
Le-le.

548
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,500
Le-le.

549
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,833
I didn't mean it.

550
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,375
Neither did I.

551
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,250
<i>Be honest. Why did you want to marry me?</i>

552
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,541
<i>Do I have to say it?</i>

553
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,875
It's because… seeing you makes me happy.

554
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,458
Hey.

555
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,625
It's going to rain soon. Come home.

556
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,333
Your home or mine?

557
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,875
Isn't my home yours too?

558
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,416
Get down here.

559
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,708
What's wrong with your foot?

560
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,708
Wanna see a doctor?

561
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:32,833
No.

562
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,208
Here, take this.

563
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,041
Le-le!

564
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,041
Here comes Daddy!

565
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:36,875
<i>Anyway, this man made me</i>
<i>brave the risks of strewn corpses</i>

566
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,500
<i>to step into the tomb of love together.</i>

567
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,291
<i>Lastly, I thank…</i>

568
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,333
<i>Wow, I've lived in Taipei for years,</i>

569
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,291
but I didn't know such a place.

570
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,208
I thought we're having Korean beef.

571
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,250
The show's about to start.
It's a surprise for you all.

572
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,458
- Hi.
- Who's performing?

573
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,125
Four of us. This way please.

574
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,291
Today's performer
has been laying low for a while.

575
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:24,208
Everyone, let's welcome Cheng Le-le!

576
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,708
Hello, how's everyone doing?

577
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,416
I'm Le-le.

578
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
- Good!
- Good!

579
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,375
I took two weeks off.

580
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,666
These two weeks mattered a lot to me.

581
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,791
Because I needed to think about
whether or not to get a divorce.

582
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,208
I know some of you must be thinking,

583
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,416
"You need two weeks
to think about getting a divorce?"

584
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,666
"That long?"

585
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,125
Okay, here's the thing.

586
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:56,541
I'm thinking about it
because two weeks ago,

587
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:00,083
I met up with my husband's
law firm coworkers

588
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,791
for an important dinner.

589
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,166
It was a celebration
for opening an overseas branch.

590
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,625
And they met up
at a very posh French restaurant.

591
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,208
When his partner saw me, he asked,

592
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:15,250
"What does your wife do?"

593
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,208
Let me tell you about me first.

594
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:22,041
I work at a convenience store
during the day and perform here at night.

595
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,708
And my husband,

596
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,250
a handsome, charming,
and successful lawyer,

597
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,041
a partner at his law firm,

598
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,916
paused to think.

599
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,250
I was right next to him. I thought,

600
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,500
"What's he gonna say?"

601
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:38,250
"Will he say I'm a convenience store clerk
or a stand-up comedian?"

602
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,208
And between these two answers,

603
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,000
he eventually chose to say

604
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,208
that I'm a bank executive.

605
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:47,125
That sucks!

606
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:51,375
- That moment for me was complicated.
- Cheers.

607
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,166
- A toast to you.
- You actually think so little of my jobs.

608
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,250
You're too embarrassed to say it.

609
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,708
But on the other hand, I also thought,

610
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:05,458
a bank executive and a law firm partner

611
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,125
actually sound like a perfect match.

612
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,375
Great match!

613
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,958
Anyway, that day,
with my limited knowledge,

614
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,791
I thought, okay, a bank executive

615
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,833
must have a keen eye for numbers.

616
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,666
So the whole night, in every conversation,

617
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,791
I kept throwing in all kinds of numbers.

618
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:28,041
Did you know there were 114,606 marriages
registered in Taiwan last year?

619
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,083
The marriage rate was 4.88 per thousand,
which is a record low.

620
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:35,250
But 47,887 couples got divorced, excluding
those who wanted to but couldn't.

621
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,041
The divorce rate was 9.32%.

622
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,416
I kept up the act till the very end.

623
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,458
I almost pulled it off.
But then I blew it.

624
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,500
Because when the dinner was over,

625
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,375
the wives were waving goodbye,

626
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:55,666
saying things like,
"Bye-bye," "See you," "Ciao, ciao,"

627
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,666
stuff like that.

628
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,958
All sorts of international farewells.

629
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,500
And I just automatically blurted out,

630
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,416
"Thank you. Come again!"

631
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,916
"Have a great day!"

632
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:14,916
But you know what?
What pissed me off the most was,

633
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,625
among his law firm partners,
a couple was obviously gay.

634
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,625
They were so good-looking.

635
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:25,000
And they didn't have to hide who they are.

636
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:29,208
So can someone tell me,
is being a comedian these days

637
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,750
harder than coming out of the closet?

638
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,666
But I think being a comedian
is a noble profession.

639
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,375
Because it's a lot like being a lawyer.

640
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,833
We both build our happiness
on other people's misery.

641
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:44,958
- Right on!
- Is being a lawyer that big a deal?

642
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,083
Fine, I admit it's a big deal.

643
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,875
Because now that I'm considering divorce,
I've realized,

644
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,541
if you're a lawyer,

645
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,333
you can save yourself a good amount

646
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,833
of attorney fees.

647
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,875
Isn't that a big deal?

648
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,333
So, I gotta say, my husband,

649
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:03,416
he's actually…

650
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,208
I…

651
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I…

652
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:20,125
I remember at our wedding…

653
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:26,416
I remember asking him one question
at our wedding.

654
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
It was,

655
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,416
"Why did you want to marry me?"

656
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,500
And he answered,

657
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,000
"Because seeing you makes me happy."

658
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,625
What about now?

659
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:40,333
Why doesn't seeing me
make him happy anymore?

660
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,791
What's changed about me?

661
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,416
For better or for worse,

662
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,625
for richer or for poorer,

663
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,416
in sickness and in health…

664
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,583
Excuse me. I gotta go. Sorry.

665
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,833
…we will be faithful to each other.

666
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,875
To love and cherish

667
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,750
till death do us part.

668
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:07,291
When we said those things,

669
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,583
we weren't lying, right?

670
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,166
We weren't, were we?

671
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,125
I remember every moment of the wedding.

672
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,166
We were once so very much in love, but…

673
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,666
how did we fall out of love?

674
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,125
I'm going to Singapore.

675
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,708
It was decided today.

676
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,791
They want me to manage the firm there.

677
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,666
Can we just

678
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,125
give it another shot?

679
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,333
The problem is

680
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,916
we both tried too hard.

681
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,750
Chang Kai fell in love with me
on his worst day.

682
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:46,041
But he decided to leave me

683
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,708
on his best day.

684
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,791
Maybe it's not that the love is gone.

685
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,250
We just tried too hard.

686
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,250
Hey!

687
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,750
Would you prefer
that we curse at Chang Kai with you,

688
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,666
or more of a

689
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,541
"Don't say that about him!" type?

690
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,000
I respect his decision.

691
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,708
That sounds robotic.

692
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean it.

693
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,166
Why don't you move back to your dad's?

694
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,250
I don't want to move back
to that old haunted house-like place.

695
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,291
Hey, this bag is for you.

696
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,041
You forgot how great it is to live alone.

697
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:31,125
There's no guilt in not making dinner.

698
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,125
You can walk around naked
with slimming cream on.

699
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,083
As long as you become prettier,

700
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,791
anyone will come back.

701
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:44,708
Living alone is awesome.
You only have to worry about yourself.

702
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:48,708
Starting afresh at this age,
anything's possible.

703
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,916
Hey, how about
we live together in 30 years?

704
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:56,416
I visited a community the other day.
The house was gorgeous.

705
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,875
It's great for seniors.

706
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,208
Wait, seniors?

707
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:00,708
Are you serious?

708
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:04,333
Is this what we're dreaming about now?
That's ridiculous.

709
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,666
- Hi, Mr. Cheng.
- Mr. Cheng.

710
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,750
- You…
- Dad.

711
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,125
You two…

712
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,750
We're here to help.

713
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,750
Thank you.

714
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,500
You two…

715
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,583
Not yet.

716
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,291
If it doesn't work out,

717
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,708
just move back home.

718
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,916
I'll support you.

719
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,208
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

720
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,708
<i>No way that Mr. Cheng would be so caring.</i>

721
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,458
Thank you.

722
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,458
- You two…
- Not yet.

723
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:51,500
What a waste of money.

724
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,250
Just move back home.

725
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,458
Why rent a tiny studio
that's ten minutes away from here?

726
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,000
I want a fresh start.

727
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,791
If I do move back home,

728
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,333
I'll start cleaning up. You'll regret it.

729
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,208
You got room for all your stuff?

730
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,625
If not, I'll put 'em at yours.

731
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,333
No way. Don't bring any more junk home.

732
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,250
You've hoarded lots of junk.

733
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,333
Clean up the junk
you left at my place first.

734
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,208
- I'll be grateful, okay?
- Fine.

735
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:19,500
All right. I'll pick up some stuff.

736
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,500
- What stuff? There's more?
- Thanks, girls.

737
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,875
Sure, leave it to us.

738
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,416
Anyway, I've got stuff

739
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,208
to bring back to you.

740
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,375
Hi, Mr. Cheng.

741
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,791
- Hi.
- I'll let you through.

742
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:29,958
He's my colleague.

743
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
<i>What is it with you and Chang Kai?</i>

744
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:38,333
I left to avoid
talking about Chang Kai and me.

745
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,083
It's a blessing to be able to quarrel.

746
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,541
Hey,

747
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,000
I heard a joke two days ago.

748
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,083
An elderly man told his child,

749
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,000
"If you don't get married or have kids,

750
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,375
when every house lights up
during Lunar New Year,

751
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,791
you'll know how lonely you are."

752
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,666
The daughter replied,

753
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,041
"I just want to stay single."

754
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,541
"It's not like
I won't pay my electric bill."

755
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,291
What a lame joke.

756
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,666
- Is it lame?
- It's so lame.

757
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,416
From my years of experience,

758
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,708
I'd like to give you some marriage advice.

759
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,958
You're probably the last person in Taipei
to give marriage advice.

760
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,291
Just listen to me.

761
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,375
It's about the right time, right place,
and the right people.

762
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:31,000
It fails if it's the wrong time,
wrong place, and wrong people.

763
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,250
Fine. Leave such advice

764
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,833
for the aliens.

765
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,541
If aliens do visit Earth,

766
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,625
it means they think highly of us.

767
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,625
Don't you find
highly intelligent beings like them

768
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,458
really incredible?

769
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,916
I never thought my first day separated,

770
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,083
I'd be talking about aliens with my dad.

771
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,583
Where's my stuff?

772
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:04,875
It's in the kitchen.

773
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:07,833
All right.

774
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:13,666
Hey, where did you say
you're going back to?

775
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,708
Home.

776
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,000
Su-fei and Chia-yun are waiting.

777
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,625
Your home, my home.

778
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:21,958
My home is your home.
