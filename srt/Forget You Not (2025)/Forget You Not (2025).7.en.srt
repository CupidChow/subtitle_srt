1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,625
<i>He seemed clumsy and careless,</i>

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,166
<i>but he was actually very observant.</i>

3
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,958
IN MEMORY OF MR. CHENG KUANG-CHI

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,000
Kuang-chi might have seemed
to be bold and fearless,

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,208
but I know his biggest fear
was his daughter being unhappy.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,708
Here's the thing about him.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:34,291
He kept asking me to teach him
how to make tomato omelet rice.

8
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,958
I'd have taught him,

9
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,708
but you know how he was.

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,041
He was only good
at making instant noodles.

11
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,541
Kuang-Chi

12
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,416
was the best and most loyal friend

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,166
I've ever had in my life.

14
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,583
Last time, at Tang's funeral,

15
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,416
I think I also said this about Tang.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,916
I said,

17
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,666
"People our age

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,541
seem to be attending

19
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,208
more funerals than birthday parties."

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,875
But Kuang-chi said,

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:19,708
"Now there are fewer of us
attending these events."

22
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,791
Safe journey.

23
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>Kuang-chi was</i>
<i>a humorous and easygoing person.</i>

24
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,916
He just went ahead
to scout the way for us.

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,000
Next, let's invite

26
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,708
his long-time close friend,

27
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:45,666
Ms. Hsiu-lien, to come up
and share her moments with Kuang-chi.

28
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,833
Hello, I'm Liu Hsiu-lien.

29
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,666
I'm not dressed like this
because I'm rude.

30
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,916
It's because
this dress was Kuang-chi's favorite.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,333
Whenever I had it on,

32
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,875
he'd compliment me.

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,708
So for his funeral,

34
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,625
I wanted to put it on

35
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,541
so he could enjoy it

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,708
and praise me again.

37
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
Not a lot of you know this,

38
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,666
but I almost married Kuang-chi.

39
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,166
When we were out on a date,

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,541
Kuang-chi ruined the moment by saying,

41
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,250
"I want to get married
so that when I'm old,

42
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,041
someone can care for me. That's all."

43
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,875
He also said

44
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,375
that he didn't want
his daughter to worry about him.

45
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,041
But then I thought,

46
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,583
"For when you're old? Aren't you old now?"

47
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,500
But if you came out of your coffin now

48
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,541
and asked me to marry you,

49
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,500
I'd still say no.

50
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,333
Ms. Hsiu-lien,
thank you for the heartfelt speech.

51
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,375
Now let's invite
another close friend of Kuang-chi,

52
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,416
Ms. Wang Mei-huei, to speak to us.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,916
Are you sure?

54
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,000
All right. Next, let's invite
Mr. Chang Kai.

55
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,333
Hello, I'm Chang Kai.

56
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,208
I was Mr. Cheng Kuang-chi's…

57
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,250
close friend, I think.

58
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,416
Just joking.

59
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,125
But I actually am.

60
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,541
It's unfortunate.

61
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,250
I never imagine I'd see Le-le's dad
for the last time like this.

62
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,125
He was not only my in-law

63
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,583
but also my friend, despite the age gap.

64
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,250
He was optimistic by nature.

65
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:53,166
I think his liveliness and high spirits
surpassed that of many young people.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,083
I'd like to share a short story.

67
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,833
Le-le's dad used to tell me in private

68
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,208
he was grateful
I took Le-le off his hands.

69
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,875
But I'd like to use this opportunity

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,375
to tell him

71
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,625
that I was the grateful one.

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,583
I'd like to thank him
for entrusting Le-Le to me.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,666
But I didn't know any better

74
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,500
and gave Le-le back.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,375
Despite all that,

76
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,333
the connection between him and me
will never disappear.

77
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,708
We are the two people in the world…

78
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,833
who love Le-le the most.

79
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,583
Thank you.

80
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,541
Friends and family of Mr. Cheng,
thank you all

81
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,750
for sharing and looking back
on various aspects of Kuang-chi's life.

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,083
So, to close the funeral today,

83
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,125
we'd like Mr. Cheng's
most beloved daughter, Cheng Le-le,

84
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,083
to share her thoughts on her father.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:23,375
RAIN THAT WON'T STOP ANYTIME SOON

86
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:28,083
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

87
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:41,041
Buddha, Guanyin,
Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary,

88
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,291
watch over him…

89
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,833
Dad.

90
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,333
If you're in pain and want to go,

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,208
just go ahead. Don't worry about me.

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
Mr. Cheng, you're awake?

93
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,333
Dad.

94
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,833
Just…

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,375
Just now,

96
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,750
I was already at death's door.

97
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,750
Then I saw you there,

98
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,166
scolding me.

99
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,375
I was so scared

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,083
that I came back.

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,958
Your dad's adorable.

102
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,958
There's always a catch
with every adorable person.

103
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,041
We'd like Mr. Cheng's
most beloved daughter, Cheng Le-le,

104
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,125
to share her thoughts on her father.

105
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
Are you kidding me?

106
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,541
- Hey…
- Kuang-chi.

107
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,375
So you knew?

108
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,000
Why the tears?

109
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,875
Kuang-chi.

110
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,166
- You freaked me out.
- That was freaky.

111
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,041
I was freaked out.

112
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,250
What an old rascal.

113
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,250
- Oh boy.
- What the hell was that?

114
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,875
Thank you for coming today.

115
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,458
I've missed you all so much.

116
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,416
When I heard what everyone just said,

117
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,791
I really thought this…

118
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,291
Well,

119
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,500
I've never died before

120
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,958
so I don't know

121
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,500
what it's like to be

122
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,041
in a coffin,

123
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,125
or if I can hear people talking.

124
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,375
So my daughter and I

125
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,625
came up with this little plot.

126
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,708
Sorry about that.

127
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,458
You're such a prankster.

128
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,625
I'm glad you're okay.

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,583
I've been willful all my life.

130
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,458
I'm not a great dad,

131
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,583
or a good husband.

132
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
As a friend,

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,416
I'm not really reliable.

134
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,458
As for my jobs,

135
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,625
I was a jack of all trades,
master of none.

136
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,500
I wanted to do everything.

137
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,875
Enough of that.

138
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't get to be a good son either.

139
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,333
Of course, I wasn't a good lover.

140
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,250
But I suppose

141
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,083
I'm a good person.

142
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,625
All my life,

143
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,125
I feared having regrets.

144
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,208
But because of that,

145
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,916
I ended up letting lots of people down.

146
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,333
When I heard what you guys just said,

147
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,125
I realized

148
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
that kicking the bucket

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,750
has a big perk.

150
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,416
Everyone says nice things about you
and all memories became wonderful.

151
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,000
Le-le,

152
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,541
I've always said,

153
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,083
if the sky falls,
tall people will hold it up.

154
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,416
You've always said,

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,958
"What if the tall people just duck?"

156
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,333
What will you do then?

157
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,375
Listen,

158
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,458
I'll be watching over you

159
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,208
from up in the sky.

160
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,750
So don't be afraid.

161
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,291
I'll be watching over you.

162
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,125
IN LOVING MEMORY OF MR. CHENG KUANG-CHI

163
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,708
I wanted to give you a heads-up.

164
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,458
Even if I knew,

165
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,791
I'd still show up.

166
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,916
Do you think we should hurry up

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,291
and get our divorce finalized?

168
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,708
I can ask to be relocated back.

169
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,625
Why would you?

170
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,375
Get out of here.

171
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,083
I can't even handle my dad.

172
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm really glad we didn't have kids.

173
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,000
If we did, things would've been

174
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,791
too much to handle.

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,250
If anything really happened to my dad,

176
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,833
all that miscellaneous stuff…

177
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,583
I'll do whatever you want.

178
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,416
If you need help financially--

179
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,125
It's all good.

180
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,458
But thank you.

181
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,708
Le-le.

182
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,791
Can you not always act so tough?

183
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,041
Cheng Kuang-chi is

184
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,041
really crazy, right?

185
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,916
Like father, like daughter.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,541
Hey, what do you mean?

187
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,916
Aren't you just as crazy
to have arranged this funeral for him?

188
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,041
Do you think I can stop him
from doing anything he wants?

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,833
IN LOVING MEMORY OF MR. CHENG KUANG-CHI

190
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,250
All right, that's enough.

191
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,125
You barely took five steps.

192
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,416
I'm tired. I want to sit down.

193
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,208
Ten more steps.

194
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,125
Mr. Cheng, time for your pills.

195
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,625
Here.

196
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,458
- Five steps.
- Are you haggling now?

197
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,458
Seven steps.

198
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,708
You can have ice cream later.

199
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,750
Okay. Fine, I'll take them.

200
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,458
You can do it. You're doing well today.

201
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,250
Yes, good boy!

202
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,375
One more step.

203
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,166
Nice. Good boy, Cheng Kuang-chi.

204
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,791
Why do you sound like
you're talking to a dog?

205
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,541
Come on, even a dog walks faster.

206
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,416
That might be an insult to dogs.

207
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,208
Come on, faster.

208
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,625
Don't just pick the big ones.

209
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,041
You only pick the big ones.

210
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,250
Dad, you… Hey!

211
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,833
Hey, wait.

212
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,583
I'm exhausted.

213
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,083
You're just messing around, aren't you?

214
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,208
- One last step?
- The last step.

215
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,833
- Okay.
- The last step. Come.

216
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,083
Good job!

217
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,958
- Mr. Cheng Kuang-chi is awesome.
- Gosh.

218
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,291
Ice cream.

219
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,916
- You're the best.
- Really?

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,375
And at this place,

221
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,583
you don't have to pay
at the grocery stores

222
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,333
because all the cashiers are caregivers.

223
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,041
They will say,

224
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,208
"You don't have to pay
because someone has paid."

225
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,666
Those seniors will say,

226
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,458
"That's nice."

227
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,291
It wasn't funny?

228
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,875
I have to stay focused
to walk a straight line.

229
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,166
This is so good.

230
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,125
Yeah.

231
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,458
Well, can you always get me ice cream

232
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,875
after my rehab exercise?

233
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,041
You wish.

234
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,708
Here, I'll take a photo of you.

235
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,625
Let me post a story.

236
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,000
Gosh… Again?

237
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,750
Come on.

238
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,875
Good boy.

239
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,875
I'm all better. Why take so many pills?

240
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,541
I'm home.

241
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,458
Dad, what are you doing?

242
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,333
Dad.

243
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,666
Do you need help?

244
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,833
Dad.

245
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,541
Can I come in?

246
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,375
Let me know if you need any help.

247
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,625
Dad.

248
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,583
Listen, I have to head out.

249
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,416
And I'll be back in just three hours.

250
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,333
I really need to go out and work.

251
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,583
Yeah?

252
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay.

253
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,750
Here, just listen to music and watch TV.

254
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,333
I'll be back in just three hours.

255
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,041
Be right back.

256
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,708
<i>Thank you for the second chance.</i>

257
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,875
Oh well, someone got Covid again.

258
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,708
Got your script?

259
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,625
I forgot to print it out,
but I've saved it on my phone.

260
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,041
- Take a look.
- It's fine.

261
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,583
- Just go ahead. What's the topic?
- Nursing home.

262
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,125
- That's boring.
- It's not.

263
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,541
It's fascinating.
It's a place in the Netherlands.

264
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
They built a retirement village
for dementia patients.

265
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,208
Those patients
don't know they have dementia.

266
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,125
And they're monitored 24/7.

267
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,875
Seriously, it's fascinating.

268
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,875
Keep going.

269
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,500
I'll bring up my dad
to introduce the topic.

270
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:33,125
Then, I'll be ironic and say
how happy it is to have dementia.

271
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,458
I'll wrap it up in a more serious tone.

272
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,666
It's more sentimental.

273
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,583
If you're okay with that.

274
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,958
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

275
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,375
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Ms. Cheng?</i>

276
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,875
<i>We're a stock market</i>
<i>analysis and survey company.</i>

277
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,083
- No, thanks.
<i>- With the recent stock market surge--</i>

278
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,416
Sorry about that.

279
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,333
Make sure you do well on stage.

280
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,041
- I will.
- You've got the right outfit today.

281
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,083
It's more feminine.

282
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,666
Yeah.

283
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,125
All right. I'll go and…

284
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,458
Okay, thank you. I'll get ready.

285
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:17,000
Coming up next is our club's
outstanding comedian.

286
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,250
As long as she's here,

287
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
there's no audience she can't win over.

288
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,250
Let's welcome Cheng Le-le.

289
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,291
Hi, everyone. I'm Le-le.

290
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,875
How's everyone doing today?

291
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:36,958
- So-so!
- Good!

292
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,833
"So-so?"

293
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:39,791
Same here.

294
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,833
Well, recently, it's been…

295
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,208
Sorry, I've been single for too long,

296
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,791
so I forgot
to turn off things that vibrate.

297
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,791
Here, well…

298
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,291
It's unprofessional of me
to bring my phone on stage.

299
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,166
So should I answer it
just as unprofessionally?

300
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,375
- Yes!
- Go ahead! Answer it!

301
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,291
- Answer it!
- Hello?

302
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,291
Answer it!

303
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,916
<i>Le-le, where are you?</i>

304
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,166
<i>It's so loud there.</i>

305
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,458
I'm at work. What's up?

306
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,833
<i>Your dad has been</i>
<i>downstairs waiting for you.</i>

307
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,833
<i>He said you're picking him up.</i>

308
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,625
Why's he waiting for me?
We don't have a date.

309
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,416
Where are you meeting him?

310
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,250
We're grown-ups.

311
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,458
We can go home on our own, right?

312
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,875
<i>What do you mean? I…</i>

313
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,625
<i>I'll hand him the phone.</i>
<i>Talk to him yourself. Hey, Mr. Cheng.</i>

314
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,041
<i>Where is he?</i>

315
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,000
<i>- Le-le, your dad's gone. Where is he?</i>
- Okay.

316
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,416
I think I need to unprofessionally
call our host back up here…

317
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,333
Let's give her a big hand.

318
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,791
But why is he gone?

319
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,666
Can you look for him nearby?

320
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,625
I'll be back right after I'm done here.

321
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,958
Okay? Please?

322
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,666
She probably forgot her lines.
She's calling her writer.

323
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,708
- Chia-yun, where are you?
- It's okay, give her a minute…

324
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,500
Okay, that's fine. Don't panic.

325
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,000
Take Shaw to the doctor first.

326
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,166
Okay, he'll get better.

327
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,666
Don't panic.

328
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,583
I actually brought my phone too.

329
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,833
Actually, I've got something to share.

330
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,875
I'll finish my set.

331
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,291
Single people say
to us who are married or have kids,

332
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:34,416
"I can imagine that you're a good father."

333
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,041
Once you have a kid,
your whole life changes.

334
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:43,208
Because those trivial things in life
that used to be easy and simple

335
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,666
become super difficult.

336
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,833
Dad.

337
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,583
Dad!

338
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,458
Sir, could you cooperate with us?

339
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,625
Your daughter is on her way. Just wait.

340
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,625
I want to go home.

341
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,083
- I know. We'll let you go.
- I'm fully able.

342
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,583
- Why can't I go home?
- You can…

343
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,541
- But if you leave alone, it's unsafe.
- I want to go home!

344
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,916
Be careful.

345
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,791
- Sir, need a hand?
- No, it's okay. I got it.

346
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,083
You hit me.

347
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,375
No, we won't touch you.

348
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,375
- Dad!
- All right…

349
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,875
- Are you his daughter?
- Yes.

350
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:58,958
Your dad might have lost his way.

351
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,000
It's dangerous for him to go out alone.

352
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,125
- Be careful.
- Easy.

353
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,125
Can we leave now?

354
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,125
Yes, we need you to sign some papers.

355
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,333
Here.

356
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,000
Thank you.

357
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,083
Sign here.

358
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:19,125
Do you know
what my favorite dementia joke is?

359
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,208
I don't remember.

360
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,083
Your dad's quite fit.

361
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,750
He's very strong. He was going to hit us.

362
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,083
By the way,

363
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,875
you really shouldn't
let your elderly parent live alone.

364
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,625
He is not living alone!

365
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,458
Okay.

366
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,125
We're leaving.

367
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,125
Let's go home.

368
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,458
- Come on.
- Let's go home.

369
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,541
Take it easy.

370
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,416
They thought I couldn't find my way home.

371
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,666
That's so weird.

372
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:03,625
- When I was at sea, I never got lost.
- Take care.

373
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,833
Watch it.

374
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,041
- Officer.
- Yes?

375
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,041
I'm sorry, and thank you.

376
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,000
You're welcome.

377
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,083
Take care.

378
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,333
Why did you run out?

379
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,625
Where exactly did you go tonight?

380
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,166
Dad.

381
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,083
Mr. Cheng Kuang-chi.

382
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,333
I'm talking to you. Who am I?

383
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,291
What happened to your arm? It was…

384
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,458
It was fine. Why…

385
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,750
Mr. Cheng.

386
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,125
Can you listen to me? Can you--

387
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,583
- Give it back!
- I will.

388
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,791
But answer my questions first.

389
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,458
Why did you run out?

390
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,208
Why on earth did you run out?

391
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,375
What happened to you tonight?
Can you try to recall?

392
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,875
Because if this is the case, I don't know…

393
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:28,666
I don't know
if I can leave you at home alone.

394
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,583
Do you remember?

395
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,291
We didn't say we'd meet at the gate.

396
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,833
Okay? So don't wait for me there.

397
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,625
Do you remember?

398
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,541
I'm grown up.
Don't pick me up at my elementary school.

399
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,583
Remember that?

400
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:44,833
I'm divorced,
so stop mentioning Chang Kai.

401
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,541
Didn't I tell you that I had to work today
and would be gone for three hours?

402
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,083
Didn't I tell you that?

403
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,625
Can you pay attention when I speak?

404
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,958
If this keeps happening,

405
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:14,041
I really think
I have to put you in a nursing home.

406
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,083
Because I don't know
if I can keep taking care of you

407
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,875
in this place by myself.

408
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:30,125
I lost my job today
looking for you at the police station.

409
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,916
Do you know I have a job?
I need to make money.

410
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,500
I need money to care for you.

411
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,125
Why? Because I don't have money. I don't…

412
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,125
I don't have money
because you took out a loan on the house.

413
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,125
I'm worn out
from working night shifts every day.

414
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,291
And you just look for aliens
or work on your bike.

415
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,791
Aliens don't exist!

416
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:18,916
It's broken.

417
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,291
This is broken.

418
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,166
It's broken.

419
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,333
They can't find me now.

420
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,000
Dad, I'm sorry.

421
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,041
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's broken.

423
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,791
We'll fix it.

424
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,125
I can't remember.

425
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,875
I can't remember.

426
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:00,875
It's okay.

427
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,083
It's okay if you can't remember.

428
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,041
I can't remember.

429
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,583
We'll fix it.

430
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,291
Let's fix it.

431
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,750
Dad, wait here. I'll be right back.

432
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,500
Excuse me.

433
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:31,083
Doctor, about the Barthel Index…

434
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,416
Don't worry about that.

435
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,208
You're qualified
to hire a foreign caregiver.

436
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,291
- Thanks.
- But you might have to wait.

437
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,000
Because there's a long wait list.

438
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,083
It's an aging population
and everyone's busy with work.

439
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,291
Yeah, the aging population
is a serious issue now.

440
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,500
Well…

441
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,583
That new drug you mentioned before,

442
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,833
if I get enough money for it--

443
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:55,875
Given Mr. Cheng's current condition,
that drug might not be very helpful.

444
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,750
It's now past
the critical period for treatment.

445
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:05,333
We should probably consider
how to give Mr. Cheng better care

446
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,083
in his daily life.

447
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,666
Are you Mr. Cheng's main caregiver now?

448
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,333
Yes.

449
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,958
I saw some wounds on his legs.

450
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,708
He might have scratched it
because his skin was dry.

451
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:21,166
We need to get him
to walk around as much as possible.

452
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,958
If he sits for too long,
he might get bedsores.

453
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,041
<i>Even his limbs might atrophy.</i>

454
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,375
<i>Over time, some organs might deteriorate.</i>

455
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:32,416
<i>By then, he could have difficulty</i>
<i>swallowing even his own saliva.</i>

456
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,250
<i>There are many cases</i>

457
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,666
<i>where the elderly</i>
<i>choke on water and pass away.</i>

458
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,166
<i>Hello. Please do not smoke, eat, drink,</i>

459
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,291
<i>chew gum or betel nut in the Taipei Metro.</i>

460
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,250
<i>Please do not smoke,</i>
<i>eat, drink, or chew gum</i>

461
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,791
<i>or betel nut in the Taipei Metro.</i>

462
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:41,250
<i>Hello. Please do not smoke, eat, drink or…</i>

463
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,208
Thank you.

464
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,416
<i>…in the Taipei Metro.</i>

465
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,708
<i>Hello. Please do not smoke, eat, drink,</i>

466
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,833
<i>chew gum or betel nut in the Taipei Metro.</i>

467
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,458
Align it to the corner like this
and stick it on.

468
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,958
- See? Now it won't hurt.
- Ken, push it over.

469
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:15,875
Okay.

470
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,916
Lin Chia-yun,
don't you want to have a third child?

471
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,125
- Good.
- Why did you bring this here?

472
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,166
Why do you keep jinxing me?

473
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,833
Le-le wanted to buy stuff for the elderly.

474
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,291
I looked,
and they're similar to what my sons used.

475
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,750
Put it up there. See?

476
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,166
- Then… Right.
- Okay.

477
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,291
- Clip it to the top. Up there.
- Careful.

478
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,541
- That's so high up.
- Over there.

479
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,625
- Here?
- Yes.

480
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,833
- Be careful.
- I got you.

481
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,291
- Like this?
- Open it like this.

482
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,500
If you have presbyopia, enlarge it,
and it will look clearer. See?

483
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
- It's so long.
- It's hot in here.

484
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,041
Where does this go?

485
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,125
Do you have a screwdriver?

486
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,500
- I'll test it out.
- Yes.

487
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,625
- It must be here.
- I'll find it. Keep going.

488
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,666
- Good.
- Does this…

489
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,166
Okay.

490
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,083
Don't step on it.

491
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,541
I didn't step on it.

492
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,333
- Can you get…
- All done here.

493
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,708
- Sit here.
- Can you get some drinks? It's hot.

494
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,958
I'll go chat with Mr. Cheng.

495
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,375
- My dad is asleep.
- Mr. Cheng!

496
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,750
- Don't bother him.
- He's asleep. Don't wake him up.

497
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,250
They are all mean to me.

498
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,166
- He's sleeping. Please?
- You took it off.

499
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,791
Dad.

500
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,875
It's 2:00 a.m.

501
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,375
I'm making you some milk.

502
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,666
You always have milk
when you're hungry at night.

503
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,916
Remember to rinse your mouth later.

504
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,458
I'll take you to school tomorrow morning.

505
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,833
Dad, come on.

506
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,750
Come.

507
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:52,750
It's okay.

508
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,041
Come.

509
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,666
Be careful.

510
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,375
- I want to sit down.
- Here. Okay.

511
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,291
Is this okay?

512
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,875
- I can't move much.
- Okay.

513
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,791
- Can I sit here?
- Dad, you…

514
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,791
Watch it.

515
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,416
Dad, you have to take off your pants.
I'll wash them later.

516
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,250
- Go and get me a towel.
- You have to…

517
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,791
Okay, wait here.

518
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,333
Just take it all off, then.

519
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,250
- I'll clean that up.
- Okay.

520
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:25,958
Be careful.

521
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,708
Let us through.

522
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,791
Excuse me.

523
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,666
- It's tiring to go downstairs.
- Thanks.

524
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,833
Jeez.

525
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,875
How do you make it here without me?

526
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,958
We don't get any sun when you're not here.

527
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,416
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

528
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,791
- Here, I'll do it.
- Okay.

529
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,791
Dad, are you hungry?

530
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,875
Do you want some food?

531
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,916
Or do you want water?

532
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,791
No?

533
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,041
Here.

534
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,583
I got you some information
on nursing homes.

535
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:18,500
Okay.

536
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,541
This is for you.

537
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,333
I've highlighted
the ones that are affordable.

538
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:26,083
I regretted it
after talking to you that day.

539
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,125
You don't need to decide now.

540
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:31,833
If possible,
check out the homes with your dad.

541
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,875
He should have a say in this too.

542
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,083
Despite it all,
I still find this so cruel.

543
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,166
Cruel?

544
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,208
How is it cruel?

545
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,458
At least these nursing homes
have professional caregivers.

546
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,791
You got hurt taking care of him.

547
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,000
You've done your best.

548
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,666
I haven't.

549
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,500
I know I haven't.

550
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,500
Think about it. When my mom abandoned us,

551
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,458
my dad, this big man, he…

552
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,250
Now I have a little setback,
and I want to send him to a nursing home.

553
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,416
You know,
I shouldn't even have such thoughts.

554
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,166
Ma'am, would you like some milk?

555
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,458
Wait a second.

556
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,375
Why does it seem so easy for others?

557
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,083
Just like I said.

558
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:31,875
They are professionals.

559
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:36,208
You should really find a higher-paying job

560
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,750
and send your dad to a nursing home.

561
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,333
These facilities are good.

562
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,125
It's so sunny today.

563
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,291
Dad, why don't we go home now?

564
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,625
Let's go.

565
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,583
Can you please not send me away?

566
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,750
Please don't send me away.

567
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,250
Can you please not send me away?

568
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,041
I can really look after myself.

569
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,083
But please don't send me
to the neighbor's again. Is that okay?

570
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,666
<i>Okay.</i>

571
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,500
Pinky swear.

572
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,375
Get a bit closer.

573
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,291
<i>Number 55,</i>
<i>please come to counter 16. Thank you.</i>

574
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,208
<i>How may I help you?</i>

575
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,666
Divorce.

576
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,000
I'll need your household registry,
ID cards, and name chops.

577
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
CHANG KAI

578
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:24,166
CHENG LE-LE

579
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,458
Just a moment.

580
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,625
What time is your flight?

581
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,458
7:50 p.m.

582
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,791
Congratulations, you're single.

583
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,416
Yeah.

584
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,416
A dream life.

585
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,833
All right, well…

586
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,708
Safe flight tonight.

587
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,791
Take care.

588
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,041
Bye, eligible bachelor.

589
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,041
Dad, we're now going to get into bed.

590
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,041
Hold on to me.

591
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:12,958
Hold on tight.

592
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,666
One, two, three. Here, Dad.

593
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,250
Yes, okay.

594
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,833
Okay.

595
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,458
REAL ESTATE AGENT

596
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,041
Here.

597
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,708
What are you looking at?

598
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,541
Stop checking. You look handsome.

599
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,458
Dad, do you remember?

600
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:21,500
You used to host
those watermelon seed spitting contests.

601
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,708
Remember?

602
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,250
Here, look. Like this.

603
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,333
Let me show you.

604
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:28,583
Watch me spit it.

605
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,708
Remember?

606
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,083
You always won.

607
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:37,916
Okay, I did win once.

608
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,833
But I knew you lost on purpose.

609
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,708
I'll give you a piece, okay?

610
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,000
Here.

611
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,333
Take a bite.

612
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:48,833
Come on.

613
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,541
You always won.

614
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,541
And when you won, you did this dance.

615
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,166
Remember?

616
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,375
We always danced when it rained.

617
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,375
Do you remember dancing in the rain?

618
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,291
Remember?

619
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:08,541
Come on. Hurry up.

620
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,541
Give it a go.

621
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,791
I know you can win this. Here.

622
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:20,416
Okay, that's fine.

623
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,666
It's okay if you can't remember.

624
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:30,458
It's okay.

625
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,000
I ASKED YANI TO ADD YOU
YOU CAN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER

626
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,291
Hey, what are you doing?

627
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,958
What's up? I don't know…

628
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:52,583
You look dashing.

629
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,083
Why are you so handsome?

630
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:07,583
Cheng Kuang-chi.

631
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,541
So dashing.

632
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:11,875
<i>I'll take a photo.</i>

633
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,750
From the reflection.

634
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,250
You're feeling great today?

635
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:50,125
Hello, sir. I am Yani.

636
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:53,166
Dad, this is Chia-yun's friend, Yani.

637
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,333
She'll look after you for two days.
She's very experienced and really nice.

638
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,375
So don't worry, okay?

639
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:03,625
He's a bit shy, but when he knows you,
he cracks lots of jokes.

640
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,916
No problem, madam.
I'll take good care of him.

641
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,125
I'll be home around 8:00 p.m.

642
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:10,166
- It's a bit late. Sorry about that.
- Okay.

643
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,416
No worries, madam. I'll take care of him.

644
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,333
- Don't worry. Bye.
- Thank you. Okay.

645
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,833
- Bye, madam. Bye.
- Thank you.

646
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,083
Sir, I am Yani.

647
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,458
I'm here to look after you.

648
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:22,708
Don't be afraid.

649
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,000
Sir, what food would you like?

650
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:29,166
I was a tour guide,

651
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,875
so I think I'm good
at handling unexpected incidents.

652
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,208
- So you are experienced.
- Yes.

653
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:39,166
- And also good at handling crises.
- That's right.

654
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,333
Great. You're exactly what we need.

655
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,416
Yes.

656
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,458
So why at this age…

657
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,583
Sorry, I mean…

658
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:57,583
Sir, I've looked after many people,

659
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:00,375
so I understand how you feel.

660
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:04,041
I'll take good care of you.

661
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,125
I haven't seen my own dad for a long time.

662
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,583
Isn't that funny?

663
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,375
I don't take care of my dad,

664
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,833
but I keep
taking care of other people's dads.

665
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,541
How about I play some music for you?

666
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,541
Sir, do you want some water?

667
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,250
I'll get you some, okay?

668
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,708
Hello, Yani? I'm sorry, I was sleeping
and missed my stop. What's wrong?

669
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,916
Madam, your dad
locked me out when I took the trash out.

670
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,541
<i>- I can't get in now.</i>
- What?

671
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,125
It's okay.

672
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,375
Is he okay?

673
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,125
<i>I don't know.</i>

674
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,041
Okay, listen. I'll be home soon.

675
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,375
Stay by the door and don't go anywhere.

676
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,791
I'll be right back.

677
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:15,750
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

678
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,583
- Madam, you're home.
- Sorry.

679
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,458
- Hurry.
- Okay.

680
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,916
Cheng Kuang-chi!

681
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,166
She hit me!

682
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,166
I didn't.

683
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,750
- I didn't hit him.
- She really did.

684
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,625
- I know.
- I've been looking after him.

685
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,083
- I didn't hit him.
- I know.

686
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,708
I'm so sorry.

687
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:51,125
I think your dad
doesn't like having me here.

688
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,166
No, he's just not used to it.

689
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,583
You know, he has good and bad days.

690
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:58,208
- I really didn't hit him.
- Sorry. I know you didn't.

691
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,791
Why don't you go home and rest?

692
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,041
Sorry I kept you waiting.

693
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,375
It's way over time now.

694
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,833
- Okay, I'll go now.
- Sorry.

695
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,041
- Thank you.
- I'm off.

696
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,166
Yani, I'm sorry.

697
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,250
Can you give my dad another chance?

698
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,708
I'll think about it, okay?

699
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:11,375
- Yani, I'm so sorry.
- Sorry, madam.

700
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,416
I'll go now.

701
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,583
Okay, please do think about it. Please.

702
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:19,708
She hit me.

703
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,208
Okay, let's get you to sit up.

704
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,000
One, two, three.

705
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,916
Are you hurt?

706
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,166
Slippers.

707
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:24,333
I'm Cheng Kuang-chi.

708
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,333
My daughter is Cheng Le-le.

709
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,166
Do you remember

710
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,875
your daughter loves you?

711
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,000
Do you know your daughter loves you a lot?

712
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,041
Yes.

713
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:10,500
I do.

714
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:20,083
It's okay if you don't remember anything.

715
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,750
Just remember
your daughter loves you very much.

716
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:26,875
I…

717
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:28,625
I know that.

718
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,916
I know.

719
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,375
But you're such a bad boy.

720
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,541
I'm mad at you.

721
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,291
<i>Mr. Cheng Kuang-chi.</i>

722
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,666
You look handsome today. Good boy.

723
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,833
Ten out of ten.

724
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:55,333
Look, you have a great daughter.
She's always by your side.

725
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,875
I'll prescribe
a month's repeat prescription.

726
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:00,583
We'll check again when he's more stable.

727
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:02,208
Okay. Thank you.

728
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,041
Thank you.

729
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,833
Whoa…

730
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,500
Dad, it's raining. Give me a minute.

731
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,875
I remember I brought an umbrella.

732
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,916
It's hard to grasp.

733
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,250
Dad!

734
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,750
Dad, what are you doing?

735
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:56,625
It's raining! You…

736
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,291
<i>Since the rain won't stop anytime soon,</i>

737
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,875
<i>I'll stay by your side,</i>

738
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,333
<i>just like you did for me.</i>

739
