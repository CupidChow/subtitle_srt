1
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,250
<i>Everyone calls their dad Superman,</i>

2
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>but I call mine an alien.</i>

3
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,208
<i>He always says the universe is infinite,</i>

4
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>and humans are insignificant.</i>

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,708
<i>We should take it easy in life.</i>

6
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,291
<i>However,</i>

7
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>he forgot to tell me</i>

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>humans exist in the world</i>

9
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,375
<i>and humans are complicated.</i>

10
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,125
Cheng Le-le.

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,250
Why wasn't your mom at the mom's meeting?

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,000
My mom went abroad,
but my dad said he'd come.

13
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,291
But he isn't here.

14
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,708
You think it's dad's group?

15
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,041
Not your business.

16
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,875
Your mom went abroad to ditch you.

17
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,500
Has your mom ever hit you?

18
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,750
Why?

19
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,708
My mom and dad never hit me.

20
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,416
'Cause they don't want you.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,708
My mom hits me because she loves me.

22
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,791
I love you so much!

23
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,583
Cheng Le-le, why'd you hit me?

24
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,541
Yeah, why'd you hit her?

25
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,291
- I'm telling my mom!
- I'm telling the teacher!

26
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,125
Le-le!

27
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,625
Le-le! So Le-le's not here.

28
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,041
Oh no.

29
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,041
That's too bad.

30
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,083
I went a long way
to get a bike in this color for her.

31
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,750
Who is it?

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,458
Le-le.

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey, look at this headlight.

34
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,458
I got it from Thailand and installed it.

35
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,333
I heard there was some hitting
at school today.

36
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,000
No, it was like this…

37
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,000
Like this? Where'd she hit you?

38
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,541
- Were you hurt?
- No, but she deserved it.

39
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,583
Great timing.

40
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,375
I got a call
the second I got off the boat.

41
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,291
Did you forget
you were supposed to be here today?

42
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,875
Be here for what?

43
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,541
Never mind.

44
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,166
Have you been listening to Mrs. Liu?

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,833
She told me you're barely eating
and sneaking back home at night, right?

46
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,125
Can you please not send me away?

47
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm not sending you away.

48
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,583
I'm just worried
no one's looking after you.

49
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,208
I can really look after myself.

50
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:58,250
But please don't send me
to the neighbor's again. Is that okay?

51
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,875
Pinky swear.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,833
I AM MY OWN WORST ENEMY

53
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,666
FIVE YEARS AGO

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,625
Ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,875
our God of Wealth temple tour
is now at Taipei Guandu Temple.

56
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
When we enter God of Wealth's temple,

57
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,000
imagine entering a bank.

58
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,125
You wouldn't go in just to look.

59
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,625
Don't leave a treasure mountain
empty-handed.

60
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,708
Whether it's for wealth,

61
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,041
to fill your fortune,

62
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,416
or for your descendants to do well,

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,250
success all the way.

64
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,083
- How does that sound?
- Good!

65
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,833
All right.

66
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
- Tour guide.
- Yes?

67
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
Are you married?

68
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,791
Oh, not yet.

69
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll pray to the matchmaking god.

70
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,791
- Okay?
- Great!

71
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,041
The restrooms are over there…

72
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,916
GUANDU TEMPLE

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,166
Wait for me at the entrance…

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,541
DAD: HAVE YOU EATEN?
ARE YOU BACK IN TAIPEI?

75
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,208
Be safe, those who pray shall be blessed.

76
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,958
Miss, where's the restroom?

77
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,041
It's over there. I just told you.

78
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,208
Miss, is the toilet clean?

79
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,125
Yes, it's very clean.

80
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,625
- Sorry.
- No worries.

81
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,375
DAD: WHEN WILL YOU BE HOME?
HOW ABOUT WE CATCH A MOVIE?

82
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,958
I BOUGHT A BIG WATERMELON

83
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,958
Miss, are there seated toilets?

84
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,708
- Yes, there are.
- I have bad knees.

85
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,166
Are they big or small? Take me there.

86
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,500
Sure, come with me.

87
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,583
- Sorry.
- No worries. Let's go.

88
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,958
THREE SISTERS, COMEDY QUEEN OF THE DAY

89
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,541
Any idea why she's late today?

90
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,166
Pregnant women can be slow.

91
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,916
She was slow before the pregnancy.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,208
What's the rush?

93
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,500
It's better than being busy
doing who knows what.

94
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,000
Is that directed at me?

95
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
Speak up if you're upset.

96
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,833
Who on earth
enjoys taking elders to the temple?

97
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,625
If God of Wealth temples work,
I'd be rich.

98
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,708
Don't underestimate the elderly.

99
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,500
If you treat them well, they'll fly you…

100
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,583
In first class.

101
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,291
Give me a hand.

102
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,416
Sorry, my bad.

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,291
The MRT is going so slow.

104
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,708
One for you, and one for Le-le.

105
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,541
How dare you call the MRT slow.

106
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go elsewhere
for the Period Club, okay?

107
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,208
Why?

108
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,291
Here's the food.

109
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,416
- Here.
- Because…

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,458
Because kids aren't allowed here.

111
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,958
Focus on yourself first.

112
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,833
Postpartum care, facials, spas.

113
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,000
It was all about your man.

114
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,166
Now it's all about your unborn baby.

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,166
Who's selfish like you?

116
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,333
I'm contributing a lot to this world
by taking care of myself, okay?

117
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,500
Best to be healthy when you're old.

118
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,416
Who was it

119
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,333
that wanted to marry into a rich family?

120
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,458
Don't say that.

121
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,125
Who was it
that wanted to lead tours in the US?

122
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,583
- Okay.
- You two are really noisy.

123
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,166
Who gets to realize
their childhood dreams?

124
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,291
I wanted to be a DINK.

125
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,250
- And you?
- Maybe Sailor Moon?

126
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,333
Forget I asked.

127
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:22,375
- You wanted to go to the US to look for--
- Look for your mom.

128
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,208
This conversation's over.

129
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,958
- You didn't order salted pork.
- Stop ordering.

130
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,041
We want you to gain wisdom, not gain…

131
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,000
What does food have to do with that?

132
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,416
Is this a five-star hotel?
It's 5,000 NT dollars a night.

133
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,583
That's my name.

134
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,708
Yes, you've got a room.

135
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,666
Yes, because they had
more guests yesterday.

136
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,875
Do we have rooms?

137
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,250
Is this our problem?

138
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,833
No, give me the card key.

139
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,541
We want to go shopping.

140
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,083
May I buy you some coffee? Please wait.

141
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,125
No, I'm not angry.

142
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,125
I'm not angry.
I've been waiting for too long.

143
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
And let me remind you,

144
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,375
isn't our time valuable?

145
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,208
We still want to go shopping.

146
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,250
Who'll make up for this wasted time?

147
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,375
I will.

148
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,666
I'll give you a massage. Please wait.

149
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,208
Why does she get one? I feel sore too.

150
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,875
Sir, weren't you just sticking up for me?

151
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,541
Come on, I'm tired too, okay?

152
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,208
How are you tired?

153
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,208
Right here.

154
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,750
Come on.

155
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,833
Right here.

156
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,125
You're joking.

157
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,000
Sir, that's inappropriate.

158
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,708
We're in a hotel, not an escort bar.

159
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,250
No, he's joking. It's okay.

160
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,916
Hey, hold on.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,041
Are you scolding your customers?

162
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,333
- No.
- I'm not.

163
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,333
- No, I--
- Miss.

164
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,750
- What's your problem?
- I have no problem.

165
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,583
- Aren't you our tour guide?
- We're handling things.

166
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,166
You can't do this.

167
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,416
Listen, I've had enough of you.

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,208
You've been giving us attitude.

169
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,166
We paid you to be our tour guide.

170
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,333
I have the right to demand
the best service from you!

171
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,208
No…

172
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,541
- The tour guide hit someone!
- The tour guide hit someone!

173
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,458
Oh, are you okay?

174
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,250
My knees hurt!

175
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,750
How are your knees?

176
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,125
No…

177
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,333
Don't touch her!

178
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,458
Why'd you hit her?

179
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,875
Don't touch me!

180
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,791
Don't touch her!

181
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,291
I can't get up!

182
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,750
FIVE-STAR PRICING, ONE-STAR SERVICE

183
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,208
"High-end tour guide hit a customer."

184
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,291
Is it hard to appease the clients?

185
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,750
It's all over the news.

186
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,166
You want more publicity?

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,125
You brought her in.

188
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,625
What do you want me to do?

189
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,916
- She--
- She what?

190
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,125
- I--
- You what?

191
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,500
If you wanna keep your job,

192
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,250
get out.

193
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,166
What were you doing?

194
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,875
No, sir. That day, the elderly lady--

195
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,666
If customers beat you, just let them.
So what?

196
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
She was a difficult customer--

197
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,875
So what? Did she hit you?

198
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,458
She didn't.

199
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,666
Did you touch her?

200
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,666
I just pushed her hand away.

201
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Pushed it away? You did hit her!

202
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,208
You can't mess with customers.

203
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,250
We can only respect them. Get it?

204
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,625
They're like gods!

205
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,083
Who do you think you are?

206
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,625
Leave. Just go.

207
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,750
What?

208
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,833
Get out.

209
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,000
Pack up your stuff.

210
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,166
You're fired.

211
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:48,875
Le-le.

212
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,375
Cheng Le-le!

213
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,208
Exactly. That's it.

214
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,916
With that kind of spirit,
you won't get Monday blues.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Monday's open mic session
is open to everyone.

216
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,833
Amateur performers
are welcome on stage to give it a go.

217
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,333
Anyone here for the first time?

218
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,916
Anyone? Any first-timers?

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,625
So many. All first-timers?

220
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,250
Got nothing better to do?

221
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,708
Hello and welcome.

222
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,750
It's Monday, so I know how you feel.

223
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,541
Work days, right? Monday Blue.

224
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,750
Okay, so let's hope our performer

225
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,250
can give us a boost of energy
and get the ball rolling.

226
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,083
Because this performer
is also the only guy

227
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,125
who can easily roll a ball,
judging from his figure.

228
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,875
Let's welcome C2!

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,791
Hi, everyone. I'm C2.

230
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,958
I was waiting for the bus yesterday
to go home.

231
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,208
Apart from me,
a couple was also at the bus stop.

232
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,708
Right then, across the street,

233
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,333
a gangster-looking guy yelled at us…

234
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,416
DAD

235
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,375
"Hey, you!"

236
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,458
"Yes, you!"

237
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,416
Whoa, I was terrified.

238
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,250
I looked down,
pretending I didn't hear it.

239
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,250
Then he yelled, "Hey, you!"

240
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,791
"Yes, you, fatty!"

241
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,041
I turned to look at that couple.

242
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,791
Because I needed to know
whose BMI was lower.

243
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,458
What's your BMI?

244
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,250
Isn't this rude?

245
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,166
Fifty-eight. A round of applause.

246
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,625
Fifty-eight? Who else weighs that much?

247
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,458
Hello, Mom.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,875
Yes.

249
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,958
It'll be announced today.

250
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,250
I'm quite confident.

251
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,375
Don't worry. I'll let you know.

252
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,333
It's 2:00 a.m. there. Get some rest.

253
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,166
Okay, good night.

254
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,333
CHANG KAI, I SAW THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
SORRY YOU WEREN'T MADE PARTNER.

255
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,000
I KNOW YOU WERE HOPING FOR THIS.
KEEP GOING.

256
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,416
"My face is handsome," please?

257
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,125
- Come on…
- I said no!

258
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,333
Thanks. I'm Big Tooth. Thank you.

259
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,333
Thanks, Big Tooth,

260
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,041
for the self-deprecating performance.

261
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,541
We're out of performers.

262
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,791
Any volunteers?

263
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,958
You volunteered! Hey, you volunteered.

264
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,916
- You.
- Me?

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,833
That's right.

266
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,083
- Didn't you raise your hand?
- No…

267
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,250
Her hand went up, right? I saw it.

268
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,541
I'm going to the restroom.

269
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,500
The restroom? It's this way.

270
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,958
But hold on.

271
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,208
Come on stage.

272
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,375
- I…
- Come on!

273
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,958
I can't do stand-up comedy.

274
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,250
You can't do stand-up comedy?

275
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,750
It's okay. Anyone can come on stage.
You can talk about yourself.

276
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,083
What's your name?

277
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,750
I'm Cheng Le-le.

278
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,125
Cheng Le-le!

279
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,333
- You're using your real name?
- Yes.

280
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,708
You're pretty drunk.

281
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,208
Just gave away your personal info.

282
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,375
Why'd you do that?

283
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,791
- Sorry.
- What do you do?

284
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,333
I just got fired.

285
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,458
You got fired?

286
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,416
You can tell us why you got fired.

287
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,375
Listen, one thing
stand-up audiences love to see

288
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,041
is people struggling, you know?

289
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,166
They hate if you're doing well.
Come on up.

290
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,458
FUNNY CLUB TALK SHOW
DON'T DIE LAUGHING TONIGHT

291
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,750
I…

292
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,708
Hi, everyone.

293
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,166
I'm Cheng Le-le.

294
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
Like I just said,

295
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,916
I got fired today.

296
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,583
Before I left the company, I went to HR.

297
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,166
HR told me,

298
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,833
"Seems like you didn't do your job well."

299
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,416
I said, "That's right."

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,875
"I haven't been
doing my job well for years."

301
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,416
"You just noticed it now."

302
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,583
"You didn't do your job well either."

303
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,791
I've only been fired twice
in my whole life.

304
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,291
The first time, I was fired
by my gang leader in middle school.

305
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,000
I got fired because

306
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,500
I apologized too often.

307
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,416
"Cheng Le-le,

308
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,750
why do you keep apologizing?"

309
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,166
"Oh, sorry."

310
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,500
"Sorry, I didn't mean to."

311
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,958
"You did it again!"

312
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,958
"I'm really sorry."

313
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
"No more apologizing."

314
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,750
"Now give me your thug girl attitude!"

315
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,041
Fucking hell!

316
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,208
You think I'll apologize like that?

317
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,250
Who do you think you are? Fuck you!

318
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,416
Mr. Cheng, sorry to disturb you so late.

319
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,416
We can't find Le-le, and we're worried.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,125
She'll be fine. She's a grown-up.

321
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,666
Maybe she went to look for aliens.

322
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,125
You're pregnant.
Go home and get some rest.

323
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,291
Go to bed.

324
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,208
Okay.

325
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,666
Let us know when you hear from her.

326
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,833
I will.

327
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,083
- Get some rest. Good night.
- Okay.

328
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,375
<i>The second time I got fired</i>

329
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,833
was because I wouldn't apologize.

330
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,000
I got some customer complaints

331
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,208
and even made it to the news.

332
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,041
You know, in Taiwan, we do have lots

333
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,625
of implicit difficult customers.

334
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,666
That's right.

335
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,708
"You're a tour guide.
Aren't you in the service industry?"

336
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,458
"Tour guide,

337
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,750
don't you know this hotel sucks?"

338
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,250
Excuse me. Let me ask you this.

339
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,875
Does a columbarian agent
try living in every niche?

340
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,666
"Tour guide,

341
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,333
is it cheaper
if my kid doesn't take up a bed?"

342
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,000
But your kid is 35 years old.

343
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,666
"Tour guide, this restaurant isn't good.
Can we get a refund?"

344
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,625
"Tour guide, why was
last year's tour guide prettier?"

345
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,000
What we earn isn't wages.

346
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,583
It's compensation for emotional damage.

347
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,375
It's really common for tour guides
to get harassed, you know?

348
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,041
It's as common as eating and drinking.

349
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:02,166
But when I saw my friend
getting harassed the other day, damn it,

350
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,916
I totally just snapped.

351
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,125
Then I got a complaint
saying I hit a customer.

352
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,916
Hey, no way, I…

353
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,625
How could I have hit her?

354
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,416
I'm not in a gang anymore.

355
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,333
I've turned over a new leaf.

356
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,333
Right?

357
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,000
I think…

358
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,041
what upsets me the most today is

359
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:35,916
my best friend was standing next to me
when the manager fired me.

360
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,125
She's my best friend.

361
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,166
We're so close
that our periods are in sync.

362
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,833
But as my best friend,

363
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,166
isn't she supposed to fight for me?

364
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
She couldn't do much.

365
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,916
She's not a bitch.

366
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,416
Forget it.

367
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,625
Actually, I…

368
00:18:55,708 --> 00:19:01,250
Rationally, I know
I shouldn't think like this at this age.

369
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,333
But today, I really felt like

370
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,875
I was betrayed by the whole world.

371
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,625
<i>As a corporate slave,</i>
<i>I understand the frustration, but</i>

372
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,083
<i>couldn't she have tried to keep me?</i>

373
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,458
<i>Like, for instance,</i>

374
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,125
she could've hugged me…

375
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,958
and told the manager, "Sir,

376
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,333
whenever Cheng Le-le kills a cockroach,

377
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,250
she always prays for it

378
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,541
and chants scriptures for its afterlife.
<i>Amitofo</i>.

379
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,458
How could she hit anyone?"

380
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,708
<i>Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.</i>
<i>Leave a message…</i>

381
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,625
LE-LE, WHERE ARE YOU?

382
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,208
"Gang!" That was so funny!

383
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,708
Cheng Le-le.

384
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,041
I'm Mark, this club's producer.

385
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,458
How do you do?

386
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,916
Would you like to do another stand-up?

387
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,083
Sorry.

388
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,250
You do mean it.

389
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,666
You've got potential.

390
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,583
Me?

391
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,625
I'm just a loser who got fired,
having a midlife crisis,

392
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,041
and now a bit drunk.

393
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,625
That's great.

394
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,208
Sounds like you've got tons of material.

395
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,500
People with tougher lives
make the best comics.

396
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,708
We need people with stories.

397
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,000
Especially women.

398
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Are you stalking me?

399
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,125
No, I'm not…

400
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,083
Sorry.

401
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,500
I thought I was being stalked.

402
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,958
Sorry to scare you.

403
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,375
Honestly, I was stalking you.

404
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,041
- What?
- Don't get me wrong.

405
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,291
I was in the audience.

406
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,625
I…

407
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, I…

408
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,541
I just wanted to thank you.

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,125
What for?

410
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,500
For making me feel a bit

411
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,041
happier tonight.

412
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,875
You're welcome.

413
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,250
I had a good time too.

414
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,958
It was fun. Do you perform here often?

415
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,541
No, I…

416
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,458
- It was my first time.
- What?

417
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,708
Yeah, I got pretty drunk.

418
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:46,958
I couldn't tell.

419
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,916
No, you were great. Really talented.

420
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,125
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

421
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,666
- That also cheered me up.
- Thanks.

422
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,958
I had a rough day.

423
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,916
Oh, that…

424
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,250
It's okay.

425
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,000
You're not a scammer, right?

426
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,500
I am.

427
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,125
<i>Hey, have some watermelon, kids…</i>

428
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,416
Stop playing and have some watermelon.

429
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,708
- One, two…
- Not bad!

430
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,625
- Didn't spit it.
- One more time.

431
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,125
Hey, why aren't you in bed?

432
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,208
Didn't I tell you not to wait up?

433
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,250
I'm watching a ball game.

434
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,041
Is it finished or starting?

435
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,250
I'm watching the second one.

436
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,750
Who won?

437
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,791
What are you doing?

438
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,541
Don't you always want milk
when you're hungry at night?

439
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,791
Are you crazy?

440
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,833
That was back in elementary school.

441
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:25,750
What?

442
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,333
I'm groggy from sleep.

443
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,708
DRAMA QUEEN OF THE DAY

444
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,000
I really needed some fresh air.

445
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,291
When will your husband be back?

446
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,083
Next month.

447
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,833
A week before I'm due.

448
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:48,958
That exact?

449
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,000
He needs to take leave.

450
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:55,458
I asked Le-le about the discount tickets.
I wonder if she's got them.

451
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,583
Are you being dumb?

452
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,166
Why are you saying that?

453
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,083
- We're friends. Just talk it out.
- Tell her that.

454
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,916
She always gets mad first.

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We can just talk it out.

456
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,166
It's like I forced her to be a tour guide.

457
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,208
- I've backed her up many times.
- Okay.

458
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,166
- I'm always backing her up.
- Okay.

459
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,041
Okay, don't get upset. Let's order food.

460
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,125
No, I'm on a diet.

461
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,875
I've decided to finish a plate
of salted pork myself.

462
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,250
I want two bites.

463
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,541
No, get your own. You always do this.

464
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,791
You always end up eating half of Le…

465
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,333
Momo, I'll have a <i>mentaiko onigiri</i>,
three whelk soups,

466
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,791
fried chicken and a bottle of beer.

467
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:35,916
Sure.

468
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,958
That wasn't a violent act.
It wasn't my problem…

469
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,666
Apart from sleeping in…

470
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,958
As for the salary, we could…

471
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,041
Ms. Cheng, after such an incident,

472
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,791
we really can't hire you.

473
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:59,375
Su-fei, isn't it boring to just
take photos of Chiang Mai's ancient ruins?

474
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,666
What do you suggest then?

475
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,083
I'll think about it.

476
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,250
WE ARE HIRING

477
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,250
ADOPT ME, GIVE ME A HOME

478
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,541
FUNNY CLUB TALK SHOW

479
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,000
Just like this, in the front.

480
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,500
Stock up, facing this way.

481
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,250
Confirm with the checklist

482
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,791
to see if the purchase quantity
is consistent.

483
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,666
We're short of these on this shelf.

484
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,833
…not even a little.

485
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,750
That's where I'm at right now.

486
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,583
Ask me anything.

487
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:12,833
Sure. Thanks, sir.

488
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:13,916
Move quicker.

489
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,625
DAD

490
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,333
- Hello.
<i>- You finally answered.</i>

491
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,708
<i>I was so worried.</i>

492
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,416
Listen to me.

493
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,125
Huang Su-fei has always been bossy…

494
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,916
The last thing I need
is a logical explanation.

495
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,250
- Gotta go. Back to work.
<i>- No, listen…</i>

496
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,375
<i>Don't hang up--</i>

497
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,291
Hello?

498
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,416
What the heck?

499
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,666
An Earth sign indeed.

500
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,000
"May 18th."

501
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,083
Ma'am, are you okay?

502
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,250
Do you need any help? Are you okay?

503
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, I'm fine.

504
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,958
- Do you need help? You look pale.
- Are you in labor?

505
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,541
- What?
- In labor?

506
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,625
You wanna sit?

507
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,208
Yes, but I'm due in two weeks.

508
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,000
Be careful.

509
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,458
- Easy.
- I can do this.

510
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,625
- Take it easy.
- Take deep breaths.

511
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:45,791
Don't panic.

512
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,125
I'm not panicking. Don't panic.

513
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,291
- Don't worry.
- Mom, someone peed.

514
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,750
Ma'am, is it your first child?

515
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,500
Congratulations.

516
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,416
Thank you.

517
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,916
What about your family? I can call them.

518
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,375
My husband is abroad.

519
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,666
What about other family?

520
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,875
I don't have other husbands.

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,666
Take deep breaths. Don't panic.

522
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,958
Don't push your belly.

523
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,041
Any discount? It's a joyous event.

524
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,916
Here's the wheelchair.

525
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,583
- Help her up. Be careful.
- I can do this.

526
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:15,916
Slowly…

527
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,916
Wait!

528
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,500
I have emergency contacts.

529
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,291
<i>The elevator door is closing…</i>

530
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,375
Wait!

531
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:35,958
<i>The elevator door is closing…</i>

532
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,166
Excuse me.

533
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,041
Who are you here for?

534
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,000
Lin Chia-yun.

535
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:02,916
Lin Chia…

536
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,208
Are you her family?

537
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,541
- Little sis.
- Big sis.

538
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:11,583
Listen, if we miss out
on our sister's childbirth,

539
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,250
you'll regret it.

540
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,166
Room 710.

541
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,000
Put on the isolation gowns.

542
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,833
Well done. Keep going.

543
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,166
Take deep breaths.

544
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,333
Take deep breaths.

545
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,333
Deliver elegantly.

546
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,583
Deep breaths don't work.

547
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,541
Why do I suffer for so long
so he can enjoy one second?

548
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,458
And he's not even here.

549
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,500
I forgot to wash my hair.

550
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,500
My water broke.

551
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,583
I should've washed my hair first.

552
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,458
You're worried about that now?

553
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,833
It looks painful.

554
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,125
She's in labor!

555
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,333
Tell that jerk to get his ass here!

556
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,500
Five, six…

557
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,250
Your wife will nag about it.

558
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,625
We're right here with you, okay?

559
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,541
Cancel my prenatal essential oil massage.

560
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,000
- What?
- Okay, I'm on it.

561
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,541
- Push.
- Push.

562
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,250
- Let me do this.
- Good job!

563
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,541
Why did you take so long to get here?

564
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,791
I miss you so much, you know?

565
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,166
Being in the middle of you two
while pregnant…

566
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,375
I see the head!

567
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,583
So exhausted!

568
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,750
Come on. Good job!

569
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,125
I see the head! Good!

570
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,000
The head is showing!

571
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,583
Childbirth is terrifying.

572
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,333
Yeah.

573
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,750
Can you imagine we were right there
when the baby came out?

574
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,000
Sorry.

575
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,041
But I don't feel bad.

576
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,666
I was happy for you when you got fired.

577
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,000
You didn't even like that job.

578
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,041
I know.

579
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,375
But having done it for so long,

580
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,833
I suddenly realize

581
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,625
I don't have the talent for it.

582
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,958
I'm so average.
That crushed my confidence.

583
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,958
So am I really not cut out
to be a tour guide?

584
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,458
You're not.

585
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,291
So,

586
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,125
a stand-up comedian?

587
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,125
- How do you know?
- Come on. I know your dad.

588
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:54,000
You're always so cynical.
Never thought you'd be chatty on stage.

589
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,500
'Cause you're always the chatty one,

590
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,833
I don't get to talk.

591
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,000
But I gotta admit,

592
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,041
it feels special being on stage.

593
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,500
As long as you don't hit customers,
you'll be okay.

594
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,750
Can you just be likable for one second?

595
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,791
No, thanks.

596
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,625
I already miss the days
when I didn't talk to you.

597
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,416
Girls?

598
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,041
- Coming.
- Coming.

599
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,250
Oh…

600
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,541
What does that mean?

601
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,666
- It--
- Huang Su-fei, don't piss off a mom.

602
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,875
It's fine. Go ahead.

603
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,916
I was already being nice about it.

604
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,125
Come on, he's cute.

605
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,666
Is your taste ruined
by Taipei's cityscape?

606
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,583
A quiet baby is a cute baby.

607
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,541
You're right.

608
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,416
Oh, I see.

609
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,541
What?

610
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,416
Shaw,

611
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,833
they're Mommy's best friends.

612
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:17,083
This is Auntie Su-fei,

613
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,416
and this is Auntie Le-le.

614
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,083
Ma'am, you can rest now.

615
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,708
We'll take the baby to the nursery.

616
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,500
Okay, back to the nursery.

617
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,166
- So small.
- Such a tiny one.

618
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,833
What…

619
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,958
What day is it?

620
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,500
No, I mean the date.

621
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,625
January 20th.

622
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:40,958
Are you drunk?

623
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,708
My dad's birthday.

624
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,958
Oh, boy.

625
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,791
Once people have kids,
they forget their parents' birthdays.

626
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,083
I'll remind her on my son's birthday.

627
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,666
<i>Hello?</i>

628
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,208
Dad, happy birthday.

629
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,875
Sorry, I forgot again.

630
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,458
Chia-yun went into labor.

631
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,583
Congratulations.

632
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,125
- It's all right.
- <i>Okay.</i>

633
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,583
<i>We'll celebrate later.</i>

634
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,791
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- It's really okay.

635
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,583
Congratulate her for me.

636
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,750
Okay.

637
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,333
Gotta go. Happy birthday.

638
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,625
Bye-bye.

639
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,708
Your baby's here. I gotta feed my cat now.

640
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,208
- You have a cat?
- Yeah.

641
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,500
Do you know why?

642
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,833
Cats only meow when they get mad.

643
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,333
But friends…

644
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:36,166
Why don't you feed the cat later?

645
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,958
Stay with me a bit longer.

646
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,916
Can you feed your son later?

647
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,041
Get out.

648
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,250
All right, get some rest.

649
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,791
We'll head back.

650
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,541
When is your husband coming?

651
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,875
He's on the plane. Maybe later.

652
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,833
But my mother-in-law will be here soon.

653
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,708
So it'll be two on one soon.

654
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:57,375
My husband can handle things on his own.

655
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:01,958
Right now,
Shaw is the most important man in my life.

656
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:02,875
Likewise,

657
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,875
my kitty is the most important man
in my life right now.

658
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,166
Women,

659
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,916
such mysterious creatures.

660
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,291
All right, let's go.

661
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,583
Wait, come here.

662
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,833
- What now?
- What?

663
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,125
Anyway, thank you both.

664
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,666
- Why so polite?
- What's so funny?

665
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,416
Wow. Being a mom changes things.

666
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,125
- No, I love you both.
- Don't be like that. It's weird.

667
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,750
Right?

668
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,791
Stop laughing. I just…

669
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,041
You're crying.

670
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,458
Aren't you a tough lady?

671
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,916
You're mean. Why are you laughing?

672
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,875
You're really freaking me out.

673
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,166
<i>We can't choose our parents.</i>

674
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,333
<i>But at our age,</i>

675
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,708
<i>we get to choose our friends.</i>

676
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,291
<i>Only true friends</i>

677
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,458
<i>can see right through our sorrow.</i>

678
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,791
<i>We can be who we truly are</i>

679
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,166
<i>and rely on each other.</i>

680
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>So,</i>

681
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:07,833
<i>what about love?</i>

682
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:13,916
