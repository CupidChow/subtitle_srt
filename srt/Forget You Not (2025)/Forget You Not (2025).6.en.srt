1
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,666
Dad.

2
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,166
What are you up to?

3
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:02,791
Dad.

4
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,625
What are you doing?

5
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,625
Dad.

6
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,458
What's wrong?

7
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,541
It's me, Le-le.

8
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,583
I'm fine.

9
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:51,791
DELIRIUM

10
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,208
Okay, done.

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,666
He's…

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,750
Some time ago, he'd stare at one spot

13
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,666
and mumble to himself
or stay quiet for a long time.

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,000
The other day at the store,
he couldn't recognize me.

15
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:17,916
And yesterday, he went
to my old elementary school to pick me up.

16
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:23,291
I know he has mild dementia,
but he was doing okay before.

17
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,333
I don't know why it suddenly got worse.

18
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:29,666
Has anything changed in his life lately?
Like moving or having arguments?

19
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,458
No…

20
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,041
I helped him tidy up his place.
Does that count?

21
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:40,291
The elderly often rely on
certain habits or routines in their lives.

22
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,125
We might think
we mean well by tidying up for them,

23
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,791
but it backfires
and they can't recognize anything.

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,833
I see.

25
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,708
Besides the changes in his surroundings,

26
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,291
has anything happened
that you think is significant?

27
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,916
I don't think so…

28
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,416
Oh, I…

29
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,166
My mom passed away recently,
and so did his best friend.

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,500
That's pretty significant.
Why wouldn't you see it as a change?

31
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,666
He and my mom
have been divorced for over 30 years.

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,291
And they don't live together.

33
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,083
The day he came back
from his friend's funeral…

34
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:19,083
Actually… It seemed like
he was still able to joke around.

35
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,958
Living apart and not meeting often
doesn't mean there's no bond.

36
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,333
He might not have
expressed certain emotions,

37
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,833
but he's really hurting inside.

38
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:32,333
This type of PTSD can sometimes
speed up the progression of dementia.

39
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,250
It could even result in delirium.

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,625
Excuse me, what's that?

41
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,291
Delirium is an acute brain failure.

42
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,250
So, it's not related to dementia?

43
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,333
It's similar, but people confuse the two.

44
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,583
But delirium
is more of an acute brain illness.

45
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,416
It can be controlled
through early treatment.

46
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,791
Gosh. How many
more of these old-age diseases are there?

47
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,875
Bed coming through.

48
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
Excuse me, coming through.

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,208
- Bed coming through.
- Excuse me, coming through.

50
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,375
Dad, let's go.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,625
I don't want

52
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,750
to be hooked up to all those tubes.

53
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,375
Why are you saying that?

54
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,750
Just a minute, please.

55
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,833
- Name, please?
- Cheng Kuang-chi.

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,708
Thank you.

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,708
This medicine's for calming the brain.

58
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,041
Take one before bed.

59
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,125
- This one's for the stomach.
- Okay.

60
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,541
- Thanks.
- No problem.

61
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,333
- Let go. Look closely.
- It's my bike.

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,583
- It's mine.
- I just…

63
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,458
- What's going on?
- It's mine.

64
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,291
It's mine, but he keeps saying it's his.

65
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,625
- It isn't your bike.
- It is.

66
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,625
- It's mine. Stop it!
- Sorry, he's confused.

67
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,250
- You rode your bike to Mr. Tang's funeral.
- Let go!

68
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,375
Did you ride it back?

69
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,625
Are you senile or what?

70
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,000
Did you have to be so rough?

71
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,958
- He has some issues…
- I'm in a hurry.

72
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,125
Why's that my problem?

73
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,541
- He didn't mean to.
- Was it my fault? Why yell?

74
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,666
- All right, guys.
- Can we respect each other?

75
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,458
- He's having some issues.
- "Respect?" What a joke!

76
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,416
Did you respect me?

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,750
- Stop arguing.
- Fine, sorry.

78
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,208
I'm so sorry, all right?

79
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,291
Sorry to bother you.

80
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,041
I apologize.

81
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,666
What a bunch of lunatics.

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,458
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,791
Dad.

84
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,708
Where are you going now?

85
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,500
PERIOD CLUB MEETING AT 14:00 TOMORROW

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,708
CAN WE CANCEL? I'M EXHAUSTED

87
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
REMEMBER TO TAKE THE KEY OUT

88
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,708
TURN OFF THE TV

89
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:40,708
NAME CHOP AND PASSBOOK ARE IN THE DRAWER

90
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,458
CHANGE SHOES AND TAKE THE KEY OUT

91
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,083
LE-LE AND HER HUSBAND, CHANG KAI
OUR FAMILY

92
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,750
LE-LE TURNED ONE

93
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,250
FIRST TIME SEEING CHERRY BLOSSOMS

94
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,875
MY DAUGHTER AT TEN YEARS OLD

95
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:06,000
TANG AND I
TANG IS GONE

96
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,791
I'm Cheng Kuang-chi.

97
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,458
I can take care of myself.

98
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,250
I'M CHENG KUANG-CHI
MY DAUGHTER CHENG LE-LE

99
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,833
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF

100
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,458
I told you to use a wheelchair.
Why do you have to act tough?

101
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,791
No wheelchair.

102
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,708
Why? This is dangerous…

103
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,416
Hey, look!

104
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,375
See?

105
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,708
- Cheng Kuang-chi, sit down.
- Help me.

106
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,250
Fine…

107
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,333
I'll sit down.

108
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,583
Sit. You're too old for this.

109
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,125
You just hurt your foot.

110
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,458
- Lower your voice.
- Why don't you listen?

111
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,500
- Okay. Sit down.
- It's a hospital…

112
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,791
Lift your legs up.

113
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,000
Lift it up. Be careful.

114
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,250
I had to give it a try.

115
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,125
- Put these on the foot pedals.
- Okay.

116
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,333
Keep it steady.

117
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,791
Sure, no problem.

118
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,500
Your seatbelt came off.
Let me buckle you up.

119
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,291
Come on, sit still.

120
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,666
Why are you holding your shoe?

121
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,666
Here, I'll put it on.

122
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,583
Okay, sit still.

123
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,291
All right.

124
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,166
CHANG KAI:
YOU AWAKE?

125
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,083
LE-LE:
YES

126
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,000
CHANG KAI:
IS YOUR DAD OKAY?

127
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:06,625
LE-LE: OKAY MY ASS!
HE'S PRETTY TRENDY THOUGH

128
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:13,666
HE HAS DELIRIUM NOW.
IS HE TRYING TO WEAR ME OUT?

129
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,250
LE-LE:
HE'S OKAY. HOW ARE YOU?

130
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,833
CHANG KAI: THIS MIGHT SEEM ABRUPT
BUT AFTER LUNAR NEW YEAR

131
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:48,416
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
MOVING TO SINGAPORE WITH ME?

132
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,416
Watch out, there's a ramp.

133
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,458
- Okay, good. Steady.
- Hold on tight.

134
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,625
Yes…

135
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,416
- Hello.
- Is your foot okay now?

136
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,083
- Much better.
- Really?

137
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,458
Yeah, thank you.

138
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,875
The worst part of divorce
is changing your emergency contact

139
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,125
from your husband to your parents.

140
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:36,375
Actually, my dad
was recently diagnosed with dementia.

141
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,708
He's not the best person
to handle any emergencies now.

142
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,416
If one day something happens to me
and I end up in the hospital,

143
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
"Mr. Cheng,
your daughter's in the hospital."

144
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,791
"Please get here now."

145
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,625
And my dad would say,

146
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,916
"You have the wrong person.
Who's Mr. Cheng?" Then he hangs up.

147
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,583
Then I'd go, "Dad, wait!"

148
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,916
"Answer the phone! My life's at stake!"

149
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,250
- Where's Mark?
- He left. He seemed pissed off.

150
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,458
Hey, that breakup sex bit was dope.
I loved it.

151
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,583
Awesome.

152
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,916
- I gotta take this.
- Sure, go ahead.

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,375
- Hello?
<i>- Where's my underwear?</i>

154
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,875
- In the dresser.
- I can't find it.

155
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,041
In the dresser in the bathroom.

156
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,791
I told you not to move my stuff, didn't I?

157
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,625
<i>My stuff is where it should be.</i>

158
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,291
<i>Yeah? You said</i>
<i>you'd be an obedient daughter.</i>

159
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,625
<i>You gotta be obedient.</i>

160
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,916
Obey me, not yourself.

161
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,625
Don't wear it today.

162
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,833
No way.

163
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,750
<i>Or wear the old one inside out.</i>

164
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
<i>What time do you finish work?</i>

165
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,791
It's fine if you don't wear it for a day.

166
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,500
It'll feel airy without it.

167
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,750
Hey, don't you have to work?
You've got so much free time.

168
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,666
Hey, is your foot okay now?

169
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,708
Yeah, my foot's fine.

170
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,833
Time to get rid of the crutches.

171
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,875
It's only a little better.

172
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,125
Don't just wander off.

173
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,541
Yeah.

174
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,166
What?

175
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,166
Are you my mom or am I your dad?

176
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,333
Looks like you're fully recovered.

177
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,833
Yeah.

178
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,166
Hey.

179
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,583
This blazer looks nice, right?

180
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,583
I bought it at Sincere.

181
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,583
Sincere closed down years ago.

182
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,125
No, I got this at Sincere.

183
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,125
Dad, where are you going?
I'll go with you.

184
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,541
No, it's okay.

185
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,208
I'm going to the corner store
to borrow… I…

186
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,625
It looks good, right?

187
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,333
It looks good.

188
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
I bought it at Sincere.

189
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,333
Dad, what's for New Year's Eve dinner
this year?

190
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,000
- It's New Year again?
- Yep.

191
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,458
Oh, right.

192
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,416
I was going to the corner store to buy
red paper for writing Spring Couplets.

193
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,500
No Spring Couplets this year.

194
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,458
No way, we have to write them
for the New Year.

195
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,958
Just like how it won't be the New Year
without New Year's Eve dinner.

196
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,625
All right.

197
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,333
Here, hold on.

198
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,708
- Taking pills again?
- Yes.

199
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,041
- So many?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,708
Take them now, or there'll be more.
Here, come on.

201
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,875
Here.

202
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,333
That's a good boy.

203
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,666
Hey, it looks good, right?

204
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,125
You bought it at Sincere.

205
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,208
<i>It's called acute delirium,</i>
<i>also known as the elderly's silent killer.</i>

206
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>Its onset increases the risk of dementia</i>
<i>and disability, and even death.</i>

207
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,666
<i>It's a sudden brain confusion,</i>
<i>so it comes on quickly.</i>

208
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,791
<i>The condition fluctuates a lot.</i>

209
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,541
<i>Sometimes good,</i>
<i>sometimes bad, going back and forth.</i>

210
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,166
<i>That's why close observation,</i>
<i>companionship, and care are important…</i>

211
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,791
<i>Hey, Le-le.</i>

212
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,791
<i>Why don't you come home</i>
<i>for New Year's Eve dinner?</i>

213
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,958
I've told you.
I'm working the night shift.

214
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,166
Oh boy, who works during the New Year's?

215
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,083
They pay me double for the night shift.

216
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm on my own after the separation.

217
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,041
<i>All right, that's it for now.</i>

218
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>I have to head out now.</i>

219
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,875
Hey, Le-le.

220
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,916
Tell me,

221
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,916
what's your wish for the New Year?

222
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,041
Happiness.

223
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,958
- Oh.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

224
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,750
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Okay, bye-bye.

225
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,833
Wishing you good wealth!

226
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,958
Those in the front,
please come to the center.

227
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,541
- Pray to the Goddess Mazu for blessings.
- Everyone gets one.

228
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,625
Wishing you good wealth!

229
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
- Wishing you good wealth!
- Stop pushing.

230
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,666
Wishing you good wealth!

231
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,791
Why can't I just sleep in

232
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,958
on the first day of the New Year?

233
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,291
Happy New Year.

234
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,375
Go back to sleep.

235
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,750
<i>Don't forget…</i>

236
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,666
HAPPINESS

237
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,583
<i>…stick the "fortune" upside down,</i>

238
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,333
<i>and fortune will arrive.</i>

239
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,791
<i>Stick the "happiness" upside down too,</i>
<i>and happiness will arrive.</i>

240
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
Come get your pork!

241
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,250
Good deals here!

242
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,291
Get your ribs!

243
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,666
Come buy some meat!

244
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,083
Come get your meat and ribs!

245
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,333
Ma'am.

246
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,791
- What can I get for you?
- I want some pork belly.

247
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,791
Will you braise it or steam it?

248
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,416
I'll give you a good deal.
How much do you want? Or do you want ribs?

249
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,208
Well, it's okay. I'll come back later.

250
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,666
Okay.

251
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,750
KEEP THE DOCTOR AWAY

252
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,916
<i>The kitchen staff never stopped.</i>
<i>A thousand people were waiting for dinner.</i>

253
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,750
<i>The chef said for the New Year's dishes,</i>

254
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,750
<i>they've prepared 250 kg of lobster</i>

255
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,750
<i>and 80 kg of fish maw.</i>

256
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,708
<i>The last day of the shopping…</i>

257
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,416
Turn the Tide Beef Noodles.

258
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,333
Prosperous and Vibrant Tomato Noodles.

259
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,208
Booming Success Wine Chicken.

260
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,708
Everything Goes Well Soybean Noodles.

261
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,666
This one…

262
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,250
The original flavor.

263
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,125
Mine's omelet rice.

264
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,791
You've been cooking all afternoon.

265
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,125
This is nice. Good job.

266
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,208
I thought you didn't like instant noodles?

267
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,875
Why do you still cook it all the time?

268
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,375
This is all I can cook.

269
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,750
Okay, pick one that you like.

270
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,750
Okay.

271
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,333
Well…

272
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,916
I'll pick this one.

273
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,541
You picked the original flavor? Come on.

274
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,458
No, the original flavor is good.
It tastes great.

275
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,291
You used to add lots of stuff.

276
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,666
I wanted you to have more nutrition.

277
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,583
You've done a good job.

278
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

279
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,041
Mommy's cooking smells so good!

280
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,500
Kids, dinner's ready.

281
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,541
Get ready for dinner.

282
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,625
Put away your toys.

283
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,791
- Shaw, help Anne put the toys away.
- Put them…

284
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,125
- Why are you crying?
- Sit.

285
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,625
That's okay.

286
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,500
Anne, no.

287
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,625
- Mommy's got you.
- Mommy's here.

288
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,458
Come here, son.

289
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,708
Oh, sweetie.

290
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,375
Okay, what were we playing earlier?

291
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,583
The car slide, remember?

292
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,583
Your hands.

293
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,458
Your hands. Stay here.

294
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,125
Come on.

295
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,958
- Someone needs the elevator.
- Good.

296
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,875
Dad, Mom.

297
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,000
Happy New Year.

298
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,500
- Are you having New Year's Eve dinner?
- Spoon…

299
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,958
Let me take a picture
for Grandma and Grandpa.

300
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,000
Look at me.

301
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,958
Hey, let's go on a trip
after the New Year.

302
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,875
Why do they play the same game every year?

303
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,041
- Yeah, they don't change it up.
- Yeah.

304
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,625
But what is his name?

305
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,250
He's not bad. He's doing all right.

306
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,375
- Yeah.
- Right?

307
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,250
He's one of the funnier ones.

308
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,500
Right.

309
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,416
Happy New Year.

310
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,750
Hold on.

311
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,375
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

312
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,166
All the best for the year.

313
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,583
Be happy every day.

314
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,583
Oh, dear.

315
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Thank you.

316
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,333
This is great.

317
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,208
It's a bit light, though.

318
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,750
Don't say that, okay?

319
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,833
<i>This feels like </i>The Truman Show.

320
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,333
What's more terrifying is

321
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,375
you're in this world.

322
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,791
Nobody makes it out alive.

323
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,291
Your foot.

324
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,041
- Your foot.
- What?

325
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,041
Your foot!

326
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,125
<i>And the elderly…</i>

327
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,375
Mr. Cheng.

328
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,625
<i>…stay inside 24/7.</i>

329
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,666
Take your pills.

330
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,166
<i>Why does this sound</i>

331
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,791
so scary?

332
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,375
- Because this place really exists.
- Morning, Le-le.

333
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,916
Do you know there's a place
in the Netherlands called De Hogeweyk?

334
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,625
- It's a nursing home.
- She's…

335
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:25,500
<i>And it's for seniors with severe dementia.</i>

336
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,541
<i>This sounds cruel.</i>

337
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,916
<i>Because they have no idea</i>
<i>what's going on around them.</i>

338
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,541
<i>And they're watched and monitored</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

339
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,750
<i>They are surrounded by medical staff.</i>
<i>But they don't know that.</i>

340
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,791
<i>They are looked after and cared for daily.</i>

341
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,166
<i>It's actually a pretty good life.</i>

342
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,166
Especially…

343
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,333
When they shop…

344
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:52,875
Hello.

345
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,250
<i>Especially when they shop,</i>
<i>they don't need to pay.</i>

346
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,583
- Separate receipts?
- Yes.

347
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:59,583
Pay with cash?

348
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,416
<i>- The cashier will tell them…</i>
- Yes.

349
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,166
<i>"Hey, you don't have to pay."</i>

350
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,666
<i>"You paid last time."</i>

351
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,583
Isn't that just like <i>The Truman Show</i>?

352
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,250
NO GIG FOR YOU TOMORROW NIGHT

353
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm coming.

354
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,041
- Hi.
- Hello.

355
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,916
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.

356
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,666
How come you're home?

357
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,000
- Chia-yun?
- I'm Su-fei.

358
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,791
- Shoes off.
- I'm Su-fei.

359
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,500
- Keep your shoes on.
- Yeah?

360
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,208
- That's fine.
- You're here.

361
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,416
This is Anne.

362
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,041
- Hello.
- Anne, this is Mr. Cheng.

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,583
- For me?
- Le-le, which cup?

364
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,208
- For you.
- You're so generous.

365
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,291
Here…

366
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,500
Wait, I'll tidy up.

367
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,416
Want some?

368
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,583
Anything to drink?

369
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:15,083
- Hey, your dad is good with kids.
- Kaoliang.

370
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,500
- Did you see this giraffe?
- He's a kid too.

371
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,541
- Giraffe.
- Hey.

372
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,875
I got a coupon two days ago.

373
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,708
A duplex with a great view.

374
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,125
It has an outdoor hot spring,
and it's 40% off.

375
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,333
How about we go there for our trip?

376
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,625
Can I bring my two kids?

377
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,625
Can I bring my old man?

378
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,000
What? Bathe with them?

379
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,625
That's ridiculous.

380
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,125
It's hard to talk to
married and divorced women.

381
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,208
No wonder I only hang out
with the singles.

382
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,666
I might be able to make it
if it's a day trip.

383
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,083
I'll see if my mother-in-law
can babysit my kids.

384
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,458
Me too.

385
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,791
Yeah, like I'm twisting your arms.

386
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,916
You want that cup?

387
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,083
I book the restaurants.
You're often skipping Period Club.

388
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,958
We talked about a trip.
You can't even commit.

389
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,791
Never mind.

390
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,916
- Come on. This is for you.
- No.

391
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Are you on your period?

392
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:04,250
Watermelon.

393
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,291
No.

394
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:10,000
Sorry, we've been busy
and haven't had time to hang out.

395
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,916
Do you find us boring now?

396
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,916
How can life always be interesting?

397
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,208
Exactly.

398
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,083
You both have family stuff
to talk about. Do I?

399
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:27,291
Hey, why was the glass of water sad?

400
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,541
Because it felt empty.

401
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,541
Am I right?

402
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,500
Right? So empty.

403
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,541
Look, I have two.

404
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,208
Hey, look at that.

405
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,458
- Weren't we going to drink Kaoliang?
- Yeah, I'll open it for you.

406
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,125
Hold on.

407
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,291
I want some too.

408
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:57,083
Be careful with the bike.
Don't let it fall on you again.

409
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,208
Okay.

410
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,375
I've made all your meals
and put them in the fridge.

411
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,333
Just heat them up if you're hungry.

412
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,250
Okay.

413
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,625
Don't forget your pills.

414
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,916
I've divided them.

415
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,375
They are in the pill case.

416
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,875
And I've written down

417
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,833
your emergency contacts.

418
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,833
I've put them up on the door,
the fridge, and the bathroom.

419
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,500
I've spoken to Mrs. Liu.

420
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,958
If anything happens,

421
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,375
just contact us or her, okay?

422
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:28,500
Dad.

423
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:30,833
Dad.

424
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:33,916
You'll be back tomorrow, right?

425
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,041
Yes.

426
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,375
I'll be back tomorrow.

427
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,708
Cheng Le-le!

428
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,166
Your driver's here.

429
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,166
Remember to eat and take your pills.

430
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,375
I'll be back soon.
Emergency contact info is here.

431
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,041
Bye. I'll bring treats for you.

432
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,625
Cheng Le-le, hurry up! I've been waiting.

433
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,833
Hurry up!

434
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:03,333
- I've been waiting for so long.
- I'm coming.

435
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,000
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

436
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,833
Mr. Cheng, we're off.

437
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,416
We're off. Bye.

438
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,583
Be good and stay home. I'll be back soon.

439
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,583
I'll take care of your daughter.

440
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,125
- Isn't it pretty?
- It's so nice!

441
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,000
I told you we should come here.

442
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,416
Oh my God!

443
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,875
Gosh! This bed…

444
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,000
- Wait.
- You haven't showered.

445
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,541
Seriously?

446
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,416
What did you say to Chang Kai?

447
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,625
She hasn't replied.

448
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,166
I can't deal with that right now.

449
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,250
Yeah, I get it.

450
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,875
Yeah? You get it?

451
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,291
Well, you don't get it.

452
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,916
Right, I don't.

453
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,291
How can a happy single lady

454
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,708
understand the miseries
of married women like us?

455
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,416
I have my own problems, okay?

456
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,583
- Like what?
- Such as?

457
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,666
My collar bones don't really show.

458
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,125
Mine never did.

459
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,875
You can't compare pain.

460
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,291
Of course you can.

461
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,916
All pain comes from comparison, okay?

462
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,041
The pain of childbirth,

463
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,916
the pain of breastfeeding,

464
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,916
the pain of spending
the New Year with my mom-in-law.

465
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,625
You don't know how lucky you are.

466
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,041
Like I said, you'll never get it.

467
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,250
What time is it?
Should I video call my son soon?

468
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,166
No.

469
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,791
I should call my dad soon too.

470
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,250
No.

471
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,166
Hey, we just got here three hours ago.

472
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,583
My skin's all wrinkled.

473
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,000
It's only been five minutes.

474
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,083
Another 20 seconds then.

475
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,125
Handsome.

476
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,083
Do you miss me? Do you miss Mommy?

477
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,833
What did you eat today?

478
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,125
<i>Daddy gave me a popsicle.</i>

479
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,291
<i>It was so yummy.</i>

480
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,916
You had a popsicle?
It was so sweet and tasty, right?

481
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,666
But it's cold today.

482
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,125
Isn't your dad worried
you'll get a sore throat?

483
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,125
And what happens for seven hours
after you eat sugar?

484
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,416
You won't grow tall.

485
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,666
Shaw, excuse me.

486
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,541
I'm borrowing your mom today.

487
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,333
Get some rest and sleep early.

488
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,583
Honey, don't keep scrolling
in front of the kids.

489
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,541
You're a control freak.

490
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,666
All the men run away from you.

491
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,875
No, I'm not!

492
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,583
It's like this now.
He won't even come home when he's older.

493
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,833
He will.

494
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,250
But with a girlfriend.

495
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,125
I really can't recall
the last time I used a facial mask.

496
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:04,625
Oh well, it's never too late
to start skincare.

497
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,375
It feels great
to leave my kids and husband behind.

498
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,166
I've actually
thought about how great it'd be

499
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:15,375
to leave my dad behind
and go to Singapore with Chang Kai.

500
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,833
Okay, I know.

501
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,083
It's wrong to think this way.

502
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,958
But if I had siblings,
I wouldn't be burdened like this.

503
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,625
At least not as much.

504
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,250
I'm really exhausted.

505
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,875
Let's not talk about
these depressing things anymore.

506
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,875
- Okay?
- Yeah.

507
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,416
- Okay.
- Cheers.

508
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,041
I'll toast with tea.
I'm taking Chinese medicine.

509
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,541
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

510
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,541
Cheers.

511
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:54,833
Hello?

512
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,708
Okay. Thanks.

513
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,916
Cheng Kuang-chi, age 80, male.

514
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,916
Roll the bed in.

515
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Sir.

516
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,125
Okay, hook him to the monitor.

517
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,750
- Make sure blood pressure's accurate.
- It'll be okay.

518
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,958
I'll do the paperwork. You stay put.

519
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:08,708
Help me push.

520
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,708
Okay.

521
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,916
How's his blood pressure?

522
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,583
Still checking.

523
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,666
Is his family here?

524
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,500
Cheng Kuang-chi's family!

525
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,375
Is Cheng Kuang-chi's family here?

526
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,250
Yes, I'm here.

527
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,000
His family's here.

528
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,625
Okay, can you get him on…

529
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,583
Okay.

530
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:30,791
Are you his family?

531
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,333
- Yes.
- Do you know what happened?

532
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,750
I'm not sure because I wasn't with him.

533
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:40,333
Okay, he may be in respiratory failure
due to an object blocking his airway.

534
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,708
We'll likely need to intubate him next.

535
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,083
Does he have any chronic disease?

536
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,708
Is delirium acute?

537
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:50,666
Yes.

538
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,000
So, have you discussed
a do not resuscitate order?

539
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,875
It's okay. Take a look at the form.

540
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,125
- Think it over and let me know.
- Okay.

541
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:15,958
DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER

542
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:16,875
<i>Being alive</i>

543
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,333
<i>is the most basic dignity of being human.</i>

544
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,250
<i>We've spent our whole lives learning it</i>
<i>and living by it.</i>

545
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:27,750
<i>But now,</i>

546
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,166
<i>does his decision or his right to live</i>

547
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,291
<i>solely rely on someone else's signature?</i>

548
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,041
I don't want
to be hooked up to all those tubes.

549
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:49,291
DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER

550
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,208
