1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,375
If a woman announces
she's getting married,

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,208
when she announces it,

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,833
it's like the happiest moment of her life.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,000
She even announces it like…

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,791
"See?"

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,250
"I'm getting married."

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,750
"I'm finally off the market."

8
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:35,416
"He proposed halfway through the movie,
and I said yes."

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,041
But if a man announces the same thing,

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,125
it's like he's announcing
he got a terminal illness.

11
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,958
"I finally know how married life is…"

12
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,791
"Impotent."

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,250
Hey, why's that seat always empty?

14
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,041
A VIP reserved that seat.

15
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,958
Just doesn't show up?

16
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,041
Why do you care?

17
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,750
No, but other people could sit there.

18
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,208
The empty seat bugs me.

19
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,625
What if the VIP shows up?

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,375
That's it for today because I have
to rush to my wedding anniversary party.

21
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,375
Hello?

22
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,791
Let's go!

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,416
Let's go!

24
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,041
THE RESERVED SEAT

25
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,166
Red Dragon.

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,166
Pong!

27
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,708
- Why are you yelling?
- I've been waiting.

28
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,333
Feeling proud?

29
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,500
- Two Dots.
- Okay.

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,541
I really can't handle it.

31
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,708
Whenever I call Le-le for dinner,

32
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,875
she plays hide-and-seek with me. South.

33
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,625
She says she's making eggs.

34
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,416
Is my food that bad?

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,291
My daughter Le-le tends to be independent.

37
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,666
Just like her mother.

38
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,833
Why did you bring that up?

39
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:14,833
It's okay.

40
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,916
I just give her the keys now.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,208
She can get home herself.

42
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,583
- Mrs. Liu, thanks for looking after her.
- No big deal.

43
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,916
One Bird.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,375
I've known Le-le since she was a baby.

45
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,625
When are you gonna call it quits?

46
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,875
I haven't paid off my mortgage.

47
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,541
I want to save up more money
to give Le-le a better life.

48
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,958
But Le-le's a girl.

49
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,833
She'll marry, and you'll be alone.

50
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,333
Who'll take care of you?
You'll be a lonely old man.

51
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,291
Mrs. Liu, you're thinking way ahead.

52
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,666
I'll take care of myself.
I can get a loan on my house

53
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,166
and have money for retirement.

54
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,583
You pay off the loan and borrow again.

55
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,000
Isn't that weird?

56
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,916
You should spend more time at home.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,625
Kids only grow up once.

58
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,541
I win.

59
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,333
I was waiting to win.

60
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,208
- Hey, you're home.
- Le-le.

61
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,541
Say hi.

62
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,250
Hi, Uncle Tang. Hi, Mrs. Liu.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
- Auntie Sammy.
- Hi, Auntie Sammy.

64
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,208
Hello, Le-le. Have you eaten?

65
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,791
I'm not hungry.
I'll get ready for my speech contest.

66
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,041
Okay, good girl.

67
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,500
It's normal
to dislike dad's female friends.

68
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,916
Le-le likes me.

69
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,416
Does she?

70
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,416
Let's play.

71
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,333
Wow.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,375
Should I go cheer for you?

73
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,583
Please don't.

74
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey!

75
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,375
Everyone gets good luck from my support.

76
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,291
Don't make a promise you can't keep.

77
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,291
Well…

78
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,375
Who is Auntie Amy?

79
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,541
That's Auntie Sammy.

80
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,583
What happened to Auntie Yoyo?

81
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,708
They're like Mrs. Liu.

82
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,208
We are just friend.

83
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,000
"Friends" with an "s."

84
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,291
Your English sucks.

85
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,916
Hey, I can hear you.

86
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,958
Le-le…

87
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,208
Le-Le, dinner time.

88
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,458
Le-le, come to my place for dinner.

89
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,458
Why are you hiding there, Le-le?

90
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,375
Your dad said that
you have to eat at mine when he's away.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,458
I already ate.

92
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,666
I'll go to your place to sleep
after I finish my homework.

93
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,208
<i>How is everyone tonight?</i>

94
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,500
<i>Great!</i>

95
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,750
You sound energetic.

96
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,125
Let me ask you a question.

97
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,750
Do we have any moms here?

98
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,833
No? Probably not.

99
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,958
Yeah, what mom has the time
to come to a show?

100
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
I don't have kids,

101
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,875
but my bestie has one.

102
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,416
Her son was the first newborn baby
I've ever seen.

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,750
I was shocked when I first saw him.

104
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,458
I gotta say, newborns are…

105
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,083
They're really cute.

106
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,958
But when I saw her son
come out from down there

107
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,708
and they pulled him out,

108
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,583
I really gasped.

109
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,375
He was purple, all crinkled up.

110
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,625
I thought, "What alien is this?"

111
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,833
I really wanted to greet him with,

112
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,000
"Hello,

113
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,666
welcome to planet Earth."

114
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,958
"Congrats on making it out."

115
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,291
No, "Congrats on being born."

116
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:57,375
One time, my ex
gently caressed me in bed and said,

117
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,291
"How about we have a baby?"

118
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,208
I immediately jumped up and said,

119
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,416
"You wanna hear crying every day?"

120
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,791
He's like, "No, kids don't cry all day."

121
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,750
I said, "But I will."

122
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,500
"I'll cry right now."

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,083
I don't want kids.

124
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,375
It's true. Another…

125
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,083
I know you're dealing with things
after the separation.

126
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,208
But you're really struggling.

127
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,416
I don't know what you're resisting.

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,291
It's a rare separation experience.

129
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,958
You can curse, vent, and insult your ex.

130
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,625
Why not go for it?

131
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,541
At least make the most of your ex.

132
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,250
He's not my ex.

133
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,750
He… We're still in divorce phase--

134
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,500
It's the same thing.

135
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,625
Just remember,
get the most out of what's left of him.

136
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,833
I don't want to entertain
the crowd like this.

137
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,833
Do you have any other ways?

138
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,166
I had high hopes for you
because you can self-deprecate.

139
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,250
But listen,

140
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,958
you're no longer a rookie.

141
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,458
Your biggest problem is
your words are too modest.

142
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,083
It doesn't hit hard enough.

143
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,666
The audience is here to blow off steam,
not to listen to your stories.

144
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,833
But didn't you tell me
you need women's stories?

145
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,833
I'm sharing women's--

146
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:09,250
If the audience doesn't care about you,
they won't pay attention to you.

147
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,125
Everything has its stages.

148
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,375
LOCAL NUMBER

149
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,625
I think I can find my own style.

150
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,250
I've seen too many people.

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,125
You are pretty funny,
but if you insist on your own ways,

152
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,750
anyone can replace you.

153
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,291
Hello?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,875
Hi, I'm looking for Cheng Kuang-chi.
I'm his daughter.

155
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,708
- Over there.
- Over there?

156
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
Thank you.

157
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,583
Cheng Kuang-chi, what have you…

158
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,958
Dad.

159
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,333
Le-le.

160
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,500
Come say goodbye to your mom.

161
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,583
He's a sailor, I'm a driver.

162
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,041
This guy's always on the run.

163
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,125
No, listen.

164
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,166
People are on the run to do business.

165
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,666
He's on the run to chase after girls.

166
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,791
Another bottle.

167
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,208
Thank you.

168
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,625
Le-le…

169
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,583
Don't cry. Mommy will make you milk.

170
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,458
Listen to Mommy when Daddy's away, okay?

171
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,500
What's with all the crying lately?

172
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,958
I'll be back in ten days.

173
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,708
Le-le.

174
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Hsiao-fang.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,125
- Hsiao-fang.
- What?

176
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,916
Are you listening?

177
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,750
I'll be back in ten days.

178
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,666
Okay.

179
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,666
When I'm gone, talk to the neighbors more.

180
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,416
Mrs. Liu said
you ignored her at the market.

181
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,333
I'm off now.

182
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,916
- Kuang-chi.
- Yes?

183
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:29,875
What is it?

184
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,791
Nothing.

185
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,500
Okay.

186
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
It's okay. Don't overthink it.
Drink more water.

187
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,750
Daddy's off. Bye-bye.

188
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,208
Hey, Mrs. Cheng.

189
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,250
Getting groceries?

190
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,875
I haven't seen you for a few days.

191
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,708
Oh, Le-le.

192
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,833
Little Le-le.

193
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't cry…

194
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,958
It's all right.

195
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,250
Kids are like this. Crying is healthy.
It helps them grow faster.

196
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,333
With kids, it'd be easier to manage
if you have more.

197
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,208
All right…

198
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,333
So we'll…

199
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,875
Sweetie, let's go home and cook.

200
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,458
Get out and stretch your legs
when you've got time.

201
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,416
Watch where you're going!

202
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,125
<i>Chia-yun said</i>

203
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,083
<i>some people are better at being mothers…</i>

204
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,541
I'm off now.

205
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,166
<i>…while others aren't.</i>

206
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm off now.

207
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,291
Mommy, are you ready? Let's go.

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,166
<i>But no matter what,</i>

209
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,250
<i>being a mother</i>

210
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,708
<i>is always chaotic but happy.</i>

211
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,583
Mommy, let's go play. Mommy.

212
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,750
<i>However,</i>

213
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
<i>the mom I remember</i>

214
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>never seemed happy.</i>

215
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,916
Mommy, look.

216
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,375
Mommy, look at me!

217
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,833
Mommy, why weren't you looking?

218
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,750
I looked. Go play.

219
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,375
- Le-le, school's out?
- Yes.

220
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,583
Mommy, where are you going?

221
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,375
I'm hungry.

222
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,250
Remember to chop the onion
into small pieces.

223
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,500
I'll teach you so you can make it
when you're hungry.

224
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,458
- You hear me?
- Yes.

225
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,083
You can add a lot of ketchup,

226
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,666
but make sure to mix it well.

227
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,000
Remember that.

228
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,541
Mom, I'll wait till you come home.

229
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,541
<i>Hi, how's your day going?</i>

230
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,208
<i>After a long day,</i>

231
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>a lot of things in life can get us down.</i>

232
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,333
<i>We might think the world's ending,</i>

233
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,416
<i>but actually, the earth keeps on spinning.</i>

234
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,708
<i>Let's pause and take a breath.</i>

235
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,750
<i>We'll enjoy this song.</i>

236
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,500
Sir, can you turn off the music? Thanks.

237
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
<i>…get off the bus.</i>

238
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,708
In just two hours,
the recycling company's coming.

239
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,416
Dad.

240
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,375
Dad, are you okay?

241
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,250
- Yeah?
- Are you all right?

242
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm fine.

243
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,833
We gotta hurry. We only have two hours.

244
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,791
What's the rush? How is two hours enough?

245
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,666
Throw away everything you see.

246
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,083
That's plenty of time.

247
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,375
How on earth do I open this door?

248
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,166
- Can you open it?
- Hello. You…

249
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,250
Mr. Cheng.

250
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:26,791
Chin.

251
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,166
- It's been ages.
- Yeah.

252
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,375
Are you Hsiao-fang's daughter?

253
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,875
You look just like your mom.

254
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:34,833
How so?

255
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,833
I live next door. Call me Chin.

256
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,875
Let me get this door. It's a bit stuck.

257
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,333
There's a trick to get it open.

258
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,750
Lift it up slightly,

259
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,833
and it opens.

260
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,791
Chin, I didn't know you lived here.

261
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:59,666
I was living with my daughter
and looking after her kids,

262
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,500
but she kept picking on me.

263
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,625
So I just moved back
to keep Hsiao-fang company.

264
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,166
That's nice.

265
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,416
The landlord said
the furniture belongs here.

266
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,333
You just need to clean up
the rest of the stuff.

267
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,708
Okay.

268
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,708
I'm sad that Hsiao-fang is gone.

269
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,291
When is her funeral?

270
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,333
There's no funeral.

271
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,041
Le-le.

272
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,833
What? You know her that well?

273
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,166
- It's done.
- Let's chat another time.

274
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,333
That's fine.

275
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:32,208
Actually, Hsiao-fang
doesn't like that either.

276
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,375
She's not religious.

277
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,083
She only likes singing.

278
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:40,166
- Chanting gives her a headache. No, I--
- Thank you.

279
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,625
- I can actually help--
- We can handle it.

280
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,208
Hey…

281
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,291
NAME: WANG HSIAO-FANG

282
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,333
PAYMENT MADE BY: CHENG KUANG-CHI

283
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,125
Hey!

284
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,041
You're throwing that away too?

285
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,041
- Don't.
- Why not?

286
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,666
Don't you have enough stuff?

287
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,083
Isn't this too heartless?

288
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:41,708
Heartless?

289
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,250
Am I the heartless one now?

290
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,791
Right. You're the loving person.

291
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:51,583
What is this?
You've been paying her medical bills?

292
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,875
How did you get that money?
Didn't you mortgage the house?

293
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,791
So you did that for Wang Hsiao-fang?

294
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,291
This is my money too.

295
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,916
I thought she was in San Francisco
or somewhere in the US.

296
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,291
And you guys got in touch?

297
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,041
And you kept me in the dark.

298
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,833
Don't you think that's unfair?

299
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,625
She's the one who left me, left us.
You forgot?

300
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,208
And do you know

301
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,500
why I studied English?

302
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,000
Because I wanted to look for her.

303
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,333
I thought I was able to find her.

304
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,666
Do you know why I became a tour guide?

305
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,833
I wanted to find her.

306
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,791
I wanted to leave you.

307
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,583
I was going to leave you.

308
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:36,500
- I… just--
- I just don't get it.

309
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,458
I really don't get it.

310
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:43,375
She had been living here.
You could've told me. Why didn't you? I…

311
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,666
Even that neighbor next door…

312
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,875
- Chin? Chan?
- Chin.

313
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,541
Whatever her name is!

314
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,291
She knew more about my mom than I did.

315
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:09,916
Did she tell you

316
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,500
why she left us?

317
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,416
Did she know

318
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,083
I had a lot of questions for her?

319
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,958
I won't get a chance to ask.

320
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,291
And what is this?

321
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,875
What is this? You went with her…

322
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,875
You went to an exhibition with her.

323
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:56,291
You went with her,
but you kept it from me.

324
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,041
What's wrong with you?

325
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,291
Listen to this.

326
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,166
Mom took me to get my ID photo taken.

327
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,250
You didn't know that, right?

328
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,708
She was going to leave you, not me!

329
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,416
Your mom suffered in her last few years.

330
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,166
Look at this. How can I scold him?

331
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,458
Shaw threw a crayon at that girl
because of me.

332
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,916
Lin Chia-yun, don't let your son
cloud your moral judgment.

333
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,041
No, it was the girl
next to Shaw who was being rude first.

334
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,791
She said to Shaw,

335
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,083
"What's so great about a housewife?
How can she be a superhero?"

336
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,416
Isn't that rude?

337
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,583
Is it a housewife?

338
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,375
Yes, look. He drew me. Isn't it pretty?

339
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,541
There are so many hands.

340
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,833
- What is this holding?
- A broom.

341
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,041
And this?

342
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,416
Is this… poop?

343
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,208
Who holds poop with bare hands?
That's garbage.

344
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,791
So to Shaw, you're an… octopus?

345
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,666
That's a son's love for his mother.
You wouldn't get it.

346
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,125
Other people have love too.
Your son threw crayons.

347
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,500
They still have love.

348
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,708
- You're here.
- Yeah.

349
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,541
- What are you looking at?
- My son's drawing.

350
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,208
Let me see.

351
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,416
He draws better than me.

352
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,250
Are you okay?

353
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:25,833
I'm fine.

354
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,041
I'm okay.

355
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,666
You…

356
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,458
Just think of it
like she went on another trip.

357
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,625
Like before.

358
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:34,958
Yeah.

359
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,083
Look…

360
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:39,083
Look at Huang Su-fei's parents.
They've been abroad for years.

361
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,875
What difference does it make?

362
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,333
Do you know how to chat?

363
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,958
What am I supposed to say?

364
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,166
How did the cleaning go?

365
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,708
She didn't leave much behind.

366
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,583
It's like she was…

367
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,166
she was ready to leave again.

368
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,291
I wonder if your mom left
because she had postpartum depression.

369
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,375
Did that exist back then?

370
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:31,958
<i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>what my bestie said struck me.</i>

371
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,583
<i>Maybe my mom did have</i>
<i>postpartum depression.</i>

372
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:39,625
So all of my childhood trauma

373
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,500
hit me hard in my forties.

374
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,291
Like people-pleasing personality,

375
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,791
inferiority complex…

376
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,958
Look at me, standing here,

377
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,708
pleasing everyone.

378
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,791
Please you…

379
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,250
I pushed the door open

380
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,916
and went into her place.

381
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,833
I saw it.

382
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,041
It was empty.

383
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,875
Just a couch.

384
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:11,916
And

385
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,291
a bed,

386
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,708
a toothbrush,

387
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,041
and a bunch of pills.

388
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,708
And a pile of vinyl records.

389
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,666
I…

390
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,208
Couldn't she just be like a normal mom?

391
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,833
Could she leave me a gold bar,

392
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,333
or a gold ring, or a gold bracelet,

393
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,458
or even a designer bag?

394
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,583
Anything would do.

395
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,291
I really need this.

396
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,083
I don't get why you had to leave us,

397
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,958
abandon everything,

398
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,666
abandon me,

399
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,708
and live such a tough life,

400
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:01,416
just to chase after what others call

401
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,083
a dream.

402
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,916
This behavior…

403
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,750
This stupid behavior really…

404
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,416
All I can say is, you're a lot like me.

405
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,291
As your daughter,

406
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,583
I haven't forgiven you.

407
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,416
But as a woman,

408
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,708
I can understand you.

409
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,750
You were just

410
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,625
exhausted.

411
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:42,250
You were crushed by fear.

412
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,291
You… wanted to be yourself.

413
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,041
You had a hard time.

414
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,708
You were stressed out.

415
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,458
But guess what?

416
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,375
I actually envy you.

417
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,625
Because I think you're braver than me.

418
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
FUNNY CLUB TALK SHOW

419
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:20,541
Wait!

420
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,916
Wait!

421
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:52,791
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

422
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,500
what were you like at 40?

423
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,125
Were you a lot like me?

424
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,125
But anyway, I…

425
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,041
I'm all grown up now.

426
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,875
Even without you,

427
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,500
I still grew up.

428
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,083
And I'm doing just fine.

429
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,583
I'll be okay, right?

430
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,791
Honestly, I don't know.

431
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,041
Lately, my life has been…

432
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,375
Did you just ignore what I said?
Are you really doing this?

433
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,333
I'm sorry.

434
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,333
This is a stand-up comedy stage.

435
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,791
Not your mom's place.

436
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,916
I'm sorry.

437
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,541
"Sorry" doesn't solve anything.

438
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,291
No one's here for your apologies.

439
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,458
They don't need to hear your backstory.

440
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,958
They are just here to relax.

441
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,833
I know.

442
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,500
All right.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,208
Give me your script. Let me tweak it.

444
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:25,166
You mean I can go this way with it?

445
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,166
Hurry up.

446
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,000
<i>The day I first met your mother,</i>

447
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,083
<i>we spent the whole night dancing.</i>

448
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,916
<i>Dancing?</i>

449
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,083
<i>I've never even seen her smile.</i>
<i>She danced?</i>

450
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,166
<i>She actually used to laugh a lot.</i>

451
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:12,000
<i>I remember she was a really happy person.</i>

452
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,541
<i>Especially when she was singing on stage.</i>

453
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,625
<i>She had always been alone.</i>

454
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,041
<i>Her parents died young.</i>

455
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,708
<i>In a way,</i>

456
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,416
<i>we were both wired to be alone.</i>

457
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,958
<i>Why have a kid?</i>

458
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,208
<i>You can't just try out kids</i>
<i>and dump them if they don't fit.</i>

459
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,083
<i>Who knows if we never tried?</i>

460
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,333
<i>When we were young,</i>

461
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,958
<i>we both loved alien movies.</i>

462
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,375
<i>Back then, no one believed</i>

463
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,375
<i>that aliens existed.</i>

464
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,041
<i>Only your mom believed in me.</i>

465
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:04,458
<i>She said she'd move</i>
<i>to outer space with me.</i>

466
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,833
<i>Have you ever hated her?</i>

467
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,916
<i>I…</i>

468
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,916
<i>I couldn't understand her then.</i>

469
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,916
<i>But I've never hated her.</i>

470
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,250
<i>Then, as we grew older,</i>

471
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,416
<i>nothing else really mattered.</i>

472
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:56,916
Dad.

473
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,541
Do you have dirty laundry?

474
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I almost forgot to give you this.

475
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,083
I found this
in your mom's kitchen cabinet.

476
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,666
So I put it away.

477
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,500
Mr. Cheng.

478
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,625
- Hey, I didn't think you'd come.
- Chin, yes.

479
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,041
Nothing's changed in here.

480
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:01,958
That's right.

481
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,541
- Hsiao-fang also said the same thing.
- Yes.

482
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,125
Here, have a seat.

483
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:07,791
I'll get you some drinks.

484
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:08,875
- Sure.
- Thanks.

485
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:10,625
Is it you?

486
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,041
Mrs. Yang?

487
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,250
It really is you.

488
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,500
- It's been so long.
- Indeed. Right.

489
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,250
Do you remember Mrs. Yang?

490
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,750
She was your mom's midwife.

491
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,416
How can she remember?

492
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,541
Were you in touch with her?

493
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:38,000
Hsiao-fang had been unwell
since giving birth.

494
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,625
She was emotionally unstable as well.

495
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,875
Yeah, that was all in the past.

496
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,416
All right then.

497
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,625
<i>Mom.</i>

498
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,750
<i>In my dreams,</i>

499
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,375
<i>there are many times</i>
<i>I feel like I see you.</i>

500
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,291
<i>In real life,</i>

501
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:19,166
<i>I feel like I run into you a lot.</i>

502
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,750
<i>Outside the window,</i>

503
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,375
<i>in an alley…</i>

504
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,625
I know.

505
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,208
<i>…or when I pulled over by the road.</i>

506
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,291
<i>But I know it's not you.</i>

507
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,833
Close your mouth. One, two, three…

508
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,333
<i>It's just because</i>…

509
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:38,791
Good.

510
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,291
<i>…I miss you so much.</i>

511
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,916
Okay, smile.

512
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,041
<i>You said you'd take me to San Francisco</i>
<i>to see the bridge</i>

513
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,083
<i>and the aliens.</i>

514
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,083
<i>I purposely forgot</i>

515
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,041
<i>that you smile.</i>

516
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,958
Mommy, catch me!

517
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,208
Mommy's here. Come on…

518
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,500
Get ready to fly.

519
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,875
<i>I purposely forgot…</i>

520
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,791
<i>how hard you had tried.</i>

521
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:28,833
Good girl!

522
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,541
<i>I purposely forgot…</i>

523
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,791
<i>the day you left,</i>

524
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,416
<i>it was me who let you go.</i>

525
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,708
Mommy, you can go.

526
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,125
But please stop crying.
