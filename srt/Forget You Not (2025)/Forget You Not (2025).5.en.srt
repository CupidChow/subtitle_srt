1
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,708
<i>Life is made up of countless choices.</i>

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,416
<i>And I choose what I can live with.</i>

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,750
- Your hot latte. Thank you.
- Thanks.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,250
- Hello there. For here or to go?
- Just a sec.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,500
Members get buy one, get one free today.

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,333
What can I get you today?

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,166
I'll have a…

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,625
a latte. That's all.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,375
Sure, a latte.

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,125
Want to upgrade to local farm milk
for $5 more?

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,833
Low-fat or whole milk? Decaf?
Sugar? Large, medium, or small?

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,291
Do you collect points?
Iced or hot? For here or to go?

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,125
To go, please.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,583
To go.

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,083
De-- decaf.

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,083
Decaf.

17
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,708
Sorry, just a moment. Thank you.

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:08,708
I…

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,916
- Let me think about it.
- No problem.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Hello there. For here or to go?
Are you a member? Members get…

21
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,208
- To go. I'm a member. Points.
- To go.

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,250
Single origin latte, large, less ice,
no sugar. I have my tumbler.

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,250
And a hot pressed ham sandwich.

24
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,708
- Pay by card. No bags, thanks.
- Thanks.

25
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,791
<i>It's just a cup of coffee,</i>

26
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:30,125
<i>but every time they ask me,</i>
<i>I feel like an idiot.</i>

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,958
NO OTHER CHOICE

28
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,416
Come on, keep up.

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,750
Can't you return two days earlier?

30
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,333
Choose your own bread.

31
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,875
I'm not making you choose
between family and work.

32
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,583
- But I haven't seen my parents in ages.
- Mom, I want the hot dog bun.

33
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,708
Fine. Gotta go. Bye.

34
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,791
That's unhealthy processed food.

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,458
That gives you a sugar high.

36
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,083
Didn't you tell me to choose?

37
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,125
Get this. It's tasty and healthy.

38
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,666
You'll thank me when you grow up.

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's go. It's getting late.

40
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,625
Come on.

41
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,041
I'm sure a lot of you know

42
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,958
that I'm in my forties.

43
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,333
I know what you're thinking.

44
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,583
I'm not in menopause yet, okay? All right?

45
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,125
Not yet.

46
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,250
But any day now.

47
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,333
I've actually been going through a phase

48
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,708
where my period has been irregular.

49
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,791
It's like playing hide and seek with me.

50
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,208
Here it is, and then it's gone…

51
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,416
When I was younger,

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,916
I'd freak out if my period was late.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,458
I'd think,

54
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,333
"Am I pregnant?"

55
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,958
But now,

56
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,916
I still freak out if my period's late.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,375
I'm like, "Come on. Please be pregnant."

58
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,750
"I don't want to hit menopause.
I really don't."

59
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,000
It sounds sad.

60
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,291
Ovarian decline.

61
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,416
It brings mental changes,

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,958
memory loss,

63
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,291
chronic unhappiness,

64
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,625
trouble concentrating.

65
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,583
You get angry easily
and find it hard to fall asleep.

66
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,208
All these symptoms, when I heard them,

67
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,583
I thought they sounded just like
my dad's Alzheimer's.

68
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,958
So I said to the doctor, "Hold on."

69
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,125
"Is it possible that you misdiagnosed it?"

70
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,625
Maybe my dad doesn't have Alzheimer's.

71
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,625
Maybe he's just hit menopause.

72
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,166
Just menopause, that's all.

73
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,166
Le-le.

74
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,583
Officer, I'm sorry.

75
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,583
What happened?

76
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,541
He said he lost something.

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,125
I've checked everywhere,

78
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,666
no one broke in.

79
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,041
I asked him what he lost,
but he wouldn't tell me.

80
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,208
You said I lost my wallet.

81
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,750
Look, the keys are here.

82
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,791
Your wallet?

83
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,833
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,916
Let me take a look.

85
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,791
Dad.

86
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,583
Here's your wallet.

87
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,541
What?

88
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,625
I'm sorry…

89
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,208
I'm here for the second time this month.
We come when we get a call.

90
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
I know…

91
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,500
You want to take a break
and have water or a drink?

92
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,166
No, it's fine. It's all good.

93
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
- Thanks.
- I'm off.

94
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,708
Okay, sorry about that.

95
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,541
Sorry. Thank you.

96
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,666
It's pretty chilly in this hospital.

97
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,625
Yeah.

98
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,208
- What?
- I pulled my back from sneezing.

99
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,750
- You pulled your back?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,166
Hold on, I'll find you a seat.

101
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,333
Excuse me. Is it possible--

102
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,375
I'm pregnant.

103
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
- Okay.
- It's fine…

104
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,000
- You can have my seat.
- No, you…

105
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,916
- Hey, no…
- Thank you.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,833
No worries.

107
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,250
Go ahead and sit.

108
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,416
<i>Mr. Cheng, how's your appetite been?</i>

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Well, you don't need to shout.

110
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,333
My hearing's pretty good.

111
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
How's your appetite been?

112
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,208
Why did the peanut go to the hospital?

113
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,291
Why?

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Nutty.

115
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,125
Because it was feeling nutty.

116
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:25,666
I had peanut butter on toast
for breakfast this morning.

117
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,583
That's lame. Stay focused.

118
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,666
Okay. Do you sleep well?

119
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,750
Yes.

120
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,583
Do you know what day it is?

121
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,500
Does it matter?

122
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,250
Okay.

123
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,625
Who's she?
Do you know who's here with you?

124
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,708
Of course I do. She's my daughter.

125
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,750
Doctor, I'm not sick.

126
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,625
I… She's the one who's sick.

127
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,666
She's been forgetful since she was little.

128
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,250
She used to get lost in school.
I had to go look for her.

129
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,208
Do you remember
what you had for dinner last night?

130
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,125
Delicacies, I think.

131
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,875
Delicacies.

132
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,416
- Okay, Mr. Cheng.
- Yeah?

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,750
You seem fine to me. You're good.

134
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,708
- Nothing's wrong.
- Yeah, I'm not sick.

135
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,291
She's the one who's sick.

136
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,208
- Right…
- She should see a doctor.

137
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,000
I often have to look for her.

138
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,125
Yeah, I'll take a look at her.
Can you wait outside?

139
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,166
She…

140
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,791
She's grown up now.

141
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,791
Hey, don't worry.

142
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,625
I'll take you home.

143
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,583
Please sit here and wait.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sorry about that.

145
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,375
It's still pretty mild now.

146
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,875
I'll prescribe some meds
to slow the symptoms.

147
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,041
But he'll slowly lose his memories.

148
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,875
Then he'll get suspicious,

149
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,875
thinking things are stolen
when he misplaces them.

150
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,666
- Some people might even get violent.
- Thanks.

151
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,791
We suggest spending more time with him
and talking to him.

152
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,583
It'll help ease his symptoms.

153
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,125
Are these symptoms irreversible?

154
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,041
It's like,

155
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,458
we only get older,
and we don't get younger, right?

156
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,125
What about that new drug I mentioned?

157
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah, I've looked into it.

158
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,083
But are there side effects?

159
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,291
All medications have side effects.

160
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,166
We look at whether it has a major effect
on the overall treatment outcome.

161
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,208
It's currently the only medication
for treating dementia.

162
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,500
Our hospital's part of
the new drug program.

163
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,375
It will work best on Mr. Cheng
since he's in the early stages.

164
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,208
I see.

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,708
So do I have to decide right now?

166
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,333
Because the cost…

167
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,875
About the cost,

168
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,166
once you confirm with your dad,
we can discuss it with the hospital.

169
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,833
Okay.

170
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,541
PSYCHIATRY

171
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,208
Why are you standing?

172
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,041
I'm fine. Someone else can sit.

173
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,541
You like to act tough.

174
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,125
Self-reliance leads to strength.

175
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,416
Here, give me…

176
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,166
Let's drink these somewhere.

177
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,250
Hey, answer this.

178
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,291
Which would you pick, coffee or Coke?

179
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:27,958
Coke, I guess.

180
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,375
Well, Coke asks coffee,

181
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,916
"Who will live longer?"

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,041
Coke.

183
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,541
It's always bubbly, so it'll live longer.

184
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,583
Coffee says, "That's hard to tell."

185
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,416
"It depends on your lifestyle,

186
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,375
if you exercise,

187
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,625
your social life."

188
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,875
- "The environment. Everything affects it."
- Okay.

189
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Then what?

190
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
That's it.

191
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,416
Coffee talked for too long,
so Coke went flat and got dumped.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,416
Wow, that's so funny.

193
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,708
Not funny?

194
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,625
Hey.

195
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,000
It looks serious.

196
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,291
Just kidding.

197
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,458
Well…

198
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,583
That's silly!

199
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,333
It still hurts a little.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,708
Here, wait a sec. Be careful.

201
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:30,958
All right.

202
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,625
Thank you, sir.

203
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
All right, here.

204
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,250
I think we should move
to a place with an elevator.

205
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,125
Climbing stairs is good. It's a workout.

206
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,666
What if you can't climb anymore?

207
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,166
You're underestimating me.

208
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
Not really.

209
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,708
It's inevitable.

210
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,666
I don't even want to climb now.

211
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,833
You're just lazy.

212
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,416
I am just old.

213
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,958
I'm used to living here.
I don't want to move.

214
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,125
The doctor said that you can't live alone.

215
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,708
Why don't you live with the doctor?

216
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,041
No, we can talk about this, right?

217
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,791
Going up and down the stairs
is dangerous for you.

218
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,375
If I pull my back, I have to move out.

219
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,833
If I lose my eyesight,
do I move into your heart?

220
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,375
I think the doctor's wrong.

221
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,541
It's not dementia. You're just immature.

222
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,625
- Hello?
<i>- Can you fill in tonight?</i>

223
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,375
Seriously? This is so sudden.

224
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,875
I have to work today.

225
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,791
<i>Does your job at the convenience store</i>
<i>matter more than comedy?</i>

226
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,875
<i>Just get someone to cover your shift.</i>

227
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,416
Okay, I'll think about it.

228
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,708
Where are my pills?

229
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,000
Hold on. Give me a second.

230
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,750
Go home now.

231
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,916
<i>Are you up for it? It's a full house.</i>

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,583
<i>Great chance to get exposure.</i>

233
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,833
I don't have any material.

234
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,625
Besides, didn't you say
my jokes weren't funny?

235
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you want to talk about this now?</i>

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Jeez!

237
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,875
Should I do that bit
about you backstabbing people?

238
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,416
Might get more laughs.

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,083
Hello, welcome.

240
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,208
- I'm filing a complaint.
- Yes, sorry.

241
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,833
- Gotcha.
- Lin Chia-yun.

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,125
You're performing tonight?

243
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,041
You're here alone?

244
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,416
Jack and his mom are in Taipei.
I can finally get away from the kids.

245
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,208
I miss you.

246
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,666
What happened?

247
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,125
Why? Do I need a reason to come see you?

248
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,458
Aren't we besties?

249
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,375
Spill it.

250
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,250
Before Jack went out, he told me

251
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,708
he'd take the kids camping
with his coworkers over spring break.

252
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,250
I told him Shaw was
about to start an extracurricular class

253
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,791
and Anne is so young.

254
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,708
He said, "That's fine. It's your call.
You can take time off or something."

255
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,958
Seriously?
It seems like I'm making decisions,

256
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,041
but I'm being told what to do.

257
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,916
I'll end up fixing everything.

258
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,666
Take time off, cancel, and apologize
to the teachers. Do I even have a choice?

259
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,125
At least you still have some options.

260
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,333
I have no choice but to choose.

261
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,125
Those so-called options aren't even real.

262
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,458
It's just choosing
after the real choice has been made.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,333
Is your dad okay?

264
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,750
Define "okay."

265
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,208
My definitions keep changing every day.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,708
He used to decide for me,
and now I decide for him.

267
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,416
Moving, the new drugs…

268
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,958
Will I have to decide
what he eats and drinks in the future?

269
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,291
How can I decide for him?

270
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,916
Looking after the elderly
is like caring for kids.

271
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,291
You think you're done with this? Not yet.

272
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,625
The next challenge is around the corner!

273
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,250
From formula and diapers

274
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,625
to school and kindergarten,

275
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,291
sometimes I feel like I'm going nuts.

276
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,583
Why me? Why?

277
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,958
I don't wanna make decisions.
I wanna sleep!

278
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,125
What if he doesn't like my decisions?

279
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,250
He'll tell you if he doesn't.

280
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,458
What if those decisions he doesn't like
are actually better for him?

281
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,208
Is it what you think is better
or what he thinks?

282
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,625
Come on, look on the bright side.

283
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,625
I'm dealing with the old and the young.

284
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,083
At least you only have…

285
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,916
The old.

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,333
No, the young.

287
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,541
Go to hell.

288
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,500
Your slap is… Take it easy!

289
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,916
Here, I'll get you a drink. Choose one.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,333
More choices?

291
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,125
Your Majesty Su-fei.

292
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,041
This is for you.

293
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,583
You've worked hard.

294
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,791
What is it? Asking me for a favor?

295
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,708
Your Majesty, please don't say that.

296
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,416
I'm honored to treat you to coffee.

297
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
- Just cut to the chase.
- That Hokkaido New Year's tour--

298
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,541
I haven't spent New Year's
in Taiwan in six years.

299
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,541
- No way.
- Come on.

300
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,583
Does it matter?

301
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,791
Hokkaido is romantic.

302
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,708
- Not for six years.
- The streets…

303
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,166
What about the Seoul tour?

304
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,500
I'd rather not. I'm all alone.

305
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,916
I want to spend New Year's with my kitty.

306
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,375
Hello?

307
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,041
General Manager.

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,958
Yes, this isn't about paying me double.

309
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,958
I know my family lives abroad, but…

310
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,333
Yes, General Manager,
you're so kind to me.

311
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,375
Hokkaido it is.

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,958
Thank you.

313
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,666
Thank you, Your Majesty. Please enjoy.

314
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,750
Thank you.

315
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,958
Son of a bitch.

316
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,375
TANG'S BIKE SHOP - DAUGHTER

317
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:15,958
Dad.

318
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,333
Did you know
you left your keys in the door?

319
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,333
Dad.

320
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,500
Dad.

321
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,375
Come on.

322
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,416
WILL

323
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,791
HENG LI ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW
WILL

324
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,500
SEALED FOR CONFIDENTIALITY

325
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,291
Hello, Le-le.

326
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,875
Can you tell me
what's going on with the will?

327
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,708
<i>What's in my dad's will?</i>

328
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,666
I can't disclose client info.

329
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,583
Can you be a bit more flexible or humane?

330
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,625
When did he talk to you?

331
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,500
Why didn't I know about it?
I'm his daughter!

332
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,000
<i>This is so important, and I…</i>

333
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,375
<i>I have no idea. No one told me either.</i>

334
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,708
How…

335
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,666
are you?

336
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,666
I'm fine.

337
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,375
Why wouldn't I be fine?

338
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,375
I'm just single and divorced.

339
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,041
And I'm working two jobs.

340
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
<i>My dad thinks he's dying,</i>
<i>so he wrote a will.</i>

341
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,916
<i>I'm about to inherit something.</i>

342
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Why wouldn't I be fine?

343
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,500
<i>Calm down.</i>

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,125
<i>Want me to come over?</i>

345
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,041
How do you get back?

346
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,583
Do you have a private jet?

347
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,583
I don't have one.

348
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,500
But…

349
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,083
HENG LI

350
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,166
…I'm in Taipei now.

351
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,333
So you didn't even tell me you're back?

352
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,333
Right.

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,458
You don't have to tell me.

354
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,708
- So…
<i>- So…</i>

355
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,541
<i>Go ahead.</i>

356
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,833
It's okay, you go ahead.

357
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,833
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,166
I should've told you.

359
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,958
No, it's just…

360
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,125
I was in a bad mood. Sorry.

361
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,333
<i>You didn't say that five minutes ago.</i>

362
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,791
Don't push your luck.

363
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,041
- But about the will. Are you--
<i>- Yes.</i>

364
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,416
I'm an inflexible and inhumane lawyer.

365
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,625
How long are you staying?

366
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,875
<i>Not sure yet.</i>

367
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,708
<i>How's everything in Singapore?</i>

368
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,708
It was hard being alone.

369
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,750
But we made that choice.

370
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,625
Didn't we?

371
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,083
Yes.

372
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,125
But I didn't know…

373
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,125
if we had other options.

374
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,666
<i>Ma'am, you sure you're not joining us?</i>

375
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,750
You guys are insane.

376
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,500
I can't keep up with you.

377
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,125
Make sure to come back early tonight.

378
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,458
- Okay.
- I'll have beef noodle soup ready.

379
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,625
I'll be the first one back.

380
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,541
Hey, you old rascal.
When did you get this bike?

381
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:03,875
It's an unfair advantage.

382
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,666
Don't make excuses
for your lack of ability.

383
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,458
Hey, let's go. They're all there.

384
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,583
Honey, I'm off.

385
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,291
Hey, don't jump the gun, okay?

386
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,083
I think this is the one.

387
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,875
- This one.
- How about this? Look.

388
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,916
- Hi, everyone.
- He's not smiling in this.

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,041
- Hey.
- Cheng.

390
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,458
- Hey, Cheng. Here you are.
- We finally picked this. Any thoughts?

391
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,583
Let me see.

392
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:34,791
- It looks…
- Is it good?

393
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:35,750
Not this one.

394
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,583
- Not this one?
- No?

395
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,458
- Or we'll quit.
- I think it's okay.

396
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,375
Tang would like this one.

397
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,291
- This?
- This one's good.

398
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,958
- How did we miss it?
- Yeah.

399
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,083
Look at this…

400
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,333
- Is this good?
- Okay?

401
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah? This is it, okay?

402
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:50,916
Okay…

403
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,875
We're going with this.

404
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,791
All right then… Okay…

405
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:55,750
This is it.

406
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,166
That's right…

407
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,166
Ma'am.

408
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,291
What's this place?

409
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,958
It's your place.

410
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,916
Where is Tang?

411
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,500
Tang…

412
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,208
Tang's out for a bike ride.

413
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,541
He'll be back soon.

414
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,458
It's been a while
since I've had your beef noodle soup.

415
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,958
Friends of Mr. Tang,

416
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,291
thank you for coming.

417
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,583
Mr. Tang got a flu shot last week

418
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,583
and got myocarditis.

419
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,625
He passed away in the hospital
two days ago.

420
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,375
He asked me to tell you,

421
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:44,125
remember to take your bikes.

422
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,541
He's gone ahead.

423
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,208
See you on the other side.

424
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,958
I just pulled my back,

425
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,958
so I won't get up to speak.

426
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,541
Tang and I have been friends for 60 years.

427
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,958
When he retired,

428
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,500
he wasn't very happy.

429
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So I asked him to bike with me.

430
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,208
He came along
and got more into it than me.

431
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,458
One time, we fell off our bikes.

432
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,541
I can't remember when that was, though.

433
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,500
He broke his femur,

434
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,291
and it was quite bad.

435
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,458
My daughter told me to stop biking.

436
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,416
I said, "I gotta ask Tang."

437
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,666
"If he doesn't quit, I won't either."

438
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,958
Tang said

439
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,416
Guan Gong came to him one night.

440
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,166
He asked Guan Gong,

441
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,333
"I'm a devout believer

442
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,458
and I love drinking, just like you."

443
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,500
"Why don't you watch over me?"

444
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,625
Guan Gong said,

445
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,416
"I ride my horse, Red Hare."

446
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,375
"You ride a Cipollini bike."

447
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,458
"I can't keep up."

448
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:57,750
Right?

449
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:03,208
The joke's not that funny.

450
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,791
It's not that the joke's bad,

451
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,041
it's the person who'd get it

452
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,125
is already laughing in heaven.

453
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,291
Tang,

454
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,208
we'll keep biking.

455
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,458
Safe journey, and don't ride too fast.

456
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,875
I'm your older brother. What about it?

457
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,333
Have you acted like one?

458
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:34,291
I took care of our parents before.
Then you took over. Now what?

459
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,291
You were there when they were healthy.

460
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,125
Where were you when they weren't?

461
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,416
Where were you?

462
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,083
Fuck, if I don't beat him up today,
I'll be damned.

463
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,291
- Big brother.
- Come on.

464
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,583
Don't talk like that.

465
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,875
Dad left us more
'cause we're taking care of mom.

466
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:50,166
- You…
- What are you two fighting about?

467
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,000
Your mother's in there.

468
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,583
Do you have to fight about this
at your dad's funeral?

469
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,541
No, Mr. Wu, it's my younger brother…

470
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,291
Mr. Wu…

471
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,583
Hey.

472
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,791
Can I have your card, please?

473
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,333
Sure, feel free to ask
about end-of-life arrangements.

474
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,583
Okay, thank you.

475
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,416
Mr. Cheng,
what did you say about your bike?

476
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,166
Something's jammed on my bike.

477
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,666
The brakes seem a little loose too. Look.

478
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,625
I'll have to examine it.

479
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,666
Don't ride with your back like that.

480
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,250
Leave it here.
I'll let you know when it's fixed.

481
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,041
You're right.

482
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,375
Thanks for your help.

483
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,958
- Bye.
- Okay.

484
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:39,041
AN XIN APARTMENT COMPLEX

485
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,375
We're here.

486
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,333
Sir, we've arrived.

487
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,000
Sir, we're here.

488
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,875
- We're at the bus terminal.
- Where…

489
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,083
Where are we?

490
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,875
We're at the bus terminal.

491
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,916
The bus terminal?

492
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,041
Where is An Xin apartment complex?

493
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,916
We already drove past it.

494
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,583
Your back's better? Out for fun already?

495
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,083
It's just a strained back.

496
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,625
If I fall, I'll get back up.

497
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,625
Don't make a big deal out of it.

498
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,708
Where's my stuff? Hey!

499
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,333
- Put on slippers. The floor's dirty.
- Where's my stuff?

500
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,125
Things go where they're supposed to.

501
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,875
Food goes in the kitchen.

502
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,750
Clothes go in the closet.
Trash goes in the bin.

503
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,666
My stuff is always in the same spot.

504
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,541
I'm too old for you to tell me
where to put things.

505
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:31,166
Did you know you left your keys
in the door when you left today?

506
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,416
It's really concerning.

507
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,750
There's nothing to worry about.

508
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,708
You've moved out for so long.

509
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,708
Why do you care all of a sudden?

510
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,958
Don't think I haven't noticed.

511
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,208
You haven't taken your pills.

512
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,333
Nah, I'm not sick. Why would I take pills?

513
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,875
Drunk people always say they're sober.

514
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,208
It's all good…

515
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,291
You always turn nothing into something.

516
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:59,000
Please, if anything happens to you,
I don't have time to take care of you.

517
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,583
Also, I need to tidy this place up.

518
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,000
- Don't take care of me.
- Look at the clutter.

519
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,125
How do you even find anything?

520
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,333
If you're so into tidying,

521
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,291
why don't you tidy up your room?

522
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,041
You left all your junk here
when you moved out.

523
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,375
My place isn't your storage space.

524
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,083
Where's my DV camera?

525
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,250
I threw it out on the balcony.

526
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,166
- You threw it out?
- Yep.

527
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,125
No one uses that model anymore.

528
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,166
Hey!

529
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:33,333
You never throw away anything.
No wonder this place is so cluttered.

530
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,458
Throw things away…
You might as well throw me way too.

531
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,083
I'm telling you one last time.

532
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,333
Don't ever touch my stuff again.

533
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:45,666
Fine.

534
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,250
I won't.

535
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,916
Do you know where I went today?

536
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:08,625
Mr. Tang planned a bike trip
to Wanjinshi with me this weekend.

537
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,083
But he suddenly died.

538
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,541
Hey, did you hear me?

539
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,250
Mr. Tang's dead.

540
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,625
They said he died from a flu shot.

541
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,333
How could someone so healthy
just die like that?

542
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,250
So unpredictable.

543
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,000
Life is so unpredictable.

544
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,916
Change is the only constant.

545
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:43,208
Death caused by flu shots.

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,625
The odds are very slim.

547
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,750
Hey, you didn't…

548
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,833
You didn't hear what I just said.

549
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:54,000
Mr. Chen died from a flu shot.

550
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,000
Was it Mr. Tang or Mr. Chen?

551
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,541
They say they give the body
a spa treatment.

552
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,958
And it costs extra.

553
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,625
The family has to be there.

554
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,375
They asked me to go too.

555
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,708
Why would I go?

556
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,125
I used to go to the sauna with Tang.

557
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,958
Now he's doing the spa alone.

558
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,708
Why would I go?

559
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,208
I want to read it.

560
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,166
WILL

561
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,625
Go for it.

562
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:13,083
WILL WISHES

563
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,500
JIAMING LAKE ALIEN HUNT
CONTACT UFO ASSOCIATION

564
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,791
SNEAK IN LE-LE'S STAND-UP

565
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,500
TAKE A HANDSOME FUNERAL PHOTO

566
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,666
TAKE DRY-CLEANED SUIT AND SWEATER TO LIU'S

567
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,166
This… What…

568
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,708
What is this?

569
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:37,416
People usually cry
when they read their dad's will.

570
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Why the heck would I cry?

571
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,333
"First, Jiaming Lake alien hunt."

572
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,291
"Second, five-day camping."

573
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,875
"Third, repair my bike."

574
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,375
"Fourth, tour Taiwan again."

575
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,708
"Fifth, have Kobe steak."

576
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,916
"Sixth, see Le-le's stand-up sometime."

577
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,500
"Seventh, Tami…"

578
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,041
Wait, why is my stand-up ranked sixth?

579
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:01,083
I'm less important than a steak?
Are you serious?

580
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,875
Shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

581
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,000
You've never invited me
to see your stand-up.

582
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,958
No, 'cause it's awkward
to have you in the audience.

583
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,750
What's so awkward about it?

584
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,375
I gave birth to you.

585
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,708
No, you didn't.

586
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,500
Technically, you only assisted.

587
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,083
At least I did a decent job.

588
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,250
Do you always
say bad things about me on stage?

589
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,208
Let's not get into it.

590
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,500
Okay, here.

591
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,791
"Ninth, take a funeral photo."

592
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,833
You…

593
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:38,541
Don't you think it's a bit too late
to put it in the will?

594
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,833
I wrote it down
because I'm afraid I'll forget.

595
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,958
"Give the dry-cleaned suit to Liu's."

596
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,000
You can give it to him now.
Why just sit here?

597
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:55,166
Don't you think we often end up
not doing the things we want?

598
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,500
This isn't a will.

599
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,125
It's a bucket list.

600
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,458
It's…

601
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,458
Do you really think
a will is for the living?

602
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,083
A will is for the living
to sneak a peek at.

603
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,875
Are you kidding me?
You wrote it for me to peek at?

604
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:17,083
I texted you,
but you never have time to read them,

605
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,250
so I just wrote a will.

606
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,125
I'm your daughter,

607
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,458
not Lalamove or Uber Eats, okay?

608
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,625
Everyone has their own priorities.

609
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,666
Okay, I get it. I'm ranked sixth to you.

610
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,375
If you think I got it wrong,

611
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,791
then show me your will for reference.

612
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,750
What reference?

613
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm not even ready to write a will.

614
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,416
Hey, listen.

615
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,208
You live alone, just like me.

616
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,375
Maybe no one will handle your stuff
when you're gone.

617
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,750
All right, I know.

618
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,083
- You should think about it.
- Okay, I…

619
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,666
What?

620
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,208
You've already read it.

621
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,958
- Hey!
- Mission accomplished.

622
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,708
I'm gonna make instant noodles.
You want some?

623
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,625
I don't like them. I don't want any.

624
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,333
Why can't you remember that?

625
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,375
Suit yourself.

626
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,416
Do you want some watermelon?

627
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,291
I have watermelon in my fridge.

628
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,958
Take some home to Chang Kai.

629
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:24,333
I gotta go.

630
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,916
Hey, stay for dinner.

631
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,958
We can do it tomorrow.

632
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,250
Tomorrow… It's always tomorrow.

633
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,791
Luckily, there's always tomorrow.

634
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,458
<i>Let's take a look at the weather.</i>

635
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,125
<i>Due to the arrival of cold air,</i>

636
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,416
<i>temperatures will start dropping tonight…</i>

637
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,416
Dishes are done.

638
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,708
I'm off now.

639
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,833
<i>In open coastal areas,</i>
<i>it will be even colder,</i>

640
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,833
<i>around 10 to 15 degrees Celsius.</i>
<i>Stay warm when you go out…</i>

641
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,958
You won't find a friend
who'd skip shopping

642
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,458
just to bring you a hot oat milk latte.

643
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:15,875
I prefer iced drinks lately.

644
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,375
You can't have that.
You need some self-care.

645
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,750
You think I have time?

646
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,708
Wow, your skin looks really dry.

647
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,208
Come on, your hand.

648
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,125
I really need this.

649
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,458
- Yeah.
- My skin's been way too dry lately.

650
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,541
Rub it on your neck.

651
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,708
Like this.

652
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,666
You're going without makeup?

653
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,500
I have makeup on.

654
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,458
That's so well done.

655
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,958
I could hardly tell.

656
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:42,625
- Take this. It's good for your face too.
- Thanks.

657
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,875
Who is dying?

658
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,208
Have you written a will?

659
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,041
Come on.

660
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,125
Why would you ask something so insulting?

661
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,333
Of course I have.

662
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,958
You're way crazier than I thought.

663
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,875
Wait, have you seen this?

664
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,666
Will generator.

665
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,583
What is this?

666
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,166
Look. Fill in your basic information.

667
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,375
And here, funeral and burial arrangements,

668
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,541
asset distribution, it's all there.

669
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,625
You're serious.

670
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,583
I didn't take it too seriously.

671
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,500
Just in case the company asks me
to arrange euthanasia trips.

672
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:23,208
So that trip to Switzerland
you planned a few years ago,

673
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:24,833
was that for fieldwork?

674
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,541
Yeah, kind of.

675
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:30,583
I think that death should be something
we choose for ourselves.

676
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,375
You're worrying too much.

677
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,083
I'm just planning ahead.

678
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,250
You have your family.

679
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,166
If anything does happen to you,

680
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,708
they'll definitely offer
all sorts of advice.

681
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,125
As for me,

682
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,416
I am all alone.

683
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:49,750
I need to sort things out myself.

684
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,875
Your parents live abroad.

685
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,958
You talk like they've passed away.

686
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,000
But they can't handle my funeral.

687
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,625
Listen.

688
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,791
You gotta organize stuff
like your Facebook,

689
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,708
your computer, and your ATM passwords,

690
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,375
so someone can handle them.

691
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,583
You still have us.

692
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,166
Do I really?

693
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,416
What do you mean?

694
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:17,208
How many people actually
have someone around when they need them?

695
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,416
<i>That's true.</i>

696
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,083
<i>Single people should only fear loneliness,</i>
<i>not the hassle.</i>

697
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:29,375
<i>Because no one needs to be responsible</i>
<i>for someone else's life.</i>

698
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:52,666
<i>I'm actually not sure</i>
<i>if my dad really has dementia,</i>

699
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,250
or if he has simply gone crazy.

700
00:42:56,916 --> 00:43:00,958
He just finished his will last week.

701
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,375
He wrote a will

702
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,041
and asked me
to take funeral photos with him.

703
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,208
When I read his will,

704
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:13,458
I wondered if he wrote it
during an episode of dementia.

705
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,708
It was a list of things like…

706
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,708
Go to Kobe for steak.

707
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,125
Look for aliens at Jiaming Lake.

708
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,833
I was like, "This isn't a will."

709
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,958
"It's a bucket list."

710
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,166
Just call it "A memo for my daughter."

711
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,500
How about that?

712
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:35,333
So he wrote his will
the same way I used to write in my diary.

713
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,458
They were written for people to snoop on.

714
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:42,958
You know? I used to write
stuff like this in my diary, "October 2nd,

715
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,291
sunny Sunday."

716
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,500
"The weather was great today."

717
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,875
"I just wanted to stay home and study."

718
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:55,166
Then the next day,
I'd see my dad wrote "A+" on it.

719
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,291
I caught him reading my diary.

720
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,583
Here's a math question.

721
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,208
If you're 40 now,

722
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:09,166
how much more time
do you think you have with your parents?

723
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,916
If you only share a meal together
once a month.

724
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,208
Assuming your parents are healthy
and could live to their eighties.

725
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,000
Take a guess.

726
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:22,875
How much time is left to spend with them?

727
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,916
Come home early if you're tired.

728
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,625
Tomorrow's another day.

729
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,916
<i>The answer is 15 days.</i>

730
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,625
<i>There's only 15 days left.</i>

731
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,916
<i>And in these 15 days,</i>

732
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,666
<i>by the time you notice it,</i>

733
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,791
<i>they will have aged uncontrollably</i>

734
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,000
<i>until they can no longer</i>
<i>make decisions for themselves.</i>

735
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,500
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

736
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,416
Can you please
take a photo of me with this tree?

737
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,833
A photo? Sure. Okay.

738
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:08,833
Vertical?

739
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,333
- Yeah, vertical.
- Okay.

740
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,083
Can you get it all?

741
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,166
- This…
- The whole tree?

742
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,125
- Yeah, get the top of the tree too.
- Okay.

743
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,333
Look here, one, two, three.

744
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,833
So do I have to decide right now?

745
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:22,958
Because the cost…

746
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:23,958
About the cost,

747
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:28,000
once you confirm with your dad,
we can discuss it with the hospital.

748
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,916
Thank you.

749
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,291
But… Doctor,

750
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,791
I don't think my dad realizes he's sick.

751
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,916
That's why
your judgment and decisions are crucial.

752
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,125
Ms. Cheng,
you might want to be mentally prepared.

753
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,750
Your dad's cognition will deteriorate.

754
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,666
In the end, you might be
the only person who can decide.

755
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,333
So the sooner you figure it out,

756
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,791
the better it might be for the patient.

757
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,500
