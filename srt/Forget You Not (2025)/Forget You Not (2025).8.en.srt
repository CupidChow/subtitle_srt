1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,291
I'm his daughter.

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,166
Yes… I can't make it today,

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,541
but his caregiver will take him there.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,916
Could you please wait a bit longer for us?

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,250
Of course,
I know doctors need to rest too.

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,416
I'm really sorry.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,333
Sorry, just a second.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,208
Hey, sorry. His caregiver is calling.

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,416
I'll call you right back. Thank you.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,458
Yani, where are you?

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,916
Why are you in Zhongli?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,125
Didn't I tell you last week…

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,958
Yani, listen.

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,166
It's okay.
I'll take him to the hospital now.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,833
Once you're in Taipei,
go straight to the hospital, okay?

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,583
Yes, okay. Bye-bye.

17
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,458
Can't she go to the hospital alone?

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,500
We're going to the hospital now.

19
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,166
Who's "we"?

20
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,833
You look so tired.

21
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,291
I'm fine.

22
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,666
I mean it, yeah.

23
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,000
You need someone to look after you.

24
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,458
I'm grown up now.
I can take care of myself.

25
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,916
However grown up you are,
you should be looked after.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,916
Thank you.

27
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:32,333
IF YOU FORGET
I WILL REMEMBER IT ALL FOR YOU

28
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,291
Nini, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,208
He's inside.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
Cheng Le-le.

31
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,250
This is the third time in two weeks.

32
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,458
Do you still want to work here?

33
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,416
If you can,
get someone to take your shift.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,958
But you can't,
so your coworkers have to cover for you.

35
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,416
How is this okay?

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,708
Sir, I'm really sorry.

37
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,791
I feel bad for Nini too. I have no excuse.

38
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,166
Something came up
unexpectedly today, so I--

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,833
Hold on.
You also said that the last two times.

40
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,916
I really don't know… I don't know
if I should let you keep this job.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,541
Sir, please.
Give me another chance. I'll work hard.

42
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,250
Because my dad had to
go to the hospital today and…

43
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,125
Something came up,
but I've asked a caregiver for help.

44
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,500
So please give me another chance. I will…

45
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,291
I really need this job. I--

46
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,625
Jeez,

47
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,041
why do I have to deal with
your personal issues?

48
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,416
Do I have to tell you what to do next?

49
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,458
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,166
Sir, I'm off now.

51
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,083
Bye.

52
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,750
- Remember to pay me double for my hours.
- Okay.

53
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,458
- Hello.
- Good morning. Thank you.

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,250
<i>I'm not a mom to any child,</i>

55
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,583
<i>but I've ended up mothering my dad.</i>

56
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,875
Here.

57
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,541
Fine. You're not eating?

58
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,125
If you don't eat,
thunder and lightning will strike.

59
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:52,708
WEDNESDAY, ORDER DIAPERS AND PADS ONLINE
5:00 P.M. NIGHT SHIFT

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,416
Hello? I'm the family of room 223. Yes.

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,333
You're a ghost.

62
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,875
Keep it down. I'm on the phone.

63
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,291
- No. Rock, paper…
- Rock…

64
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,166
Yes, I'd like to ask if my parents

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,541
are doing well lately.

67
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,333
I understand.

68
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,625
It must have been too dry.
Their skin itched, so they scratched it.

69
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, you guys are great.

70
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,875
You're attentive and professional.
I'm really grateful.

71
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,875
<i>Please take good care of them.</i>

72
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,875
<i>Okay. I'll try to visit them soon.</i>

73
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
<i>Probably next month, yeah.</i>

74
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,708
Here.

75
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,083
You don't want water?

76
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,416
You've been drinking
very little water lately.

77
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,750
Your lips are chapped.

78
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,916
I can't see things up close now.

79
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,416
Let me moisten your lips.

80
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:08,583
I received the insurance policy slip
that you bought over 40 years ago.

81
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,875
Looks like you cashed out most of it,

82
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,000
so there's not much left.

83
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,875
They wanted me to deal with it, but

84
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,666
they need your signature.

85
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,291
Don't blame me for this.

86
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,041
I signed it for you.

87
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,666
You know,
I'm good at copying your signature.

88
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,875
My teachers never noticed
that I copied your signature.

89
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:41,125
By the way, Chang Kai asked
if I'd go to Singapore with him.

90
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,708
Do I want to go with him?

91
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,083
I'm telling you, of course, I do.

92
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,291
But I can't.

93
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,750
I know you'd tell me

94
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,875
not to worry about you and just go.

95
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,833
Right?

96
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,500
Well, I'll admit, I did consider

97
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,541
leaving you behind.

98
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,791
Sometimes,

99
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,583
I don't know if I'm taking care of you
out of responsibility or guilt.

100
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,791
I'm actually…

101
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,125
I'm actually exhausted.

102
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,000
But I feel so bad for you.

103
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,583
You know what?

104
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,625
Sometimes,

105
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,916
I feel like you're a handful of sand.
It's as if…

106
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,250
It's as if I can hold you in my hand,

107
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,875
but if I loosen my grip,
you'll slip right through my fingers.

108
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,208
Do you get what I mean?

109
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,625
You know I hate it when you call my name.

110
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,791
But it's been a while.
Can you call my name?

111
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,875
Cheng Le-le.

112
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,291
Cheng Le-le.

113
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,666
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm not whining but…

114
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,125
I'm just a bit tired.

115
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,791
I'm repeating the same chores every day.

116
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,875
Can you tell me if you'll get better?

117
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Will everything get better?

118
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,583
Frankly, I'm terrified.

119
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,166
I'm afraid you'll pass away suddenly.

120
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,833
But what frightens me more

121
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,583
is you hanging on like this.

122
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,958
I'm a bad daughter. I'm sorry.

123
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,666
Hit me…

124
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
Just hit me.

125
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,500
Yes. Ms. Huang is on leave today.

126
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,583
I'll check her desk for the info.

127
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,833
Sure. I'll call you back. Bye.

128
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,916
Where's Su-fei?

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She takes this day off every year.

130
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,541
The pitch is next week. Are you all done?

131
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,250
Yes, we've planned
a cosmetic surgery package for besties.

132
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,833
And we've contacted a few beauty clinics.

133
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,083
I'll finish up
this weekend and report to you.

134
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,958
Taking time off before the work's done?

135
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,708
I've had enough of veterans.

136
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,250
Hello?

137
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,125
Ms. Chen. Yes, she did.

138
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
Okay, I'll send it to you later.

139
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,583
Okay, no problem.

140
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,583
FAMILY DAY

141
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,833
I know you don't like sweets.

142
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,458
But this is the Hokkaido cream roll cake.

143
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,250
It's worth a try.

144
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,833
Strawberries from Hokkaido.

145
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,541
It feels ceremonial, right?

146
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,041
Everyone's into camping these days.

147
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:33,416
IN MEMORY OF
HUANG WEI-CHENG, CHUNG HSIN-HUEI

148
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,916
Dad, Mom,

149
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,625
how are you?

150
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,833
I'm okay.

151
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,708
I'm just a bit tired.

152
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,791
I spent New Year's
in Hokkaido again this year.

153
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,416
Of course,

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,708
I had New Year's Eve dinner alone.

155
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,666
Guess what my favorite moment was?

156
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,750
When I sent the tourists
into the restaurant for dinner.

157
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,750
Wow, in that split second…

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
everything went quiet.

159
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,208
I could almost hear
the snow falling on the ground.

160
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,500
They found me pitiful,

161
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,083
but I felt carefree.

162
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,666
There's no need…

163
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,041
No need
for New Year greetings and small talk,

164
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,250
like wishing everyone good wealth.

165
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,916
I still haven't told Le-le and Chia-yun

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,333
that you passed away in a car accident.

167
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,791
I know it's not right of me
to keep such a secret from my besties.

168
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,500
But I don't want them to pity me.

169
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,541
I'm afraid to be consoled.

170
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
I know what they'd say to me.

171
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,791
Lies are sometimes just like wishes.

172
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,583
The longer you've lied,
the more you buy into them.

173
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,250
I believe you're still alive

174
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,791
and you're just living elsewhere.

175
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,166
Dad, Mom.

176
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,041
I miss you so much.

177
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,041
But I can't seem to remember
what you looked like.

178
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,750
I'll do my best to remember.

179
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,125
You're home from work?

180
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,041
Dad.

181
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,875
How did you get back on your feet?

182
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,208
Take your jacket off.
We're having noodles soon.

183
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,708
Hurry and go wash up.

184
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,291
Then come out for dinner.

185
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,500
Go and wash up now.

186
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,833
Dad.

187
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,166
Dad.

188
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,708
Dad.

189
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,375
I'M CHENG KUANG-CHI. I'M 77.
MY DAUGHTER IS CHENG LE-LE.

190
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,708
<i>Mr. Cheng keeps getting hospitalized</i>

191
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,666
<i>because of pneumonia from choking.</i>

192
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,208
<i>Each time there's inflammation,</i>
<i>it could lead to other complications.</i>

193
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,000
<i>We suggest</i>
<i>placing a nasal feeding tube for now.</i>

194
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,125
<i>But he said</i>
<i>he doesn't want to be intubated.</i>

195
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,291
<i>A nasal feeding tube isn't intubation.</i>
<i>It gives him enough nutrition.</i>

196
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,125
<i>It also prevents him from choking</i>
<i>and suffocating or going into shock again.</i>

197
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,500
Dad, I'm sorry.

198
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
<i>Do it this way.</i>

199
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,000
- Release it faster, it drips faster.
- Okay.

200
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,291
So we tie it like this
to slow down the flow.

201
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,250
Otherwise, it'd fill with air
and his stomach would feel very bloated.

202
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,458
<i>One, two, three.</i>

203
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,250
- Nod.
- Nod.

204
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,583
Here, try harder.

205
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,541
Good job, Dad.

206
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,958
Okay. Hold it up.

207
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,708
Good.

208
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,916
Mr. Cheng.

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,375
- Cheng Kuang-chi.
- Okay.

210
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,791
- Sorry.
- How about we get the pillow?

211
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,000
- Okay.
- Here, I got you.

212
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,458
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

213
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,416
It feels better to be home, right?

214
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>Cheng Kuang-chi.</i>

215
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,333
Cheng Kuang-chi.

216
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,375
I'm your daughter, Cheng Le-le.

217
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,666
I'm your daughter, Cheng Le-le.

218
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,791
You took this in Spain.

219
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,583
And you brought me…

220
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,708
I think it was a teddy bear?
I still have it.

221
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,583
You were in the States.

222
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,541
I've always liked this photo.

223
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,833
You were good-looking as a young man.

224
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:38,250
I remember how my classmates
used to say, "Your dad is so handsome!"

225
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,541
But I think you aged like fine wine.

226
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,791
Look, our family photo.

227
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,166
Who is this kid?

228
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,791
Cheng Le-le.

229
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,333
Who is Cheng Le-le?

230
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,458
Me.

231
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,166
See? Told you it was blue.

232
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,250
The first bike you got me.

233
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,833
LE-LE'S FIRST SUMMER BREAK
AFTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

234
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,916
<i>Can you not send me away?</i>

235
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,958
I'm not sending you away.

236
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,291
I'm just worried
no one's looking after you.

237
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,833
Hey, it's going to rain soon.
Let's go home.

238
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,333
Did she tell you

239
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,541
why she left us?

240
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,750
<i>- Dad, don't let go.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

241
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,583
- Dad, please don't let go.
- Wait.

242
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,500
Hello?

243
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,458
<i>I couldn't reach you these days.</i>
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

244
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:34,875
<i>How's your dad?</i>

245
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,666
<i>Is he okay?</i>

246
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,708
He's gone.

247
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,958
<i>Where did he go?</i>

248
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,583
<i>Where are you?</i>

249
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,750
<i>I'll come see you.</i>

250
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,333
You don't have to.

251
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,500
I'm okay.

252
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:57,458
I got to spend
the last two days with him quietly.

253
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,833
I think it was quite nice.

254
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,833
This is bound to happen, right?

255
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,833
Don't worry.

256
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,750
That's all for now.

257
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,041
Ma'am, here's
the death certificate you requested.

258
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:45,833
DEATH CERTIFICATE

259
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,500
Hi, I'd like to remove him
from the household register.

260
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,750
- Hello?
<i>- Ms. Cheng, good news.</i>

261
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,958
<i>We have a foreign caregiver</i>
<i>ready to start next week.</i>

262
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,708
I don't need one anymore. Thanks.

263
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,916
Hello, what's up?

264
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,250
<i>My mother-in-law</i>
<i>is taking the kids to the south.</i>

265
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,958
<i>You… Why don't I come over?</i>

266
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,125
<i>Or should I bring you something?</i>

267
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,583
It's okay. You don't have to.

268
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,333
<i>You must have a lot to handle.</i>

269
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,583
<i>I'll be there in half an hour.</i>

270
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,375
It's really okay.

271
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,875
I'm just wondering
what to do with my dad's belongings.

272
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,083
Hey, I finally understand

273
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,541
why my dad couldn't throw stuff away.

274
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,833
Hey, Lin Chia-yun, I get it.

275
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:11,250
I've realized that the 49-day ritual

276
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,166
is actually to keep the family busy
doing pointless stuff.

277
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,041
But my dad

278
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,041
already had his living funeral.

279
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,125
I don't know what to do now.

280
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,375
TO LE-LE, DON'T THROW IT AWAY

281
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,250
<i>I'm not sure if it'll work.</i>

282
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,833
<i>Oh well, let's give it a shot.</i>

283
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,500
<i>I'm not sure if it'll work.</i>

284
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,083
<i>Oh well, let's give it a shot.</i>

285
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,625
<i>It's your mom's tree burial today.</i>

286
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,791
You were right.

287
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,458
Your mom didn't leave you anything.

288
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,375
<i>So I thought</i>

289
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,291
<i>I'd record a few words for you every day.</i>

290
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,708
<i>One day, when I'm gone,</i>

291
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,833
<i>you'll have these recordings</i>

292
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,958
<i>and you won't be so lonely, right?</i>

293
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,375
<i>Isn't this idea pretty cool?</i>

294
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,333
<i>You must be rolling your eyes now, right?</i>

295
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,375
<i>That's much better than crying, right?</i>

296
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,500
<i>Right?</i>

297
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,833
<i>Let's see. What else should I say?</i>

298
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,458
<i>Oh, right.</i>

299
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,125
<i>When you walked me home from the hospital,</i>

300
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,625
<i>didn't you ask me what you said as a kid?</i>

301
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,916
<i>Your mom and I just split up.</i>

302
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:06,458
At that time,
you didn't speak for six months.

303
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,500
You wouldn't talk, so I kept talking.

304
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,458
You were quiet. I'd talk.

305
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:16,083
One day, you suddenly started talking.

306
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,541
What did I say?

307
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,125
<i>You said</i>

308
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,708
<i>you wanted a map of the States.</i>

309
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:25,000
<i>That's the one in your room.</i>

310
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,416
When you get old,

311
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,750
you forget what happened yesterday,

312
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:38,291
but you remember
everything in the past so clearly.

313
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>Well…</i>

314
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,750
<i>I forgot what I was going to say.</i>

315
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,583
<i>That's all for today.</i>

316
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,250
<i>The first episode is shorter.</i>

317
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,916
<i>Bye.</i>

318
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,083
<i>Will this work?</i>

319
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,291
<i>Let me take a look.</i>

320
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,541
<i>Listen.</i>

321
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,916
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>most of the people in my phone contacts.</i>

322
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,208
<i>I've forgotten who they are.</i>

323
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:11,750
<i>So don't worry about them when I'm gone.</i>

324
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:16,000
<i>However, the people in this notebook</i>
<i>are very important.</i>

325
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,833
<i>They are friends who helped me</i>

326
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:22,583
<i>when I was a sailor.</i>

327
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,958
<i>After I'm gone,</i>

328
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:28,208
<i>make sure to thank them.</i>

329
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,875
<i>Thank them properly and tell them</i>

330
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,750
<i>not to join me too soon.</i>

331
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,500
<i>I'm scouting ahead first, okay?</i>

332
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,416
Bonjour.

333
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,708
In Hungary.

334
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,958
- It's also "bonjour."
- It's amazing in Madrid.

335
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,333
- Anywhere is fine…
- Hi, gorgeous.

336
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,333
- Here you are.
- Hey.

337
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,375
Let's take a photo.

338
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:52,291
<i>I bet Chia-yun and Su-fei</i>
<i>will come and console you.</i>

339
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,166
<i>Be sure to cherish them.</i>

340
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:57,166
<i>Or you'll be lonely when you're old.</i>

341
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>Although none of my friends know</i>
<i>what stand-up comedy is,</i>

342
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:14,208
<i>I told them what you're doing is amazing.</i>

343
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,833
<i>Because it's hard enough</i>

344
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:19,125
<i>to cheer yourself up,</i>

345
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,125
<i>let alone make others laugh.</i>

346
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,833
<i>Le-le,</i>

347
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,958
<i>I think you're awesome.</i>

348
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,125
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

349
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,625
Look.

350
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,083
These Spring Couplets

351
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,208
<i>will last you till you're 80.</i>

352
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,208
<i>Well? Don't I look good?</i>

353
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,208
<i>Nice, right?</i>

354
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,250
You bought it at Sincere.

355
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,083
<i>You should be here soon.</i>

356
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,791
<i>You finally have some time today.</i>

357
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,625
<i>Oh, right. Let me tell you.</i>

358
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,500
<i>This box of food…</i>

359
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,125
<i>Take this home with you, okay?</i>

360
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,416
<i>Don't eat out all the time.</i>
<i>That's unhealthy.</i>

361
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,916
<i>Hey.</i>

362
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,208
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

363
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,416
<i>Hello?</i>

364
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,083
<i>Le-le.</i>

365
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:32,750
<i>Okay.</i>

366
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:34,583
<i>All right.</i>

367
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,291
<i>You're busy, so just go ahead.</i>

368
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,208
<i>It's okay. Don't worry.</i>

369
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,208
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

370
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,625
<i>Jeez.</i>

371
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,375
<i>Who is the unreliable one now?</i>

372
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,416
<i>Turns out</i>

373
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,791
<i>someone is more unreliable than me.</i>

374
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,958
<i>Am I right?</i>

375
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:57,125
<i>You said you're free to eat out with me</i>
<i>and have a good chat today.</i>

376
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:01,541
<i>But young people always</i>
<i>put their own stuff before their parents'.</i>

377
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,708
I'm sorry.

378
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:06,416
<i>When we were young,</i>
<i>we did the same to our parents.</i>

379
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,250
<i>"Third, repair my bike."</i>

380
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,958
<i>"Fourth, tour Taiwan again."</i>

381
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,375
<i>"Fifth, have Kobe steak."</i>

382
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,875
<i>"Sixth, see Le-le's stand-up sometime."</i>

383
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:24,416
<i>Wait, why is my stand-up ranked sixth?</i>

384
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,625
<i>I'm ranked below a steak?</i>

385
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,916
<i>Are you serious?</i>

386
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,291
<i>Shouldn't you reflect on yourself?</i>

387
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,666
<i>You've never invited me</i>
<i>to see your stand-up.</i>

388
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,833
I'm sorry.

389
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,583
<i>No, 'cause it's awkward</i>
<i>to have you in the audience.</i>

390
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,708
<i>What's so awkward about it?</i>

391
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,250
<i>I gave birth to you.</i>

392
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,333
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

393
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,666
<i>I might seem laid-back now,</i>

394
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,708
<i>but I worked really hard when I was young.</i>

395
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,500
<i>I saved my sailing money</i>
<i>to buy us a house.</i>

396
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,500
<i>I wanted a home</i>

397
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:00,208
<i>so I could be with you for a long time</i>
<i>and always be there for you, right?</i>

398
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,333
<i>Yes.</i>

399
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,083
<i>I know</i>

400
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,208
<i>that I'm very forgetful now.</i>

401
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,291
<i>But I don't like it</i>

402
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:22,375
<i>when you keep bringing up dementia.</i>

403
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,416
<i>Who doesn't grow old?</i>
<i>Who doesn't become forgetful?</i>

404
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,166
<i>One day when I'm gone,</i>

405
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,875
<i>you'll probably cry for a few days, right?</i>

406
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,041
<i>Then slowly,</i>

407
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,833
<i>you'll move on</i>

408
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,291
<i>and live a normal life.</i>

409
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,125
<i>Perhaps</i>

410
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,833
<i>you'll gradually forget me too.</i>

411
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,541
<i>I have to pee now.</i>

412
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:51,500
<i>Just bury me next to your mom.</i>

413
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,291
<i>But</i>

414
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,041
<i>leave a little space between us.</i>

415
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:06,583
<i>I'm worried she might</i>
<i>run away from home again.</i>

416
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,416
Sure, okay.

417
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
I'll send you the slides. Yeah.

418
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,666
Okay, thank you.

419
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,000
Good night. Bye-bye.

420
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:43,208
Su-fei, I've negotiated a good price
with Perfect Body Beauty Clinic.

421
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,625
- Ken…
- If it's 20…

422
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,250
Oh no.

423
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,416
How about
we drop this beauty clinic project

424
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:53,625
to promote the seniors' LOHAS tour?

425
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,125
I can't hear you.

426
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,541
Don't you think
our society is unfriendly to the elderly?

427
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,666
They are left to fend for themselves.

428
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,625
But they also want to travel.

429
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,041
Someone should plan tours for them.

430
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,750
If I had the money,
I'd rather join a cosmetic surgery tour

431
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,625
and make myself look 28 again.

432
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,041
You're not listening to me.

433
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,166
Su-fei, you're not listening to me.

434
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,500
You might be my boss,
but I have to say this.

435
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,291
What have we been working overtime for?

436
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,833
So we can pitch tomorrow and nail it.

437
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:25,041
Don't you dare sabotage…

438
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,958
What a beautiful sound.

439
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,333
<i>Tonight,</i>

440
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:40,375
<i>a friend that we haven't seen for ages</i>
<i>has returned.</i>

441
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:44,291
How many unlucky stories
has she saved up to tell us?

442
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,708
Let us welcome

443
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,875
Cheng Le-le!

444
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:52,875
Cheng Le-le.

445
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,500
Hi.

446
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,708
Le-le!

447
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,833
Hi, everyone. I'm Cheng Le-le.

448
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,875
How are you?

449
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,000
- Good!
- Great!

450
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,958
A kind-hearted friend of mine got fired

451
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,791
because he offered his seat

452
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,958
to an elderly person on the bus.

453
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,416
Do you know why?

454
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,625
- Why?
- Why?

455
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,083
Because he was the driver.

456
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,291
It's not funny.

457
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,875
My dad told me this lame joke.

458
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:26,875
He doubled over laughing after telling it.

459
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:29,916
All I could think was, "Oh no."

460
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,791
I might never make it big
as a stand-up comedian.

461
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,625
Because it's in my genes, you know.

462
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,833
Speaking of my dad,

463
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,791
he passed away recently.

464
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:44,833
All right. Some of you look stunned.

465
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:48,583
Okay. Let me put it in a nicer way.

466
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,875
My dad has gone home.

467
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,208
Yeah.

468
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,708
I believe you know which home I meant.

469
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:55,958
That "home."

470
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,250
Not this one.

471
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,625
He'd come here in seven days
for the "first seven" ritual.

472
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,250
When my grandma passed away,
my dad told me,

473
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,166
"Le-le,

474
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,458
Grandma is asleep."

475
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,166
So I said,

476
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,916
"What? But Grandma has slept for so long."

477
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,500
"I'm going to wake her up."

478
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,666
My dad quickly said, "Le-le, wait."

479
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:21,416
"Grandma…"

480
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,375
"She's in heaven now."

481
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,000
When I heard that, I replied,

482
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,166
"Why?"

483
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,958
"That's so nice. Why didn't she take me?"

484
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:35,875
There was no perfect way to explain

485
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:39,166
the concept of death to a kid

486
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,875
who just attended a funeral.

487
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,041
Before my dad passed away,

488
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,166
he turned into a child.

489
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:54,041
It was exhausting
to look after a very old child.

490
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:57,958
I always thought
he needed me and relied on me.

491
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,458
It was only after his death
that I realized

492
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:03,208
I was the one who needed him.

493
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,958
Just like how I thought
I didn't have to come here

494
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,916
because the world of stand-up
doesn't need Cheng Le-le.

495
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,708
But after my dad died,

496
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,958
I realized
this is the one place I want to be.

497
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,333
Because for Cheng Le-le,

498
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,541
she can't live without comedy.

499
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:21,666
I need you.

500
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,125
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not asking for sympathy.

501
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,958
I'm a very lucky person.

502
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:32,541
I have

503
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,125
those who love me

504
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,875
and those who I love.

505
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,958
And anyone who's heard
my bits about my dad should know

506
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,208
just how annoying my dad was.

507
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:47,250
It's not just his lame jokes, gosh.

508
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,083
Have you ever met a dad
who only cooked instant noodles?

509
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,375
- Hey.
- Dad.

510
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,833
Hey, Le-le, have some noodles.

511
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:01,583
Have some noodles.

512
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:03,041
- No, I gotta go.
- Come on.

513
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm running late.

514
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:04,916
Have…

515
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,416
<i>Hello, Le-le?</i>

516
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,083
Okay, you're busy?

517
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,625
Then go do your thing. It's okay.

518
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,583
Okay. Bye-bye.

519
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:27,750
<i>He was always biking everywhere.</i>

520
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,250
<i>Always out and about.</i>

521
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,916
<i>What's more, he believed in aliens.</i>

522
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:42,291
<i>My dad used to say if the sky falls,</i>
<i>the taller people would hold it up.</i>

523
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,291
<i>But just a month ago,</i>

524
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,250
<i>that taller man collapsed.</i>

525
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:53,541
<i>And I realized I didn't have</i>
<i>what it takes to hold the sky up.</i>

526
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,750
<i>I admit I was a bit angry.</i>

527
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,416
He lied to me.

528
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,875
I was seriously angry.

529
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,791
Then I realized, I was angry at myself.

530
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,583
How could I believe
that he'd always be here for me?

531
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:13,125
How could I be so naive
to think that I could be

532
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,625
his little girl forever?

533
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,458
<i>There are things,</i>

534
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:23,666
<i>no matter how long</i>
<i>you might have prepared for it,</i>

535
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,583
<i>it doesn't make you</i>
<i>any less sad when it happens.</i>

536
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,125
<i>Hello? I have a question.</i>

537
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:35,125
I heard that people stay warm
for a while after they died.

538
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,791
I'm worried that he might feel cold now.

539
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,541
Do you think he'd feel cold?

540
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,333
I should have brought him a jacket.

541
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,250
This month, I finally figured it out.

542
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,916
It's fine even if I can't hold the sky up.

543
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,708
It's okay because there are

544
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,375
aliens.

545
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,458
What the heck?

546
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,458
What a lame punchline.

547
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,333
This radio

548
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,916
was my dad's way of communicating

549
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
with the aliens.

550
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,500
My dad often said that nowadays,

551
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,583
people don't fix things.
They just toss them.

552
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:24,291
Back in their days,
they fixed everything that was broken. So…

553
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,666
I've fixed your radio, Dad.

554
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,666
I'll keep searching for aliens.

555
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,041
Go, Le-le.

556
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,083
Go, Le-le.

557
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,041
- Go, Le-le.
- We're here with you.

558
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,583
You can do it.

559
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,041
Sometimes,

560
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,625
people eventually get forgotten.

561
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,125
But I have to say,

562
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,458
my dad was such a show-off,

563
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,833
so if anyone still remembers him,

564
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,833
I'm sure he'll be overjoyed.

565
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,166
Perhaps by doing so,

566
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,208
he can be remembered

567
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,625
forever.

568
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:15,875
Right?

569
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,500
So,

570
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,791
what I want to say is,

571
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,125
Dad,

572
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,291
as long as I get to perform on stage,

573
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:35,958
I'll keep exploiting you.

574
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,500
You can't do anything about it, can you?

575
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,416
What? What did you say?

576
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,583
I can't hear you.

577
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,166
<i>It's okay if you forgot.</i>

578
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,500
<i>I'll remember.</i>

579
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,291
<i>As long as I keep talking about you,</i>

580
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,750
<i>I believe I won't forget you.</i>

581
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,375
<i>I'll keep going…</i>

582
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,041
<i>until I also start forgetting.</i>

583
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:54,208
