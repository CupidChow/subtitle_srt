[Episode 15]

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,560
What are you doing?

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,870
What are you doing?

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,840
I thought you were jumping
off the ledge!

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,430
You scared me!

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,480
I thought you were
pushing me off the ledge!

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
Are you all right?

9
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,560
I was enjoying my music.

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,070
I'm glad you're all right.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,640
Were you tailing me?

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't try to console me.

13
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,870
I don't need that from you.

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,470
No, I wasn't consoling you.

15
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
If you can come here

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
when you feel down,

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
why can't I be here as well?

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Be reasonable.

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,630
What's on your mind?

20
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,560
Everyone at our age

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
has something to worry about.

22
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,190
I just realized

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,590
that I know nothing

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,000
except studying.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
I used to think that falling for someone

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,590
was like studying for an exam,

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,710
that hard work

28
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,680
and determination

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,430
would get me what I wanted.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,870
But I realized that wasn't the case.

31
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,000
I understood that

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,590
much sooner than you did.

33
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,030
This subject is too complicated for me.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
I give up.

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,120
I quit.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,630
I surrender.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,630
Give it a try.

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,800
What?

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Tossing stones.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,590
See if it helps lift the mood.

41
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,400
Does it work?

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,840
You won't know until you try.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Do as I do.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,910
Use the force of your upper arm

45
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,240
and aim far.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,030
That went pretty far.

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,680
Try it out.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,400
When can I move on?

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,360
I didn't do that anyway.

50
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,400
To me,

51
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,240
moving on isn't that important.

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,910
I like her,

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,470
so keeping her company,

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,750
becoming her friend,

55
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,800
and slowly getting closer

56
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,680
is all that I ask!

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,080
That was impressive!

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,680
Try again.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,710
The sound it makes is pretty soothing.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,590
Aim far!

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,240
Is the ceiling leaking?

62
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,560
An umbrella from Jiang Yi?

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,920
He found it on the street.

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
And you believe him?

65
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,510
Huang Yingzi.

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,070
Muster your courage.

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
I have an announcement to make.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,190
I don't like Jiang Yi anymore.

69
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,680
Why?

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm applying
to the university in Beijing.

71
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,470
With his lousy grades,

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,630
he will never make it.

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,270
I thought it through.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
We are never meant to be.

75
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,800
Does that mean

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,870
you can move on so easily?

77
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,870
Tell me.

78
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,950
Would you like him if you knew

79
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,120
you two never had a future?

80
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,600
See?

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,360
That alone

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,430
makes me quit.

83
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,390
Why should I be part of a race

84
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm destined to lose?

85
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,040
But I'm not sure

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
if he likes me or not.

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,270
Tickets to the movie tonight.

88
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,270
Watch it with him.

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,630
What now?

90
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
I was supposed to watch it with you.

91
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,750
Just say it to his face.

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,630
"Let's watch a movie together."

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,950
This is a romance movie.

94
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,480
If he goes with you,

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
you'll get the answer.

96
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,830
What?

97
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,920
Listen,

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I didn't quit because of you.

99
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,600
Do I look like

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
someone who would pull punches

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
in this kind of thing?

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,560
A man as prideful as Jiang Yi

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,680
will not be conquered so easily.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,800
It's up to you to defend
the dignity of the women

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,000
in Hangtian City.

106
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't just nod at me.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,190
Stand up.

108
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,070
Look at me.

109
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,390
See any changes?

110
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,750
Where are you going at this hour?

111
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,750
I'm going to Mingyu's place to study.

112
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,190
Come home early!

113
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,920
She never

114
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,310
stops worrying me.

115
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,360
Huang Yingzi?

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,630
It's not raining.

117
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,830
What's the umbrella for?

118
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,720
Jiang Yi.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,630
What the...

120
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,040
What was that for?

121
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,630
But...

122
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,920
Madam, what got into you tonight?

123
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,480
Well...

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,270
Sorry about that.

125
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,360
I didn't mean it.

126
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,070
What's wrong?

127
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,750
Well...

128
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,950
Do I not look good with the makeup?

129
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,550
It's hard to tell.

130
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,720
You don't know anything.

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,320
This is the most trendy

132
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
women's fashion.

133
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,550
People want to look
like ghosts nowadays?

134
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,360
Ghosts?

135
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,030
You're the scary one here!

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,510
Forget it.

137
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,120
You wouldn't get it.

138
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:52,790
All right,

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,390
back to business.

140
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,910
I thought you never
liked romance movies.

141
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,960
Why did you agree to come?

142
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,630
I had nothing better to do.

143
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,670
I thought you could use the company.

144
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,630
Some ground rules.

145
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,080
No popcorn

146
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
when we watch the movie.

147
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes.

148
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
I've lost

149
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
the appetite anyway.

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,200
I mean...

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,440
Can I drink the beverage?

152
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,790
Yes.

153
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,000
Good.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
At least Zhuang Yuan
didn't come to starve.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,240
How is Zhuang Yuan part of this?

156
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,670
Where are the others?

157
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,750
Just the three of us?

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,150
You...

159
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,870
What's wrong with your face?

160
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,510
What's so funny?

161
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,670
Stop laughing!

162
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,150
What's wrong with your face?

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,670
I lost my mind, okay?

164
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah...

165
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
Why is Iron Teeth here?

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,030
You asked me

167
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,870
if I was coming,

168
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,480
but he and I were gaming.

169
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,750
I asked him to tag along.

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Did you only get two tickets?

171
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,910
Okay.

172
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,840
Move!

173
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,510
I meant no disrespect.

174
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,200
Sorry.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
I couldn't help it.

176
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,630
Why did she

177
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,240
get the wig?

178
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,600
The wig isn't the main concern.

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,480
I thought
she got possessed after watching

180
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
"The Devil in the Suit".

181
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,790
Let's go.

182
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,150
Do you want to switch places with me?

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,390
Nope.

184
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,910
Can you switch places with me?

185
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,030
Why should I?

186
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Stop talking.

187
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,630
I'll punch

188
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,390
the talking one.

189
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,120
What's wrong?

190
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,270
Yes. I got it.

191
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll be right there.

192
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,270
Let's go to the toilet.

193
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,790
I don't want to.

194
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,390
Come with me to the toilet.

195
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,240
You two,

196
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,910
are you watching or not?

197
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,630
What now?

198
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,030
I'm not allowed to use the toilet?

199
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,720
Excuse me.

200
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,550
Coming through.

201
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,750
Excuse me.

202
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,080
Why are boys going to the toilet
in pairs as well nowadays?

203
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,270
Ouch...

204
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,240
You two!

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,360
Are you all right?

206
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,150
What happened to your face?

207
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,960
What happened to your face?

208
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,750
Huang Yingzi.

209
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,360
Did you learn nothing

210
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,270
from my lessons?

211
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,960
Enough about me.

212
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,870
What about you?

213
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,840
What happened?

214
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,120
A bunch of hooligans
was harassing Yifei.

215
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,870
They insisted on having fun with her.

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,790
Yifei said no.

217
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,870
Then, they got handsy.

218
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,000
I couldn't allow that.

219
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,270
I called Jiang Yi

220
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,790
and Zhuang Yuan to help me out.

221
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
I didn't call you

222
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,270
because Jiang Yi didn't want
to worry you.

223
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,600
What's the meaning of this?

224
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
Did you leave me out

225
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,030
because I was weak?

226
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,390
No.

227
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,550
I wanted to call you,

228
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,150
but your makeup

229
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,870
might traumatize the thugs.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
Is that supposed to be a joke?

231
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,910
No.

232
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,030
I mean,

233
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,080
I'll make sure you're there

234
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720
the next time

235
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
we get into a fight.

236
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,000
That's more like it.

237
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,600
Did you win the fight?

238
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Of course we won.

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Enough.

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,150
Stop bluffing.

241
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,000
You got beaten up.

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,030
Here, treat his bruises.

243
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,080
You, get over here.

244
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,440
Get moving.

245
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,270
You too.

246
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
You...

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,550
You're not done with me yet!

248
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,510
I'll finish it later.

249
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,200
You, get over here.

250
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,910
Come on.

251
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Sit here.

252
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,270
Sit.

253
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,150
Come on.

254
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,670
Sit here.

255
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,030
Just sit down already.

256
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,790
What a nuisance.

257
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,030
You can't even
treat your injury after a fight.

258
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,910
Turn around.

259
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,390
Turn around!

260
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,870
What are you looking at?

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
At you, of course.

262
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,550
It's going to sting.

263
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,550
Ouch!

264
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,510
Sorry.

265
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll be gentle.

266
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
What's so funny?

267
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
I wasn't laughing.

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,360
Do I look that hideous?

269
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,910
Not really.

270
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,360
So what's wrong?

271
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
Let me be honest with you.

272
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,000
You are ten thousand times prettier

273
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,720
when you don't have

274
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,630
any makeup on.

275
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,790
Get over here.

276
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll be gentle.

277
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,910
Well...

278
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,200
We didn't finish the movie.

279
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I'll make it up to you.

280
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,030
I don't want another movie with you.

281
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,080
You two ran off without me.

282
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,600
I went after you

283
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,030
before I finished the movie.

284
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,870
Oh no!

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,480
Madam, what now?

286
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,510
My umbrella!

287
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,920
Don't cry.

288
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,830
I lost it!

289
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,720
It wasn't yours to begin with.

290
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,030
But that whale...

291
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,590
It looks great!

292
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,880
I'll get you another umbrella.

293
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,510
Then, I'll draw the same whale on it.

294
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,960
How does that sound?

295
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,070
They are not the same.

296
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,400
Even if you get another umbrella,

297
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,880
it's not the same umbrella.

298
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,720
What should I do?

299
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,750
Leave me alone.

300
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,070
I want to cry in loneliness.

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
I'll feel better soon.

302
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,680
My goodness!

303
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,590
What now?

304
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,270
What now?

305
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,350
Did Jiang Yi

306
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,960
find that umbrella?

307
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,480
Of course not.

308
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,790
I can tell if it is his drawing.

309
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,440
He gave you something so precious,

310
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,310
how can you not be sure
of his feelings for you?

311
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,200
Maybe it was because
he brought Zhuang Yuan

312
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
when I invited him
to a romance movie.

313
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,830
What an odd person.

314
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,069
He was odd.

315
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,110
You mentioned Hangtian a lot.

316
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,070
What was the place like?

317
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,110
Where do I even begin to describe it?

318
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,310
In my eyes,

319
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,270
it has the most brilliant

320
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,830
sunshine.

321
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,070
As your teacher,

322
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,440
I don't think it's fair for you.

323
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,400
Give us a three-second head start.

324
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,400
Sure.

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,550
Run as fast as you can.

326
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,270
Don't go easy on us.

327
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,270
Sure.

328
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,790
Ready...

329
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,680
Three, two, one!

330
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:21,270
Go! Mr. Guan!

331
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,750
Mr. Guan.

332
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,240
I have a question for you.

333
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,830
Given your talent,

334
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,720
why did you
become a teacher in Hangtian?

335
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,110
What's wrong with being a teacher?

336
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,680
Isn't it better to be an athlete?

337
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,200
If I went that route,

338
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
who'd take care of you troublemakers?

339
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,310
All right, back to the class.

340
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,030
Get in line!

341
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,000
All clear.

342
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,830
What are you up to?

343
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,720
Checking Mr. Guan's background.

344
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,750
Beijing Sport University Athletics?

345
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,440
Who are these?

346
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,720
What are you doing?

347
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,400
Hello, Ms. Yang.

348
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,590
Did Mr. Guan confiscate your phones?

349
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,440
No.

350
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,640
We are here for...

351
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,750
We're here

352
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,270
for...

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,640
The basketball!

354
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
We're here to get the ball.

355
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,880
Basketball time.

356
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,270
Bye, Ms. Yang.

357
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,430
Bye.

358
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Consider this a rent payment.

359
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,070
Sorry, honey.

360
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,110
I'm late.

361
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
Lin Xiaoyang was out of line today.

362
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,790
I made him run extra laps.

363
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm famished.

364
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
Wash your hands. Dinner is ready.

365
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,400
Dig in.

366
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,680
You read my mind.

367
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,750
What's wrong?

368
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,750
I get it.

369
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,270
Did the class upset you again?

370
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,200
I'll give them an earful tomorrow.

371
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,720
Chao.

372
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,160
Tell me something.

373
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,240
Why did you marry me?

374
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,830
What a silly question.

375
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,400
Why else could it be?

376
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,880
It's because I love you.

377
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,680
What do you think

378
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,110
love is?

379
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,030
Actually,

380
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,070
I don't even know

381
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,030
what love is anymore.

382
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,880
But I know

383
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,480
I can tell someone is in love

384
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,960
from the look in his eyes.

385
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,680
Yang Fan.

386
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,270
Where did you find the photos?

387
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,070
I came across them

388
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,350
in your office.

389
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,200
Guan Chao.

390
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,750
I thought I knew you.

391
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,200
But today, I realized

392
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,480
that I didn't really know you.

393
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,160
I've seen the photos

394
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,590
of your other childhood friends.

395
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,230
But I've never seen her.

396
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,960
I thought

397
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,830
you hid it from me

398
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,880
so you wouldn't hurt my feelings.

399
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,600
But today, I realized

400
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,350
that there is a side of you

401
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,920
that I never knew.

402
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
Yang Fan...

403
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,200
It's not what you think.

404
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,480
Tell me.

405
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
There is a pair

406
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,550
of torn running shoes

407
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,270
in the closet.

408
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,350
You wouldn't let me throw it away.

409
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,920
Was it a gift from her?

410
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,510
On the day of our wedding,

411
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
you saved a seat at Yingzi's table.

412
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,720
Was it for her?

413
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,440
And every year,

414
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,720
you spend a day

415
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,830
over at the tree

416
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,750
by the wonton shop.

417
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,550
You stay there for one whole day.

418
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,790
Is it because of her?

419
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,550
Yang Fan.

420
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,400
Yifei is...

421
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,640
One last question.

422
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
Does she always

423
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,390
have a place

424
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,070
in your heart?

425
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,590
Is that a place

426
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,510
that I can never enter?

427
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,310
And I can't replace her?

428
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,960
Fine.

429
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,030
I get it.

430
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,240
You can tell me

431
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,590
when you're ready.

432
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,550
Yang Fan.

433
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,510
I'm home.

434
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,640
I brought you food.

435
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,550
Thanks.

436
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,000
Did I enter the wrong house?

437
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm living here for free,

438
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
dear babysitter.

439
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,240
Zhuang Yuan.

440
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,070
You know what?

441
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,200
It's a shame you're not

442
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,350
studying home economics.

443
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,680
I think so too.

444
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,510
I can clean

445
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,550
and sort things out.

446
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,270
I threw away all the junk

447
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,200
in your fridge,

448
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,510
cupboards, and closets.

449
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,310
Don't worry.

450
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,440
I didn't get rid of it.

451
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,790
Grandma?

452
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,830
(Why do you have this umbrella?)

453
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,920
Huang Yingzi

454
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,270
searched every inch of Hangtian

455
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,030
for it.

456
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,350
Zhuang Yuan.

457
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
Did you ever have

458
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,030
an idol that you liked a lot?

459
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,550
That would be Maggie Cheung.

460
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,110
If you had a chance to become

461
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,590
Maggie Cheung's friend,

462
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,030
what would you do?

463
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,510
Becoming her friend?

464
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,440
I'd love it.

465
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,720
Which is more important?

466
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,640
Maggie Cheung

467
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,350
or your childhood friend?

468
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,030
Childhood friend, of course.

469
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,200
The answer is obvious.

470
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,070
An idol is what she is

471
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,480
because she lives in our imagination.

472
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,480
The distance creates a yearning.

473
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,030
But a childhood friend is different.

474
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,680
We grow up with them.

475
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,310
They are an inseparable memory

476
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,750
of our lives.

477
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Judging by the sound of it,

478
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,440
you value the childhood friend more.

479
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,110
Hang on...

480
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,110
Is this idol Ding Ye?

481
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,270
Fine.

482
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,270
You're smart.

483
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,350
Great work.

484
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,350
Are you saying

485
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,440
Ding Ye and Huang Yingzi

486
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,920
are now...

487
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
No way.

488
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,350
You and Huang Yingzi are a match

489
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,480
made in heaven.

490
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,270
No one else can ever hope

491
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,680
to come between you two.

492
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,920
Jiang.

493
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,440
I know we grew apart

494
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,920
after that incident.

495
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,640
We became distant.

496
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,030
But now,

497
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,270
you're back.

498
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,750
We are hanging out

499
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,270
just like we used to be.

500
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,160
More importantly,

501
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,400
you need to stop

502
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,880
circling around her.

503
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
Be a comet

504
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,510
and go for it

505
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,680
if you must.

506
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,400
Your star is calling.

507
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,550
What now?

508
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,110
You asked me out and said nothing.

509
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,550
I'm a little

510
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,310
thrilled

511
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,430
because you came to see me.

512
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,160
Jiang Yi.

513
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Tell me something.

514
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,110
Go ahead.

515
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,640
Do you remember the umbrella?

516
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Which umbrella?

517
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,070
The one with a whale you drew.

518
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,240
I told you I found it.

519
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,160
There were less than
500 boys in Hangtian

520
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,550
who could actually draw.

521
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,920
There were less than 200 girls

522
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
who liked whales as much as I do.

523
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,400
But someone who would
draw a whale on an umbrella?

524
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,750
I think there's only one.

525
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,160
Fine, I drew the whale.

526
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,790
You lost it.

527
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,440
Fine.

528
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,270
I have a question for you too.

529
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,880
Be honest with me.

530
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,550
Are you...

531
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,350
Jiang Yi.

532
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,440
Ding Ye is an author I like a lot.

533
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,200
I liked him in the past.

534
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,640
I still like him now.

535
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,750
But to me,

536
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,830
he has always been a friend.

537
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,750
How did you know
what I wanted to ask?

538
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,350
Don't forget

539
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,920
who wrote "The Life of Jiang Yi".

540
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,310
I am Huang Yingzi.

541
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,640
No one knows you
better than me in Hangtian.

542
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,400
Grandma called me.

543
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,960
She misses me

544
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,440
and wants me to visit her.

545
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,550
She never wanted to trouble us.

546
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
Why would she call you?

547
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,310
Yeah.

548
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,160
If she wants to see me,

549
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,550
it must be important.

550
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,000
Will you

551
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,240
come with me?

552
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,000
If you have no one to go with you,

553
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,310
I'll do you a favour.

554
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,830
I have no one to go with me.

555
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,270
Why do you need

556
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,270
the umbrella for a sunny day?

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,350
I always carry an umbrella with me

558
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,790
when I travel.

559
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,750
It makes me feel safe.

560
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,750
What do you mean?

561
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,030
A trauma from losing the last one?

562
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,880
Maybe.

563
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,350
Why didn't you ask me

564
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,440
to draw you another back then?

565
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,240
Promise not to make fun of me

566
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,720
if I tell you.

567
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,160
Sure.

568
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
At the time,

569
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,550
I thought I deserved to be sad

570
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,750
for losing something so precious to me

571
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,400
because I failed to keep it safe.

572
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,590
I didn't deserve to own

573
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,640
another umbrella as great as that.

574
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,920
I told you not to laugh.

575
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,030
Did you look for it?

576
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,030
Yeah.

577
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,510
I searched many times.

578
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,280
But to no avail.

579
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,670
Never mind.

580
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,670
Someone must have found it.

581
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,070
When it rains,

582
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,320
the whale gets to swim again.

583
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,880
Sorry.

584
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,800
Sorry, excuse me.

585
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,400
Where did you

586
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
get the umbrella?

587
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
We got it from a friend.

588
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,480
What do you care?

589
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,920
Wait.

590
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,590
I think

591
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,510
you found this umbrella at the cinema.

592
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
We're calling the police.

593
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,630
Hear me out.

594
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,670
This umbrella

595
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,760
is a gift for my friend.

596
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,440
She is a clumsy person.

597
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,190
She dropped it

598
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,440
after the movie.

599
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,400
She searched many times for it.

600
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,920
She's been down for quite a while.

601
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,000
I've been coming here

602
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
when it rains to look for the umbrella.

603
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,030
Every time when it rains?

604
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,960
Is it a girl you like?

605
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,150
Forgot your umbrella as well?

606
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,630
Sit.

607
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,360
Guess who I am!

608
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,280
Who else can be as playful as you?

609
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,110
Grandma.

610
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,880
I missed you too.

611
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,880
Grandma,

612
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,190
see who's behind you.

613
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Grandma.

614
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,880
We have another visitor!

615
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,800
Great. You are both back.

616
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,320
Take a seat.

617
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,840
I'll get you

618
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,190
your favorite drinks
back when you were little.

619
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,710
Sure, Grandma.

620
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,590
Coming!

621
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,880
You loved this.

622
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,630
And this was your favorite.

623
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,630
I'll make you some wontons later.

624
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,190
Thank you.

625
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
Why are you chuckling?

626
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,440
It's nothing.

627
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,800
No.

628
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
Something is up. Come clean.

629
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,190
What is it?

630
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,510
After so many years apart,

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
you still have fun

632
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,830
like when you were kids.

633
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,510
It seems the foundation
of your relationship

634
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,280
stood the test of time.

635
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,070
I don't have a relationship with him.

636
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,150
We are nothing but friends.

637
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah. Just normal friends.

638
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,190
Those who grow up together

639
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,230
can meet again after parting,

640
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,110
and become closer after growing apart.

641
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,190
However...

642
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,710
Do you mean Yang Fan and Guan Chao?

643
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,230
They fought?

644
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,110
How do you know?

645
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,480
If every human being

646
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,110
was as insensible as you,

647
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,760
the world would've been doomed.

648
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,320
Grandma.

649
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,670
Did they fight because of Yifei?

650
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,630
You know that too?

651
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,150
Shut it.

652
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,480
Where could Guan Chao be?

653
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,440
You're an amateur driver.

654
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,880
Focus on the driving.

655
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,230
I'm not an amateur driver.

656
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,670
I've been driving for ten years.

657
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,400
But you barely

658
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,840
touched the steering wheel.

659
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,230
Your dad must have a lot of faith in you

660
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,280
to let you drive the car.

661
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
You whine too much.

662
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,920
Why don't you drive?

663
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,630
No way.

664
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,670
When a couple fights,

665
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,150
how do outsiders resolve the situation?

666
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,230
I think

667
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,920
it's pointless
to talk any sense into them.

668
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,630
They have to solve it themselves.

669
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,960
You're right.

670
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,960
But first, we must find them.

671
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,590
Wait. Don't drive so fast!

672
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,400
Don't worry. The car is going steadily.

673
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,590
I'm scared.

674
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,550
My goodness.

675
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,230
(Slow down!)

676
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,880
(Slow down!)

677
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,360
We looked everywhere.

678
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,000
Are you sure he's here?

679
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,110
Guan Chao!

680
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,360
Take it easy.

681
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,400
Come on, what happened?

682
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,880
What happened between you and Yang Fan?

683
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,710
Where is she now?

684
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,280
She went back to her parents' place.

685
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,630
Did you go to her?

686
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,030
Did you call her?

687
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,360
I bet you never apologized.

688
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,590
Guan Chao,

689
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,840
you never change.

690
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,880
When you need help,

691
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,550
you prefer to keep it to yourself.

692
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,320
Simply brooding here

693
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,590
won't solve anything.

694
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,670
Enough. Stop lecturing him.

695
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,800
Sometimes,

696
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,800
I feel like I've failed Yang Fan.

697
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,960
Why?

698
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,670
I still think about Yifei.

699
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,000
Guan Chao.

700
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,030
I too think about Yifei a lot.

701
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,760
Yingzi.

702
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,190
It's not the same.
