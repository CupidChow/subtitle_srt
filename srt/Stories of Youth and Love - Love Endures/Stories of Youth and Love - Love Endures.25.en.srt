[Episode 25]

3
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,030
Zhuang Yuan.

4
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
I've been looking for you everywhere.

5
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:29,960
What's wrong?

6
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
Are you giving up the chance
to stay on campus?

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
Don't you want to complete your thesis?

8
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,870
Hey,

9
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,400
why are you giving up easily?

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Tianlin,

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,310
I've thought a lot recently.

12
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,150
What is my life goal?

13
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,960
Why did I study so much?

14
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,360
I've figured it out.

15
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,870
I don't want to be bothered
by things like my degree

16
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,630
or staying here.

17
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,280
Mom?

18
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Why are you here?

19
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,190
Madam... Madam Xu.

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
If there's nothing...

21
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,870
I have something to do.

22
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,870
I'll take my leave.

23
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,280
If Professor Ma hadn't called me,

24
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,080
I had no idea you'd do this!

25
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,840
Zhuang Yuan,

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
what exactly are you doing?

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,750
I just want to do what I love.

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,470
Then get admitted directly first!

29
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,630
You can do what you want later.

30
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,470
Do you know how rare it is

31
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,560
to remain here?

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,430
Rare?

33
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,400
Do I have to accept it
because it's a rare opportunity?

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,030
All I want is to focus on real research.

35
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,120
That is only temporary.

36
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,240
After enduring for a few years,

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,150
you'll get to be a university professor.

38
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,840
Isn't that your dream?

39
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
That's your dream.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
Not mine.

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,750
Fine, it's my dream!

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
Zhuang Yuan.

43
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,030
Your dad and I

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,360
didn't study much,

45
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,000
but I know

46
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,470
only through education
can you change your destiny

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,920
and

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
live a life different from ours.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,270
This is the best option

50
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,160
I can think of for your future.

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,390
The opportunity
is right in front of you.

52
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,920
I won't allow you

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,070
to be willful

54
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,510
and give up without thinking.

55
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,070
Let's go meet your professor together

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,240
and ask him to give you another chance.

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,920
I won't go.

58
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,160
Let's go!

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,630
I said, I won't go!

60
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,070
What do you want, Zhuang Yuan?

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,830
I'm going to celebrate
Yingzi's birthday tonight.

62
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,430
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,360
You all came to celebrate my birthday.

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,870
Yingzi,

65
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,480
when Guan Chao and I got married,

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
you helped us a lot.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,390
It's only right for us
to celebrate your birthday.

68
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,040
Yes.

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,390
Guan Chao told me

70
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,160
you loved birthday celebrations
when you were young.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,070
Really?

72
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,270
I don't think so.

73
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,870
Did you forget?

74
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,390
During your 17th birthday,

75
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,160
we didn't prepare any gifts

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
and gave you a wish card.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
You kicked up a fuss,

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,630
wanting to sever ties with us.

79
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,600
Regarding the wish card,

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
they have fulfilled my wishes.

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
You're the only one left.

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
Yingzi,

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
I canceled

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,390
my vacation and flight ticket for you.

85
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,390
Do as you see fit.

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
That means

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,560
you never planned
on celebrating my birthday.

88
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,360
I thought

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,800
you wanted to spend
some alone time with him.

90
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,040
What alone time?

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,800
Yingzi.

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,310
I have a surprise for you.

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
Look that way.

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,680
Happy birthday.

95
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you crazy, Zhuang Yuan?

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,390
When Guan Chao got married,

97
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,920
you said it only happens
once in a lifetime,

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
so you attended his wedding.

99
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,390
Yingzi can celebrate

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,190
her birthday every year.

101
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,480
Is it worth

102
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
giving up your future?

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,160
Mom,

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,240
you've got it all wrong.

105
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,270
It's not that I'm giving up
my future for Yingzi.

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,120
This is

107
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
exactly what I want.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,390
Since when did you become this willful?

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
I've never been willful,

110
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,830
so I'll be willful this time.

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,390
Mom.

112
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,480
Since young,

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,950
I've been an obedient child.

114
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,800
You make arrangements,

115
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,630
choices,

116
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,040
and decisions on my behalf.

117
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,430
However, have you asked me?

118
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,510
Have you asked

119
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,920
if this is what I want

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
or if I'm happy doing this?

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm 30 this year.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can be responsible for my own choices.

123
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,040
I've had enough

124
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,630
of your previous arrangements.

125
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
I forced you.

126
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,240
You've had enough.

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,510
Got it.

128
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,360
Okay.

129
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,750
Not bad, Yingzi.

130
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,160
Your car is quite spacious.

131
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,600
My car

132
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,950
is the same brand as yours.

133
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,720
Let's play a song.

134
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,270
I think that's a good idea.

135
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,270
It has been years,

136
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,480
but your song list is still the same.

137
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,870
The songs we listened to
when we were young,

138
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,360
the singers

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,120
sang really well.

140
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,360
These few years,

141
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,790
there are many new singers

142
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,790
and new songs,

143
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,910
but they are different.

144
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,360
Back then, besides Stefanie Sun,

145
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,960
we have Jay Chou,
Mayday, and Jolin Tsai.

146
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,270
Thinking back,

147
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,440
it really was the golden age
of the Chinese music scene.

148
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,030
It should also be our golden age.

149
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,150
Mingyu.

150
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,270
Do you remember Yifei and I

151
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,960
had a promise regarding Stefanie Sun

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,390
when we reached the age of 30?

153
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,440
Of course.

154
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,910
I was your witness.

155
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,910
Yifei remembers that, too.

156
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,670
This promise

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
is about to be fulfilled soon.

158
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,600
Mom.

159
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,630
Why are you here?

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,240
I've been looking for you
the entire day.

161
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,440
The rain is getting heavier.

162
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
Come back home with me.

163
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,670
Mom, I'm sorry.

164
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,790
I

165
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,870
went overboard today.

166
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,910
Every time I come to campus,

167
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,790
I'll imagine

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,320
you as a professor.

169
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,000
Sitting on the field,

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,550
you're surrounded

171
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,120
by a bunch of students

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
listening to your lecture.

173
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,150
You'll share your knowledge with them.

174
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,390
I'll tell everyone,

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,200
"Look,

176
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,030
that's my son,

177
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,870
Professor Zhuang Yuan.

178
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,360
He's the biggest pride

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
of my life."

180
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,200
I might never

181
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
be able to see that scene, ever.

182
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,510
In fact, since young,

183
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,120
I've always

184
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,390
lacked a mind of my own,

185
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,440
so I've gotten used

186
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,480
to following your orders

187
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,080
and arrangements.

188
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
I thought the best gifts for you

189
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,080
would be my doctoral degree

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
and my graduation certificate.

191
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,360
But now I understand

192
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,910
that the best gift I can give you

193
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,550
is me growing up,

194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,390
being responsible for my own choices

195
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
and not regretting them.

196
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,910
You've grown up.

197
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,320
You can choose your own path

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
and don't need me
to plan for you anymore.

199
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,480
Mom,

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,240
where are you going?

201
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm going to find Professor Ma

202
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,440
to thank him for his guidance and trust.

203
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,840
I also want to apologize to him.

204
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
My son

205
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,480
is going to take

206
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,150
the path he wants.

207
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,270
Do you have a cigarette?

208
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you have a lighter?

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,910
No.

210
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,150
When did you start smoking?

211
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,910
When I was 18. What about you?

212
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,150
Same.

213
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,080
Did you bring everything?

214
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,270
Do you think

215
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,360
we can hide it well
just like in the past?

216
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
I don't know,

217
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,390
but this is the only way.

218
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,120
You're still the same.

219
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,150
Yingzi would rush ahead
to protect everyone,

220
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
and you'd hide behind her
to protect her.

221
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,670
Why are we still standing here?

222
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,840
Let's go dancing!

223
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,120
My heart is about to jump out.

224
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,750
I should go home and do my homework.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
Why are you so diligent?

226
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,390
If my mom finds out,

227
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,550
she'll kill me.

228
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,150
We've celebrated our 18th birthday.

229
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,200
What's wrong with dancing?

230
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,030
Come on.

231
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,840
Just this once.

232
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,320
No more next time.

233
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Come on.

234
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,510
Let's go.

235
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,720
Come on.

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,670
Let's dance together.

237
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,390
Let's battle.

238
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,440
Good.

239
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Are you here
to take selfies or have fun?

240
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,200
You know nothing.

241
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,510
This is a camera phone.

242
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,320
Do you have it?

243
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,550
My second mock exam's score
passed the cutoff line,

244
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,550
so my dad gave it to me.

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,550
It's the only one.

246
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,440
Mingyu, let's go to the restroom.

247
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Okay.

248
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,670
We're going to the restroom.

249
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,200
Go ahead.

250
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,240
I'll bring you there.

251
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,480
The restroom is that way.

252
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:44,870
That way.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Come on.

254
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Why do I feel

255
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,390
dizzy?

256
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,080
What?

257
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,670
I said, I feel dizzy.

258
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,240
I feel dizzy!

259
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,000
Stop drinking, then.

260
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,150
It isn't that lively today.

261
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,390
Oh, isn't this Lan Yifei?

262
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
Stand right there.

263
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,840
What do you want?

264
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,320
I miss you.

265
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,390
Why?

266
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,120
Wasn't the previous beating enough?

267
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,550
Don't fight.

268
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,030
If you lose, you end up in the hospital.

269
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,960
If you win, you end up in jail.

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,390
You're just a bunch of kids.

271
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,510
How dare you act all arrogant?

272
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,750
Let's see how you'll act arrogant today.

273
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,080
So what if you outnumber us?

274
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,000
If you dare, let's fight one-on-one.

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't fight!

276
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,910
If you lose, you end up in the hospital.

277
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,320
If you win, you end up in jail!

278
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,390
I'll fight one-on-one with her.

279
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,750
Scoundrel.

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,030
Scoundrel?

281
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,630
You make it sound sweet.

282
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,150
Mind your mouth!

283
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,360
We... We're in trouble.

284
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,030
Come, we're in trouble!

285
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,150
Let's go.

286
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,080
Yifei, Guan Chao.

287
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
Are you okay?

288
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,750
We're fine.

289
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,510
Little Chicken Chiu?

290
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,550
Huang Feihong?

291
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,440
Why did we run into you again?

292
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,120
Darn it.

293
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Is he the only thug in Hangtian City?

294
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,960
Why is he everywhere?

295
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,360
What do you want?

296
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,390
Don't you try to trick me this time.

297
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,720
You're just a high school student.

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
Stop pretending
to be Huang Feihong's descendant.

299
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,320
Guys,

300
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
teach them a good lesson today.

301
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,360
What do you want?

302
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,920
We can't end up
in the police station again.

303
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,110
Are we not fighting?

304
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,790
We can't fight today no matter what.

305
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
Let's scare them

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
and then run.

307
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Do the countdown.

308
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,920
Three,

309
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,350
two,

310
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,960
one.

311
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,270
Go after them!

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,480
Are we not going after them?

313
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
If you lose, you end up in the hospital.

314
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,640
If you win, you end up in jail.

315
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,110
I can't.

316
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,240
Slow down...

317
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,880
So?

318
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,720
Huang Feihong's descendant

319
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,200
isn't only skilled in martial arts.

320
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,400
She's also smart, right?

321
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,480
Yes.

322
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,590
Yi, let me tell you.

323
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,790
As long as I exist,

324
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,160
you exist as well.

325
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,550
Okay.

326
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,160
I'll keep protecting you,

327
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,920
okay?

328
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Okay.

329
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
You, too.

330
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,790
As long as the six of us are together,

331
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,720
we won't be scared anywhere we go.

332
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:28,879
Get it?

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,270
Yes.

334
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,590
I have a question.

335
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:31,919
Why does she

336
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
keep saying she's a descendant
of Huang Feihong?

337
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,069
Why?

338
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,440
Her surname is Huang.

339
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
She also loves fighting.

340
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
She made that up.

341
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,960
That's it?

342
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,589
Yes.

343
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,199
Well,

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Huang Feihong was born in Guangdong.

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Perhaps

346
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,790
she is the descendant

347
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,070
of his descendant,

348
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,960
many generations removed.

349
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,200
What are you

350
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,830
muttering about?

351
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,640
Greetings, Heroine Huang.

352
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,510
You, come here.

353
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,790
You, go.

354
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,310
Don't always single me out
for blame, okay?

355
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,880
Come, let's go home!

356
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Slow down...

357
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,830
Why can't you

358
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,960
walk straight?

359
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,720
How can you say that?

360
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
Who is the one not walking straight?

361
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,240
Did you know

362
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,110
what this is?

363
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,550
Walking daintily.

364
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,480
Foshan Shadowless Feet.

365
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,110
Wudang Elevator Jump.

366
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,720
Okay.

367
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,030
I had no idea you're a martial artist.

368
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
I am a great master of martial arts.

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
What's wrong?

370
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,200
Jiang Yi.

371
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,590
Don't cry
if someone bullies you in the future.

372
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,750
I'll be there to take care of you.

373
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,510
Don't worry.

374
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,400
Okay.

375
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,270
Let's go home.

376
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,550
I won't go there again.

377
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,510
It's fine.

378
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,480
You need to cover up

379
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,510
so your parents won't realize it.

380
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,160
Hear that?

381
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,440
I can't breathe.

382
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
Fine.

383
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Okay, I'm leaving.

384
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,830
Where is my phone?

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,960
My phone.

386
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,750
Where is my phone?

387
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Where is it?

388
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,550
(Are you sober now?)

389
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,270
Phone.

390
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,510
Where is my phone?

391
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,590
Has anyone seen my phone?

392
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,720
What is this?

393
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,270
Where is my phone?

394
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,270
Has anyone seen my phone?

395
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,200
(Why hasn't Huang Yingzi replied to me?)

396
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,830
Jiang Yi.

397
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,790
Uh, the supermarket has
a buy-one-get-one-free offer on yogurt.

398
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,200
I bought a bottle for Yingzi.

399
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
Yingzi isn't with you?

400
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Isn't she home?

401
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,350
She didn't answer her phone,

402
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,550
so I thought she was
doing her homework at your place.

403
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,240
But I left her at her doorstep

404
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,550
before leaving.

405
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,720
Oh dear. Where is she?

406
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,480
Huang, go find her now!

407
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,960
Coming.

408
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,720
Don't just wait. I'll go look for her.

409
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,270
Madam Guo, I'll go look with Mr. Huang.

410
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:32,590
Okay.

411
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,680
You can wait at home.

412
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,070
If there's any update,

413
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,640
let me know immediately.

414
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
I... I'll wait for your call.

415
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,640
Hey,

416
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,750
we meet again.

417
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,550
Where is Huang Yingzi?

418
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,680
I'd like to know that, too.

419
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,160
I was about to ask you that question.

420
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,960
Why did you come instead of her?

421
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,350
Don't you want it?

422
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,030
Give me the phone.

423
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,350
Give it to me!

424
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,790
The phone isn't yours.

425
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,030
Why are you so agitated?

426
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
You beat us to a pulp

427
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,590
and we were locked up
at the police station.

428
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,510
Now you want us to be honest?

429
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,000
That's too much.

430
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,040
Tell me.

431
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
What do I have to do
for you to give it to me?

432
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,960
Let's do this.

433
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,590
Let us beat you up

434
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,030
the same way you beat us up.

435
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,960
Do you still want it?

436
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,920
If you don't, forget it.

437
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,790
The phone is the latest model.

438
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,240
Selling it will be enough
to cover the losses.

439
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,110
Sure. Go ahead.

440
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,400
You should wait at home.

441
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,640
I can't stay at home.

442
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,790
Huang,

443
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,720
where do you think she'll go at night?

444
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,000
Calm down.

445
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,720
She's an adult.

446
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
She can protect herself.

447
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,270
Two days ago,

448
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,480
I read about
a female high schooler's disappearance.

449
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
In the beginning,
they lost contact with her.

450
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,440
When they found her,

451
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,030
she was

452
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
dead.

453
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
Can you stop

454
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
scaring yourself?

455
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,350
Let's call the police.

456
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,240
You have to wait for 24 hours
before reporting a disappearance.

457
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,110
Why do you only

458
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,550
read half of the news?

459
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,270
Mr. Fang, any updates?

460
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,350
Madam Xu,

461
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,790
did Yingzi contact you?

462
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,680
What?

463
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,920
Someone saw her
at the disco this afternoon?

464
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Nearly fought?

465
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,270
Okay, thank you.

466
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,270
Okay, let's keep in touch.

467
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,110
Didn't you say she's an adult

468
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,880
and has the ability to protect herself?

469
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,000
Huang Yingzi!

470
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
Huang Yingzi.

471
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,240
Huang Yingzi.

472
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
Huang Yingzi.

473
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,510
It's late. Where...

474
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,680
Where could she be?

475
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,880
Huang Yingzi.

476
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
Look. What is that?

477
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,510
What?

478
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,830
Isn't that Yingzi?

479
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,030
Yingzi!

480
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,550
Yingzi...

481
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,030
Wake up...

482
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,960
Yingzi, look.

483
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,440
It's me, Mom.

484
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,270
Huang Yingzi!

485
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,790
You got drunk

486
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,000
and even fell asleep here?

487
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,550
That's enough.

488
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,200
You're scaring her.

489
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,440
There, there.

490
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,920
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry.

491
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I lost the phone

492
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
you just bought for me.

493
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,590
I couldn't find it.

494
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,160
It's fine. Good girl.

495
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I'll buy another one for you.

496
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,750
I'm glad you're fine.

497
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,350
Okay.

498
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,240
Let's go home.

499
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,480
Will you not buy a new phone for me?

500
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,030
I will.

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,110
Where is my phone?

502
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,310
Anyway, my mom said

503
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,790
to make me learn this lesson,

504
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,350
I won't get a phone this semester.

505
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,030
How do we contact you?

506
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
You can call my house

507
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,830
or find me at my place.

508
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,750
What a pity.

509
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,200
I took many photos with that phone

510
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,480
at the disco yesterday.

511
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
I can't see them now.

512
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,680
Now,

513
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,680
I can only isolate myself from the world

514
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,790
and focus on my studies.

515
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,070
Am... Am I daydreaming?

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,070
Or did my memory deviate from the truth?

517
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,200
I remember bringing this phone

518
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,400
to the disco.

519
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
I couldn't find it after coming home.

520
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
You drank too much

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,240
and remembered wrongly.

522
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
This is great.

523
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,550
I'm glad it's back.

524
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,270
I got scared

525
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,880
thinking I lost it.

526
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,350
See if anything inside was lost.

527
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,720
How did this phone return to my drawer?

528
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,510
Be careful.

529
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,270
Is throwing balls

530
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,510
fun?

531
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,590
Stop.

532
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,200
Jiang Yi, what are you doing?

533
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,270
Show me.

534
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,160
Let me see.

535
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,310
Show me.

536
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,240
What happened to your face?

537
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,960
Who hit you?

538
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
I didn't fight. I fell down.

539
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,960
You got injured just from a fall?

540
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,550
Your face is all bruised!

541
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,790
Yes, I fell because
I was playing with my phone

542
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,790
and not watching where I was going.

543
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,110
Is it bruised?

544
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,110
No.

545
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,750
Not at all.

546
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,640
Playing with your phone again.

547
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,030
How many times have I told you

548
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,550
not to play games

549
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,640
when you're walking?

550
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,070
You suffered injuries from the fall.

551
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,920
What about next time?

552
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,640
What if you got hit by a car

553
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
and died?

554
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,830
You're no longer a child.

555
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,030
Falling when you walk?

556
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,070
How embarrassing.

557
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,110
Why didn't you fall to your death?

558
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,160
Why?

559
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,270
Why didn't you tell her

560
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,310
you got injured to help her

561
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,160
get back her phone?

562
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,550
You know nothing.

563
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,030
I'm a man.

564
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,550
Drink.

565
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,880
You... You don't have to stand up.

566
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,590
Sit down.

567
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,440
Sit.

568
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,270
Happy birthday.

569
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,240
Thank you.

570
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,790
Don't drink too much, Guan Chao.

571
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,640
Take good care of Yang Fan.

572
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,510
What's wrong with you both?

573
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
It's nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.

574
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,070
Yingzi,

575
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,000
let me take a photo for you.

576
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,590
Sure.

577
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,680
What's wrong with you two?

578
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,000
I want to pick songs.

579
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,790
Move.

580
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,350
I want to pick songs.

581
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,720
Go.

582
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,510
Uh...

583
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,270
Uh...

584
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,590
I...

585
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
Make way.

586
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,310
Hello?

587
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,640
Where are you?

588
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,070
I'm celebrating my birthday

589
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,200
at the karaoke today.

590
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,480
Okay.

591
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm sorry.

592
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,440
I didn't inform you in advance

593
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
and made the arrangements.

594
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,790
It's fine.

595
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm quite happy that they are here.

596
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Good.

597
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,350
Did you come out

598
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,160
just to apologize to me?

599
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,830
You're not prepared to tell me

600
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
about the email, right?

601
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,590
There's nothing to talk about, then.

602
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,440
Got it.

603
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,750
Happy birthday to you!

604
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,550
Thank you, everyone.

605
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm happy you're here.

606
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,720
What wish did you make?

607
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,240
My first wish

608
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
is to have a successful career,
earn a lot of money,

609
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,000
and be healthy.

610
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,830
Yingzi, you're so greedy.

611
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,030
You've already made three wishes.

612
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,790
Let Yingzi continue.

613
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
My second wish

614
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,680
is that I hope you all can be with me

615
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,400
on my birthday every year.

616
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,510
Of course.

617
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,830
My third wish is

618
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,240
that there are no secrets

619
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
between me and the person I love,

620
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,070
and we can be open
and honest with each other.

621
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,680
Done.

622
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,240
That's enough, Jiang Yi.

623
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,310
Stop keeping it a secret.

624
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,440
Take it out already.

625
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:14,790
Take it out.

626
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,720
Yingzi is getting anxious.

627
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,030
Look, she's getting upset.

628
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,270
A surprise.

629
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,400
Take it out.

630
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,590
Okay.

631
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,510
Here.

632
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,640
What is this?

633
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,270
A surprise.

634
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,590
When we were in the corridor,

635
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,680
I nearly spilled the beans.

636
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,310
Yifei told you to give me this?

637
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes.

638
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,750
Yifei is too busy
with her overseas tour.

639
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
She asked for my help

640
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,400
to confirm the order.

641
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,680
That was why

642
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,510
I logged into her email account.

643
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,240
It took a long time for it
to finally reach your hands.

644
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,070
Let's take a look.

645
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,030
Okay.

646
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,590
That's a lot.

647
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,510
Look,

648
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,150
overseas special edition.

649
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,590
(Here you go.)

650
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,030
I went to

651
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,190
CD shops all over Hangtian City

652
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,920
before managing to buy this.

653
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,230
Yifei,

654
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,030
I announce

655
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,800
that besides Stefanie Sun,

656
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,110
you're the woman I love the most.

657
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,670
When Stefanie Sun
released albums in the past,

658
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,150
you weren't this anxious.

659
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,670
I didn't win.

660
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,280
When can I

661
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,920
get to attend Stefanie Sun's concert?

662
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,480
Don't be sad.

663
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
At least we have her album.

664
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,230
Yifei, I'll redeem my wish.

665
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,360
What is it?

666
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,510
I don't want Stefanie Sun's album.

667
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,960
When we're thirty,

668
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,000
let's attend
Stefanie Sun's concert together.

669
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,840
Sure!

670
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,550
Pinky promise.

671
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,440
So? Do you like them?

672
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,670
You must be elated.

673
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,670
Thank you,

674
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,760
but I don't think you know

675
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,030
that Yifei's promise

676
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,110
wasn't to give me CDs.

677
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,920
This isn't from Yifei.

678
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,630
How could that be?

679
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,070
Urban Village, Jiangzhou Avenue.

680
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,070
Urban Village.

681
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,150
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:34,920
I might not

683
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,110
be able to stay for
today's birthday celebration.

684
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,800
Ding Ye found Lan Bin.

685
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,840
I need to go find him.

686
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,710
Yingzi...

687
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:39,960
Look.

688
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,510
Wait.

689
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,190
Chao and Yang Fan
traveled here from their hometown.

690
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,760
You should at least cut the cake, right?

691
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,360
Yes.

692
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,030
Yang Fan also said

693
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,400
she wants you to give her child a name.

694
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,760
Yes.

695
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,440
We were wondering

696
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,230
what names you'd give to my child.

697
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,510
Hurry, cut the cake.

698
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,440
Cut the cake.

699
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,920
Let's eat the cake first.

700
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,880
Jiang Yi, don't just sit there.

701
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,070
Get the stuff to cut the cake.

702
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,400
Okay, that's enough!

703
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,960
I...

704
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,030
I really don't know

705
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,590
what's wrong with you.

706
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,280
Did I do anything wrong?

707
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,110
You were all there

708
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,190
on the day Lan Bin left, right?

709
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,510
You were there

710
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,510
when Yifei cried for her dad, right?

711
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,840
All the while,

712
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,030
Yifei wanted to find her dad.

713
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,590
You know that well, right?

714
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,280
Now that we've found

715
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,030
Lan Bin,

716
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,280
why are you stopping me?

717
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,590
I really don't get it.

718
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,800
Can you tell me why?

719
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,360
And you, Jiang Yi.

720
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,880
You've been acting strange recently.

721
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,760
Can you explain about

722
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
Yifei's email account and the CDs?

723
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,230
What exactly is going on?

724
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Can you all explain?

725
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,320
Yingzi.

726
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,880
Stop! I'm not a fool!

727
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,440
I know you're hiding something from me

728
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,670
just like him.

729
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,800
Fine.

730
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,070
If you're not willing
to tell me the truth,

731
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,030
never mind.

732
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
I'll find the truth myself.

733
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,480
Yingzi.

734
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,230
Yingzi.

735
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,070
Don't follow me!

736
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,880
Especially you.

737
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,190
Why is Ding Ye causing trouble now?

738
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,710
We can't let Yingzi see Lan Bin.

739
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,480
Both of you stay here.

740
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,030
Jiang Yi and I will stop Yingzi.

741
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,480
Okay.

742
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,760
Yang Fan is pregnant.

743
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,880
You stay with her.

744
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,590
I'll head there with Jiang Yi.

745
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,000
Come on.

746
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,960
Enough!

747
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,590
All of you stay here.

748
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,960
I'll go alone.

749
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,960
Wait for my news.

750
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,480
Ding Ye.

751
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,670
Where is he?

752
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,150
Bring me to him.

753
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,070
Does your friend know
you're looking for her dad?

754
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,280
Yes.

755
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,630
I sent her an email
to tell her about it.

756
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,760
What did she say?

757
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,360
She told me to stop finding him,

758
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,440
but I knew deep down

759
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,070
she wanted me to find her dad.

760
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,400
So no matter what happens,

761
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,710
you must find him?

762
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,030
I must see him.

763
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,630
Everything has been strange recently.

764
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,510
I feel extremely confused.

765
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,590
I think everyone is hiding something

766
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,590
from me.

767
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
I must see Lan Bin.

768
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,110
I want to know what happened.

769
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,510
All I want is an answer.

770
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,590
Even if the answer is a nightmare,

771
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,510
you'll still persist?

772
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,190
He's inside.

773
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,590
Thank you.

774
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,840
Mr. Lan.

775
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,920
You are...

776
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Yingzi?

777
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,800
Is it really you?

778
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,150
Yes.

779
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,920
I'm Huang Yingzi.

780
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,550
You still remember me?

781
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,440
Do you remember your daughter,

782
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,670
Lan Yifei?

783
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm a scum.

784
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,550
I wronged her.

785
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,190
Over these years,
have you gone to look for Yifei?

786
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,190
I don't have the courage to see her.

787
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,880
I'd rather not know anything!

788
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,150
Stop asking me!

789
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Mr. Lan,

790
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,670
Yifei misses you a lot.

791
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,230
I'm sure she wants to see you.

792
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,760
Yifei might be overseas now,

793
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,760
but she'll come home one day.

794
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,920
You can meet her, then.

795
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,710
Yingzi,

796
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,320
didn't you know?

797
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,400
What?
