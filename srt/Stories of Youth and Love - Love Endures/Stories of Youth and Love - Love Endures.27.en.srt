3
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,070
(Lan Yifei.)

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,510
Why are you acting innocent?

5
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,680
And Guan Chao.

6
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,070
Are you dumb?

7
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:37,760
Did you know

8
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,480
you were cuckolded?

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Are you out of your mind?

10
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,870
What are you saying?

11
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,870
I have the photo.

12
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,790
Don't believe me? Take a look.

13
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,120
Look at the photo.

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,310
Everyone, come and check it out.

15
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,480
Am I right?

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,350
Is this not Lan Yifei?

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,560
It really is Lan Yifei.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,070
Indeed, that's Lan Yifei.

19
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,510
Yes.

20
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,710
It's really her.

21
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,640
What's going on?

22
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,590
Am I right?

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Really?

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
Is it Lan Yifei?

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
This photo

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,120
has gone viral in the class group.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
You're the last one to know.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,510
Give me your phone!

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,560
Guan Chao!

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,640
No, no, no!

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,710
Let go, let go!

32
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,760
Yifei!

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,430
Say it again!

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,190
Let go, let go!

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,080
Say it again!

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,030
Yifei has left.

37
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,120
What are you doing?

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,840
Yifei!

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,470
Quickly delete the photo
from your phone.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,630
Yifei.

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,310
Yifei.

42
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,960
What happened to you?

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,910
Tell me.

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Why are you crying?

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,240
Talk to me.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,560
Let's face this together, okay?

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
I don't know.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
I really don't know anything.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Stop crying.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,310
Who is that person? Tell me.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,520
I'll look for him now.

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,470
Don't go.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,630
Who is it?

54
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,800
Tell me.

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,590
Dai Wei.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Dai Wei?

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,430
The one who went to jail

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,710
for hurting someone for you?

59
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
You're up.

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,840
How did I end up here?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,310
You drank too much yesterday.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,630
We were supposed to send you
back to the wonton shop,

63
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,400
but

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,630
it was closed.

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,710
So we came here.

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,630
What are you afraid of, Yifei?

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't do anything to you.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I want to go home.

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,280
Yifei. Yifei.

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
No, let's talk some more.

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
I want to go home!

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Listen to me.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Let's talk a bit more.

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
There's nothing left to say between us.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,750
Yifei.

76
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,560
Let go. I want to go home!

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
That day...

78
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,560
He told me that day

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,680
that he saw my dad.

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,240
He said he'd take me to see my dad.

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,310
So I went with him.

82
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,920
We went to a bar.

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,190
I don't know about the rest.

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
What did he do to you after that?

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,950
He really didn't do anything.

86
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,750
Yingzi.

87
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,870
Please believe me.

88
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,070
The photo is fake.

89
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,750
He really didn't do anything.

90
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,000
That's fake.

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,430
I believe you, Yifei.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,950
I believe you.

93
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,680
Yifei.

94
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,920
Remember.

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,070
No matter what happens,

96
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm by your side.

97
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,920
Don't cry.

98
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,310
Don't cry, Yifei.

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,870
Don't cry.

100
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,190
It's okay, Yifei.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,480
Delete the photo!

102
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,680
Who do you think you are?

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,510
How dare you negotiate with me?

104
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,190
If you dare harass Yifei again,

105
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,600
trust me

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,070
I'll hit you every time I see you!

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,160
Keep him alive.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,390
Don't move!

109
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,240
Yifei.

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,630
Go back and rest.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,510
Leave it to me and Mingyu here.

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,950
I'm fine.

113
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,630
Boss.

114
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,800
Check, please.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,830
You had two bowls of wonton.

116
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,950
One grilled sausage.

117
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,510
It should be 25 yuan.

118
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm giving you some business.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,310
If you bother about this small amount,

120
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
who will come in the future?

121
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,120
We've been running this shop

122
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
for decades.

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,390
We rely on our capabilities.

124
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,800
Yes,

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,360
you are truly capable.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,070
That's why you could seduce a big boss.

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Don't talk nonsense.

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,430
Don't listen to rumors.

130
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,480
Rumors?

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,600
In this small place like Hangtian City,

132
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
who hasn't seen her photo?

133
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,870
Trying to seduce men

134
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,800
at this young age.

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't you talk nonsense!

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,270
I didn't even complain
about your cleanliness.

137
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,430
You and your wife opened
a stinky tofu shop

138
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,600
at the bridgehead, right?

139
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,190
Yes.

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,190
What's wrong?

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
I've seen you fooling around
with other women

142
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,920
when your wife is away.

143
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't talk nonsense.

144
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,270
I'm not talking nonsense.

145
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,950
You're a father yourself.

146
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,920
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

147
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
You know what? I could go see
your wife now

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,830
and tell her all your dirty deeds!

149
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,270
Shut up!

150
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,950
Don't talk nonsense.

151
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,920
If you don't want me to talk nonsense,

152
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,950
pay the full amount

153
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,830
and get lost!

154
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,160
Pay up, five yuan!

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Here.

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,720
Here.

157
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,600
Get lost!

158
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,950
Don't talk nonsense again!

159
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,720
Yifei, don't mind him.

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,070
He was just bluffing.

161
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,040
Bluffing you.

162
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,480
You know?

163
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,750
He wants to extort us.

164
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,070
Next time we meet someone like him,

165
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,160
let's scare him away.

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
I don't care what they say.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,070
But I'm afraid Grandma will be worried
if she hears this.

168
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,270
We have to let Dai Wei clarify this.

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,190
Otherwise, the rumors will spread.

170
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,920
If we could do it like in the movies

171
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,160
by hacking into all the phones

172
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,560
and deleting all the photos inside,
that would be great.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,390
But the one guy who can do it among us

174
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,720
is not here.

175
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh no.

176
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,120
This is bad.

177
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,440
What's wrong?

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,390
Guan Chao is in trouble.

179
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's go.

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,120
To Guan Chao's home.

181
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,630
I'll go find my dad.

182
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,720
You guys wait here.

183
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,630
Stop!

184
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,240
Stop trashing my place
or I'll call the police!

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,150
Call them, then.

186
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,510
If you call the police,
they'll start with your son.

187
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,000
University student.

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,240
Too bad.

189
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,080
He hit someone

190
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
and smashed a store.

191
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
He'll get a few years

192
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,320
if he's caught.

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,510
It'll be over for him.

194
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
Let him be.

195
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,000
He has to take responsibility

196
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
for his own actions.

197
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,750
Acting so impulsively.

198
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,390
It's a good opportunity.

199
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,960
Jailing him for two years
should teach him a lesson.

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,480
But Dai Wei is in trouble.

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,790
If Guan Chao was arrested,

202
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,200
he can't escape either.

203
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
What's the matter?

204
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,000
He regrets not staying inside longer?

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,870
He just came out,
now he wants to go back in again?

206
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,480
Young girl.

207
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,750
Who are you?

208
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,630
That's not important.

209
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,630
What matters is

210
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,550
Guan Chao's business is our business.

211
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
Can you make the decision?

212
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,320
Speak up.

213
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,390
What's your condition
for releasing Guan Chao?

214
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,910
What do you think?

215
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,550
How much money?

216
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,870
500? Sure.

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll pay up.

218
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,200
500?

219
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,000
That's not even enough
to pay for my cigarettes.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,320
It's 50,000, lady!

221
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,750
This is daylight robbery!

222
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,960
You don't have it?

223
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,440
Then there's nothing to talk about.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Go back and tell Dai Wei.

225
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,750
We can pay the money.

226
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Hurry up and release him,

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,550
or it won't be as simple
as going to jail.

228
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,720
Huang.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,240
I...

230
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,550
If the kid loses a single hair,

231
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,030
we won't let you off!

232
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,270
Get lost!

233
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,030
I was so scared just now, Dad.

234
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
What do you want to eat?

235
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
A bowl of wonton.

236
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,000
Your wonton is the best.

237
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,910
Young man.

238
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,960
What happened to your head?

239
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,390
I fell off my bike.

240
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,550
You have to be careful.

241
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,440
Okay.

242
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,000
Our shop here

243
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,270
has been open for decades.

244
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,320
The customers who come and go,

245
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,510
I recognize them all.

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
But you seem

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,510
unfamiliar.

248
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,600
Have you been here before?

249
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,630
I've been here once.

250
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,870
Last time,
your granddaughter treated me.

251
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,870
Speaking of which,

252
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,840
we are considered old friends.

253
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,910
Do you know Yifei?

254
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,320
Looks like

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
she never mentioned me to you.

256
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,000
I...

257
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,510
I can see you're several years
older than her.

258
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,480
You don't seem like classmates.

259
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,080
We aren't classmates.

260
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Well,

261
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,550
I was expelled
before finishing middle school.

262
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
Well,

263
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,120
how did you two meet?

264
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,550
Well, Hangtian City is so small.

265
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,120
After seeing each other a lot,

266
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,270
we naturally got to know each other.

267
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,790
Please don't misunderstand.

268
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,440
Yifei is

269
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,960
a very, very good girl.

270
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,360
She even helped me before.

271
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,870
Is that so?

272
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,360
This child didn't tell me.

273
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,720
If I had known it earlier,

274
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,390
I would've added an egg for you.

275
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
Grandma.

276
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,150
I'll come often in the future.

277
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,030
We'll get acquainted.

278
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,270
Great.

279
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,840
By the way...

280
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,440
Here's a little something for you.

281
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,840
I can't accept this.

282
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,270
Please take it.

283
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,320
Take it as

284
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,080
a gift to Yifei.

285
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,510
Well, thank you.

286
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,270
Please sit.

287
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,320
Let me get you some soup.

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,750
I'll finish this first.

289
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,510
Go ahead.

290
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,080
Sorry, my friends.

291
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
These were all your gifts for me.

292
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,080
But now,

293
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,200
they have a bigger purpose.

294
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,790
Stefanie.

295
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,390
If you can bless me

296
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,550
through this difficult time,

297
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,670
I will

298
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,840
buy a thousand albums
to repay you in the future.

299
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,390
I hope

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,480
I can sell you for a good price.

301
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,670
Dad.

302
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,910
This is all I have.

303
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,950
This is also all I have.

304
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,320
Why did you put it in the sock?

305
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,630
This is clean.

306
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,870
I've never worn it.

307
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
The most dangerous place

308
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,630
is the safest.

309
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,960
Don't let your mom know.

310
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,240
Otherwise, we're both finished.

311
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Understood.

312
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,510
Who's finished?

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What's this for?

314
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
Buying groceries.

315
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,720
Buying groceries.

317
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,720
Buying groceries?

318
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,440
With your little scattered money,

319
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,750
what can you do?

320
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,840
Still hiding it from me?

321
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,510
Mom, I beg of you.

322
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,150
Please help us this time.

323
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,000
Guan Chao beat someone up badly.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
If they call the police,

325
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
Guan Chao won't be able
to go to university.

326
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,150
Even if they didn't tell the police,

327
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,120
there is no telling
what Dai Wei might do.

328
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,600
Did you forget about Ma Mingliang?

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,550
A few years ago,
he was beaten badly by Dai Wei.

330
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,600
Please, save him.

331
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,270
With your little money?

332
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,320
Your mother will help you.

333
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Thank you, Mom!

334
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,910
I knew it, you're the best!

335
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,270
That's enough.

336
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,910
Here.

337
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,440
No need to take it. No need.

338
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,870
Go, hurry.

339
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm going.

340
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Okay.

341
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,550
Slow down.

342
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,320
Why are you getting excited too?

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,080
Really.

344
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,600
These two.

345
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,960
How about it, Mom?

346
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,750
Do we have enough money?

347
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,910
I still have a few hundred yuan
of New Year's money.

348
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,630
I'll go get it.

349
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,360
Okay, go get it.

350
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,720
Mom.

351
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
There's still so much New Year's money.

352
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,910
Mom, what are you doing?

353
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,600
Mom, open the door.

354
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,270
Son.

355
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,120
Now that you've finally been
admitted to university.

356
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,080
You...

357
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,960
Now, you mustn't have any accidents.

358
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,750
I will deliver the money to the Huangs
and come back.

359
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,550
I'll be fine, Mom.

360
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,000
Open the door, please.

361
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,630
Guan Chao needs us.

362
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,790
Mom, did you hear me?

363
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,390
Are you still here? Open the door.

364
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,680
The place where Mingyu
goes to university is cold.

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,550
Tomorrow,

366
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,920
we should get her two wool blankets.

367
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,160
Now that she's in university,

368
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,790
she should have a laptop.

369
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,680
One day,

370
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,920
I'll take Mingyu to choose one.

371
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,960
Dad, Mom.

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,400
What about Guan Chao and Yifei?

373
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,440
Are you really not going to
get involved in their affair?

374
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,070
How can we get involved?

375
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,790
They won't release Guan Chao

376
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,310
just because we are involved.

377
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,200
But everyone is trying
to find a solution.

378
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
I know you care about your friends.

379
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
But this matter

380
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,510
is beyond our control.

381
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,920
This child.

382
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,310
Yifei.

383
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,400
We're almost done cleaning.

384
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
Go upstairs and rest.

385
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,510
It's okay, Grandma.

386
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,590
I'll be done right away.

387
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,640
You rest first.

388
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,029
Yifei.

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Yifei.

390
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:48,750
Yifei.

391
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,510
What's wrong?

392
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,640
It's okay, Grandma.

393
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,790
Grandma.

394
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,590
Did someone

395
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,920
come by today?

396
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,590
Just the regulars.

397
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,750
I remember now.

398
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,030
There was a man.

399
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,110
I hadn't seen him before.

400
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,790
Thin.

401
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,550
Tall.

402
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,030
In his thirties.

403
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,830
He said he knew you.

404
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,920
What did he say to you?

405
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,750
He said you helped him before.

406
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,030
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,310
Did he

408
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,510
only tell you these things?

409
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,510
He also said he would come often

410
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,310
to help us

411
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,350
with the wonton business.

412
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
He even gave us a fruit basket.

413
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,590
Why do you look so upset?

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm fine.

415
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,240
I just stayed up late
at a class reunion yesterday.

416
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm tired.

417
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,680
I've made soup for you.

418
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,880
I'll serve you a bowl.

419
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,750
Eat it.

420
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,030
And go to sleep.

421
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,400
Don't go in.

422
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,070
I'll talk to them alone.

423
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,200
Dad.

424
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm not afraid.

425
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,480
But I am.

426
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,160
You're still young.

427
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,440
You're about to go to university.

428
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,550
You can't get involved.

429
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Dad.

430
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,920
This had nothing to do
with you initially.

431
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,510
But would you ignore it?

432
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,000
I seem to have inherited

433
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,680
your sense of justice and nosiness.

434
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
In short,

435
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
since you won't ignore this matter,

436
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
I won't either.

437
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,510
You don't know what's going on in there.

438
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,240
Dad.

439
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,070
We, the Huangs have
faced many troubles.

440
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,790
How could I let you go in alone

441
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,310
and watch from here?

442
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,200
Let me go in with you.

443
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
Mr. Huang, Yingzi.

444
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,680
Why are you here?

445
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,680
Didn't you say you couldn't come
just now?

446
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,480
I forced the door open.

447
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,240
Mr. Huang, take this.

448
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,510
I jumped off the building.

449
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,550
I live on the first floor.

450
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,200
Are you okay?

451
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
I'm fine.

452
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,720
Hurry up and go back.

453
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,110
Go back now.

454
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,640
No.

455
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
Mr. Huang.

456
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,160
That's our friend.

457
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,350
We have to go.

458
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,070
Yes.

459
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,110
We will pay if we have the money,

460
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,830
and contribute all our strength.

461
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,830
Dad.

462
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
The six of us are one.

463
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,550
Guan Chao is inside.

464
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,070
Just let us in.

465
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,590
Okay.

466
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,310
You are all good kids.

467
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,590
Let's go.

468
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,510
Let's go.

469
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,070
Boss.

470
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,070
We got the money.

471
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,680
What's due to you

472
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,920
will be paid, not a penny less.

473
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,240
Mr. Huang.

474
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,790
You're a man of your word.

475
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,030
Can we let him go now?

476
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,240
Mr. Huang.

477
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,160
You can't give him the money!

478
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Guan Chao, stop talking.

479
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,790
If you don't delete the photo,

480
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,750
this matter is not over yet!

481
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't move!

482
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,640
Stand still and don't move.

483
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,590
Guan Chao, listen closely.

484
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,640
Compared to what I did for Yifei,

485
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,160
you are nothing.

486
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,270
Sir.

487
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,920
You've kept your word.

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,000
The sum is correct.

489
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,270
I'll release him.

490
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,960
But Guan Chao

491
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,070
has to kneel down and kowtow to me.

492
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,790
Bullcrap!

493
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,440
Guan Chao.

494
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,000
What are you doing?

495
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,750
You guys are too much!

496
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,590
Guan Chao.

497
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,640
Squat down, don't move.

498
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,240
Squat down, don't move.

499
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Okay.

500
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,000
Guan Chao.

501
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,310
Are you alright?

502
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
Are you okay, Guan Chao?

503
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,920
I know you came for me.

504
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't make things difficult for them.

505
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,350
I'll talk to you.

506
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,680
Yifei.

507
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,110
You are finally willing to contact me

508
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,830
and see me.

509
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,790
Can you please stop bothering them?

510
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,790
How did I bother them?

511
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,270
It was your friend named Guan Chao

512
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,400
who came to bother me first.

513
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,440
Look at my head.

514
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,400
He did this.

515
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,510
I apologize to you on his behalf.

516
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,160
You don't have to.

517
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,510
How will you let Guan Chao go?

518
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,350
Well...

519
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,880
If you want money,

520
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
I can help him

521
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
pay you.

522
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,510
If you

523
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,590
want me to stop contacting him,

524
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,030
I will stop doing that.

525
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,270
Just leave him alone.

526
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,880
When did I say these words?

527
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,790
Did I ask you to do these things?

528
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,200
Why are you

529
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,000
always mentioning this Guan Chao?

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,240
Guan Chao?

531
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,160
Sorry, Yifei.

532
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
Sorry.

533
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,270
How about this?

534
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,830
Let me

535
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,350
ask you nicely.

536
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,590
Tell me.

537
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,790
What do I, Dai Wei,

538
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,510
lack in comparison

539
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,200
with Guan Chao?

540
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,790
Tell me.

541
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,200
Let go.

542
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,110
Can you tell me?

543
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,510
I'm begging you.

544
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,000
Let go!

545
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,480
Yifei!

546
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,680
Tell me, Yifei!

547
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,350
Are you crazy?

548
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,400
Yifei, tell...

549
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,960
Let go!

550
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,590
Tell me!

551
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,550
Help!

552
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,830
Let me go!

553
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,160
Tell me!

554
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,030
Let me go!

555
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,720
Help!

556
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,000
Help!

557
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,270
Help!

558
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
Listen to me.

559
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,110
Yifei.

560
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,310
This Dai Wei.

561
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,160
He must die!

562
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,880
Yingzi.

563
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,240
Don't go.

564
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,480
Yifei.

565
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,310
Let's call the police.

566
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,160
Why not?

567
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
We have no other options now.

568
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,550
We can only call the police.

569
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,790
If we call the police,

570
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,640
everyone will know it.

571
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,110
Yingzi.

572
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,000
I beg of you.

573
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
I beg of you.

574
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,880
Don't let anyone know, okay?

575
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Now,

576
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,750
I just want you to accompany me.

577
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
Okay.

578
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,270
Okay.

579
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,590
I promise you.

580
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,830
I won't call the police.

581
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
I won't tell anyone.

582
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,310
Don't worry.

583
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,440
Yifei.

584
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,000
Let go.

585
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,790
Let go!

586
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,720
Yifei!

587
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,830
(Lan Yifei.)

588
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
(Why are you acting innocent?)

589
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,750
(Trying to seduce men)

590
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,240
(at such a young age.)

591
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
(Guan Chao,)

592
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,590
(are you dumb?)

593
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,680
No matter what you are going through...

594
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,920
(Did you know)

595
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,880
(you were cuckolded?)

596
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,270
I want to face it all with you.

597
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,830
(Don't touch me!)

598
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,350
(Listen to me!)

599
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,680
Yingzi.

600
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,510
Did you know?

601
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,440
Sometimes,

602
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,310
I envy you and Mingyu very much.

603
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,480
Maybe a little jealous, even.

604
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,920
Your parents

605
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
love you so much.

606
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,640
No matter what happens,

607
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,160
they will always stand in front of you.

608
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,550
But I have nothing.

609
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,310
I only have you guys.

610
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,070
Something I've always been proud of

611
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,110
is having a good,

612
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,070
pure boy who likes me.

613
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,000
But now I'm losing him too.

614
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,240
You won't.

615
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,310
You won't lose him.

616
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,750
Guan Chao will never leave you.

617
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
We will never leave you.

618
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,920
Yingzi.

619
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,110
I want to see my mom. Come with me.

620
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,160
I miss her.

621
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,720
Sure.

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,030
I'm leaving.

623
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,960
Don't worry.

624
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,480
Chat for as long as you want.

625
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I'll wait for you here.

626
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,400
Mom.

627
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,440
Well...

628
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,000
How did you...

629
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,880
How did you find this place?

630
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,110
Grandma told me your address.

631
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,000
I...

632
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,240
I miss you.

633
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,000
I just want to see you.

634
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,830
How are you doing recently?

635
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,880
Have you settled
your university affairs?

636
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,750
Everything is fine.

637
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,750
I was admitted to
the Central Dance Academy.

638
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,110
Really?

639
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,750
That's great!

640
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,750
That's great.

641
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,070
I'm really proud of you.

642
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,110
Hurry up, Dongdong.

643
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,550
Mommy.

644
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,480
Let's go now.

645
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
Okay, Dongdong.

646
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,110
I will come right away, okay?

647
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,510
We'll wait for you outside.

648
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,240
Okay.

649
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,680
Yifei.

650
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,270
Seems like you are doing well.

651
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,160
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

652
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,440
Some day,

653
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,360
I’ll go visit you and your grandma.

654
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,590
Just

655
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,590
don't come here looking for me anymore.

656
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,800
Yingzi.

657
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,880
Yifei.

658
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,320
How was it?

659
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,510
Did you see your mom?

660
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
What did she say?

661
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Was she happy to see you?

662
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,710
She missed me a lot.

663
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,230
She kept asking me how I was doing.

664
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,550
She even invited me to her home.

665
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,110
I saw

666
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,510
my photos in her home.

667
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,190
She told me to dance well.

668
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,590
And she will go to see my performances.

669
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,440
Really?

670
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,510
I'm relieved.

671
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,590
I was worried that your mom might...

672
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,030
Don't worry.

673
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,550
Anyway,

674
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,070
I'm leaving Hangtian City soon.

675
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,800
All these bad things

676
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,030
are in the past.

677
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm going to Beijing.

678
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,480
Over there, I will lead a new life

679
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,760
and

680
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,630
embrace my passion, which is dancing.

681
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,000
That's right.

682
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
It's a new page in Beijing.

683
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,710
When the time comes,

684
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,630
we will get the first-row tickets

685
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,800
to your performances, alright?

686
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,760
Don't just think about me.

687
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
After going to Communication University,

688
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,190
you will definitely become
the best reporter.

689
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,110
You must expose

690
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,030
all the injustices and darkness.

691
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,710
I will try my best.

692
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,960
Let's work hard together.

693
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,710
I trust you.

694
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,440
It can definitely be done.

695
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,070
Yingzi.

696
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
Thank you.

697
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,960
I'm a little hungry.

698
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,710
I want to eat some potato chips.

699
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,320
Can you buy it for me?

700
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,480
No problem.

701
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,230
I'll go and buy it for you.

702
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,590
Let's eat it together later.

703
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,710
I will be right back.

704
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,110
Sir.

705
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,800
Do you have sour cream
and onion potato chips?

706
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
The second row of shelves from the back.

707
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,710
Take it yourself.

708
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,510
Thanks.

709
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,550
How much?

710
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,230
Six yuan.

711
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,000
Thanks.

712
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,710
Why is there a girl here?

713
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,920
She jumped off the residential building.

714
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,320
Yes, so young.

715
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,280
Why did she jump off the building?

716
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,440
What a pity.

717
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,920
She seems to be only 18 or 19.

718
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,280
Oh my God.

719
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,110
What happened?

720
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,840
How could someone so young
jump off a building?

721
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,190
Such a beautiful girl.

722
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,510
Poor thing.

723
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,360
Yeah.

724
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,670
Why did she do this?

725
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,070
What should her parents do?

726
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,840
Call the police now.

727
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,590
Call the police already.

728
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,110
Did something happen to her?

729
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,190
We called the police.

730
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,150
(Yingzi.)

731
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,440
(Thank you.)

732
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,360
(I'm a little hungry.)

733
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,760
(I want some potato chips.)

734
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,590
Can you buy it for me?

735
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,550
(No problem.)

736
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,590
(I'll buy you some potato chips.)

737
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,230
(Wait for me.)

738
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,480
I will be right back.

739
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
Yingzi.

740
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,320
(Help me to take care of Yifei.)

741
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,480
(She missed me a lot.)

742
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,840
(She told me to dance well.)

743
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
And she will go to see my performances.

744
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,760
(I'm going to Beijing.)

745
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,030
(I will lead a new life)

746
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,670
(and embrace my passion,
which is dancing.)

747
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,630
What happened to me?

748
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,630
What happened?

749
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,590
Why does my head hurt so much?

750
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,150
Daughter.

751
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,400
Yifei’s incident...

752
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,360
Yifei?

753
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,800
What happened to Yifei?

754
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
Where is Yifei?

755
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,320
Where is Yifei?

756
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,550
I was with her just now.

757
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,880
We were going to see her mom.

758
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,510
What happened then?

759
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,630
Then,

760
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,070
after seeing her mother,

761
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,000
she told me she had a great time
chatting with her mom.

762
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,000
She wants to dance well.

763
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,590
We will head to Beijing together.

764
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,510
Then we will have fun together.

765
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,550
After that,

766
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,710
why don't I remember anything?

767
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,150
What did I do next?

768
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Yingzi.

769
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,710
Did you have heat stroke?

770
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,190
Maybe the heat got to you.

771
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,630
Yeah, you're right.

772
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,880
This summer is exceptionally hot.

773
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,400
Your mom will make you

774
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
some mung bean porridge for you later.

775
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,590
That will cool you down.

776
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,670
But why isn't Yifei here to see me

777
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,110
even though I have a heat stroke?

778
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,440
Yifei called.

779
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,000
She told us to pick you up.

780
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,710
She received a sudden notice
from a dance troupe.

781
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,710
She left.

782
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,760
So sudden.

783
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,030
She's afraid you'll be sad.

784
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,110
She didn't have time to tell you.

785
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,630
What's there to be sad about?

786
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,440
We'll meet up in Beijing soon.

787
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,110
What's wrong with you two?

788
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,070
Why are you two crying?

789
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,630
I thought you were in so much pain

790
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,630
that you couldn't wake up.

791
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,510
That's why you fainted.

792
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,110
You passed out.

793
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm a little anxious.

794
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,550
I'm too anxious.

795
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,630
Silly girl.

796
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm fine.

797
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm fine.

798
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,440
Am I not awake now?

799
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,510
It's just a heat stroke.

800
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:33,920
What's the big deal?

801
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,630
She's right.

802
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,840
Why cry?

803
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,590
No need to cry. No need.

804
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,760
Quickly, make the mung bean porridge.

805
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,760
Everything's fine.

806
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,070
It's heat stroke. That's it.

807
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,550
Let me help.

808
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,960
Stop crying.

809
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm fine.

810
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,030
Okay, I won't cry.

811
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,710
Yingzi has been having
nightmares about Yifei lately.

812
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,920
She even asked me

813
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,190
where Yifei is.

814
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,480
She wants to see Yifei.

815
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,840
Didn’t we all agree

816
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,400
to say that Yifei was
suddenly accepted by a dance troupe?

817
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,070
And that she's performing overseas?

818
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,510
You didn't let it slip, did you?

819
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,550
Of course I didn't.

820
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,710
But I'm scared.

821
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
We've been lying to her like this.

822
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,070
She might find out one day.

823
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,590
If she finds out,

824
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,840
she'll definitely be angry.

825
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,920
Mr. Huang took Yingzi to a checkup.

826
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,400
The doctor said

827
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,630
this is a stress response

828
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,150
from psychological trauma.

829
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,150
In order to protect her,

830
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,150
the body chose to forget.

831
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,230
The doctor also said

832
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,670
there is no effective cure
in the short term.

833
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,880
We can only observe her.

834
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,320
She can't take another hit.

835
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,150
How long should we observe her?

836
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
It feels really bad

837
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,510
lying to her.

838
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,070
I feel so anxious

839
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,480
and useless at the same time.

840
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,960
I really hope that the old Huang Yingzi

841
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,920
can come back.

842
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,110
Go back to when everyone was here.

843
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,440
I wish to go back too.

844
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,800
Maybe this is all part of growing up.

845
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,360
Let's grit our teeth together

846
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,800
and get through it.

847
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,280
Now only the two of us
can accompany her.

848
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,670
Maybe there's someone who can help her.
