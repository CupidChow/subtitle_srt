[Love Endures]

00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,180
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,310
(Stop joking.)

4
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,590
Reading club?

5
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,680
My popularity expired long ago.

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
I no longer have any fans.

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
It's fine.

8
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,790
All of our employees

9
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,280
are loyal fans of yours.

10
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm a fan too.

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,590
That's why we hope you could hold a reading club.

12
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,710
Alright, then.

13
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,590
But let me make this clear.

14
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710
You cannot promote it

15
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,920
or invite any media.

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,150
If so, I can only invite my old customers.

17
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,840
We won't serve any outsiders.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Don 't worry about it.

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,920
We got a new batch of books lately.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,680
You can take a look.

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,560
Call me if you need anything.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,060
Okay.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
(I've read all three of your novels)

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,400
plenty of times.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,120
I even read the novels you mentioned

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,030
within your novels.

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,190
Except for one.

28
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,910
"Ventriloquy" by Qiu Hui.

29
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
I couldn't find it.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,910
(I love to invent fictional things.)

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,360
(For example, a book,)

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,630
(a dream,)

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,120
(or a friend .)

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
(Making up things isn't the same as deceiving.)

35
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,470
(On the contrary,)

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,910
(making up things forms a sort of reality.)

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,080
(A sort of poetic reality.)

38
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,400
(In this world where the line between reality and fantasy is blurred,)

39
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,360
(there are some things that are always there.)

40
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,910
(One day, you'll read them,)

41
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,630
(discover them,)

42
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
(and encounter them.)

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,750
This prank

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,280
is pretty good.

45
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,430
This isn't a prank .

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Although

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,310
"Ventriloquy" is not a real book,

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,520
just like you,

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,310
I believe that it exists in the world.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
It's just that you haven't written it out yet.

51
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,000
So, you checked Hua University's school magazine?

52
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,520
I saw the seven short stories you published

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,910
when you were still studying.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,590
Wasn't I dumb?

55
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,120
Not at all.

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,400
I think those are

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,630
the seven weapons you used to fight against the world.

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,720
"Seven Weapons?"

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,720
That's a novel by Gu Long.

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,480
That's right.

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,830
I think you're just like Gu Long.

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,480
You're a romantic hero

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,510
in a tragedy.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,630
At most, my life is considered a tragedy.

65
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,310
I'm definitely not a hero.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Indeed.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,070
You look more like an assassin.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,160
Is this how you 're trying to persuade me

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,360
to accept your interview?

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,160
Actually, I didn't come here

71
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,040
to persuade you to accept my interview.

72
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,920
I have an important goal to achieve.

73
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
I wish to be your friend.

74
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,160
This is

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,000
a shop I treasure a lot .

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,390
Usually, I don't tell other people about it.

77
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,310
I highly recommend

78
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,390
their fish porridge.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,270
It's super delicious.

80
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,390
You must add some shredded ginger

81
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,190
and Chinese parsley.

82
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,390
It tastes superb.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
I don't take Chinese parsley.

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,360
Haven't you heard of this before?

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,270
Every person

86
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,160
has a friend

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
who introduces them to Chinese parsley.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,750
Maybe I'm that friend.

89
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,000
If so, it's impossible for me to try them out.

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,270
You...

91
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,390
It's difficult to make friends with you.

92
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,870
I don 't like to make friends.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,750
Got it.

94
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,920
This is part of your personality.

95
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,920
It's very unique.

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,040
But I'm curious about something.

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,830
Why did you become a cab driver, then?

98
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,190
A cab driver needs to engage

99
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,720
a lot of people, right?

100
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,510
How are these two factors related?

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,870
You've called plenty of cabs before this, right?

102
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,430
How many times did you notice the cab drivers?

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
You see,

104
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
I notice all of them.

105
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,270
Maybe it's because I'm a reporter.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,120
I love to observe the people around me.

107
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,600
I met a cab driver who did a live stream while working.

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
Another one was sending his child to school while working.

109
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,040
There's another guy who had no choice but to work as

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
a cab driver

111
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,120
as he just got a divorce and had no home to return to.

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,630
Most of them

113
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,270
became cab drivers

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,390
because their businesses failed.

115
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,720
Anyway, it's interesting.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
All of them are amazing.

117
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm different from them.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,630
I became a cab driver

119
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,920
because I like to be an audience.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Whenever a passenger gets into my car,

121
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,390
it's just like the opening of a movie.

122
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,310
There are all kinds of people

123
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,390
and interesting things.

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
They're fun

125
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,630
yet real at the same time.

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,430
I want to be the audience of life itself.

127
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,560
I was lost in your words just now.

128
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,070
It's no wonder you're a famous author.

129
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,120
I don't like being an audience.

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,190
I love to interact with people.

131
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,390
You've always been alone

132
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,600
without any friends.

133
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Don't you feel like you lack a link

134
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
between you and the world?

135
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,800
To be friends, you must be on the same frequency

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,750
and speak a common language.

137
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,800
I don't believe that there are that many people

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,160
who are on the same frequency as me.

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,390
If so, how can you know

140
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,120
that we aren't on the same frequency?

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,830
Waiter, order.

142
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,070
Coming.

143
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,190
You can make the order.

144
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,750
What would you like to order?

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
I want fried beef with lotus root

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,560
without beef.

147
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,310
Seaweed meatballs

148
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,360
without the meatballs.

149
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,310
Pork tripe with scallion oil

150
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,000
without pork tripe.

151
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,680
Are you sure they won't chase you out

152
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,160
for making an order like that?

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,720
It's your turn.

154
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,070
I want Hakka tofu

155
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,920
without the tofu.

156
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,870
Pork belly with preserved vegetables

157
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,600
without pork.

158
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
Dongchang pan-fried beef patty

159
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
without beef.

160
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,190
Thank you.

161
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,510
You guys are...

162
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,800
We were just kidding.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,430
We'll take a look at the menu.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,870
Sure.

165
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,920
You guys can take your time.

166
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,630
You see?

167
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,360
The same frequency can be nurtured.

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,430
Making friends isn't the point when it comes to making friends.

169
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,800
It's how you spend time with your friends.

170
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,630
Mister,

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,430
is Takeaway No. 23 ready?

172
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,000
It's on the table.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,680
Find it yourself.

174
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,870
I'll take it.

175
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,870
I heard that Stefanie

176
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,510
is going to hold a tour soon.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,150
Of course I know that.

178
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,360
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.

179
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,390
When is it?

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
You guys better remember this.

181
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
It's on the 6th of November.

182
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,790
Do you wish to attend it?

183
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,960
Lan Bin!

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,750
Stop right there!

185
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,270
Dad?

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,840
Stop running!

187
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,340
Yifei!

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,600
Lan Yifei!

189
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,790
Hurry and call my father!

190
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,480
Mingyu,

191
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,030
let's go.

192
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,080
Let's head over there .

193
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,120
Stop right there!

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,910
Keep running.

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll see where you can escape to.

196
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Lan Bin,

197
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,960
you still have the guts to come out and play Mahjong?

198
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,030
The boiler room in the factory exploded

199
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,200
all because of your negligence.

200
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,670
My brother became a cripple.

201
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,550
He had to use a wheelchair since then.

202
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,960
You must've forgotten about it, huh?

203
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,200
The factory said

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,870
the explosion

205
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,080
had nothing to do with me.

206
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,670
Do you think it has nothing to do with you

207
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,870
just because you said so?

208
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,840
Who knows

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
how you bribed the factory manager?

210
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,630
Maybe you sent that beautiful wife of yours

211
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,960
to do something about it.

212
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
Don't spout nonsense!

213
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,240
So what if I'm spouting nonsense?

214
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,870
Ma Mingliang!

215
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,480
They came in a group, you know?

216
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,270
Stop that!

217
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
You're not allowed to bully him!

218
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,510
Did you actually prepare this for them?

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,750
Where did this lass come from?

220
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,820
What?

221
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,670
Do you know me?

222
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,320
I know you!

223
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,080
You're

224
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,549
Ma Mingliang,

225
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,629
the person who fell into the dung pit, right?

226
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,600
After you fell into the dung pit,

227
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,549
my father was the one

228
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:58,509
who rescued you.

229
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,390
Did you forget?

230
00:09:59,390 --> 00:09:59,789
Your brother!

231
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:00,789
My father performed surgery

232
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:01,479
on your brother.

233
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,910
He wouldn't even be able to use the wheelchair without him.

234
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,670
Are you

235
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
Huang Qifa's daughter?

236
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,510
Yeah.

237
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah, I am.

238
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,120
Fine.

239
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,000
Your father helped me out.

240
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,030
I won't hold it against you guys today.

241
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,870
But this matter

242
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,910
has nothing to do with you.

243
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,200
Go and play by yourself.

244
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,390
If not,

245
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,960
I'll show you no mercy!

246
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,630
I'll be the one showing you no mercy!

247
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,630
You !

248
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,390
Lan Bin,

249
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,790
you're something else.

250
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,870
Not only did you not repay your debt,

251
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,320
but you also found two lasses to protect you.

252
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,000
Where is he?

253
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,240
Mr. Huang!

254
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,390
Wait.

255
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,510
Ma?

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Wait.

257
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,750
Are you okay?

258
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,910
I'm fine.

259
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,240
Ma,

260
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
how much did he owe you?

261
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
Huang,

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,870
why are you helping

263
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,790
a scum like him?

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,910
Ma.

265
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,670
I'm asking you.

266
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,630
How much did he owe you?

267
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,960
But...

268
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,960
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

269
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,670
I' ll definitely

270
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,150
return the money to you later.

271
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,030
This is between us adults.

272
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Kids like you shouldn't interfere.

273
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,240
Lan Bin,

274
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,630
as the saying goes,

275
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,840
help the urgent, not the needy.

276
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,510
This will never end.

277
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,910
I can't help you out every time.

278
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,510
Don't do it again.

279
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,320
I won't.

280
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,630
I won't.

281
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,390
Thank you guys so much.

282
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,120
Let's head back now.

283
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,670
Dad,

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,150
now that you've repaid his debt for him,

285
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,630
does that mean we have no money to buy food now?

286
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
You won't starve.

287
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,030
Look at how chubby you look.

288
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,200
You should lose some weight.

289
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,870
Speak for yourself.

290
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,000
What if this happens again?

291
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,080
Mr. Huang, you can't help him out for the rest of his life.

292
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,200
I already told the factory

293
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
to hire him as a driver.

294
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,390
Although it's tiring,

295
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,870
it's a stable job.

296
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,670
Let's go.

297
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,550
Let's go back and have dinner.

298
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,030
Let's go, Mingyu.

299
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,670
(Yifei.)

300
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Yifei, I know my fault now.

301
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,790
I know my fault now.

302
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,750
I swear.

303
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,030
This is the last time.

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,510
If this happens again,

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
may the heavens strike me down.

306
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,390
(Yifei,)

307
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,720
(how did your tour go?)

308
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,200
(I've missed you.)

309
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,240
( I saw someone yesterday.)

310
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,790
(He resembled Mr. Lan.)

311
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,270
(But I can't be sure yet.)

312
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,270
(I'm sure you'll be happy)

313
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,150
(if I find him, right?)

314
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,630
Every segment in a commercial game

315
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,360
is created

316
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,790
based on player psychology.

317
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,480
I wish to know

318
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,480
why

319
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,510
our levels

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,200
are still as boring as always.

321
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,790
We tried to adjust the difficulties of the levels

322
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,030
and add something new to the mix.

323
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,870
Is it because the plot isn't interesting or thrilling enough?

324
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,390
Whenever something goes wrong,

325
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,790
the easiest scapegoat to use

326
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,200
is the intensity of the plot.

327
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
If you only want an intense and interesting plot,

328
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,910
you could just watch a movie.

329
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,120
The face needs to be slimmer.

330
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,320
That's right.

331
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,670
I don't think his eyes are that big.

332
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,910
Make them smaller.

333
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,840
Smaller.

334
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
What about now?

335
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,000
Now,

336
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,360
he doesn't look like a person.

337
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,550
Mainly, I don't draw portraits

338
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,150
for the police station.

339
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,080
No matter how much you describe him to me ,

340
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,390
I can never draw his portrait accurately

341
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,960
without seeing him myself.

342
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,910
Yeah.

343
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,200
Zhou, sorry for the trouble.

344
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll ask someone else to do it.

345
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,860
Okay.

346
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,750
Sorry for the trouble.

347
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,480
It's fine.

348
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,240
I think our biggest issue now

349
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,790
is the lack of interactivity.

350
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,720
Actually, we already designed

351
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,630
plenty of interactive segments.

352
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,320
Jiang Yi,

353
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,440
what do you think?

354
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,390
I agree that the issue lies

355
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,840
with the interactivity.

356
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,870
There are already plenty of missions available.

357
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,910
I suggest we stop creating new missions

358
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,030
for players to complete.

359
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
We should let the players create their own missions

360
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
from a creator's perspective.

361
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,030
By doing so, players will realize

362
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,870
that they're the main characters of the game

363
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,630
and can decide how the plot will go.

364
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,550
Can you tell us in detail?

365
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,000
The main setting of the game

366
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
is the forest.

367
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,480
If so, can we create a tree data structure

368
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,840
in every level

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,550
to give players the initiative to do what they want?

370
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,480
The tree data structure represents a forked path.

371
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,030
There are pros and cons to the decision they make.

372
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,270
They decide

373
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,030
how the game will turn out.

374
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,750
Each decision

375
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,080
will change the plot itself.

376
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,550
This way, we can give players the initiative

377
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,510
and receive an improved response.

378
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,150
At the same time, it'll make the plot more interesting.

379
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,120
How long do you guys need?

380
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,390
Two weeks.

381
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,440
We can come up with a test version in two weeks.

382
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,080
He finished his studies in the UK.

383
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,840
Yi.

384
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Will you

385
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
remain on our team?

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
They said you were going to start your own soon project .

387
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,790
When will you start it?

388
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
That depends on the company.

389
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,480
Okay.

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
Let's have dinner together later.

391
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,750
I'll bring you around.

392
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,510
Sorry about that.

393
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,480
I have a dinner appointment tonight.

394
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
Another dinner appointment?

395
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,600
I couldn't tell that you were such a socialite.

396
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,910
You're pretty busy, aren't you?

397
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,390
Do you have to work overtime later?

398
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,630
What do you think?

399
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,360
I know this too.

400
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,270
I shouldn't have troubled you.

401
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll leave, then.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,750
Don 't.

403
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,870
I was just joking.

404
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Speak up.

405
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,030
Can you imagine this?

406
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
I saw Lan Bin on the streets.

407
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,750
Lan Bin?

408
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,830
How is that possible?

409
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,640
How could Lan Bin be in Jiangzhou?

410
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,310
Yeah.

411
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,350
I couldn't believe it either.

412
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,270
But I did see him.

413
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,790
I dare confirm that he's Lan Bin.

414
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,880
Jiang Yi,

415
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,270
I wish to help Yifei to find Lan Bin.

416
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
But Jiangzhou is huge.

417
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Finding Lan Bin

418
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,240
is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

419
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,790
Yeah.

420
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,030
I know it's difficult.

421
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,640
But I still wish to give it a try.

422
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,160
We didn't have a picture of Lan Bin all these years.

423
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,680
That's why I wish

424
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,720
to find someone I know

425
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,510
to draw a portrait of him.

426
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,510
I need something

427
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,590
to put out a missing person notice.

428
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,270
Jiang Yi,

429
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,510
you're the only person who can do that.

430
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,880
But to be honest with you,

431
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
my impression of him

432
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,440
is quite blurry.

433
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,310
I think the last time I saw him

434
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,200
was when we were in Grade 10.

435
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,160
(Lan Bin isn't at home again, huh?)

436
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm sure he's out gambling again.

437
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,880
He's such an addict.

438
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
You have to keep him in check.

439
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,679
The explosion in the factory back then

440
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
impacted him very deeply.

441
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,480
All his colleagues in the factory

442
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,160
have almost cut their ties with us.

443
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,479
He feels terrible,

444
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,640
and there's no one he can talk to.

445
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,200
He can only escape reality by gambling.

446
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,030
Have you not considered moving to a new place

447
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,030
and environment, then?

448
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
He was unwilling to do so .

449
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,109
He said our daughter grew up in Hangtian City.

450
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,029
All her best friends are here.

451
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,200
He's afraid that she's unwilling to leave.

452
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,920
Mom,

453
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,830
I'm back.

454
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,880
Hello, madam.

455
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,240
Yifei,

456
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,880
weren't you together with Huang Yingzi?

457
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,550
Huang Yingzi

458
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,830
went to the bookstore with Mingyu.

459
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,440
I came back first as I had dance lessons to attend.

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Later,

461
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,510
when I'm done here,

462
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,070
you should come and have a meal with us together with your mother.

463
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
Guo, you mustn't do this .

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
You and your husband have helped us out too many times.

465
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,510
We can't just sponge off you guys.

466
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,590
What are you saying?

467
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't be so courteous.

468
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,750
The more the merrier, you know?

469
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,680
Mom,

470
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,070
I'll head out for a second.

471
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,310
Dad!

472
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,110
You're already back.

473
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,270
Why didn't you go inside?

474
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,030
I'm just here to see you.

475
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,510
I have things to do.

476
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,590
Are you afraid

477
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,880
that Madam Guo might nag you?

478
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,440
Madam Guo is kind.

479
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
I know she's doing it for my own good.

480
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,270
Dad,

481
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,270
since you're already back,

482
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,030
why don't you, me, and Mom

483
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,270
have a meal together?

484
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,480
Next time.

485
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
I'll buy you a meal

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,110
when I get my wages.

487
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,380
Dad,

488
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,240
be honest with me.

489
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,590
Did you go and gamble

490
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
and get yourself in debt again?

491
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
I didn't.

492
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,110
I didn't gamble.

493
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,030
Dad,

494
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,590
I have

495
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,550
some pocket money with me.

496
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,510
Go and repay some of your debt first.

497
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,310
I know this isn't enough,

498
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,830
but you should repay your debt as much as you can first.

499
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,000
Isn't this money meant for your new dance costume?

500
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,750
It's fine.

501
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,960
My old one works fine.

502
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm in no hurry to buy a new one.

503
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,880
Just take it.

504
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,790
I'll make a move first, then.

505
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,350
It's cold out here.

506
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,510
You should wear thicker clothing.

507
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,240
Got it.

508
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,550
I would like to foot the bill.

509
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
35 yuan.

510
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,550
I thought it was only 30 in the past.

511
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,200
This is the deluxe edition.

512
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
It's different.

513
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,400
If so, please reserve this album for me.

514
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll get the money

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,750
and come back immediately.

516
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,640
Be quick, then.

517
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,550
I can't guarantee that it'll still be here

518
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,160
if you're late.

519
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Please reserve it for me.

520
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,920
I 'll come back immediately.

521
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,110
Alright. Go now.

522
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,160
The pink one looks pretty good.

523
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,350
The purple one looks great too.

524
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,510
Madam,

525
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,750
can I check this out?

526
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,550
Go ahead.

527
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm buying them for my father.

528
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,510
He's the factory's driver now .

529
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,920
He gets pernio when the factory sends him to the North.

530
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
He won't be that cold

531
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,000
if he has a pair of gloves on.

532
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,680
Madam,

533
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,510
how much do they cost?

534
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,790
60 yuan.

535
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,640
60 yuan?

536
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,240
60 yuan, huh?

537
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,400
60 yuan .

538
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,550
Ten yuan.

539
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,720
How much do you have?

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,310
19 yuan.

541
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
Me too.

542
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
We don't have enough money.

543
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,160
Madam,

544
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,830
well,

545
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,200
can you give us a discount?

546
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,920
Yeah, madam.

547
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,830
Can we get a discount?

548
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,750
I'll count you 100 yuan

549
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,790
for two pairs.

550
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,510
I can't give you a discount

551
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,510
if you're only buying one pair.

552
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,680
Madam, thank you.

553
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I won't buy it for now.

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,790
It's enough

555
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,550
with this, right?

556
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,030
It's enough, right?

557
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,920
( Yingzi kept telling me)

558
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,830
(that e-transaction will be used)

559
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,550
(in the future.)

560
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,030
We won't need cash in the future.

561
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
But when something goes wrong with the Internet

562
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,880
and banks can't make transactions,

563
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,200
we still have to use cash.

564
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,270
Cash is good.

565
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
I like cash.

566
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
There are only numbers in our bank cards.

567
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
You don't feel anything spending them.

568
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,720
But we stopped receiving cash

569
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,510
for our wages

570
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,480
since 1998, right?

571
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,510
Yeah.

572
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,590
My wages stopped growing too.

573
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,200
Look at Yifei's photo.

574
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,960
How is she this pretty?

575
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,590
Look at my daughter.

576
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,830
This is ridiculous.

577
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,680
You see?

578
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,960
What on earth is this?

579
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
I wonder who she inherited it from?

580
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,480
She's pretty cute.

581
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,700
Okay.

582
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,790
Give me a second.

583
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,640
(Mr . Huang.)

584
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,920
Hello, Mr. Huang.

585
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,640
Hello, guys.

586
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,550
Hello, Mr. Huang.

587
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,160
Jiang Yi.

588
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,240
Have you argued

589
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
with Huang Yingzi lately?

590
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,680
Nope.

591
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,590
I don't even know how I offended her.

592
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,790
Anyway, she ignored me.

593
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,240
I know why.

594
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,160
It's because of the portrait you drew.

595
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,070
Portrait?

596
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,310
Yingzi loves to brag since young.

597
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,880
She should be happy

598
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
that you drew a portrait of her.

599
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,160
Precisely.

600
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,200
Mr. Huang,

601
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,550
he drew a portrait of Yingzi when she was asleep.

602
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,960
Just like this.

603
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,400
That...

604
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,960
Doesn't she look like that when she's sleeping?

605
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
It's no wonder Yingzi was so mad

606
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,720
that she couldn't even eat in peace.

607
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,720
Boy,

608
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,000
take care of yourself.

609
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,200
Take care of yourself.

610
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,830
(Take care.)

611
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,160
You're here.

612
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,030
Xu Hong.

613
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,160
Huang.

614
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,310
There's something

615
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,440
I don't know if I should ask you.

616
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,200
What is it?

617
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
Actually, it's nothing major.

618
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,160
You see,

619
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,590
Lan Bin has owed our supermarket

620
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,480
half a year's worth of payment.

621
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,240
I don't know how to mention this to him.

622
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,960
Yes.

623
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,700
Their family has been in a special situation

624
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,790
for the past few years.

625
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,720
It's not like I have no idea.

626
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,070
But you see,

627
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,750
I have to do business.

628
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,750
I need to send my son to school too.

629
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,530
Well...

630
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,830
Xu Hong,

631
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
you mustn't mention this matter

632
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
if his daughter is around.

633
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah.

634
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,750
Yifei

635
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,110
is such a poor child.

636
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,590
Why did she have a father like him?

637
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,440
How much does he owe you?

638
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,160
(Xu Hong,)

639
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,110
(don't be anxious.)

640
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,920
I'll settle Lan Bin's debt

641
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,440
on his behalf tonight.

642
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,310
Huang, that's not what I mean.

643
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,240
You already helped him

644
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
to repay his debt in the recreation room.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,680
I can't let you repay his debt for him.

646
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
It's fine.

647
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
It's nothing much.

648
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,070
Lan Bin had it rough

649
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,070
for the past few years.

650
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,750
Even so, you can't...

651
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,440
See you.

652
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,830
With this pair of gloves,

653
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,680
my father's hands will be warm

654
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
when he drives during winter.

655
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,110
My father always told me

656
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,160
that daughters warm their fathers' hearts.

657
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,350
Now that I have seen you,

658
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,790
I finally understood what he meant.

659
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,160
I didn't buy them myself.

660
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,880
The three of us

661
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
bought them together for him.

662
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,790
Therefore,

663
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,310
the three of us warm his heart together.

664
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,310
More like three penniless girls.

665
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,960
You two spent all of this month's pocket money

666
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,830
in order to buy the gloves.

667
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,640
What should we do now?

668
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
I guess I'll buy the snacks and drinks

669
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,590
for the remaining half a month

670
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,480
for you guys.

671
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,310
You see,

672
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,750
Mingyu is

673
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,240
the most loyal,

674
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,070
chivalrous,

675
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,510
and best planner among us.

676
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,160
Let's continue our revision.

677
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,030
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,030
Dad,
what are you doing?

679
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,070
You scared us.

680
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,680
Well,

681
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,680
Yifei,

682
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,000
did your father

683
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,270
contact you?

684
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,350
My father?

685
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,550
Mingyu, Guan Chao.

686
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,640
Jiang received the latest news.

687
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,680
Grandma,

688
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,590
we'll head to the supermarket with Zhuang Yuan.

689
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
Go ahead.

690
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,240
Grandma, we'll make a move first.

691
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Safety first, okay?

692
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
Got it.

693
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,880
He's trying to escape with other people's money.

694
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,070
Don't make blind assumptions first.

695
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,480
Maybe he left because of an emergency.

696
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,590
It's going to rain soon.

697
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,480
Can we stop?

698
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,070
Why aren't they here yet ?

699
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,680
Yingzi, Jiang.

700
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
You guys are finally here.

701
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,400
Where is he?

702
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,960
Didn't you guys say you saw him?

703
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,830
Someone said they were here just now.

704
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,510
That's impossible.

705
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,160
There's no one here.

706
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,000
You must be mistaken.

707
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,400
Are you sure this is the place?

708
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Anyway, they said it was near the Dongjiao Bridge.

709
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,510
Yifei.

710
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,400
Is that your father?

711
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,350
Dad!

712
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,030
Don't tell me Mr. Lan is trying to run away.

713
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,750
Dad!

714
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,550
Mr. Lan!

715
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,160
Dad!

716
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
Mr. Lan!

717
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,830
Yifei, it's raining!

718
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,550
Dad!

719
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,200
Dad!

720
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,640
Are you abandoning me?

721
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,030
Dad!

722
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,350
Dad, I bought you a pair of gloves!

723
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,270
Look at me!

724
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,760
Dad!

725
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,750
Yifei,

726
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
I've let you down.

727
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,880
Look at me!

728
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,720
Dad!

729
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,030
Look at me !

730
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,590
Dad!

731
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,550
Dad!

732
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,880
Yifei!

733
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,830
Yifei!

734
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,070
Dad!

735
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,350
(Dear daughter,)

736
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,880
(I was wrong.)

737
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,270
(Mr. Huang)

738
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,270
(recommended me to be a driver.)

739
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,880
(I'll be starting a new job tomorrow.)

740
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,270
(After this,)

741
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,590
(I can give you pocket money.)

742
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,790
(I will work hard to earn enough money)

743
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
(and buy you beautiful clothes.)

744
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,400
(I promise you)

745
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
(that I won't gamble again.)

746
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,030
(Yifei,)

747
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,030
I was passing by just now.

748
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,720
I brought you something nice.

749
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
All of them are your favorite.

750
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,720
Thank you, Dad.

751
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,750
Dad,

752
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,510
being a driver must be tough, right?

753
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,270
Not at all.

754
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,720
You're lying.

755
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,310
You left the house at 5 AM every day.

756
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,160
And you only come back late at night.

757
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,680
It's been so many days since I saw you.

758
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,270
Besides,

759
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,030
you always head to the North.

760
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,880
Even so, you didn't have a pair of gloves.

761
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,030
If it doesn't work out,

762
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,720
I'll stop attending dance lessons.

763
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,480
This way, we can reduce our...

764
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,030
Don't spout nonsense.

765
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,480
I'm working hard to earn money

766
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,590
so that you can focus on dancing.

767
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,830
Don't let your imagination run wild.

768
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,590
Go back now.

769
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,590
I have something to do.

770
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,440
Go back now.

771
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,000
Here.

772
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,680
You were drenched.

773
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,310
Don't catch a cold.

774
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,200
Have some water.

775
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,070
Mom,

776
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,960
do you think he'll come back?

777
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,030
He will.

778
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,110
Maybe he'll come back soon.

779
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,750
What if

780
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,920
he never comes back?

781
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,640
You see,

782
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,510
you still have me.

783
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,960
You still have Grandma.

784
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,510
Mr. Huang said

785
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,480
he 'd consider this

786
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,480
a loan.

787
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,720
I'm sure we can clear our debt,

788
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,830
conquer every obstacle,

789
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,590
and lead a good life.

790
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,880
Mom,

791
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
will you

792
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,480
abandon me too one day?

793
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,510
No, I won't.

794
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,550
I will never abandon you.

795
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,800
So?

796
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,630
What do you plan to do

797
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,440
after meeting up with him?

798
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,510
I'll tell Yifei about it.

799
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,510
And then?

800
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,710
I'll criticize him

801
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,230
on Yifei and Dad's behalf.

802
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,630
I'll ask him where he has been all these years.

803
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,550
After that,

804
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,360
I'll ask him if he's doing okay now.

805
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,190
I'll help him out if he's not doing okay.

806
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,710
He's Yifei's father after all.

807
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,230
If you truly wished to find him,

808
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,960
why didn't you go to the police station?

809
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,510
I already inquired about it from them.

810
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,510
They said

811
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,440
having a name alone

812
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,840
without any additional information

813
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,030
makes it impossible to find

814
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,150
a person who went missing over a decade ago.

815
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,760
Jiang Yi,

816
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,630
right now, we're the only ones who can help Yifei out .

817
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
Fine.

818
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,230
I'll help you out.

819
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,550
Thanks.

820
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,920
Jiang Yi!

821
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,550
It's no wonder you didn't have dinner with us.

822
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,030
This is?

823
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,150
Hello.

824
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,190
I'm his friend.

825
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,110
My name is Huang Yingzi.

826
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,630
You can call me Chloe.

827
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,880
Nice to meet you.

828
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,550
Don't you intend to introduce her?

829
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,480
Is she your new colleague?

830
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,960
We're colleagues,

831
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,320
but we're old friends too.

832
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,000
We have known each other for over a decade.

833
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
To put it more accurately,

834
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,440
we became friends through Fish & Chips.

835
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,360
I haven't introduced her yet.

836
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,880
This is my childhood friend,

837
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,230
Huang Yingzi.

838
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,510
I remember you now.

839
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,070
You're the girl in the photo.

840
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,070
When we were studying in the UK,

841
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,840
there was a photo of a group of people on his desk.

842
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,280
Yeah.

843
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,000
We grew up together.

844
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,590
You guys are childhood friends, huh?

845
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,780
Good.

846
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,710
I'll leave you guys to it now.

847
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,320
By the way,

848
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,070
Zhao Yun and the rest want to see you later .

849
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,480
They want to reconfirm the details of the data tree structure.

850
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,360
Don't forget.

851
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,000
Fish & Chips friends, huh?

852
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,880
Fine.

853
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,960
I guess your preferences have changed.

854
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,030
It was because there wasn't any food I like

855
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,590
in the UK.

856
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,920
Alright , then.

857
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,280
I'll stop bothering you.

858
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,150
I'll make a move first.

859
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,760
I'll send Mr. Lan's portrait to you

860
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,070
when I'm done.

861
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,300
Okay.

862
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,670
You don't need to see me off.

863
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,960
I can head back myself.

864
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,710
Remember to foot the bill.

865
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,190
(Yingzi,)

866
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,360
(thank you.)

867
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
(But you don't need to spend that much effort to find him.)

868
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,800
(I was heartbroken)

869
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,480
(when he first left us.)

870
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,190
(But I gradually got over him)

871
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,360
(because of you guys.)

872
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,920
(The explosion that happened when I was six)

873
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,320
(impacted my family deeply.)

874
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,010
(But I was also able to encounter you guys)

875
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,320
(because of that.)

876
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,440
(You guys are my friends.)

877
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,400
(You guys are a part of my family too.)

878
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,800
Huang Yingzi.

879
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,510
Are you trying to take a bite?

880
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,670
Bad girl.

881
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,190
Dad will come home in a second.

882
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,480
You're not allowed to take a bite.

883
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,400
Got it.

884
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,880
Little cake,

885
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,760
I'll eat you later.

886
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,550
Mr. Huang,

887
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,320
I can have instant noodles at home alone.

888
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
Your parents instructed me

889
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
to bring you to my house for meals

890
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
when they weren't around.

891
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,360
One, two, three, four, five.

892
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,280
If we include my parents,

893
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,630
there are seven people.

894
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,440
How can we divide the cake evenly?

895
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,480
I attend dance lessons.

896
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,760
My dance instructor doesn't want me to take too much sweet food.

897
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,030
I can choose not to have it.

898
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,320
Yifei,

899
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,670
we only have cake once per year.

900
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,280
You'll have to wait for one year if you don't have it now.

901
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,960
There are 12 months in a year.

902
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,150
Now, there are five of us.

903
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,400
If we do some division,

904
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,000
that means we can have cake in less than three months.

905
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,320
What does division mean?

906
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,150
Forget about the calculation.

907
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,400
I have an idea.

908
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,280
We just need to divide it into eight slices.

909
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,710
And I'll have one extra slice.

910
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,190
No.

911
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,800
Today's my birthday.

912
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,880
I should have the extra slice.

913
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,960
Yingzi,

914
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,710
your mother prepared so many delicious dishes today.

915
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,480
You won't get to eat too much cake anyway.

916
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,800
Why don't 't we

917
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,760
split it into eight slices

918
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,550
and keep one slice for you as breakfast for tomorrow?

919
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,280
That's great.

920
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,110
This way, I can still celebrate my birthday tomorrow.

921
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,710
Mr. Huang, this is unnecessary.

922
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,400
Our house is lively today.

923
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,150
A little girl is celebrating her birthday.

924
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,230
There are quite a lot of kids

925
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,760
at our house today.

926
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,590
Here, come in.

927
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,190
Dad, what took you so long?

928
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm starving.

929
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,440
Yingzi,

930
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,070
I brought you a new friend.

931
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,280
His name is Jiang Yi.

932
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,800
Hello.

933
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,030
My name is Huang Yingzi.

934
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,150
Who is this?

935
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,920
He's the son of our new neighbor.

936
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,110
His parents went on a sudden business trip.

937
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,230
I brought him back to have a meal with us.

938
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,150
Sure.

939
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,880
Welcome.

940
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,800
Come on, time to eat .

941
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Time to have dinner,

942
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,630
kids.

943
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,550
That's right.

944
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,550
Time to have dinner.

945
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,590
Be careful.

946
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,190
I've waited for so long.

947
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,320
Yingzi.

948
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,440
You're the birthday girl.

949
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,230
Introduce Jiang Yi to them.

950
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,030
My name is Huang Yingzi.

951
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,230
I' m from Class 2.

952
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,710
He doesn't respond

953
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,480
when I speak to him.

954
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,070
Dad,

955
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,070
don't tell me he's deaf?

956
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,550
I'm not deaf.

957
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,630
Why didn't you respond to me

958
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,190
when I was speaking to you?

959
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,110
Alright now.

960
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,280
Let's all

961
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,360
introduce ourselves.

962
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,510
Jiang Yi was transferred to your kindergarten not long ago.

963
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,960
You guys will be classmates soon.

964
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,070
My name is Fang Mingyu.

965
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm from Class 2.

966
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm from Class 3.

967
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,840
My name is Zhuang Yuan.

968
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,070
I 'm in the same class as Zhuang Yuan.

969
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,150
My name is Lan Yifei.

970
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,360
My name is Guan Chao.

971
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,550
Jiang Yi,

972
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,320
which class were you assigned to?

973
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,440
Class 2.

974
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,000
Great.

975
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,320
He's in the same class as us.

976
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
He's a strange guy.

977
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
There's nothing great about it.

978
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Come.

979
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,110
Let's have dinner.

980
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,550
Initially, I was supposed to have one extra slice of cake

981
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,320
for breakfast tomorrow.

982
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,230
But now, it's gone.

983
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,280
Huang Yingzi,

984
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,070
how could you say that?

985
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,630
If so, Jiang Yi won' t share his cake with you

986
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,400
when it's his birthday, then.

987
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,190
Now, there are six of us.

988
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,920
We can have one more cake per year now.

989
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,710
Yeah.

990
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,710
That's right.

991
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,760
Fine.

992
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Although you were a little rude just now,

993
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I've forgiven you.

994
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,230
Let's be good friends.

995
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,150
Do you truly wish to be friends with me?

996
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,320
Or do you just want to have extra cake?

997
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,630
My goodness.

998
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,360
Alright.

999
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Let's sing the birthday song

1000
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,150
for Yingzi.

1001
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,190
Okay.

1002
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,190
Here we go. One, two, three.

1003
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:29,550
♪Happy birthday to you♪

1004
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,150
Blow the candles.

1005
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,000
Nice!

1006
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,000
What happened?

1007
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Don't be scared.

1008
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,230
Kids, don't be scared.

1009
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,400
Everything's fine.

1010
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,590
Is this Huang?

1011
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,510
Yes, it is me.

1012
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Something happened at the factory.

1013
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,480
You guys should come here immediately.

1014
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,670
Alright.

1015
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,510
I'll be there right away.

1016
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,800
What happened?

1017
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,400
Something happened at the factory.

1018
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,480
They told us to head there now.

1019
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,150
Us?

1020
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,760
What about the kids?
