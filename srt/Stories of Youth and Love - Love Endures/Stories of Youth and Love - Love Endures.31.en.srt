00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,400
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,950
People of our age

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,310
love this.

5
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,400
Men go silent after watching.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,040
The women wouldn't stop crying.

7
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,120
Do you get it?

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,400
Do you?

9
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
Why would I have that kind of book?

10
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,000
There is nothing.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm done here.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,150
Wait.

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,310
This book will suit your taste.

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,430
It takes your class to the next level.

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,430
For real?

16
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,150
You can't read it here.

17
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,560
You have a deal.

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,870
Tell your friends about it.

19
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Sure.

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,840
That actually worked.

21
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,430
After he finishes it,

22
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,240
you'll be in trouble.

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
By the time he comes back here,

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,840
we're already in Beijing.

25
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,870
For study and entertainment,
we have you covered!

26
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,120
All kinds of entertainment,
we have you covered!

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,150
We have all sorts of books!

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,960
Have a look around!

29
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,520
We only made 956 yuan.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
It's not even enough
to make it to Beijing.

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,560
I've skipped

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,360
breakfast and lunch for
so long just to save up money.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,910
I didn't sell a lot of books.

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,630
People's taste in literature

35
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,750
has become unspeakable.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,280
Yifei and I

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,630
had to give out fliers
under the hot sun.

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
We almost got heatstroke

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
before we finished our work.

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Maybe I should back out.

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,400
My mom wouldn't let me go anyway.

42
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,400
How can you quit now?

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,310
You're the only one quitting.

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,590
We're not quitting just yet!

45
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm trying to save you some money.

46
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,750
My goodness.

47
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,630
Even fate is going against me.

48
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,870
What is it now?

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,000
If I could get the ticket,

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
my dad might have given in

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
and funded me.

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
But the group admin of the fan page

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,710
told me

54
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,000
someone else took
the slot of my concert ticket.

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,240
Where do all the rich people come from?

56
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,430
My goodness.

57
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,680
Actually,

58
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,070
my parents left me a large sum

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,070
for my daily necessities last month.

60
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,000
I was wondering how I should spend it.

61
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Mr. Yi.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
So?

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,920
So, I gave it some thought.

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,720
Since I have nothing better to do,

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,360
a trip to Beijing seems nice.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,310
Seeing how broke you people are,

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
I can give you

68
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,240
some financial aid.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,390
We have a small travel budget,

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,950
but we can still get a ticket.

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes!

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay.

73
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,800
That's it. I've made up my mind.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,360
All of us must make it to Beijing.

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
It's the first time

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,120
we have left Hangtian together.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Hesitation is the obstacle to greatness.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,800
That's right.

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,120
I've made up my mind.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
Jiang Yi, Zhuang Yuan,

81
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,190
you two and I

82
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,390
are going to meet the person
who took my ticket slot.

83
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,510
But I'm already giving you my money.

84
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,560
So, you are the so-called

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
45° Sadness.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,120
You're Sunflower Van Gogh?

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,430
No, no, no.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
It's Van Gogh's Sunflower.

89
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,720
What's up?

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,830
I was told

91
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,390
you wanted to snatch my ticket.

92
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,560
Your ticket?

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,720
You haven't paid.

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,630
But I booked it first.

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,270
But you haven't paid.

96
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,120
I'll have the money soon.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,070
Enough!

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
The thing is,

99
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,070
there's only one ticket.

100
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,390
You two can talk it out

101
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,750
and see who gets it.

102
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,270
(Round One.)

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,830
Round One begins now.

104
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,560
Answer me.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,480
When was Stefanie's first

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
public performance?

107
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,390
2000 Hong Kong Live Concert.

108
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,950
Wrong!

109
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,070
It was

110
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,000
the gala event of her class

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
when she was ten!

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,950
Why you...

113
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,040
Okay.

114
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,720
Tell me.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Between "Close Your Eyes Before Dark"

116
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
and "Truth or Dare",

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,310
which will she never play?

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,720
Truth or Dare!

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,070
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

120
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,750
How?

121
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
In her song,

122
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,630
"Leaving You On A Sunny Monday",

123
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,120
the lyrics say

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,830
"I don't like detective games."

125
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,510
How can you not know that?

126
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,390
Bingo.

127
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,600
Huang Yingzi scored one point.

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Easy.

129
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,040
Easy.

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,950
More!

131
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,070
(Round Two.)

132
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,160
Round Two: Guess the lyrics.

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
The 18th line

134
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,750
of "What I Miss".

135
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,160
What I miss is having no secrets.

136
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,360
What I miss is dreaming together.

137
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,270
What I miss is the urge to love again

138
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,920
every time we have a quarrel.

139
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,390
One point to Huang Yingzi.

140
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,270
Easy.

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,510
Okay.

142
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,630
We're taking it a pitch higher.

143
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,560
You'll do it.

144
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
What I miss is having no secrets.

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,680
What I miss is dreaming together.

146
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,310
Your turn.

147
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
I...

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,750
What I miss is having no secrets.

149
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,240
What I miss is dreaming together.

150
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
What I miss is having no secrets.

151
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
What I miss is dreaming together.

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,750
I...

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,950
What I miss is having no secrets.

154
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,720
What I miss is dreaming together.

155
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
Enough.

156
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
I can't stand it anymore.

157
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,160
You're pretty much the same.

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
For this round,

159
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Huang Yingzi wins by a hair.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,830
Yes!

161
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,390
Easy.

162
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,390
More!

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
(Round Three.)

164
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,080
The final round.

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,670
Go.

166
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,360
Answer me.

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
What was the name of her band

168
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
back in university?

169
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,440
That's not fair.

170
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,030
It's cheating.

171
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,270
How is this cheating?

172
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,960
Some said it was the Rubber Band.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,670
Some said it was the Sixth Dorm.

174
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,150
It's one of the ten mysteries about her!

175
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,360
How can you ask this?

176
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,270
Just admit you can't answer it.

177
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,390
You lost.

178
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,550
Who says I can't?

179
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,120
I...

180
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,960
Rubber Band.

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,720
How do you know?

182
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,320
Next question.

183
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,630
After numerous rounds,

184
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,670
Huang Yingzi is the winner.

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,750
Yes! Yes! Yes!

186
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,150
I won!

187
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,840
The ticket is mine now!

188
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,630
Hold on.

189
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,790
What do you want now?

190
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,720
I'll pay extra.

191
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,480
Another 100 yuan.

192
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,390
No!

193
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,200
I have 500 yuan here.

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Take it all.

195
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,550
How vulgar!

196
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,910
How can you

197
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,120
quantify your love for Stefanie
with mere money?

198
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,270
I will use the money

199
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,550
to support Stefanie's albums.

200
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,360
Yes.

201
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,510
Li Qiaoqiao.

202
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,630
I never knew

203
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,240
you would stoop so low.

204
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,270
I get it now.

205
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,120
You were in this together.

206
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,030
You two...

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,550
You two...

208
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,150
I feel awful.

209
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Look at yourself.

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,960
You can't starve yourself.

211
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,030
This is not how you save money.

212
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,360
Come.

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,080
Your mom made

214
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,960
your favorite red bean tangyuan.

215
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,240
Eat a little bit.

216
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,910
We'll get you

217
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,910
something else later.

218
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,030
Your face has turned pale.

219
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,080
I can't eat.

220
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,270
My heart is empty.

221
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,480
Dad, Mom,

222
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
please. I beg of you.

223
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
Take pity on me.

224
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,360
Still haven't given up on the concert?

225
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,320
Just sponsor me this one time.

226
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,390
I guarantee

227
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,720
and swear that

228
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I will have my meals on time

229
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,080
and study hard.

230
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
I won't get into trouble again.

231
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,750
You...

232
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,750
You should eat well

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,510
and study hard.

234
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,000
It's your responsibility.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,630
How is this even a negotiation?

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,630
Fine.

237
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,750
Suit yourself.

238
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,510
Save me the tangyuan!

239
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Leave the tangyuan here.

240
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,440
I feel awful.

241
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,550
There is a saying for your predicament.

242
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,790
"You had it coming."

243
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,080
You're on your own now.

244
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,630
This woman is mean.

245
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,320
The food is here.

246
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,030
Here.

247
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,870
Thanks, Grandma.

248
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,670
Eat up.

249
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,750
Take your time.

250
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,080
Don't choke on it.

251
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,600
There is plenty of this in the pot.

252
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,510
Look at you.

253
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,670
I know you want to go to Beijing,

254
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,200
but don't let your body take a toll.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,150
I doubt I'm going to Beijing anymore.

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,550
I don't have the money.

257
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
I know.

258
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,790
It's not easy for you kids

259
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,080
to save up a large sum.

260
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,150
Yifei went as far as

261
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,080
keeping it a secret

262
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,960
so I wouldn't help her.

263
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Do you think I can't tell?

264
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
It's not that, Grandma.

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,670
No?

266
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,550
All right.

267
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,600
Stop wasting your time.

268
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,080
I am

269
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
taking you to Beijing.

270
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,870
This business

271
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,240
has been taking off.

272
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm actually loaded with money.

273
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,120
The thing is,

274
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,750
I've always wanted to travel,

275
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,120
but my legs are not up for the task.

276
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,360
Go out and see the world for me.

277
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
When you come back,

278
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
tell me about the world

279
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,630
and the things you see out there.

280
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,320
That is one way for me to

281
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,750
actually see the outside world.

282
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,870
No, Grandma.

283
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,630
We can't take your money.

284
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
You'd turn down my kind gesture?

285
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm so disappointed.

286
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,030
Here, take it.

287
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,150
No, Grandma.

288
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,670
I can't take your money.

289
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,750
Yingzi.

290
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,390
Let's take the money.

291
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
But Yifei...

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,390
It's all right.

293
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,390
Take it.

294
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,910
It's all right.

295
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,030
Thanks, Grandma.

296
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,960
Silly girl.

297
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,510
I think

298
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,550
letting them travel isn't a bad idea.

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,360
Yeah.

300
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
If they decide to have a trip,

301
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
it's actually nice.

302
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,510
You know,

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
there is this saying,

304
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
"It's better to travel than to read."

305
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,840
It's crucial for them to study and read,

306
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
but it's good for them

307
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,840
to go out

308
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,790
and see the world.

309
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,480
I think

310
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,030
we should let them go.

311
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,790
All right.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,670
That settles it.

313
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,480
We let them go.

314
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,480
But we can't take Grandma's money.

315
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,390
Yeah.

316
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,200
We'll cover their travel expanses.

317
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,960
Sure.

318
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,750
Leave

319
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,910
the accommodation to me.

320
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,550
I'll pay for the food.

321
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,510
No.

322
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,240
You're all contributing,

323
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
what about me?

324
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
Guan.

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
I have an idea.

326
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,840
Save your money,

327
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,870
but you need to help out.

328
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,440
What is it?

329
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,630
With the kids gone,

330
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,720
the wonton shop will be shorthanded
during the weekends.

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
You are going to help Grandma.

332
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
A sound plan.

333
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,200
You all had this planned.

334
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,390
All right.

335
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,080
Let's go.

336
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,600
Start playing.

337
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,630
Come on.

338
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,390
Let's go.

339
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,790
Mingyu.

340
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,390
Xu Hong told me

341
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,750
you were going to Beijing.

342
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
Not at all.

343
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,120
This is 1000 yuan.

344
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,600
You don't get to travel every day.

345
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Have fun to your heart's content.

346
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,030
Don't mistreat yourself.

347
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,960
Thank you, Mom!

348
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,600
All right.

349
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,630
This is 1500 yuan.

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:43,960
Take it.

351
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,750
This is a lot, Mom.

352
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,670
The poor travel rich.

353
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,720
When you're in Beijing,

354
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,440
eat and buy

355
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
anything you want.

356
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,120
It's on me.

357
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,720
Spend the money.

358
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,670
Thanks, Mom.

359
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,360
Why did you get the hard seats?

360
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
I told you to get
the air-conditioned soft seats.

361
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,150
It's going to make them suffer.

362
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,440
But,

363
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,630
there are only five soft-seat tickets.

364
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,000
One will be left out.

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
That's just sad.

366
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,840
Right?

367
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,720
No one should be left out.

368
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,720
Fine.

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,910
As long as

370
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,080
the kids are together,

371
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,320
the seats won't matter.

372
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,670
Yeah.

373
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,080
I split the money

374
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,910
into six equal parts.

375
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,080
Each will get their part.

376
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,360
Okay.

377
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,390
Spend your money wisely.

378
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,480
Don't worry.

379
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,360
I don't need the money.

380
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,240
You can take my share.

381
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,630
Why?

382
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,360
You all have businesses in Beijing.

383
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,550
But not me.

384
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,720
I'll go wherever you go.

385
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,200
Come on.

386
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
What about the concert?

387
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,510
Besides, you got the money now.

388
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,510
I have the money,

389
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,510
but I didn't get a concert ticket.

390
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,630
It was sold-out.

391
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,510
No big deal.

392
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,360
I can watch it online.

393
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,200
At least I don't have to
deal with the crowds.

394
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
That's tiring.

395
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,790
All right.

396
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I managed to get two tickets.

397
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,870
If you're not in,

398
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
someone else can have it.

399
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,120
How did you get it?

400
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,550
From the second-hand website.

401
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,270
Forget it.

402
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,350
You're not going.

403
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,000
One ticket

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,070
is for me,

405
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,480
the other

406
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,400
is for someone else.

407
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,480
Given our friendship,

408
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,590
you're better off

409
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,920
giving me the ticket.

410
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,920
I thought you weren't interested.

411
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,110
I'll do your homework for a month.

412
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,790
Bye.

413
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,440
Two months.

414
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,070
Deal.

415
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,590
Deal.

416
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,070
Everybody!

417
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,200
Beijing,

418
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,680
here I come!

419
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,590
Beijing

420
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,160
welcomes you!

421
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
The world is ready

422
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,720
for your arrival.

423
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,270
The flowing...

424
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,310
and charming spirit!

425
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,480
Beijing

426
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,960
welcomes you!

427
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,720
Surpass the top scores

428
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,240
on this beautiful land!

429
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,110
Yifei,

430
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,070
take a photo for us.

431
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,480
Sure.

432
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,640
One, two, three.

433
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,830
The scenery

434
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,070
along the way to Beijing is beautiful.

435
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,510
What's the plan

436
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,720
after you get to Beijing?

437
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,480
I have a plan.

438
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I'll get us a ride

439
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,550
to get some roasted duck.

440
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,069
I looked it up.

441
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,069
The outlet at Qianmen was the first.

442
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:32,999
The biggest and the oldest.

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,829
Let's go there.

444
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:34,399
Okay.

445
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,829
Good idea.

446
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,199
The Center for the Performing Arts

447
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,829
is there too.

448
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:37,309
I want to go there.

449
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,720
Okay.

450
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,109
We go to the center,

451
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:39,639
then the Bird's Nest.

452
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
- Great!
- Sure.

453
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,109
We should

454
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,829
head straight for the concert.

455
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,640
No.

456
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
We must get the roasted duck first.

457
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,000
Bittern flapjacks,

458
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,880
dip-boiled meat,

459
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,550
After eating, we can have fun.

460
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,270
We check out the Palace Museum, Houhai,

461
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,110
and Wangfujing Avenue.

462
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,960
Go on your own.

463
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm not going.

464
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,790
Come on.

465
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm getting the Fuwa.

466
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,680
They are sold-out everywhere.

467
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,400
Don't you want to be the first

468
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,310
in Hangtian

469
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,000
to own

470
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,440
the Olympic Games Fuwa?

471
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,240
Be more realistic.

472
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
We're still in Hangtian.

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,680
Yeah.

474
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,680
We'll be in Beijing soon.

475
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,070
I'm celebrating early.

476
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,960
What's with the leather jacket?

477
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,830
What?

478
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,720
It's my dad's.

479
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,750
Well?

480
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,750
Do I look like Aaron Kwok?

481
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,750
Not at all.

482
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,240
Are you fortune-telling in Beijing?

483
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,350
I...

484
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,790
I was just curious about it.

485
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,480
Give it back.

486
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,000
Come on.

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,310
They suit me the best.

488
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,400
I'll take a photo for you.

489
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,110
You're wearing Stefanie to have

490
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,350
roasted duck?

491
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
What's wrong?

492
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
It took me three days.

493
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,200
Come on, Jiang Yi.

494
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,880
Show them what you rehearsed yesterday.

495
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,310
You have one too?

496
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,350
Three, two, one.

497
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,440
Happiness knows no bound,

498
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,880
forever a Stefanie's fan!

499
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,480
What were you doing?

500
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,110
This isn't what we rehearsed.

501
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,160
I think we all look gorgeous

502
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,920
and dashing.

503
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
Let's take a photo together.

504
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,110
Sure.

505
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,200
Hold on.

506
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,720
Before that,

507
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,110
we should chant our slogan.

508
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,110
Beijing welcomes you!

509
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,030
Sorry,

510
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,640
your tickets are fake.

511
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,270
You can't go in.

512
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,920
No way!

513
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,750
We paid extra for the tickets.

514
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,160
Yeah.

515
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,200
How can it be fake?

516
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,830
Sorry.

517
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,400
You can't go in.

518
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Beijing doesn't welcome me at all.

519
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,160
You said it yourself.

520
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,640
(Forget it.)

521
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:44,960
(Let's go.)

522
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
You paid extra for the tickets.

523
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,640
But...

524
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,750
How could I have known

525
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,640
the seller was

526
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
a scammer?

527
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,110
You're the bad guy here!

528
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,400
You're the bad guy!

529
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,270
You're not worthy
of holding this placard!

530
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,160
I want my concert.

531
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,110
I want my Stefanie.

532
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,030
Fine.

533
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,310
Yingzi!

534
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,350
What's the fuss?

535
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,200
What happened?

536
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Why are you two fighting?

537
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
We could hear you across the street.

538
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,750
Were you two late?

539
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,070
Yingzi.

540
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,720
It's all right.

541
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,160
If you're late,

542
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,240
I can talk to the security guard.

543
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,030
No.

544
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,920
Ask him.

545
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
What's wrong?

546
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
The tickets I got were fake.

547
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,830
Fake?

548
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,160
I think

549
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,960
it's nothing special inside.

550
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,160
With so many people,

551
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
it's not safe to be in the crowd.

552
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,270
It's better out here.

553
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,920
Right?

554
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,480
Yeah.

555
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,350
Look.

556
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,880
We have the concert
as our background music.

557
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
We can enjoy Beijing's night view.

558
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,880
It's nice.

559
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
Zhuang Yuan is right.

560
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,070
What if someone inside

561
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,030
has stinky armpits?

562
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,350
Shut up!

563
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,790
Sorry.

564
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,070
My heart is broken.

565
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,400
My biggest dream

566
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
is to watch her concert

567
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
before I turn 18.

568
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,310
But I didn't get to.

569
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,350
I feel like

570
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,200
it will always be my regret.

571
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,830
Don't you think

572
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,880
it's very youthful of us to leave

573
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,510
Hangtian City?

574
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,240
Yes.

575
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
I think so too.

576
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
It's the first time I've left home.

577
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,550
I think I can be independent now.

578
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,680
Yes.

579
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,720
My parents didn't say no.

580
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
They even supported me.

581
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,720
Do you think

582
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,790
they will stop bossing me around?

583
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,790
Yeah.

584
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,310
I thought my dad

585
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,790
would never let me go on this trip.

586
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,750
I think

587
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,030
Grandma is the best.

588
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Long live Grandma!

589
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,310
Stop sulking.

590
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,270
I forgive you.

591
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,480
Any thoughts about your trip to Beijing?

592
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I think

593
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,510
spending time with you guys

594
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,160
is just special.

595
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,070
How so?

596
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,400
Anyway,

597
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,350
whenever I hear Stefanie Sun's songs,

598
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,110
I'll think about this trip

599
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,750
and you guys.

600
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,680
Me too.

601
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,920
I didn't get to watch her concert,

602
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,070
but I think

603
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,200
as long as we are together,

604
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
that's enough.

605
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,240
As for her concert,

606
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,240
I'll watch it someday.

607
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Don't worry.

608
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,480
When I grow up,

609
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,590
I'll get Stefanie to your house

610
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,070
and sing for you.

611
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,400
Really?

612
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
Stop bluffing.

613
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,110
Only a fool would believe you.

614
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,070
Impressive.

615
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,790
It's starting.

616
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,880
♪Putting a bitter smile
to say I understand♪

617
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,920
♪My pride is slowing me down♪

618
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,070
♪Twisting my love♪

619
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,590
♪I pretend to understand♪

620
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,590
♪For I fear the harshness of truth♪

621
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,480
Raise your hands up!

622
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,510
♪Looking decimated is worse than losing♪

623
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,070
(I didn't get to watch the concert.)

624
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,270
(But that was the first time)

625
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,480
(we've left Hangtian together.)

626
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,790
(It was our first trip to Beijing.)

627
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,750
(At the time,)

628
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,920
(the outside world felt so big.)

629
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,720
(Big enough for us to keep
exploring our entire life.)

630
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,880
(I never got my concert,)

631
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,790
(but teenage years without any regrets)

632
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,160
(is truly regretful.)

633
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,310
(So many things)

634
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,680
(have happened between us afterwards.)

635
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
(Misunderstandings.)

636
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,000
(Conflicts.)

637
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,550
(Quarrels.)

638
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,680
(Losses.)

639
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
(And even death.)

640
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,030
(In hindsight,)

641
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,680
(they have become a part of our youth.)

642
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,110
(We can spend the rest of our lives)

643
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
(reminiscing.)

644
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,590
(Hangtian is beautiful.)

645
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,070
Yeah.

646
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,720
We've been

647
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,480
away for too long.

648
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
But when we came home,

649
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,070
we realized Hangtian was the best.

650
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,590
Do you remember that land?

651
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,200
There was an oil-scald duck stall.

652
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,070
It's gone.

653
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,440
Of course I remember.

654
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,720
There was

655
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,480
always a long queue outside.

656
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:57,960
You wouldn't let me

657
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,550
eat at your house unless I bought some.

658
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,510
I wonder where the stall owner

659
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,640
moved to.

660
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,310
We might never get it again.

661
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,160
Back then,

662
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,160
there were two kittens.

663
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,160
We used to feed them every day.

664
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,200
One had a scar on the nose.

665
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,830
The other was limping.

666
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,590
Mother and son.

667
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,440
But the kitten went missing.

668
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,920
The big cat stayed

669
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
and kept waiting.

670
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,400
It wouldn't leave.

671
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,030
So,

672
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,920
did the kitten return?

673
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,030
Even the big cat went missing.

674
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,550
They said

675
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
the big cat was too old.

676
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,440
It was already 15 years old.

677
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,270
Time ran out for it.

678
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,350
It's all right.

679
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,550
A lot of things changed,

680
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
but at least we are still together.

681
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,830
We should spend the time we have

682
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,350
with Grandma.

683
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,790
Are you traveling or moving, Grandma?

684
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,880
Why are you bringing a mattress?

685
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
The old lady

686
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
rarely traveled.

687
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,960
She might not get used to new things.

688
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,680
And the pickled cabbage.

689
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,310
This is too much for a trip.

690
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,830
She wants to taste home

691
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,200
whenever

692
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,160
she misses home.

693
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,310
All right.

694
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,110
Come on.

695
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,750
We are almost done with the packing.

696
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,830
I'll take these to the car.

697
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,480
Be quick.

698
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,960
Okay.

699
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Grandma.

700
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,310
Grandma?

701
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,270
We are moving out soon.

702
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,960
Why haven't you put on your new clothes?

703
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,590
Forget it.

704
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,590
I'm not going anywhere.

705
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,960
What changed your mind?

706
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
You've always wanted to see
the world outside Hangtian.

707
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,310
The car is ready.

708
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,880
Look at this.

709
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,750
My wonton shop has been around

710
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,160
for decades.

711
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,750
I appreciate

712
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,640
your kind gesture.

713
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,830
Who knows

714
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,160
this body of mine will give up on me?

715
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,400
We must always return to our roots.

716
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
I fear

717
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,200
that after I'm gone,

718
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,960
I'll never get to come back here.

719
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,510
The bug flies.

720
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,550
The bug flies.

721
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,350
Who are you missing?

722
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,000
Grandma.

723
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,880
Why are you in the mood to sing?

724
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,110
Yifei.

725
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,310
Do you remember?

726
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,590
When you were little,

727
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,000
you wouldn't go home

728
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,240
after dancing.

729
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,350
You'd come to my shop.

730
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,270
You stayed until late at night.

731
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,200
The night sky

732
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,200
was full of stars.

733
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,750
The two of us

734
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,510
would simply

735
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,590
look at the stars.

736
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,240
You always ask me to sing this song.

737
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,160
I remember.

738
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,350
You made me worry the most.

739
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,030
You were too obedient

740
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,830
and sensible.

741
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,480
You get bullied a lot.

742
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,920
Grandma.

743
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,030
I'm an adult now.

744
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,070
No one can bully me.

745
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
Good.

746
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,240
Good.

747
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,510
Yifei.

748
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,350
I've been having dreams about you.

749
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,240
In my dream,

750
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,510
you'd come here

751
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,110
after school

752
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,790
after your dance lessons.

753
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,960
You'd tell me

754
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,880
about the new dance you'd learned.

755
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,720
You wanted to show it to me.

756
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,590
Grandma.

757
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,030
I'm home now.

758
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,270
I'll dance for you

759
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,960
any time you want.

760
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,510
Okay?

761
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,750
Okay.

762
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,270
Are you leaving

763
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,310
again?

764
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,440
No.

765
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,640
I'll be right here

766
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,310
and be with you.

767
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,830
Good.

768
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,110
Yifei.

769
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,550
If there is a next life,

770
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,640
do not come to this family.

771
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,200
Life will be so hard.

772
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,920
Grandma,

773
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
if there is another lifetime,

774
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,750
I'll be your granddaughter again.

775
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,680
In that case,

776
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,750
we should not come to this family again.

777
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,590
Let's go to a better family.

778
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,360
Grandma.

779
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,840
Let's finish the song,

780
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,670
okay?

781
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,710
The stars in the sky are crying.

782
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,960
The roses on the ground are withering.

783
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,800
The cold wind rises.

784
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,360
All I need is your company.

785
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,840
The flowers fall asleep.

786
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,000
They look beautiful in pairs.

787
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,590
The bug flies.

788
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,590
The bug flies.

789
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,030
Who are you missing?

790
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,150
Grandma.

791
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
Yifei.

792
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,320
I bet you two have met up.

793
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,320
From now on,

794
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,550
you will always be together.

795
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,840
Yingzi hasn't shed a tear

796
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,550
after Grandma's passing.

797
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,510
She is holding it off.

798
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
Give her some time.

799
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,510
She talked to Grandma

800
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,710
before Grandma passed on.

801
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,110
I wonder what they talked about.

802
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,400
Perhaps

803
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,480
we should ask her.

804
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,320
Never mind. Let her be.

805
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,670
This is the only thing

806
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,510
she can do for Grandma.

807
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
It's been a long day.

808
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,190
The doctor told you to get enough rest.

809
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,880
It's all right.

810
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,510
Dad,

811
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,400
what brings you here?

812
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,480
Over the years,

813
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,150
Grandma did a lot for you.

814
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,440
I wasn't a great father.

815
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,150
I couldn't give you a proper family.

816
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,360
She let you have a new family.

817
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,510
I'm here to thank her for that.

818
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,880
You blame yourself

819
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
for Yifei's misfortune.

820
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,230
You took care of Grandma for her.

821
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,670
That was very honorable.

822
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,920
Unlike me.

823
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,550
Dad.

824
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,880
Yes?

825
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,190
You went to Africa

826
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,550
for me.

827
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,360
Mingyu's mom told me everything.

828
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,670
That's all in the past now.

829
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,840
Go on.

830
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,070
There is much to be done.

831
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,150
I should go now.

832
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,840
Dad.

833
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,480
Come and live with us.

834
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,190
I want you to see
your grandson first-hand.

835
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,400
Okay.

836
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Sure.

837
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,360
Talk to her.

838
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,480
Let's go.

839
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,880
Go on without me.

840
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,800
I want to stay

841
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,440
for a little bit.

842
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,550
We'll be going now.

843
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,670
Don't stay up too late.

844
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,840
Go on.

845
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,360
Let's go.

846
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,510
Grandma.

847
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,400
No matter how late it got,

848
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,760
there was always a light in the shop.

849
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,760
You said

850
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,110
it'd light the way
for the people at night.

851
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,590
Tonight, I'll be here with you.

852
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,230
We're not closing.

853
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,840
The light remains on.

854
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,510
When you feel like coming home,

855
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,150
you will find the way.

856
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,590
Thank you, Yingzi.

857
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,030
Grandma taught me the recipe.

858
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,360
Give it a try.

859
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,400
It's been so long

860
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,840
since you've tasted it.

861
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,110
It's been 12 years.

862
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,590
Back when we were young,

863
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,440
I always wanted to leave Hangtian City.

864
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
I want to go outside.

865
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,280
My mom couldn't keep me here.

866
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,030
Neither did my daughter.

867
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,800
I thought I could have the life I wanted

868
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,320
as long as I didn't turn back.

869
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,590
Then, I realized that

870
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,030
it wasn't because

871
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,360
I didn't want to turn back.

872
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,920
I was too afraid to.

873
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,670
When I turned back,

874
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,550
I realized I never got what I wanted.

875
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,360
What I was looking for

876
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,230
was already gone.

877
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,550
Before she passed on,

878
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,280
she wouldn't leave Hangtian City.

879
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,440
She said it was her home.

880
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,510
She had

881
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,360
spent her entire life here.

882
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,150
She wanted to stay.

883
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,920
Her family was gone.

884
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,710
Why would the old lady stay here?

885
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,190
Maybe she saw you

886
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,400
as her own family.

887
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,230
When she taught me how to make wontons,

888
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:38,760
I thought

889
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,710
it was too much work.

890
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,030
But she insisted on saying

891
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,550
she had her reasons.

892
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,400
I didn't understand.

893
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,230
I do now.

894
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,760
These wontons

895
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,360
are for those who come home.

896
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,840
She had always been here,

897
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,630
waiting for you to come home.
