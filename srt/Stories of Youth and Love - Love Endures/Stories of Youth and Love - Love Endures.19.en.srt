00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,790
(Yingzi,)

4
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
(that's how it was back then.)

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,150
You wanted Jiang to leave the country,

6
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,790
so I became the scapegoat
and the other man.

7
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,350
However, I hope

8
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,310
that you two can have

9
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,310
an open and honest conversation today

10
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,950
and clear up
the misunderstandings from before.

11
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,950
I've known about this all along.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,870
Did you know this?

13
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,350
We've known one another
since we were young.

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,950
How could I not know

15
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,920
that you both put up the act?

16
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,150
Then...

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,710
Then you...

18
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,280
You must be very curious now.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Since I know everything,

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,430
why haven't I appeared

21
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,150
in all these years?

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,520
It's because I was mad at you.

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,870
I was mad about
why you said goodbye to me

24
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,680
in that way.

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,590
I was also mad about
why you didn't discuss it with me

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,190
and made the decision for me.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Also, Huang Yingzi,

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,470
do you never believe

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
that there are things

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
we can face together?

31
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,430
Maybe the way I did things

32
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,470
hurt you.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,520
I apologize to you.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,910
However, what I don't understand is,

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,870
since you know everything,

36
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,080
why didn't you contact me

37
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,240
in these twelve years?

38
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,470
That's because you broke your promise.

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
Just like what you said back then,

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,430
you would always follow me

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,870
and be my little follower.

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,840
(Okay.)

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,870
(I'll follow you.)

44
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,870
(I'll follow you forever, all right?)

45
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,080
(All right.)

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,870
(Little follower.)

47
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,400
Anyway, all of this
is not important anymore.

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,030
It's all in the past.

49
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,710
I'm just still upset

50
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,630
about what happened yesterday.

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
So I can't sit here
and have coffee with you.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,710
You both talk first.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,680
Jiang.

54
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,030
You said I broke my promise
and made you sad.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,870
Am I not sad?

56
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,040
I regret it a lot.

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
Did you know?

58
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,240
Since you left,

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,750
I've been touching the globe so much

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,920
that the spot where London is has faded?

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
I've already said sorry.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,190
What else do you want?

63
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,480
Clearly, you knew everything,

64
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,480
yet you didn't contact me
for twelve years.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,510
You're the petty one

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
holding grudges.

67
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,630
You're a big bad wolf.

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,390
(Now,)

69
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,190
what I'm sending out

70
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,870
is the confirmed character design.

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000
Please take a look,

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,430
and then we can discuss it.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
On the fourth page

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,510
are the confirmed
main character settings.

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,070
Sasha, the special forces soldier,

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,430
excels in shooting

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
and is very powerful

78
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
in the game.

79
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,040
She has a sexy appearance...

80
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm sorry, everyone.

81
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,950
I came here suddenly

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,270
without prior notice.

83
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,040
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ding Ye

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
to follow up
on the progress of this game.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,800
Please, have a seat.

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,950
We're about to start.

87
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,240
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

88
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,510
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Ms. Huang,

90
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
you look familiar.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Mr. Gao,

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
I have an average face,

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,510
so you might find me familiar-looking.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,830
Let's continue.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,630
Sasha is able to survive
in the most deadly places

96
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,510
in this world.

97
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,920
She is skilled in shooting

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,310
and extremely powerful in the game.

99
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Her appearance is sexy and beautiful...

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,430
Regarding the character design
for "The Maze",

101
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,270
I would like to stick
to my original opinion.

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
Jiang Yi,

103
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,260
I know you have your own persistence,

104
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,870
but the project needs to move forward.

105
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,800
I suggest that things
that have already been rejected

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
should not be
repeatedly brought up for discussion.

107
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,560
Does anyone else have any opinions?

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,830
Mr. Gao,

109
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,310
I have a small insight.

110
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,480
Go ahead.

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,360
I've just heard
about the character design

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
for this female special forces soldier,

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,430
Natasha.

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
It's Sasha.

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,390
Sorry.

116
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,750
This Natasha...

117
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,160
Nasha...

118
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,750
Whatever it is.

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,070
Anyway, Mr. Ding Ye and I both agree

120
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,160
that this whatever-it-is

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,240
doesn't fit
the temperament of "The Maze".

122
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,480
We would like a change.

123
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,040
I am Mr. Ding Ye's agent.

124
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,720
As for the novel 'The Maze',

125
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,190
I have some of my own ideas.

126
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,040
Although I am an outsider
in game development,

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I am also

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,270
a seasoned gamer.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,510
Thus, today,

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,070
I brought something.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,950
The character in this comic

132
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,390
is called Popping Candy.

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,240
She is a girl
who can travel through time

134
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
and uses her abilities

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,360
to mend her relationship
with her friends.

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,630
Thank you!

137
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,390
What is this for?

138
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,910
You will know in the future.

139
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,720
Popping Candy
keeps traveling back in time,

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,390
while the protagonist of "The Maze"

141
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,750
keeps jumping in different timelines.

142
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,790
In my opinion,

143
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,600
they are both trying to
make up for the regrets brought by time.

144
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
The essence of "The Maze"

145
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,750
is actually a parallel universe,

146
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,000
but I think

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
the key to unlocking it

148
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,670
is still time.

149
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,270
Popping Candy

150
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,720
is different people

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,870
in different photos.

152
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,120
She doesn't have to be
a high school girl anymore.

153
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,910
She can be any character,

154
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,750
bringing freshness and excitement

155
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,720
to players.

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,440
Of course,

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,870
the comics I brought today

158
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,000
are not professionally drawn.

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,270
They are just for reference.

160
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,910
However, these comics

161
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,910
have been with me since I was young.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,320
I believe your art team

163
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,270
can provide

164
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,480
a better image for it.

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,480
This is based on your own image,

166
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,510
isn't it?

167
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
She can be any girl.

168
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,270
As I just said,

169
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,320
I have an average face.

170
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,030
I believe that a girl

171
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,720
who is curious about this world

172
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,390
can indeed be the best person to explore

173
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,440
the time maze.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,510
Jiang Yi,

175
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,440
what do you think?

176
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,030
Jiang Yi.

177
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,840
I think it's good.

178
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
The strokes are delicate,

179
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,390
and the characters are exquisite.

180
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,550
Why not use this
as the original artwork?

181
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,600
Mr. Gao,

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
what do you think?

183
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,000
If you can use Popping Candy

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,510
as the character design,

185
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,960
I believe Mr. Ding Ye

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,840
will be very willing to
cooperate with the publicity.

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,960
I really like this idea.

188
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,750
From the perspective of time,

189
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,750
we are all losing,

190
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
but from the perspective of growth,

191
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
we ultimately beat time.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,390
Thank you for today.

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,670
You finally talked to me.

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,630
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

195
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,590
I was wrong about the last time.

196
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,510
I shouldn't have stood you up,

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,960
but I really didn't mean to disappear.

198
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,360
Your phone had no signal.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,510
So had his phone.

200
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,000
Did you both travel back
to ancient times?

201
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,600
Yes, yes.

202
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,960
I was really desperate
to contact you that day.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,630
It was a sudden situation.

204
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,840
I only found out there was no signal
when I got there.

205
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,510
I got lost trying to find a signal

206
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,320
to contact you.

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,750
When I came back the next day,

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,080
I immediately contacted you.

209
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,030
However, when I called you,

210
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,550
your phone was turned off.

211
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,870
So you understand the worried feeling.

212
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,550
I looked for you the whole night.

213
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,870
I even thought of
the worst-case scenario...

214
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,320
What's the worst-case scenario?

215
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
I don't want to talk anymore,

216
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,440
and I don't want
to make that assumption.

217
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,670
This won't happen again in the future.

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,390
Okay.

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,720
Considering your good performance today,

220
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,000
I won't hold it against you for now.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,750
Thank you.

222
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,440
Also,

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,550
I really like the gifts

224
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,750
that you gave me,

225
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,790
You're really something else.

226
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,270
It took you twelve years to find it.

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,840
That's because you're too smart

228
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,910
and I'm too dumb.

229
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,320
I really want to ask you.

230
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,360
Why did you make me look so ugly?

231
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,480
How is it ugly?

232
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,670
What is this?

233
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,440
Isn't this Princess Mononoke?

234
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
If I really wanted to make you look bad,

235
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
I'd draw you as Okkoto.

236
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,960
I've seen that animated movie.

237
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,720
Don't think

238
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
I don't know what Okkoto is.

239
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
I know Okkoto

240
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,320
is a pig.

241
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,240
And this one,

242
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
what's this?

243
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,910
Isn't this Huang Feihong?

244
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,480
Didn't you always call yourself

245
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
a descendant of Huang Feihong?

246
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,270
Why did you call them all

247
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,390
Popping Candy?

248
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,200
That's because you couldn't sit still
when you were young

249
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,910
like you had springs on your legs.

250
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,080
I was actually going to
call you Jumping Tiger.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,120
Jumping Tiger is such a cute name.

252
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,630
How did you find out?

253
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,630
When I got home that day,

254
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,910
I beat the globe up

255
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,720
as if it were you.

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,840
Then the globe broke,

257
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,790
and these things came out.

258
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,670
(Anyway, you're really something else.)

259
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,360
Who would put gifts

260
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
inside a globe?

261
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
If the globe hadn't broken,

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I wouldn't have seen

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,360
these things in my whole life.

264
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,630
I thought with the frequency we argue,

265
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,790
you would have dismantled that thing
a long time ago.

266
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,360
Jiang Yi,

267
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,360
since I won this bet,

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,550
congratulations,

269
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,320
you finally have
my formal authorization.

270
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,910
So

271
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,240
you and Ding Ye
are officially friends now.

272
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,120
Friends,

273
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,960
but just friends.

274
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,320
Why?

275
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,000
Yi,

276
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,790
it's time for the meeting.

277
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,360
It's okay,

278
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
you go ahead.

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Your cold hasn't gotten better, has it?

280
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,670
Not yet.

281
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,910
Zhang,

282
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,120
can your technology department's
internship position

283
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,270
take in one more person?

284
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
Internship position?

285
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,000
Mr. Guo,

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,030
when did this internship position
become your concern?

287
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,840
(How's your game?)

288
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,720
How is it going now?

289
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,120
We finally reached a consensus.

290
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,200
Your company

291
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
has always been at odds with you.

292
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,750
How did they suddenly agree?

293
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,360
It's because of Huang Yingzi.

294
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,630
Yingzi?

295
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,150
She came to the company today

296
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,630
and talked it out,

297
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,080
finally resolving the issues

298
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,840
we were deadlocked on.

299
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,480
However,

300
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,030
with your attitude that day,

301
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,320
she still went out of her way
to help you.

302
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,320
That's because she received

303
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,030
a very thoughtful gift.

304
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,960
What gift?

305
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,960
It's a secret.

306
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,270
I'm so sad.

307
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
I've become a mediator

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,240
and even the other man.

309
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,440
You two have made up,

310
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,360
yet you didn't tell me.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you know what that's called?

312
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,720
It's adding insult to injury.

313
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,000
What's wrong?

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Are you a donkey?

315
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,670
No!

316
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,080
I was forced to

317
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,750
become the antagonist in your game,

318
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,670
an NPC.

319
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,670
Indeed,

320
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,510
this game has been played
since we were young.

321
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,790
Every time we feel like
we're about to clear a level,

322
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
something goes wrong.

323
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Is this "something"

324
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,030
Ding Ye?

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,110
I didn't say that.

326
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,070
Mingyu's company has sent me a message

327
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,310
asking me to report tomorrow.

328
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Are you Zhuang Yuan?

329
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,030
Hello.

330
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,240
Don't be nervous.

331
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Have a seat.

332
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
I'm Guo Kai.

333
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,000
I've seen your photo

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
at Mingyu's place.

335
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm Mingyu's boyfriend,

336
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
but this matter needs to

337
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
be kept confidential at the company.

338
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,480
Don't let others know.

339
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,030
Okay.

340
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,000
Can I take a look?

341
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,440
I've seen your resume before.

342
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,000
Your research direction
aligns with the research direction

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,790
of the Agricultural Science
and Technology Department

344
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,590
in our company.

345
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,440
You should know

346
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,350
that it's not easy to add a position.

347
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,310
Work hard.

348
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,590
So it's because of you

349
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:34,879
that they contacted me again.

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Why did you help me, then?

351
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,830
It's just a small effort.

352
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,960
It's mainly because your education

353
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,200
and background are good.

354
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,269
Otherwise,

355
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:46,999
no matter how hard I tried,
it wouldn't have worked.

356
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,480
Thank you.

357
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
You're welcome.

358
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,510
I'm leaving.

359
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,880
By the way,

360
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,640
if you really want to thank me,

361
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,200
I do have something

362
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,720
I need your help with.

363
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,750
Only you

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,590
can help me with this favor.

365
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,960
Me?

366
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
(The gaming company has approved
the character design of Popping Candy.)

367
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,200
(Thank you for your support.)

368
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Zhuang Yuan, what's wrong?

369
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,590
It's nothing else.

370
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,200
I want to invite you to dinner tonight.

371
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,550
Tonight?

372
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,950
This way, please.

373
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,270
Thank you.

374
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,070
You're welcome.

375
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,070
Wow.

376
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,750
Did you win the lottery?

377
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,160
Why did you treat me to a dinner here?

378
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,110
I didn't book this restaurant.

379
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,110
It was Mingyu's boyfriend
who arranged it.

380
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,270
Why did her boyfriend treat us?

381
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,480
What are you doing here?

382
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,310
Didn't Guo Kai tell you?

383
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,640
Guo Kai?

384
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,070
He just said...

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
Thanks to Zhuang Yuan today.

386
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,790
Mingyu,

387
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,400
I know

388
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Huang Yingzi, Zhuang Yuan,

389
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,440
and Jiang Yi

390
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,880
are your best friends.

391
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,550
I'm also from a small town.

392
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,400
In my hometown,

393
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,310
I have childhood friends like them, too.

394
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,350
However, when I came to Jiangzhou,

395
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,550
I lost contact with them.

396
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,030
Zhuang Yuan,

397
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,510
why didn't you tell us beforehand?

398
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
I don't know what's going on either.

399
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,960
Let me explain.

400
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,070
I did something wrong before

401
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,240
and made Mingyu unhappy.

402
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,590
In the future,

403
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
you can supervise me

404
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,160
and I won't make Mingyu angry again.

405
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,270
All right.

406
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,200
Since everyone's here,

407
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
let's sit down and order some food.

408
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,750
Mingyu.

409
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,510
I know

410
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,480
you've never liked
underground relationships.

411
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,070
You want a relationship out in the open.

412
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,310
I've done you wrong.

413
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,680
I have one more thing to say to you.

414
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,400
Mingyu.

415
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,030
You've always been my best comrade

416
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,400
and my closest lover.

417
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,110
I want to build a company

418
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,830
called 'Family' with you

419
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
and be your partner for life.

420
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,070
Will you?

421
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,510
If you don't agree,

422
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,880
I'll kneel here forever.

423
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,680
This person
really has no sense of propriety.

424
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,270
He said he was helping you

425
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,750
but he actually did you a favor

426
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,030
and then used us as free labor
to lighten the atmosphere.

427
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,590
I didn't expect

428
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,270
that he would help me

429
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,680
so that we could be the audience

430
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,590
for his proposal.

431
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,160
They say a public proposal
is a form of emotional blackmail.

432
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,550
It not only blackmails
the person being proposed to

433
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,240
but also blackmails us, the audience.

434
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,270
Then I guess
I'm a qualified audience, right?

435
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,960
It's okay.

436
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
You don't need to hide anything from us.

437
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,920
If you want to drink,

438
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,960
we'll accompany you.

439
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,070
If you want to cry,

440
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,880
we'll lend you our shoulders.

441
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm 30 years old already.

442
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,720
Why cry at all?

443
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,350
Actually, from the day of graduation,

444
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,270
I've been thinking
that there would be such a day.

445
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
I've been telling myself

446
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,750
that being friends is pretty good.

447
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,880
If there's no start, there's no end.

448
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,400
If one day she really gets married,

449
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,640
if she's happy,

450
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,310
you should be happy for her.

451
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,160
However, when all this really happens,

452
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,000
no matter how many times
I've rehearsed it in my mind before,

453
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,510
I just can't be happy.

454
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,000
How do you know

455
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,640
Mingyu is truly happy?

456
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,750
The look in her eyes cannot deceive me.

457
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
Maybe she's even deceiving herself.

458
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,200
Yingzi,

459
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,720
can you do me a favor?

460
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,790
Look at you,

461
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,640
always feeling down

462
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
and low-spirited.

463
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,350
Don't you want me to be happy too?

464
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,830
Are you looking for this?

465
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,510
I was looking for this.

466
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
"A Guide
for College Entrance Exam Preferences"?

467
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,270
Is that why you dragged me here?

468
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,270
Haven't you already decided
where you're going?

469
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,160
I just want to check out
the different majors

470
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,830
and what I can do after graduation.

471
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,000
Upon checking,

472
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,240
based on last year's admission rates,

473
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,510
you could aim for Qingbei University.

474
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,960
I wouldn't dare to
bet on something that big.

475
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,920
What about Shanghai?

476
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,110
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
is also an option.

477
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,000
There's no suitable major there.

478
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,880
Jiangzhou University
is close to home and convenient.

479
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,440
Why are you more worried about me
than my parents?

480
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,830
Of course.

481
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,720
We've grown up together.

482
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,790
It would be great if we could go

483
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,640
to the same city.

484
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,070
That doesn't mean we have to
stick together forever.

485
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,440
Don't tell me

486
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,000
you're willing to change
your preferences for me.

487
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,790
Maybe.

488
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,960
Even if we can't be in the same city,

489
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,550
among the six of us,

490
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,000
there will definitely be someone
who will continue our connection.

491
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,920
That's not right.

492
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,640
What's not right, Fang Mingyu?

493
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,590
You're so strange

494
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,440
and secretive.

495
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
I was the first to tell you
that I applied for Media Studies.

496
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,070
Why didn't you tell me?

497
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,110
I didn't say I wouldn't tell you.

498
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,240
Now I'll tell you, all right?

499
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,240
You have to keep it
a secret for me, okay?

500
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,790
I promise.

501
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,830
Qingbei University?

502
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
Calm down first.

503
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,430
This is Mingyu's personal privacy.

504
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,310
Whether she gets admitted or not,

505
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,790
don't tell anyone, okay?

506
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,750
Hold on.

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,270
In the entire Hangtian City,

508
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,160
how many people can get into
Qingbei University?

509
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,350
Even I'm worried whether I can get in

510
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,750
with the scores I get.

511
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,680
That's true.

512
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,830
Yingzi, you're here.

513
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,960
Hello, Madam Xu.

514
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,030
What are you two talking about

515
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,270
so secretly?

516
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,160
We're discussing...

517
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,750
Exam...

518
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,270
Mom.

519
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,590
I want to change
my preferences and apply to

520
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,550
Qingbei University.

521
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,590
Why did you suddenly
change your preferences?

522
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,640
It's a good university,

523
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,440
but with your scores,

524
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,750
can you get into a good major?

525
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,070
Choosing your major is a matter

526
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,400
that affects your whole life.

527
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,510
If the major isn't good,

528
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,310
you won't be competitive in the future.

529
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,030
Mom!

530
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,480
I...

531
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,000
I've always listened to you
since I was young.

532
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,510
This time,

533
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,720
I want to take a chance on my own.

534
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,750
I really don't know what's going on.

535
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,400
She really told me it was
Qingbei University.

536
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,400
I swear.

537
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,640
Zhuang Yuan.

538
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,920
Go, quick!

539
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,000
How do you find my new hair color?

540
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,920
It looks good.

541
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,110
However, they all say

542
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,720
it doesn't quite fit my style.

543
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,160
That's true,

544
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,310
it's not really your style.

545
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,200
Zhuang Yuan,
I actually know you quite well,

546
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,550
just like how you know me.

547
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,160
So you've always known

548
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,480
that I sent Huang Yingzi
to get information from you.

549
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,400
So why did you apply to
Jiangzhou University?

550
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,830
After the results came out,

551
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,070
the admissions office
of Jiangzhou University called me

552
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,590
and said there were
early admission slots available.

553
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,880
Since I met the criteria

554
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,720
and it was a rare opportunity,

555
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,680
I agreed.

556
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Congratulations.

557
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,880
Did you know?

558
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,750
I actually looked forward to

559
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,400
the idea of going to
the same university as you.

560
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,160
It's good to have a friend
not long after entering the university.

561
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,720
We could study together in the library,

562
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
eat together at the canteen,

563
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,400
and go home together during breaks.

564
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,830
I looked up pictures
of the university online.

565
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,070
There's a beautiful lake
inside the campus.

566
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,510
If we have free time,

567
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,880
we could sit by the lake

568
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,590
and daydream.

569
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,160
It would be quite blissful.

570
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240
However, that phone call

571
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,790
brought me back to reality.

572
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,350
My dreams have risks,

573
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,750
so I made a more practical choice.

574
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,480
Since you've made your choice,

575
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,920
why did you tell Huang Yingzi

576
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,790
that you were going to
Qingbei University?

577
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,160
You deserve the best

578
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,590
and shouldn't give up
your choice for anyone.

579
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,830
Zhuang Yuan.

580
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,270
Let's stick to our original intentions,

581
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
work hard,

582
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,310
and strive for the peak.

583
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm not drunk.

584
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
Take out all the alcohol in the house.

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,590
I want to drink with you
until tomorrow morning.

586
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,550
All right.

587
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,440
Jiang.

588
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,200
My relationship with Mingyu
is impossible.

589
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
You and Huang Yingzi

590
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,480
can't be like us.

591
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Among the Six of Hangtian City,

592
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,400
not a single pair has formed.

593
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,350
This is unreasonable.

594
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,200
This is unreasonable!

595
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,920
All right.

596
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,400
Our situation is different.

597
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,310
You don't understand.

598
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,350
How can I not understand?

599
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,480
I'm telling you.

600
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,160
I understand it better than anyone.

601
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,240
Did you know why?

602
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,590
It's because it hurts here.

603
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,960
Jiang.

604
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,590
You wouldn't want to see the day

605
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,110
when your beloved woman

606
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,830
is proposed to by someone else

607
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,030
and puts on a ring, right?

608
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,790
There is already one person
who is hurting in this house.

609
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,960
Go and give her the umbrella tomorrow.

610
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,190
But the weather forecast
for tomorrow is sunny.

611
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,150
That's perfect.

612
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,110
You can use it to hide from the sun.

613
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,670
Giving an umbrella
when it's raining is a nice gesture,

614
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,920
but waiting for the rain
to give an umbrella is foolish.

615
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,670
You had time to wait for it to rain,

616
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
but how could you expect others
to have time to wait for you

617
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
to confess your feelings?

618
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,400
Oh, Jiang.

619
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,670
She has been waiting for you
for twelve years.

620
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,360
You can't make her wait any longer.

621
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,670
You can't make her wait any longer.

622
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,960
Why did you come?

623
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,030
What's wrong?

624
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,360
Do you think only you are allowed to
come to my office without prior notice?

625
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
I went there because of work.

626
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,320
What are you here for?

627
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,800
That day, I was
in a hurry for the meeting

628
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,480
and didn't have time
to thank you properly.

629
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,360
No need to thank me.

630
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,000
I went there

631
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,480
because I wanted to
be the leading character

632
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,590
in the game.

633
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
It wasn't just for you.

634
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,630
Okay.

635
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,960
Let's go.

636
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,920
Where are we going?

637
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,110
Weren't we supposed to meet that day?

638
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,510
I'll make it up to you.

639
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,440
You're not mad at me anymore, are you?

640
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,360
Last time, I stood you up.

641
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,230
I was wrong.

642
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,110
If we're talking about compensation,
it should be me compensating you.

643
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,070
Tell me, where do you want to go?

644
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,710
Okay, let me think.

645
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,590
How about we go to a movie?

646
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,760
Treat me to a movie.

647
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,030
No problem, I'll treat you.

648
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,480
Don't worry.

649
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,800
It was bought according to
the size of your head.

650
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
It'll surely fit.

651
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,510
Was it specifically bought for me?

652
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,320
Yes.

653
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,760
Anyway, you'll be wearing it
a lot in the future.

654
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,630
Just wear it.

655
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,960
Let's go.

656
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,150
Go!

657
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,710
Did I choke you?

658
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,360
No.

659
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,000
Don't look around.
I've booked the whole cinema.

660
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
You're quite domineering, aren't you?

661
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,030
I didn't expect you to
bring me to watch Notting Hill.

662
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,840
It's quite vintage.

663
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,920
The movie has started.

664
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,150
The movie has ended
but you're still here

665
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,840
watching the end credit.

666
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,000
Didn't you say

667
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,550
we have to finish watching the end credit
before leaving?

668
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,030
The thing is

669
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,000
you've never once stayed
to finish watching with me.

670
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,230
That's why I said

671
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,110
today

672
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

673
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,280
Do you think

674
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,230
there's really a story
like Notting Hill in this world?

675
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,880
Overcoming all obstacles,

676
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,960
from winter to spring,

677
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,440
and then to the next spring,

678
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,960
both are thinking of each other.

679
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,000
It's a romantic movie.

680
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,960
If it isn't romantic,
who would want to watch it?

681
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,550
That's true.

682
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,550
Okay, let's go.

683
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,320
Did you forget something?

684
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,000
No.

685
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,960
(Stop crying first.)

686
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,230
I lost that whale!

687
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,030
I'll buy another umbrella

688
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,670
and draw one exactly the same.

689
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,880
(Is that okay?)

690
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
(The original one was unique.)

691
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,880
(Even if you draw another one,)

692
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,510
(it won't be the same as before.)

693
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,760
(Did you really find this?)

694
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,630
(Yes.)

695
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,510
If you really don't want it,

696
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,000
you can give it back to me.

697
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,760
I can give it to someone else.

698
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,000
It's too late.

699
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,030
This umbrella is already mine.

700
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,590
Don't lose it again this time.

701
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,150
I didn't expect

702
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,960
you to swim back to me.

703
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,320
It's because someone is so stubborn.

704
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,150
You only want this whale.

705
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,960
If I don't persist,

706
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
won't it be wandering

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,230
and lonely?

708
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,000
It's not wandering.

709
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,880
At most, it's like being adopted.

710
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,550
It definitely still remembers

711
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,710
where its home is

712
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,030
and wants to go back.

713
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,280
Okay, little whale,

714
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
we're home.

715
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,000
Okay, you go up.

716
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm leaving.

717
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,760
Um...

718
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,550
To thank you for bringing it back,

719
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,150
how about we have dinner together
tomorrow night?

720
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,070
Sure.

721
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,070
What do you want to eat? I'll cook.

722
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,110
How about some stir-fried green beans,

723
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,070
braised pork ribs,

724
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,670
steamed fish with black bean sauce,

725
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,440
and soup?

726
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,150
You have so many requests.

727
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,320
I won't get food poisoning
from your cooking,

728
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,670
will I?

729
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,840
You must eat it
even if you get food poisoning.

730
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,280
Okay, you'll be the chef,

731
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,800
and I'll enjoy the meal.

732
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,840
How about I come to your place tomorrow?

733
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,670
I haven't been to your place yet.

734
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,800
We can also...

735
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,670
Wait... Wait a minute.

736
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,360
My place won't do.

737
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,960
It's too messy.

738
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,400
I haven't cleaned up.

739
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,920
Last time when I watched the video,

740
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,280
your place looked clean.

741
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,630
It's mainly because I don't cook
at home usually.

742
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,230
I haven't been paying the gas bill.

743
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,760
There's no gas,

744
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,190
so we can't cook.

745
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,630
Then...

746
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,880
There's no induction cooker as well.

747
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,840
Look at how anxious you are.

748
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,110
It's like you're hiding someone
at your place.

749
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,590
How... How could that be?

750
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,960
I didn't say we must go to your place.

751
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,400
All right.

752
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,630
I'm going in.

753
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,000
Where are you going?

754
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,630
The entrance is this way.

755
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,190
Yes, it's this way.
