00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Zhou, what's going on?

4
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,950
Yingzi,

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Look at this week's work schedule.

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,230
Wasn't the "Bridesmaids for Rent" project
yours?

7
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,640
Why are they using Song Ke's script?

8
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,310
Morning.

9
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,480
Morning, Yingzhi.

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,560
Morning.

11
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Yingzi, your coffee.

12
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,040
Please don't get mad.

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,480
I really meant to help you
gather information.

14
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,640
I didn't mean to send my script
to the editor.

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm not mad.

16
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,950
Yiran,

17
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,480
tell me.

18
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,230
How's it going with Ding Ye?

19
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,950
I've tried to interview Ding Ye

20
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,080
and contact him many times.

21
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,080
He didn't even reply to my messages.

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,200
Let's not say about meeting him.

23
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,670
Let's discuss about this.

24
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,320
This topic,

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,230
is it worth our time

26
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,230
and energy?

27
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,430
I have a different opinion
than Yiran's this time.

28
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,320
Ding Ye

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
has a strange mind.

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,640
He contacted

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,200
the media which exposed him

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
for molesting
a drunken female passenger.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,080
But he didn't ask the media
to clarify anything.

34
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,390
Instead, he requested the media

35
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,920
to remove the picture
of the female passenger.

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
He didn't care about his own innocence.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,040
Instead, he's worried
about the girl's reputation.

38
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,390
I'm getting more curious about this guy.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,830
This matter

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
got you a chance to publish.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,950
I got a windfall too.

42
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,320
At least

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,640
I got to know you better.

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,760
Yiran.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,270
Is everything going well with Ding Ye?

46
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,160
Are you concerned about me

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,230
or Ding Ye?

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,600
If you are able to help Ding Ye

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
clear his name,

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,830
helping you to complete the interview
as quickly as possible

51
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,830
is what I would like to do.

52
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,360
Couldn't you realise
after what Song Ke did?

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,670
There is only competition
at the workplace.

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,720
Nobody is your friend.

55
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,630
Since you're concerned
about Ding Ye so much,

56
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,630
why not try again?

57
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,750
I got rejected before.

58
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,230
You only got rejected once
for your favourite topic

59
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,160
and now you're giving up?

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
You didn't even fight back
when people did you wrong.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,480
Do you think that sitting here

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,550
would help you forget everything?

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,280
I actually have my own way.

64
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,800
Whenever I feel wronged and sad,

65
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,990
I'd think of myself as Thanos.

66
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,110
With a snap of my fingers,

67
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,990
I could wipe out half of the people
on Earth.

68
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,110
Thinking it this way,

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,750
Song Ke is nothing.

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,310
You're not Thanos.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,360
You're clearly a coward.

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,870
You can only comfort yourself

73
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,070
without changing nothing.

74
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,800
Well,

75
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,800
did He Ping's matter defeat you?

76
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,360
I'll give you Ding Ye's topic,

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,550
how about that?

78
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,310
Aren't you working on Ding Ye's topic?

79
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,920
It's normal to swap unfit topics

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,630
among colleagues.

81
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,920
The best counterattack at the workplace

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,840
is to showcase your expertise.

83
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,720
If you're okay with that,

84
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,429
I'll convince the chief editors.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
Thank you, Yiran.

86
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll try my best.

87
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm heading back to work.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,520
The house has been empty for some time.

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,720
It's a bit far from the subway.

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,070
That's why it's hard to rent it out.

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,280
It doesn't matter.

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,160
If you want to rent it,

93
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,670
the owner can furnish it
with new furniture.

94
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,550
That's fine.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,360
This area

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,720
is newly developed in recent years.

97
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,480
Greening is great here.

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,600
The view is great, too.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,520
Sir?

100
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,840
Sir?

101
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,990
If you're not satisfied with this one,

102
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,280
there are two other apartments
in this area

103
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,110
to choose from.

104
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,160
It's okay.

105
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
This one will do.

106
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,400
Excuse me,

107
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
let me answer a call.

108
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,280
Why didn't you tell me
you're in Jiangzhou?

109
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,230
Did Zhuang Yuan tell you?

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,800
He even told me

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,040
you are looking for a job
at a local gaming company.

112
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,160
I haven't made a decision yet.

113
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,190
Tell me if you have a preferred company.

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,840
I work in the media industry,
I have big connection.

115
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,310
I might be able to help you.

116
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,160
Moreover,

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,870
given your capabilities,

118
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,360
if I introduce you to a company,

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
they will surely thank me for that.

120
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:12,960
Sure.

121
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,160
Thank you.

122
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,870
Let's have a meal together soon.

123
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,870
Sure.

124
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,920
Well, I'll get back to work now.

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,840
Bye.

126
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,800
(A genius writer)

127
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,720
who disappeared for more than ten years,

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,960
where did he go?

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Hunter, don't simply shoot.

130
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,750
Follow my commands.

131
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,360
What's wrong with you guys?

132
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,230
You played poorly
and didn't follow my commands.

133
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,430
You won't get paid for this match.

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,230
Yi,

135
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,280
don't be angry.

136
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
They are all newbies.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm not angry,

138
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,110
I'm just about to vomit blood.

139
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,550
Yi is the best player
in Hangtian City Warcraft.

140
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,990
He's going to compete in Jiangzhou
this weekend.

141
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,800
He might be the national champion.

142
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,430
All right, stop it.

143
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,960
That's just an invitational tournament.

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,470
Yi, don't be modest.

145
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,470
You're pretty awesome.

146
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,040
How long have we been playing?

147
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,590
Fatty,

148
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,710
get me two bowls of fried noodles.

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,070
What are you doing here?

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
You've been playing video games
for four hours.

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
I thought you might be hungry.

152
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Tell me.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,310
How do you intend to kill me?

154
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
Are you going to compete in Jiangzhou?

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,190
Can you take me with you?

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
I said, no!

157
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
I'll be your assistant.

158
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,400
I'll serve tea, do the laundry,
and cook.

159
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm going for a tournament.

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Why do you want to come along?

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,350
I want to go to Jiangzhou.

162
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,310
There is an aquarium in Jiangzhou.

163
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,520
I want to see whales.

164
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,920
What does that have to do with me?

165
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,830
I like whales.

166
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,920
You do know about this.

167
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,430
By the way,

168
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,310
there are no whales at the aquarium!

169
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,240
There are!

170
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,950
Don't forget

171
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,430
I used to help you with your homework.

172
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,350
Please.

173
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,830
How about this?

174
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,190
Before you graduate,

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll help you with all your homework.

176
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,590
Please.

177
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,880
It's just that

178
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,550
the organizer

179
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,040
only gave me a room.

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,190
Where are you going to stay, then?

181
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,640
I can get another room.

182
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,310
I will cover the expenses myself.

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,120
Do you have an ID?

184
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,590
I can sleep on the couch.

185
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,120
I can even sleep on a desk.

186
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,800
Please.

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
All the homework given
before graduation,

188
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,070
you'll help me with it, right?

189
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,040
I promise!

190
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,540
How about serving tea,
doing the laundry, and cooking?

191
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,550
You promise?

192
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,350
I promise.

193
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,350
Fine, then.

194
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,950
Have you agreed?

195
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,519
Is that a yes?

196
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,190
How generous of you

197
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,550
to have bought me ice cream.

198
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,120
If you win the tournament,

199
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,710
do you get prize money?

200
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,830
Sure.

201
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,670
A thousand yuan.

202
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,400
A thousand?

203
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,800
More than my New Year's money.

204
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,880
If I were to give you a thousand yuan,

205
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,120
how are you going to spend it?

206
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
If I have a thousand yuan,

207
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,310
I'll buy a new pair of dancing shoes
for Yifei.

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,590
Mingyu

209
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,470
always skip meals,

210
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,190
so I'll buy her a thermos.

211
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,120
Guan Chao loves Kobe,

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
so I'll buy him a Lakers jersey.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
How about Zhuang Yuan?

214
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,920
Zhuang Yuan

215
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,070
loves learning so much,

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,430
I'll buy him

217
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,160
a set of mock examination workbooks.

218
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
Do you like smart guys?

219
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,760
Smart guys are not bad.

220
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,710
But

221
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,280
they're not my type.

222
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,000
Why?

223
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,120
I am used to being free and easygoing.

224
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't understand

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,950
smart people.

226
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,520
A like-minded person

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,430
who can enjoy meals with me

228
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,350
and have fun with me till I'm old

229
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,520
suits me well.

230
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,640
What are you laughing at?

231
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,800
You're a grown man,
why are you being so nosy?

232
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,550
You haven't told me yet.

233
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,520
What are you going to buy for yourself?

234
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll buy a MP3 player

235
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,310
for myself.

236
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,310
So I can listen to Stefanie Sun's songs

237
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,430
whenever I want.

238
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,670
Nothing else?

239
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,040
Wait a minute.

240
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,950
And this.

241
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,470
I know him.

242
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
He is your favourite writer.

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,590
March 9th?

244
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,950
March 9th is...

245
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,430
After all this,

246
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,000
you came to Jiangzhou just for this?

247
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,550
I'll sleep on the couch.

248
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Are you sure?

249
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,350
Yes.

250
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,430
I am short.

251
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,280
Let me put a pillow here.

252
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,470
Here you go, a tiny bed.

253
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
It's comfortable.

254
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,670
Don't fight with me over it.

255
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,550
When I was at home,

256
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,040
I'd sleep on the couch
when I was watching TV.

257
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
It's comfortable.

258
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,670
I know.

259
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,470
I wasn't trying to fight with you
over it.

260
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,190
What I'm trying to say is,

261
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,280
when I sleep,

262
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
I usually sleep on two pillows.

263
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
So...

264
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
Don't disturb my sleep.

265
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,670
I have a tournament tomorrow.

266
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,280
Got it.

267
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,470
I sleep with my bag.

268
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
Isn't Stefanie Sun your idol?

269
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
She is my musical idol.

270
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,310
Ding Ye is my literary idol.

271
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,120
Don't tell me you came all the way here

272
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
just to get his autograph.

273
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,950
Ten years later,

274
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,950
he will definitely be a great writer.

275
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,830
His signature will be very valuable.

276
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,430
Actually...

277
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,520
After reading his book,

278
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
I have a lot of questions for him.

279
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,350
Did he write so badly?

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,550
It's so well written!

281
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,160
He inspired me to explore things.

282
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,880
Well, have fun exploring things.

283
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,470
I think reading his book

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,830
would make me like him for who he is.

285
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,920
You should go after him.

286
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,950
You're superficial!

287
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,470
I meant,

288
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,830
it's a form of appreciation

289
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,000
and a kind of admiration.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,880
Just like you loved Angelica Lee
when you were little,

291
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,590
will you go after her now?

292
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,830
Maybe.

293
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
You're more superficial than I thought.

294
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,590
I actually like whales

295
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,000
because of Ding Ye too.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,070
His first novel

297
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,550
is called
"The Man Who Dreams of Whales".

298
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,550
After reading that novel,

299
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,400
I learned about whale fall.

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,350
What is a whale fall?

301
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,350
A whale is the protector of the sea.

302
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,880
When it is alive,

303
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,710
it's a gentle yet immense presence.

304
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,160
After death,

305
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,640
its body will sink deep into the ocean

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,950
and become the warmest oasis
in the deep sea.

307
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,160
It provides habitat

308
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
for countless sea creatures.

309
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,880
Food too.

310
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,470
Sharks and grenadiers

311
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,400
feed on its soft tissue

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,670
while crustaceans

313
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,520
take shelter in its skeleton.

314
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
A whale's bones

315
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,520
eventually become
a source of energy for bacteria.

316
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,070
This is what we call a whale fall.

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,880
Whales are the most gentle miracle

318
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,190
in the sea.

319
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,120
No,

320
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,640
they're the most gentle miracles
in the world.

321
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,310
I... I'm going to sleep.

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,280
I won't bother you anymore.

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,630
I heard Ding Ye involved in a car crash

324
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,680
on his way from Chongqing.

325
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,350
This is my third time,

326
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,149
there must be a car accident
every single time.

327
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,109
I think,

328
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,070
he doesn't want to attend
this signing event.

329
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,349
Is this an attempt
to keep things mysterious?

330
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,800
He really considers himself a star now.

331
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,040
I wonder if you're a fan of his.

332
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,800
Considering his personality,

333
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,350
he surely doesn't want to do
this signing event.

334
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,149
If so,
he shouldn't have asked us to come.

335
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,149
He is irresponsible.

336
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,680
Yi,

337
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,150
when can you play with me again?

338
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,110
You've been giving me a hard time today.

339
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,630
Next time, when there's an opportunity.

340
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,070
You don't keep your account anymore,

341
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,720
how can I contact you in the future?

342
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,280
When you see

343
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,870
a change for the top player
in the game rankings,

344
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,910
you will get to find me.

345
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,830
Please upgrade your level slowly.

346
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,150
I want to be the top player
for a longer time.

347
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,000
Yi,

348
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,390
we have less than ten fully leveled
game accounts across the website.

349
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,630
It's not easy to have trained up
to this level.

350
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,150
Have you really thought it through?

351
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
Are you really selling me
both the equipment and the account?

352
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,310
Stop asking.

353
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,040
I'll take it back if you keep asking.

354
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm leaving.

355
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
Bye, Yi.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,830
You're so lucky.

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,240
Yi sold me his account.

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
How about it?

359
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,200
Have you met Ding Ye?

360
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,200
How... How about you?

361
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Did you win the first prize?

362
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,630
Here, this is for you.

363
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,150
For me?

364
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,830
Let's go.

365
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,000
Time to go back.

366
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,870
Jiang Yi, not bad.

367
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,240
You really won the first prize!

368
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,310
When did you buy this for me?

369
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,350
Just now.

370
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,630
Did you specially pick this for me?

371
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,760
No.

372
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,040
I simply walked into a store

373
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,200
and picked one.

374
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,760
Yingzi,

375
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,520
that's a nice picture of you.

376
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,720
Do you want to give it to Zhuang Yuan?

377
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,350
Why should I give it to Zhuang Yuan?

378
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,280
Didn't you know?

379
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,830
If a girl

380
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,280
gives her crush a photo of herself

381
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,110
and the guy accepts it,

382
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,630
it means...

383
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,870
Don't tell me you think
I like Zhuang Yuan.

384
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,800
You said that
when we were playing games the other day.

385
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,550
That day,

386
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,110
I thought everyone was kidding.

387
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,830
Then tell me about it.

388
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,440
If you don't like Zhuang Yuan,

389
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
who do you like?

390
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,590
I like a lot of people.

391
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,310
Tell me already.

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Stefanie Sun, Ding Ye, and Kappa.

393
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,830
Do anime characters count?

394
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,870
Huang Yingzi.

395
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,390
Why don't you get it?

396
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,720
It's going to be too late for you
if you don't get it now.

397
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
You're talking like you know everything.

398
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,000
During the Truth or Dare game
the other day,

399
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,440
did everyone really tell the truth?

400
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,040
I don't know about the others.

401
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,310
But I could tell

402
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,800
you and Jiang Yi

403
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,480
were both lying.

404
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,760
Don't you want to know

405
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,800
who Jiang Yi likes?

406
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,280
Who do you think he likes?

407
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,440
I think

408
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,310
the person he likes

409
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,960
is you.

410
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,550
Jiang Yi!

411
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,440
Wait for me!

412
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,720
(Begging me to let you tag along)

413
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,760
just to meet an untrustworthy person.

414
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,830
What did I say?

415
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,000
Such a waste.

416
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,830
I don't think so.

417
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,830
I went to the aquarium

418
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,720
and got the MP3 player you gave me.

419
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,070
It's been quite a good trip.

420
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,630
Do you think

421
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,350
that I'm a lot more reliable
than Ding Ye?

422
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,630
Why do you

423
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,720
always compare yourself with Ding Ye?

424
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,910
To be honest,

425
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
I really don't understand

426
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,800
why you admire him so much.

427
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,870
You even look forward
to being friends with him.

428
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
Now I got it.

429
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,000
You have a grudge against him.

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,390
Are you jealous of him?

431
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,910
Me? Jealous of him?

432
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,760
Why would I?

433
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
You're jealous

434
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,830
because he could be my idol.

435
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,870
I will be more famous than him.

436
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,000
How?

437
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,070
By playing games?

438
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,680
Yes. I admit.

439
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,350
I do have a talent for playing games,

440
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,440
that's for sure.

441
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,110
But I don't want to rely on that.

442
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,310
No way!

443
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,480
What I tried to say is...

444
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,280
You are usually so idle,

445
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
if you give up playing video games,

446
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
what other dreams do you even have?

447
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,440
What made you think that way?

448
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
So, what are your dreams?

449
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,240
Dreams are all talk.

450
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,280
You dare not say them out loud

451
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,680
because you're afraid
they won't come true, right?

452
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,830
Game designer.

453
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,830
What did you just say?

454
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,520
I said, I want to be a game designer.

455
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,870
The best one in the world.

456
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,070
What's wrong?

457
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,960
What?

458
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
I was just looking at you!

459
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,110
Fine.

460
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,390
When you become a famous game designer

461
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,960
in the future,

462
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
I'll come looking for your autograph.

463
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,960
That's it.

464
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,760
I'm going to take a nap.

465
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Don't disturb me.

466
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,550
Idiot.

467
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
(Hello, Mr. Ding Ye.)

468
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,720
(I'm Huang Yingzi, the editor
of news section in "New Perspective".)

469
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,960
(I would like to conduct
a featured interview with you.)

470
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,310
(Would you be interested in it?)

471
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
All right, stop hiding.

472
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Yiran told me

473
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
about Ding Ye's topic.

474
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Sir,

475
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,550
I...

476
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
Even an experienced editor like Yiran
is unable to handle him,

477
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,240
I guess we have to use you,
the risky move.

478
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
Risky move?

479
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,830
Sir, are you complimenting me

480
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,960
or insulting me?

481
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Maybe a risky move like me

482
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,240
will end up being a miracle move.

483
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,550
Let's just stop here.

484
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,070
You didn't even contact him yet.

485
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Sir,

486
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,550
I remember you did

487
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,720
a special report
on local gaming companies.

488
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,150
Can I have a look at the details?

489
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,110
You haven't finished this yet

490
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,720
and now you're thinking
about the next topic.

491
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,350
This has nothing to do with the topic.

492
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,800
It's just something I have to do.

493
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,910
Alright.

494
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,910
I will send it to your mail later.

495
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,350
Thank you, sir.

496
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,830
Hi.

497
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm Huang Yingzi, the reporter
from "New Perspective".

498
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,310
Yes.

499
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,800
I interviewed you before.

500
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,240
I heard you guys are hiring.

501
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,800
What are your requirements?

502
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,110
A bachelor's degree.

503
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
Underqualified?

504
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
But I think this job

505
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,240
depends on ability, am I right?

506
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,800
It's okay.

507
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Which company are you working at now?

508
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,480
Can you tell me about it?

509
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,200
I can't tell you.

510
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,110
(I've sent you some information
about some local game companies.)

511
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,110
(Have a look when you're free.)

512
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,520
(Okay.)

513
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,110
(Well,)

514
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,960
(buy me a meal when you get the job.)

515
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,040
(How about today?)

516
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,310
(What do you think of this restaurant?)

517
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,720
Why did you suddenly decide
to come to Jiangzhou?

518
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,070
Compared to staying abroad,

519
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,110
staying here gives a sense of belonging.

520
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
You're right.

521
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,070
Compared to the UK,

522
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,350
this place is near to Hangtian City.

523
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,680
Have you gone through
the file I sent you?

524
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,440
Have you decided
which company to work at?

525
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,480
I have considered some.

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,800
But

527
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm not sure if those companies
are willing to hire me.

528
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,680
You're acting weird, Jiang Yi.

529
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,030
I remember you used to be
quite narcissistic.

530
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,960
Why are you so unconfident now?

531
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,760
That's not it.

532
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,550
I'm worried that my requirements
are too demanding.

533
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't know
if they can match my requirements.

534
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,760
I have to answer a call.

535
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,800
Hi, sir. I'm Huang Yingzi,

536
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,520
the editor of news section
in "New Perspective".

537
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,680
I sent you a message earlier.

538
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,760
Do you remember?

539
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,870
Sir?

540
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm a loyal reader of yours.

541
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
May I have an interview with you?

542
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,830
Sir?

543
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,630
Can you hear me?

544
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,150
When is it?

545
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,070
Anytime.

546
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,960
It depends on your availability.

547
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,830
Now.

548
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Now?

549
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,520
At this moment?

550
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,200
46, Jinghua Street.

551
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,280
Who was that?

552
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,150
I think I can make it this time.

553
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,110
I'm sorry for standing you up.

554
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,590
I'll treat you next time.

555
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,870
46, Jinghua Street...

556
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,390
Wait!

557
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,310
What's the rush?

558
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,200
The dishes haven't even been served yet.

559
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,150
I'll explain later.

560
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,200
46, Jinghua Street...

561
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,550
Your sushi, sir.

562
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,040
Jinghua Street...

563
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,240
33...

564
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,280
29...

565
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,000
20.

566
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,070
19.

567
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,150
18.

568
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,440
17.

569
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,630
16.

570
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,830
15.

571
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,110
14.

572
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,240
13.

573
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,310
12.

574
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,550
11.

575
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,000
10.

576
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,440
Excuse me.

577
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,110
Are you Mr. Ding Ye?

578
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,590
Hello, Ding Ye.

579
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,280
I'm the one who spoke to you
on the phone.

580
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,350
I'm Huang Yingzi.

581
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,960
Nine.

582
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,200
Eight.

583
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,520
Seven.

584
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,870
Six.

585
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,110
Five.

586
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,870
- Four.
- What are you saying?

587
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,310
Three.

588
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,480
Two.

589
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,760
One.

590
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,390
It's time.

591
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,480
Call the police.

592
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,590
Jiang Yi.

593
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,870
Why didn't you text me back?

594
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,240
I didn't check my phone just now.

595
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm sorry.

596
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,440
Where are you now?

597
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm...

598
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,310
I'm...

599
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,520
My situation is quite complicated.

600
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,630
I'm in trouble.

601
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,280
Are you Huang Yingzi?

602
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,870
Please make a statement first.

603
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,200
I'll call you later.

604
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,520
I got to go.

605
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,240
Do you know the guy who smashed the car?

606
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,830
Do you actually know him?

607
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,000
Our situation is rather complicated.

608
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,240
He's my interview subject.

609
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,830
But it's the first time we've met today.

610
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,870
Did he ask you to call the police?

611
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,110
He didn't run away
after smashing the car.

612
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,200
He asked me to call the police
right after.

613
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,870
This guy's kind of weird.

614
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,480
Sir,

615
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,550
may I know

616
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,310
why... why did he smash the car?

617
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,550
According to his statement,

618
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,910
the car owner is an online media editor.

619
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
There's something personal

620
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,390
between the two of them.

621
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
I can't disclose the specific details.

622
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,040
What's going to happen to him?

623
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,630
Both two of them have reached
a settlement.

624
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,800
He volunteered to bear
all the compensation.

625
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,680
The car owner

626
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,760
promised not to press charges.

627
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,350
I got it.

628
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,600
Well, here's your statement.

629
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,760
Sign here if there's no problem.

630
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,510
Okay.

631
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Why are you still here?

632
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,510
I'm waiting for you.

633
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,120
Why are you waiting for me?

634
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,390
You agreed to accept my interview,
didn't you?

635
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,430
There's no need for an interview.

636
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,990
Do as you like to attract attention.

637
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,240
You may write

638
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,030
a young writer smashed car in the street

639
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,280
and was turned over to the police.

640
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,350
By the way, since when did I say yes?

641
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,030
Sir, stop kidding me.

642
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,560
I am.

643
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,240
Can't I?

644
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,240
Fine.

645
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,470
Let's just say
I misunderstood everything.

646
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,160
I am officially inviting you
for an interview,

647
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,350
could you accept it?

648
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:55,990
Sure.

649
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,910
So you agree?

650
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:57,990
I refuse.

651
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,160
Ding Ye!

652
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,240
Ding Ye!

653
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Here I come again.

654
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,760
I know.

655
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,720
The editor

656
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,990
did you a great wrong.

657
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,950
A lot of the media reported about you
without proof as well.

658
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,910
All this caused you to have
a guarded attitude towards journalists.

659
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,160
This is normal.

660
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,950
You have wild imagination, miss.

661
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,640
Then why did you smash the car?

662
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,750
Am I wrong?

663
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,310
Don't move.

664
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,560
Are you Ding?

665
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes, I am.

666
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,030
Because we didn't
delete pictures of that girl,

667
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,310
you smashed my buddy's car.

668
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,120
Such a hero.

669
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,430
After smashing the car,

670
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,560
do you think you can get out of this
with a little money?

671
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,600
What do you want, then?

672
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,470
What do I want?

673
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,470
I want to beat you up

674
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,240
and compensate you for it.

675
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,870
Can I?

676
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,600
It's too much.

677
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,160
Sir...

678
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,950
I can fight.

679
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,310
Game time.

680
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,510
Sir, stop it!

681
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,200
Stop causing a scene!

682
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,470
Where is he?

683
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,350
I don't know.

684
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,160
You, go over there.

685
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay.

686
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,310
Go.

687
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,470
You are such a good runner!

688
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,560
Thanks to your long legs.

689
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,640
Oh my...

690
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm so tired.

691
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,240
How did you catch up with me?

692
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,200
This

693
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,910
has been an exciting night.

694
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,350
First, you smashed a car.

695
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,910
Next, the police station.

696
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,430
Then, running crazily.

697
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,350
It's worse than martial arts films.

698
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,280
Run!

699
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,080
What's wrong?

700
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,310
I needed to scare you
to stop your hiccups.

701
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,120
You're quite something else.

702
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,910
Huang Yingzi.

703
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,280
I told you

704
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,870
to not drink so many carbonated drinks.

705
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,870
But carbonated drinks taste really good.

706
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,680
I heard that scaring yourself

707
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,870
would stop the hiccups.

708
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,120
You can't scare yourself.

709
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,640
Who is this?

710
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,950
So ugly.

711
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,870
I don't think anyone's going
to use this picture for a confession.

712
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,030
She looks rather familiar.

713
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,830
But I just can't remember who it is.

714
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,990
Who is this?

715
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,870
I can't believe Liao Xing put my picture

716
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,870
on the school bulletin board.

717
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,280
He is dead meat.

718
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,120
Is he taking revenge on you?

719
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,280
But,

720
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,280
no worries.

721
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,600
Look at this picture of you,

722
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,910
it looks so different.

723
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,910
No one would know it is you.

724
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,910
You're right.

725
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,720
Huang Yingzi.

726
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,760
You must be Huang Yingzi
from Class 3.

727
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,470
How do you know me?

728
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,240
Everyone knows you now.

729
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,160
What's wrong?

730
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,280
What can I do for you?

731
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,910
I'm Zhang Jiexin from Class 1.

732
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,200
I heard that Jiang Yi from Class 8

733
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,120
has been your friend since childhood.

734
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,560
Can you help me

735
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,760
pass this to him?

736
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,430
Thank you!

737
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,120
Jiang Yi is pretty popular right now.

738
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,830
What kind of taste is that?

739
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,760
Jiang Yi is such a lazy

740
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,830
and idle person.

741
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,830
He even likes to insult people.

742
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,120
What do they like about him?

743
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,350
He's not as useless as you said.

744
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,950
At least for the tournament
in Jiangzhou this time,

745
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,950
he got the first prize.

746
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,160
Huang Yingzi.

747
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,870
There's something wrong with you.

748
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,030
Why are you so angry?

749
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,830
I'm not angry!

750
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,430
Why would you say that?

751
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,160
You...

752
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,350
Yi! Yi! Yi!

753
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,280
Do your best!

754
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,030
Excuse me.

755
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,430
Jiang Yi!

756
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,200
What's up?

757
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,240
Come over for a moment.

758
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,830
This is for you.

759
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,120
Did you write this for me?

760
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,510
Why would I?

761
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,030
A girl from Class 1 asked me
to give it to you.

762
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,430
Put it in my shirt pocket, then.

763
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,390
Stop acting aloof.

764
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,120
Which is Jiang Yi's shirt?

765
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,030
That one.

766
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,560
(I heard that)

767
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,830
(if a girl give her crush
a photo of herself)

768
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,870
(and the guy accepts it,)

769
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,910
(it means...)

770
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,280
That's my water!

771
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,240
I know.

772
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,030
We have a close relationship.

773
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,910
Why would you mind?

774
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,950
What relationship?

775
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,080
A relationship
where I copy your homework.

776
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,510
Come, let's go home.

777
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,120
Head home on your own.

778
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,080
I want to do some homework
in the classroom before I go back.

779
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,560
Since when

780
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,870
did you do your homework
in the classroom?

781
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,390
I just want to be alone!

782
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,470
I told you!

783
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,910
Just go!

784
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:25,640
What's wrong?

785
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,720
Is she mad?

786
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,430
What are you doing here?

787
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,240
I was going to see you
at the police station.

788
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,990
But I couldn't find you there.

789
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,760
That's why I...

790
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,680
Do you think he looks familiar?

791
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,720
He is Ding Ye.

792
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,120
He is the interview subject
of my new topic.

793
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,420
He is my friend, Jiang Yi.

794
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,510
Ding Ye?

795
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,950
The has-been writer?

796
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,310
Shut up!

797
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,600
Ding Ye?

798
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,720
Now I remember.

799
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,720
The one who wrote the "Dream Fish".

800
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,030
It's "The Man Who Dreams of Fish".

801
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,280
It's "The Man Who Dreams of Whales".

802
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,470
Yeah, "The Man Who Dreams of Whales".

803
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,240
He has confused me.

804
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,240
Pretty much the same.

805
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Not even close.

806
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,120
Is he your boyfriend?

807
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,310
No.

808
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,280
He is just a friend.

809
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,390
I can assure you

810
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,870
that she quite likes you.

811
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,390
She has read

812
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,240
all five of the novels you wrote.

813
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,910
I've only written three novels.

814
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,720
Stop following me.

815
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,950
I'm not giving you an interview.

816
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,800
Ding Ye!

817
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,990
What I was trying to say is,

818
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,030
she is a very good reporter!

819
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,510
It's your honor
to be interviewed by her!

820
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,560
I advise you to appreciate this...

821
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,160
You're really not helping me at all.

822
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,720
Let's go.
