[Love Endures]

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,800
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,120
Thinking about it,

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,270
I'm very confident

5
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,350
that he's pretending to lose his memory.

6
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,240
What if

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,120
it is real?

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,200
Well, if he lost his memory,

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,960
he won't recognize us anymore.

10
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,680
I don't think that's real either.

11
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,790
But why would he pretend?

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,630
Is there a possibility it's because

13
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,430
Madam Wang and Mr. Jiang
are always on business trips?

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,350
He wanted to keep them using this way.

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,880
Pretending to lose his memory?

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
Looks like he is acting a drama with me.

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,510
Let's see how I'm going
to expose you today.

18
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,000
Jiang Yi!

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,880
My poor Jiang Yi!

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,950
Aunt's here to see you.

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
Aunt.

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,070
Am I your eldest aunt

23
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,720
or the youngest aunt?

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,880
I don't really remember.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
It's okay, my nephew.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,440
Look what I brought for you.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,760
Your favourite beef stew

28
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,880
and stir-fried vegetables
with fried dace.

29
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,070
I don't remember

30
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,830
I love these either.

31
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,110
Then I'm sure you don't remember

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,350
your favourite tomato juice either.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,390
Drink up, my nephew.

34
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,830
It's your favourite juice.

35
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,670
Drink up, my nephew.

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,350
Thank you, Aunt.

37
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,320
I can't believe it.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,790
He really drank it.

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,070
He really lost his memory.

40
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,950
Thank you, Aunt.

41
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,760
It tasted really good.

42
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,790
Come on. Eat more.

43
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,040
Eating more might help you to remember.

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,230
Eat more.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,160
How's it?

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,280
Can you remember this time?

47
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,830
There's nothing else we can do.

48
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,160
We'll have to use the last strategy.

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,350
Huang Yingzi!

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,200
After our repeated research,

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,510
you lost your memory

52
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,790
the moment you fell.

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
For the few days after that incident,

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,480
you remember everything.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,110
So your symptoms indicated

56
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,830
a kind of persistent memory loss.

57
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,000
You have lost your memory

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
before the men's 400 meters.

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,950
All of them.

60
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,880
Then?

61
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,590
I can only tell

62
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,270
you're quite a lucky guy

63
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,510
to have met us as your friends.

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,240
You're like a hard drive now.

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,830
The data inside your brain is gone.

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,070
But it doesn't matter.

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,000
Take your time.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
Let's make a copy

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,760
and insert into your brain.

70
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,320
I'm such a genius!

71
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,150
How to make a copy?

72
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,360
In the whole Hangtian City,

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,240
we are the people who know you best.

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,880
It took me three days

75
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,710
to compress the 17 years of your life

76
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,030
into

77
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,200
this notebook worth only three yuan.

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I wrote "The Life of Jiang Yi" for you.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,030
Next,

80
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,760
I will read it aloud to you.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,270
You only need to

82
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,440
listen carefully

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,950
and remember attentively.

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,800
When I'm done reading,

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,470
your memory of 17 years will recover.

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,680
At the same time,

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Mingyu will record in real time

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,510
and play it on Hangtian City
High School's radio station,

89
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,200
on repeat for the whole day.

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,630
Let's start.

91
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,030
Your name is Jiang Yi.

92
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,000
You were born on February 18, 1990,

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,950
in the beautiful Hangtian City.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
During your senior year of kindergarten,

95
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,710
you wore a spittoon as a hat,

96
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,360
telling you want to practice iron head.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,000
I was a kid

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and really believed
that you were talented in martial arts.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,390
One day I told you

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,150
there was a big spittoon

101
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,030
in the kindergarten teacher's office.

102
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,360
If you were able to use it
to practice iron head,

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,390
it would be a rapid progress.

104
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,830
So, during your lunch break,

105
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,030
you snuck into the office,

106
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,120
picked the big spittoon up,

107
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
and put it on your head.

108
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,950
You didn't notice

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,360
there was something in the spittoon,

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,630
spat out by Teacher Wang.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,680
Enough!

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Stop it.

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,320
Idiot.

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
You faked it!

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
You were just pretending!

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,270
By the way,

117
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,150
there was nothing in the spittoon.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
"The Life of Jiang Yi"?

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,070
Rip it up!

120
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,510
I've already finished writing it.

121
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm not going to rip it!

122
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
No way!

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,880
Give it to me.

124
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,000
Give it to me!

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,510
Here!

126
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,680
Give it to me!

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,630
I am warning you!

128
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,510
Give it to me! Faster!

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
So, why on earth did you come out

130
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
with that silly idea?

131
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,800
Because I'm really scared

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,030
that you would forget about us.

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,360
By the way,

134
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,830
that "The Life of Jiang Yi",

135
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,710
where is it now?

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,270
I don't know.

137
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,800
I guess someone destroyed it.

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
Why would I keep that such thing?

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,710
But there are a few things

140
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,710
that I've been keeping with me.

141
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,880
Wait a minute.

142
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,360
For my 17th birthday,

143
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,360
do you guys still remember

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
what you got me?

145
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Happy birthday to you!

146
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,830
Thank you guys!

147
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Where are my presents?

148
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
Thank you, Zhuang Yuan!

149
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,830
(Whenever Huang Yingzi shows this card,)

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,630
(I, Zhuang Yuan, will grant
a wish of hers.)

151
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,200
Thank you.

152
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,630
Thank you, Mingyu.

153
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,030
(Whenever Huang Yingzi shows this card,)

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,200
(I, Fang Mingyu,
will grant a wish of hers.)

155
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I officially announce

156
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,470
the Six of Hangtian City

157
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,560
is disbanded today!

158
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,070
I'm leaving.

159
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm leaving for real.

160
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,070
For real!

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,640
Leaving!

162
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm leaving!

163
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,110
I'm really leaving!

164
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,920
Why is no one stopping me?

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,230
Here I come.

166
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Yingzi,

167
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,070
this is our idea.

168
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,830
We've discussed for a long time

169
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,280
and came out with this idea.

170
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,750
Don't leave.

171
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,470
You guys worked it out together?

172
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,230
You guys are so clever.

173
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,470
It's mainly because
your previous birthdays

174
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,920
were too wonderful.

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,520
We were out of ideas.

176
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,280
However,

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,320
think about it.

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,590
Let's say I became a great scholar,

179
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,950
Mingyu became a CEO,

180
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,640
not to mention Yifei and Guan Chao,

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,750
there will be people all over the street
chasing them for autographs.

182
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,400
When the time comes,

183
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
we can get you anything

184
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
worth more than anything
you could get now.

185
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,590
You're right.

186
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,950
I understood.

187
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,750
So the four of you

188
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,470
will be earning more money.

189
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,230
Am I right?

190
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,470
What about you?

191
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,160
Me?

192
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,440
As long as I don't need to marry you,

193
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,350
I can do everything.

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,470
What did I hear?

195
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,830
Not wanting to marry me?

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,680
You made it sound like

197
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,640
I would have a crush on you.

198
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,070
So what?

199
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,830
Don't tell me you have a crush
on Zhu Baoming.

200
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:53,589
Someone is jealous!

201
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,070
Why not tell you have a crush
on Chao Tingting?

202
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,920
What's wrong with Chao Tingting?

203
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,109
She has quite beautiful eyes.

204
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:57,519
More beautiful than yours.

205
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Say that again.

206
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,950
What do you want?

207
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,040
Did you mean Chao Tingting is cute?

208
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,950
Not only is she cute,

209
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,440
but she is also a fan of Stefanie Sun!

210
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,710
You...

211
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,680
Chao Tingting! Chao Tingting!

212
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,070
Zhu Baoming! Zhu Baoming! Zhu Baoming!

213
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,870
Chao Tingting! Chao Tingting!
Chao Tingting!

214
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,440
Zhu...

215
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,870
Don't run away!

216
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,750
You get over here!

217
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,870
Stop right there!

218
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,470
Whenever it is and wherever we are,

219
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,950
as soon as I show this card,

220
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,230
you will fulfill one of my wishes.

221
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
I wonder if it still counts.

222
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,160
Among the six of us,

223
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,280
only Guan Chao stayed in Hangtian City.

224
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,280
These few years,

225
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,400
he took care
of his grandma all by himself

226
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,320
and even our parents

227
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
and family members.

228
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,230
He's getting married now.

229
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,560
He's going to accomplish something big
in his life.

230
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,870
I'm sure he'd want us, his good friends,

231
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,920
to go back.

232
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,470
If this card still counts,

233
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,470
I hope

234
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,040
you can go back to Hangtian City
with me

235
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,990
to attend Guan Chao's wedding.

236
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,870
I know.

237
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,400
We're all grown up now.

238
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,800
We have our own things to do.

239
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,280
We also have our own difficulties.

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,870
You don't have to answer me right away.

241
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,110
But don't refuse so fast.

242
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,160
The wedding's a week away anyway.

243
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,590
I'll be waiting for your answers.

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
That's the end of my presentation.

245
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,470
Thank you.

246
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,920
From your proposal,

247
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,990
we've found multiple data errors.

248
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,200
Hence, it's impossible to predict

249
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,800
the physical outcome.

250
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,440
This is impossible.

251
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,280
These mistakes are not allowed

252
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,590
in a qualified doctoral thesis.

253
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,470
After our discussion,

254
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,200
we have decided

255
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,750
that your defense for this proposal

256
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,590
is rejected.

257
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,400
Mr. Feng,

258
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,200
were you looking for me?

259
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,400
Mingyu,

260
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
I need to tell you something.

261
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,640
Guo Kai's department

262
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,350
requires several systems engineers.

263
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm sorry to trouble you, Ms. Fang.

264
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,440
You're welcome.

265
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,320
During your weekend business trip
to Hong Kong,

266
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,560
greet Mr. Xu at the head office for me.

267
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,400
Mr. Feng,

268
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,350
I want to take this weekend off.

269
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,870
I have to attend a friend's wedding.

270
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,590
Initially,

271
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,990
I secured a spot for you

272
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,200
for graduate studies.

273
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,070
But who would have thought

274
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,070
you didn't even pass your proposal?

275
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,950
This opportunity,

276
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm afraid I can't secure it for you.

277
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,750
Sir,

278
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,110
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,520
There's no point
in saying sorry right now.

280
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,950
Please,

281
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,320
don't take your future for granted.

282
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,520
Zhuang Yuan.

283
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,920
Your father passed away at a young age.

284
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,990
Your mother brought you up by herself

285
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,520
and paid for your studies,

286
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,750
all the way here.

287
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,590
I know.

288
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,990
It was not easy.

289
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,160
So,

290
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
I want to help you in any way I can.

291
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
I let you stay
because I wanted to let you know

292
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,200
this matter

293
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,920
is not completely hopeless.

294
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,400
This weekend,

295
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,070
there will be a summit
on information technology.

296
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,920
Many experts and scholars in the country

297
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,950
will attend the summit,

298
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,070
including Professor Hu
and Professor Zhang who were here.

299
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,520
You're coming with me.

300
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,470
I will look for a chance

301
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,320
to explain to the professors.

302
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,440
This trip to Hong Kong

303
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,350
is focused on Mr. Guo's project.

304
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
How about...

305
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,070
You two discuss about it?

306
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,920
Sure.

307
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,750
For the sake of this project,

308
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,070
we've been making preparation
for six months.

309
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,590
Whether the head office
approves the project or not,

310
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,750
and willing to send people or not.

311
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,040
It's all on you.

312
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,040
Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,350
It's my duty.

314
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,560
Let's go, Mr. Guo.

315
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,800
Jiang Yi,

316
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,680
as I mentioned in my email,

317
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,870
our firm has requested
a hearing for your case.

318
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,560
It will take place this Saturday
in Shanghai.

319
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,400
Actually, I got an important event
to attend.

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,110
So...

321
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm still on the fence
about going to the hearing.

322
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,070
I strongly encourage you
to attend the hearing.

323
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,470
This involves the copyright
that you own in this game,

324
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,070
including story prototype,
character design, and so on.

325
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,680
You should meet my colleague, Jennifer.

326
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,040
You should prepare for it anyway.

327
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,350
(Yingzi,)

328
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,590
(I'm sorry.)

329
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,770
(I can't make it
to Guan Chao's wedding.)

330
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,590
Excuse me.

331
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,400
May I know

332
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,230
do you have a guest named Jiang Yi?

333
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm his friend.

334
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,440
Could you check his room number for me?

335
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,230
Are you Huang Yingzi?

336
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,280
Ms. Huang, am I right?

337
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,590
Yes,

338
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,280
I am.

339
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,870
Mr. Jiang has checked out this morning.

340
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,440
He told us,

341
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,830
if there is a Ms. Huang Yingzi

342
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,800
who comes to him,

343
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,870
just pass this to her.

344
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,070
Thank you.

345
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,870
(Jiang Yi is a big liar!)

346
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,560
(He lied to Huang Yingzi!)

347
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,950
(He can't make it
to Guan Chao's wedding.)

348
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,830
(The next time he sees Huang Yingzi,)

349
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,990
(he will apologise to her
while wearing a spittoon on his head.)

350
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,950
(I'm going on a business trip
this weekend,)

351
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,680
(I'm afraid I can't make it
to the wedding on time.)

352
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,230
(I have sent you the gift money
in advance.)

353
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
(Wishing you a happy wedding.)

354
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,400
(This weekend,)

355
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,400
(I have to attend
an important academic conference.)

356
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,830
(It is related to my thesis.)

357
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,280
Yingzi,

358
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,110
you're calling on the right timing.

359
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,280
Can everyone make it?

360
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,920
Let me tell you something.

361
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,350
I just wrapped wedding candies for you.

362
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,950
A new hotel has opened in Hangtian City.

363
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,230
It is very high-class.

364
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,280
You guys can stay a few more days.

365
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,040
Chao.

366
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,990
They might not even make it.

367
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm sorry, Guan Chao.

368
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,040
It's alright.

369
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,520
It's all my fault.

370
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,270
I informed you guys too late.

371
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,600
Everyone could get prepared
if I had informed sooner.

372
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,470
Yeah.

373
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,510
They...

374
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,600
They're all busy.

375
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,120
They really wanted to come.

376
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,600
They even passed their gift money to me.

377
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,030
Got it.

378
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,550
Yingzi,

379
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,510
you're carrying
a lot of money right now.

380
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
Be careful.

381
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
Let me know when you get your ticket,

382
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,270
I'll pick you up when you get here.

383
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,510
I've been busy with the wedding
these couple days.

384
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,640
There are so many things to do.

385
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,640
I'll hang up first.

386
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,230
Sure.

387
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,990
Bye.

388
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,270
Guan Chao,

389
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,510
who called you?

390
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
It's nothing, Grandma.

391
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
It's from the hotel to order flowers.

392
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,360
So far this year,

393
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
we got only ten reports with a grade A.

394
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,400
Six out of the ten reports are
by Zhang Yiran.

395
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,080
Some of you didn't write
any reports at all.

396
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,990
There's so much online media these days,

397
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,230
I want you all to have
a sense of crisis.

398
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,360
By the way...

399
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,549
Did everyone know about the big news
that happened yesterday?

400
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:39,639
I know.

401
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,990
There was a writer named Ding Ye.

402
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,080
He was photographed last night

403
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,710
when he's molesting a woman in his car.

404
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,750
I watched it, too.

405
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,549
I think this photo

406
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,160
was chosen too deliberately.

407
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,680
Every time this kind of news breaks out,

408
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,790
there's always someone who thinks

409
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,080
this is a misunderstanding.

410
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,950
But what happened?

411
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,200
Most turned out to be true.

412
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
Each one is worse than the previous one.

413
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
I think there must be
something wrong with Ding Ye.

414
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
Look at this revelation.

415
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,950
It only talks about
this female passenger's statement,

416
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,440
which was one-sided rhetoric.

417
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,030
No evidence was taken on either side.

418
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,030
In my opinion,

419
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,600
we can't even call this news.

420
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,990
It has no credibility at all.

421
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,030
But the account that posted this article

422
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,080
has gained hundreds of thousands
of followers overnight.

423
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,510
Compared to someone who
writes articles carefully like us,

424
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,710
it's a big gain.

425
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,230
We're not paparazzi

426
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,550
who write gossips.

427
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,680
Do we have to write

428
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,600
so many unhealthy articles

429
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,310
just to gain views

430
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,640
like those marketing accounts?

431
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,840
You're right.

432
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,030
It's paparazzi gossip.

433
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,710
But it became the public topic
in just one night.

434
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,200
Ding Ye's name is trending too.

435
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,550
This is an era
where audience's view is the spotlight.

436
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,200
Don't you understand?

437
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,880
This Ding Ye also
became famous at a young age.

438
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,510
He wrote only three books,

439
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,680
but all his books are bestsellers.

440
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,840
But I heard he is running out of ideas

441
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,510
and driving a cab for a living.

442
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,030
This guy has a such dramatic life.

443
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,790
He is the highlight himself.

444
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,270
I think we should take advantage
of the popularity

445
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,400
and conduct an interview with him.

446
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,310
The interview has to be exclusive.

447
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,030
Miss,

448
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,080
can I try?

449
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't think it's that simple.

450
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,920
A deep investigation is needed

451
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,030
so that this topic won't go to waste

452
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,080
and retains its value.

453
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,080
As far as I know,

454
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,920
Ding Ye is a very difficult man
to deal with.

455
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,710
Since his debut, he hasn't accepted

456
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,510
any interview with the news media.

457
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,990
What makes you think you can make it?

458
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,120
You have to know him well
if you want to interview him.

459
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,790
I've read all his books.

460
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,360
I know him very well.

461
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,600
Being a journalist isn't
just about knowing someone.

462
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Zhang Yiran,

463
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,550
you'll handle this topic.

464
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,030
Alright.

465
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,790
That's all.

466
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,640
The meeting is dismissed.

467
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,270
Yingzi.

468
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,920
Your topic "Bridesmaids for Rent",

469
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,950
I think it's great

470
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,990
and very interesting.

471
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm sure you'll get an A for that.

472
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,160
Are you going back to your hometown
next week?

473
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,230
You're right.

474
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,710
I have something to do

475
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,680
so I need to go back.

476
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,640
I guess you'll be very busy.

477
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
I can help you sort the information out.

478
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,990
You can continue writing
when you're back.

479
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,120
Sure.

480
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,270
I'm sorry to bother you.

481
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,950
I just want to learn more and see more.

482
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,310
Sure.

483
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,680
I'll buy you a meal when I get back.

484
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,030
Thank you, Yingzi.

485
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,030
I'm leaving.

486
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,160
Are you very interested
in Ding Ye's topic?

487
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,680
I've read his books
when I was in high school.

488
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,750
I'm kind of a big fan of his.

489
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,400
Is there anything special about it?

490
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,440
I think it's just

491
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,510
sentimental literature for youngsters.

492
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,880
You can say that.

493
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,120
People who haven't read his books

494
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,360
would understand it that way.

495
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,440
Ding Ye is a good writer.

496
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,400
He is great in

497
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
emphasizing the contrast
of the characters.

498
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,750
Every character might seem happy.

499
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,550
But actually,

500
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,160
there's a hidden side to all of them.

501
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,550
Is it frustrating?

502
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,080
You were not assigned this topic.

503
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
To be honest,

504
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,310
I felt a little frustrating.

505
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,470
But you are the one handling this topic,

506
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,470
I'm good with that.

507
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm looking forward to it now.

508
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
I can't wait for you
to interview Ding Ye

509
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
so that we can get to the truth sooner.

510
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,680
In fact, whether Ding Ye
is a good or bad person,

511
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,470
I'm not interested at all.

512
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,950
If you are not interested in this topic,

513
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,880
then why didn't you just say no?

514
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,120
Because Ding Ye's getting
a lot of attention right now.

515
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
I would get more views for his topic.

516
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,270
I could only say yes.

517
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,470
This is how the workplace operates.

518
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,400
No one cares about

519
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,400
your will.

520
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,160
You're right.

521
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,160
Who would care about that?

522
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,840
Do you see this album?

523
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,840
It's not just any ordinary one

524
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
that you can easily get.

525
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,310
Look at the corner right here.

526
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,710
Do you know what it is?

527
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,550
Isn't that a doodle?

528
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,120
That's right.

529
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,600
Do...

530
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,200
Nonsense!

531
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,200
Of course!

532
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,840
That's because you don't understand!

533
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,750
Look at it from a distance
if you don't understand.

534
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,990
It might look like a doodle.

535
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,030
But in fact,

536
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,470
you'll be surprised if I tell you.

537
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,310
This is Stefanie Sun's autograph.

538
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,400
You can't touch it.

539
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
What did you say about it?

540
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,400
Huang Yingzi!

541
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,360
I can't really stand with

542
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,600
the way you show off.

543
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,880
It's only an autograph.

544
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,440
Stefanie Sun's autographed albums,

545
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,950
I have them all.

546
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,400
You can all add me on QQ later.

547
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,600
I'll be picking

548
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
a lucky winner at random

549
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,120
to listen to these ten albums with me.

550
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,790
Pick me!

551
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,400
Me!

552
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,200
What's wrong?

553
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,310
Did I freak you out?

554
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,030
I don't think
you've seen so many albums.

555
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,840
It's normal.

556
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
You have only an album.

557
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,310
You can't even compare yourself to me.

558
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,840
Smile... Smile...

559
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,230
Smile what?

560
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,840
Smiling Tiger.

561
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,550
Don't try to scare me
with Smiling Tiger.

562
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,440
There's only one big fan
of Stefanie Sun in this Hangtian City,

563
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
that's me!

564
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,470
That's me...

565
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,200
That's me...

566
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,920
Me...

567
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,920
These are all autographed albums.

568
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,990
According to the school rules,

569
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,470
no recreational products
are allowed on campus.

570
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,790
Don't you know that?

571
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,710
I know, sir.

572
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,470
The won't be a next time.

573
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,270
If you know you're wrong, correct it.

574
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,920
That's what a good student should do.

575
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,400
But it won't happen again.

576
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,840
These are confiscated.

577
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,400
Sir, I know I was wrong.

578
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,750
I really know...

579
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,470
Don't you understand what I said?

580
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,750
These are confiscated!

581
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,270
Sir!

582
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,710
Give it to me.

583
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,470
It's all your fault!

584
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,160
Sir!

585
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,990
Sir!

586
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,470
I'm nearly scared to death.

587
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,920
Mingyu,

588
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,400
has she got her albums back?

589
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,360
Since they're confiscated
by Smiling Tiger,

590
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,790
it's impossible to get them back.

591
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,880
When I was submitting our homework
in the office in the morning,

592
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,470
I heard Smiling Tiger say

593
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,550
that they'll be doing a big confiscation
for recreational products.

594
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,990
How?

595
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,710
Don't tell me they will open my drawer

596
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,840
in front of me.

597
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,440
If the teachers are not doing this,

598
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,230
I think Chao Tingting will.

599
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,270
I heard that,
in order to get her albums back...

600
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
Stop walking around.

601
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,400
I'll get my uncle to buy you
another one,

602
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,950
okay?

603
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,310
No!

604
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,880
I only want that one.

605
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,510
How about

606
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,950
we think of a way

607
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,920
to get it back?

608
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,510
I have an idea.

609
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,440
How about we snuck into the office

610
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,950
and steal the record?

611
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,790
This is not stealing.

612
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,470
This...

613
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,440
This is just taking your thing back.

614
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,120
You're smart.

615
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,990
We will get it back.

616
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,880
But there are so many of us,

617
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,600
won't they find out?

618
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,400
Nothing to worry about.

619
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,030
If they find out, we run.

620
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,360
That's what you'd do!

621
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,470
Either steal it or get it back,

622
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,440
I won't go.

623
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,030
I beg you.

624
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,270
Please.

625
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,440
Don't you forget,

626
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,080
each of you gave me

627
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,840
a wishing card.

628
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,400
Are you sure you want to use the cards

629
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,270
for a matter like this?

630
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,400
What could be more important than this?

631
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,440
Open the door.

632
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,750
They're all limited edition.

633
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,880
I want to be
a school director one day...

634
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,920
I can simply become

635
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,360
a big shot in the star-chasing culture.

636
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,440
Yingzi!

637
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,270
Hurry up and find yours!

638
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,790
Security! Security!

639
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,790
Security!

640
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,920
We are doomed.

641
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,200
The security is coming over.

642
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,790
What should we do now?

643
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,790
Guan Chao,

644
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,120
usually when you do long runs,

645
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,310
how many kilometers you run a day?

646
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,510
Ten... Ten kilometers.

647
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,710
Today,

648
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,200
can you run one more kilometer?

649
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,920
Now!

650
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,310
Which class are you from?

651
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,750
Stop running!

652
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,750
No fighting! Stop running!

653
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,600
Stop right there!

654
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,750
Stop!

655
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,030
Stop right there!

656
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
We've looked for it three times.

657
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,360
These ten are the only
autographed albums.

658
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,640
None of them is mine.

659
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,840
These belong to Chao Tingting.

660
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,310
Are you sure this isn't yours?

661
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,950
Mine has the autograph
at the bottom right,

662
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,400
while Chao Tingting's at the middle.

663
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,080
I am sure this is not mine.

664
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,990
Speaking of the least,

665
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,030
ten of them were confiscated
from Chao Tingting,

666
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,640
you just got one confiscated.

667
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,510
I think it's worth it.

668
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,120
Thanks for telling me this.

669
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,750
Jiang Yi,

670
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,360
how about we have another look?

671
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,550
Forget it.

672
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,200
Let's stop finding.

673
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,710
It won't come back to me anymore.

674
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,470
I'm never getting my Stefanie back.

675
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,360
We can't find it anymore.

676
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,440
We can't find it anymore.

677
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,310
Smiling Tiger must be
messing with me on purpose.

678
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,200
I only gave him a nickname.

679
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,200
Your records wouldn't just disappear
on its own.

680
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,440
Maybe Smiling Tiger took it home?

681
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,270
Well, we can't sneak into his house.

682
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,750
Is it possible

683
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
that everything will be alright
after a while?

684
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,230
Why don't we admit our mistakes?

685
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,470
It is just an album.

686
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,230
It doesn't worth the hassle.

687
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,270
I'm going home.

688
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,640
Where's Huang Yingzi?

689
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,310
How could she leave
without eating the dumplings?

690
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Something very important to her

691
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,360
has been confiscated by Smiling Tiger.

692
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,790
What is it?

693
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,360
Grandma,

694
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,950
it's a very precious album.

695
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,510
I guess Huang Yingzi will
lose her appetite for a week.

696
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,200
Guys,

697
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,400
I have an idea.

698
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,880
Yifei,

699
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,600
Grandma,

700
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,840
I need to ask you a favor.

701
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,840
I'll have the dumplings.

702
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,230
Sold out.

703
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,790
I'll have more dumplings.

704
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,120
Sold out.

705
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,440
Even today?

706
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,510
Grandma,

707
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,550
I've been eating your dumplings
for years.

708
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,440
My wife loves your dumplings.

709
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,880
I haven't got to buy even one
in the past seven days.

710
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,600
What should I tell my wife
when I get home?

711
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,310
Can you please

712
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,030
make a few more for me?

713
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,600
I'm not in the mood for that.

714
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,310
What?

715
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,120
Who made you angry?

716
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,080
My granddaughter's favorite album

717
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,120
was confiscated.

718
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,990
She is not in the mood to eat,

719
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
so I'm not in the mood
to make dumplings.

720
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,710
Lan Yifei,

721
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,710
did I confiscate your album?

722
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,790
I have three granddaughters.

723
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,360
Now I got it.

724
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,990
Grandma,

725
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,440
there's nothing I can do either.

726
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,510
I did it
for the sake of school discipline.

727
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,080
Let me tell you,

728
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,750
I once heard

729
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,710
your wife say that,

730
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,230
when you're in college,

731
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,040
you'd go to the radio station every day

732
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,430
to read her love poems.

733
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,710
Did you care about school discipline?

734
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,640
Grandma,

735
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,600
Why... Why are you bringing this up?

736
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,680
You even faked your sick leave

737
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,790
to buy her a birthday present.

738
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,120
Am I wrong?

739
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,270
Alright...

740
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,600
Your granddaughter's album...

741
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,480
I...

742
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,310
What's the name of the album?

743
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,230
Red...

744
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Green...

745
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,710
Light...

746
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,000
"Against the Light".

747
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,960
Yes! It's "Against the Light".

748
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,120
I got it.

749
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,790
As long as she promises not to bring it
to school anymore,

750
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
I'll give it back to her tomorrow.

751
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,480
Yifei,

752
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,790
cook the dumplings!

753
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,960
Here you go.

754
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,310
I finally got my Stefanie back.

755
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,120
I swear,

756
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,230
I won't take you to school
and show off again.

757
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,750
Alright.

758
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,310
This time,

759
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,910
all of you have done a good job.

760
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,710
Therefore,

761
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,040
these five wishing cards

762
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,270
are considered invalid anymore.

763
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,350
I hereby announce

764
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,870
our group is not dismissed.

765
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,480
Yingzi,

766
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,230
are you sure

767
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,480
to use it now?

768
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
Don't you want to wait
for us to be famous?

769
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,750
To be honest,

770
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,040
Yifei contributed the most this time.

771
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,790
How about you give her back her card?

772
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,000
You can keep the rest.

773
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,390
We didn't help much.

774
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,680
You can use our cards in the future.

775
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
You have a point.

776
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,520
Yifei, here you go.

777
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,960
Indeed, you're acting pity.

778
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,870
The person who helped the most this time

779
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,960
is Yifei.

780
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,430
Long live Yifei!

781
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,270
Long live Grandma!

782
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,910
As for the rest of you,

783
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,640
I'll ask you for my next wish
when I figure it out.

784
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,270
Slow down! Don't fall!

785
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,480
She's getting a little overexcited.

786
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,870
Look at the way she talked.

787
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,640
Such an irrational fan.

788
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,960
Wasn't that your idea?

789
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,750
Yeah.

790
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,390
I thought she was pity.

791
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,310
Does she know that?

792
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,910
I don't care if she knows or not.

793
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,310
She has been looking sad in front of me
almost everyday

794
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,120
and I am tired of that.

795
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,640
From my point of view,

796
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,680
you care for her.

797
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,200
Someone cares for her.

798
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,040
Let's go.

799
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,910
Let's do something else.

800
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,160
What?

801
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,390
(Yingzi,)

802
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,600
(Yang Fan and I will pick you up.)

803
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,640
(I'm happy to have you back.)

804
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,040
(You don't have to feel sorry.)

805
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Hey, pretty lady,

806
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,790
can I add you on WeChat?

807
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,120
What are you doing here?

808
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,870
I thought about it.

809
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,790
I can't absent from

810
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,680
Guan Chao's wedding,

811
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,350
Didn't you have

812
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,830
an important conference to attend?

813
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,910
You're not joining?

814
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,710
I'm not joining it.

815
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Those conferences

816
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,310
are not as important as you guys.

817
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,120
So this card

818
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
is considered invalid.

819
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,830
The train might be late.

820
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,080
Don't worry.

821
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,200
Guan Chao!

822
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,680
Here I am.

823
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,870
It's good to have you here.

824
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,200
Guan Chao!

825
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,680
Oh my!

826
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
Why are you here?

827
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,270
What did you mean?

828
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,430
I can't be here?

829
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,480
Weren't you kidnapped by your supervisor

830
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,270
and unable to come back?

831
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,560
This is the big deal in your life,

832
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,790
I need to come back no matter what.

833
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,040
Let me introduce you to each other.

834
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,080
Yang Fan, my wife.

835
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,230
Yingzi, nice to meet you.

836
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:31,790
Nice to meet you.

837
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,560
Zhuang Yuan, nice to meet you.

838
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,640
Nice to meet you.

839
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,910
How do you know he's Zhuang Yuan?

840
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,000
Guan Chao talks about you guys
all the time.

841
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,750
If the other three were also here,

842
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,270
I'm sure I'd recognize them too.

843
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:43,910
Enough for that.

844
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,960
Come on, let's go home.

845
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,230
Let's go.

846
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,750
Let me help you.

847
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,200
Guan Chao, not bad.

848
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,750
You have a good taste.

849
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,080
Let me do it.

850
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,310
I will get in first.

851
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,200
You get in first.

852
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:56,910
Alright.

853
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,720
Guan Chao, you're doing not bad.

854
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,280
What a nice little car.

855
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,510
Nothing special about it.

856
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,350
But,

857
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,430
I'm sorry.

858
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
Mingyu and Jiang Yi are quite busy.

859
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,560
They still couldn't make it.

860
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,240
That's all right.

861
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm very happy for

862
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,280
having you two here.

863
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,120
Zhuang Yuan,

864
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,160
why are you quiet?

865
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,200
You'll be my best man.

866
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,470
That's a must.

867
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,830
Yingzi,

868
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,720
you might as well be the bridesmaid.

869
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,990
About that...

870
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,120
Yang Fan's cousin

871
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:44,910
wants to be the bridesmaid too.

872
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,560
No problem.

873
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,600
We can get more than one bridesmaid.

874
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,990
I...

875
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,120
Stop talking nonsense
when you know nothing.

876
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,430
I'm sorry.

877
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,080
Bridesmaids must be either friends
or family of the bride.

878
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,240
How can I be the bridesmaid
when I'm friends with the groom?

879
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,240
Don't listen to him.

880
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,510
Guys,

881
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,600
I'll take you home
to put your luggage first.

882
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,910
When you're done packing

883
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,800
and my class is over,

884
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,990
let's go to get some dumplings
at Grandma's place.

885
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,470
Sure.

886
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,030
Okay.

887
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,080
Mom!

888
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,510
Coming!

889
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,680
Open the door!

890
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,030
Here I come.

891
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,240
My daughter,

892
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,910
I've missed you so much.

893
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,240
Huang Qifa!

894
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Your daughter is back!

895
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm cooking.

896
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,870
I can't believe my dad is cooking!

897
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,680
Your mother said I know nothing

898
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,200
and made me choose
between cooking

899
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,120
and square dancing.

900
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,990
You made the smart choice to cook.

901
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,350
I chose square dancing.

902
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,720
Daughter,

903
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,240
come have some water.

904
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,350
Sit here.

905
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,200
I want to ask you something.

906
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,720
Here.

907
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,030
What is it?

908
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,910
I heard that Jiang Yi
has returned to China.

909
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,800
He is now in Jiangzhou.

910
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,990
How do you know that?

911
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,990
Who told you that?

912
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,200
Anything going on in Hangtian City

913
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,600
can't pass through your mom's ears.

914
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,950
Jiang Yi

915
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,030
is not staying in Hangtian City anymore.

916
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,430
Is he coming back
for Guan Chao's wedding?

917
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,200
He is busy with work.

918
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,990
He is not coming back.

919
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,830
Speaking of Jiang Yi, I think

920
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,680
he makes a good match for our daughter.

921
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,510
Dad.

922
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,800
Don't talk nonsense.

923
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,990
I'm suing you for defamation.

924
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,200
Jiang Yi has been abroad
for so many years,

925
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,390
is he still single?

926
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,390
I don't know.

927
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,310
I didn't ask him.

928
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,910
You added Jiang Yi on WeChat, no?

929
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,390
Yeah.

930
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,350
What do you want with it?

931
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,470
Well, let me talk to him.

932
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,390
No way.

933
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,390
Just one sentence.

934
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,430
Give me.

935
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,830
Don't say nonsense.

936
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:50,990
Hello,

937
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,720
Jiang Yi.

938
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,990
It's me, Madam Guo.

939
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,680
I heard you are back.

940
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,990
When are you free?

941
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,950
Do pay me a visit when you're free.

942
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,950
I quite miss you.

943
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,200
I will make you
something delicious to eat.

944
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,800
That's enough.

945
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm sure he's back in England by now.

946
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,510
Has he replied yet?

947
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,800
(Sure, madam.)

948
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,030
Let me have a look.

949
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,560
Let me.

950
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,720
Look.

951
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,390
He said yes.

952
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,720
He was being polite.

953
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,470
Do you understand?

954
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,640
I'm a little tired.

955
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,910
I'm going to lie down for a while.

956
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,080
Call me when dinner's ready.

957
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,030
Can't you lie later?

958
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,280
The dinner's almost ready.
