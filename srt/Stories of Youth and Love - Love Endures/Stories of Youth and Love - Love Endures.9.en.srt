00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,380
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,350
You don't think I like you, do you?

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,790
Don't you?

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,310
When we played Truth or Dare
the other day,

6
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,040
you said it yourself.

7
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,640
Who gave you that confidence?

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,280
I wasn't being serious, okay?

9
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,230
Then why have you been

10
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,400
going home with me
after school these days?

11
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,000
Who wants to go home with you?

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
I just want to copy your homework.

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,230
And the day we were watching
"Chinese Paladin".

14
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,430
Why did you sit behind me on my bike?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who wants to sit behind you?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Everyone else was taken.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,760
I had no choice.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,590
Are you saying

19
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,710
that you wanted
to ride behind someone else?

20
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,640
Anyone but you.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,430
Was it Guan Chao?

22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,710
There's no way I'd pick him!

23
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,560
Then who was it?

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,350
It was Jiang...

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,790
You wanted to ride with...

26
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,800
Zip it! No!

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,400
Don't say it.

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,400
Huang Yingzi. You give yourself away.

29
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,870
It is funny when I think about it now.

30
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,680
I was too naive

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,560
to keep the secret from you.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,080
Yeah.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
I actually thought

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,120
you liked me.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,310
I was so freaked out.

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,590
Well,

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
I think we were all
just simple teenagers.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
During Truth or Dare on my birthday,

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
whether what we said was true

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,630
or not

41
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,150
it didn't really matter.

42
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,870
But now,

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,870
there is something very important to me.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,310
When I like someone,

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
I don't expect things to go my way.

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,680
However, if I don't tell the person

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,960
about my feelings,

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
I will regret it forever.

49
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,840
But sometimes,

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
we don't have the courage

51
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,870
to say words we once held in.

52
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,840
You will miss out on her

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,310
without even trying.

54
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,800
Won't you regret it?

55
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,910
Well, Yingzi.

56
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,680
I have lectures.

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,120
I'm not staying to help out.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,710
Zhuang Yuan.

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,910
There is always a way.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
Cheer up.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Okay.

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Good luck, Dr. Zhuang.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Good luck.

64
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,680
To the left a bit.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,190
Here?

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,560
Is the strength okay?

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,240
Yes.

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,630
I heard that some departments
are having a gathering this weekend.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you going?

70
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,430
It will be awkward for HR personnel

71
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,190
to join team-building activities.

72
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,590
So they never invited me.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
You don't have to feel awkward.

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,280
I think

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,400
you should go.

76
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,400
Developing a deep bond with colleagues

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,310
is an essential skill.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,150
Guo Kai.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Do I look distant

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
to other people?

81
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,830
Do you?

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,310
Look, I'm getting closer to you.

83
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,160
I can get even closer.

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
Hey.

85
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720
It tickles.

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,360
What table is this?

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,000
I have to submit this next week.

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,830
By the way, Jiang Yi came to me today.

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,360
Who?

90
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,430
Jiang Yi.

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
My childhood friend
back in Hangtian City.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
He just got back from the UK.

93
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,950
Why did you meet him again?

94
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,720
Just catching up.

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,390
We talked about Yingzi

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
and our past.

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,390
Well,

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
this is ineffective socializing.

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Not all social interactions

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,870
need a purpose.

101
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,870
Only those who have fame and money

102
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,680
can say that.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,120
By the way, Mr. Lu is resigning
as the deputy general manager.

104
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,750
Who will replace him?

105
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,950
Do you know?

106
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,750
The company prefers
an internal election.

107
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,310
There are only three people
in the company

108
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,950
who meets P10 management standards.

109
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,340
That's Zhao Miao, Zheng Xiaotian,

110
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,600
and you.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,480
Zhao Miao and Zheng Xiaotian

112
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,120
are more experienced than me

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,310
and graduated
from prestigious universities.

114
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,720
Do you think my odds are great?

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
I have faith in you.

116
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,480
Whatever the odds are,

117
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,870
I must go all out.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
I have worked hard all these years

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,070
just for this opportunity.

120
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,750
Mingyu.

121
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,510
Mingyu, I know you are tired.

122
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,510
Once I join the core management team,

123
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,160
you can resign.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
You can do anything you want.

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,270
We can live a life

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,800
we desire.

127
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,870
But for now,

128
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,510
I want you to support me unwaveringly.

129
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,720
Of course, I will.

130
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,680
Very good.

131
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm going back.

132
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,830
I have a meeting tomorrow.

133
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,040
Can you get me

134
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,830
the details of Zhao Miao
and Zheng Xiaotian?

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,630
Good. I'm off, then.

136
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,430
Hello?

137
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,030
What are you doing?

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,510
I was just about to call you.

139
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,070
What's the matter?

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,160
What about you?

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Why are you calling

142
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,480
so late?

143
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,270
I want to discuss something with you.

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,560
You want to celebrate
the New Year countdown with me?

145
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,600
How did you know?

146
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,600
I know everything on your mind.

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,390
Don't forget

148
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,390
that I wrote "The Life of Jiang Yi".

149
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,750
What is your plan?

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,630
Do you remember

151
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,320
the six of us exchanged gifts

152
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,480
during the countdown party?

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,030
I would like to have
another part like that one.

154
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,200
That is what I thought.

155
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Great minds think alike.

156
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,960
So it is settled.

157
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Bye-bye.

158
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,440
I rack my brain to come up with this.

159
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,840
I suppose your brain isn't wise enough.

160
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,200
Please say something nice to me
on New Year's Eve.

161
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,720
Well, let's go on.

162
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,390
You can see

163
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,720
there are six ends here.

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,480
Each of us will take one

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,510
and untie the knot.

166
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,320
If any two people find
your string linked,

167
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
you are fated

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,360
and will exchange your gifts this year.

169
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,390
I thought
it was some weird ritual array.

170
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,670
I'm trying to save everyone money.

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
We need to buy only one gift.

172
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,120
You are rich.

173
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
You can go out

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,030
and buy each of us a gift now.

175
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,390
Let's start.

176
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,750
I have a question.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,960
Who will go first?

178
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,790
Good question.

179
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,390
I came up with this idea.

180
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,480
So I pick the string first.

181
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,440
You all will play rock paper scissors
to decide your turn.

182
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,120
No.

183
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:02,669
I can easily come up with eight ideas

184
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,200
in one night.

185
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,320
This is not fair.

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,910
Fine.

187
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,670
What do we do, then?

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,750
We choose the strings simultaneously
after three counts.

189
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,550
It depends on our speed.

190
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
I have another question.

191
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,200
If we get the gift we don't like,

192
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,270
can we exchange it?

193
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,670
No!

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,510
All right. Starting now,

195
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,750
no more questions will be asked.

196
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,510
I will count to three,

197
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,510
and we pull the strings together.

198
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,550
Three, two, one.

199
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,550
Pull the string.

200
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,240
Let's start first.

201
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,670
What is this?

202
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,960
I hope Yifei can realize her dream soon

203
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,030
and become the principal dancer
in the troupe.

204
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Thank you.

205
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,150
Well...

206
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,000
This is for you.

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,120
May Guan Chao become
an Olympic champion soon.

208
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,840
We wouldn't know what to do

209
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
if the rest of us received your gifts.

210
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,790
Zhuang Yuan, here you go.

211
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,870
Thanks.

212
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,720
Oh, my. A limited edition
Zoro resin model.

213
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,840
Can't he dress properly?

214
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,720
You don't want this?

215
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,750
Give it to me.

216
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,390
But we can't exchange the gifts.

217
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:35,960
Fine.

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,750
Here's mine.

219
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,360
Thanks.

220
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,390
This watch is valuable.

221
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,030
Did you skip breakfast for three months

222
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,670
to save up for this watch?

223
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,550
I did.

224
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,840
And my allowance
to buy reference books.

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,750
Jiang Yi, here you go.

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,790
Thank you.

227
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,270
Here's my gift.

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,390
What is that?

229
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,670
I can't see.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,510
Thank you for your gift.

231
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,510
What is it inside?

232
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,750
Show us.

233
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,200
It is a secret.

234
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,390
Boring.

235
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,910
What you just saw

236
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,600
was the tree data structure
of the conceptual design

237
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,390
of "Spirit Forest" by Zhao Yuan's team.

238
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,630
We have already come up
with four versions

239
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,000
of the interface design.

240
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,630
The one on the first slide
is the most recommended.

241
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,670
Next

242
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,200
is the dynamic simulation test version
for the tree data structure.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Mr. Gao.

244
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,200
The concept of the tree data structure

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
is proposed by Jiang Yi.

246
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,750
He will take charge
of the dynamic simulation test.

247
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,960
What do you think?

248
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,000
Sure, no problem.

249
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,440
Jiang Yi, you will handle this.

250
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,550
I'm really looking forward
to the outcome.

251
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,510
We should call it a day.

252
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,600
Meeting adjourned.

253
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,270
(Tonight is the New Year's Eve.)

254
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,440
(Let's have a gift exchange party.)

255
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,550
(You guys go ahead without me.)

256
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,720
(I have plans tonight.)

257
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Tonight is the New Year's Eve.

258
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,870
Let's dine at the Italian restaurant

259
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,960
where we had our first date.

260
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,480
I was invited to a drink tonight.

261
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,550
I have to go.

262
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,750
Why don't you wait for me at home?

263
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,120
(Change of plans.)

264
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,670
Happy New Year!

265
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,510
It has been some time
since we had the last countdown party.

266
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,910
Do you remember
the last countdown party we had?

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,200
It was

268
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,240
more than ten years ago.

269
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,120
Do you still remember

270
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,270
that we exchanged gifts?

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Of course.

272
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,910
I got a resin model from Yingzi.

273
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
It is still on my desk.

274
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,510
I chat with it sometimes.

275
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,510
I believe Zoro is rather reticent.

276
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,720
You still remember this.

277
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,670
You really wanted it back then, right?

278
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,120
Oh, right.

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,870
Mingyu gave me those watercolor paints.

280
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,960
I have used up all of them,

281
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,080
from high school to university.

282
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,080
Afterward,

283
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
I own

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,030
my first graphics tablet.

285
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,550
Zhuang Yuan's gift was a watch.

286
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,320
I still keep it with me.

287
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,550
I know

288
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,240
the watch

289
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,840
wasn't prepared for me.

290
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,030
Well, are we going
to do the usual today?

291
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,080
We're using

292
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,630
a new method today.

293
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,270
It is simple.

294
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,000
We will draw lots

295
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,270
and then give the gift to the person.

296
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,840
Come on.

297
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,320
You prepared it.

298
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I will start counting.

299
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,550
Three,

300
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,360
two,

301
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,790
one.

302
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,030
I got Yingzi's name.

303
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,600
Mine is Mingyu.

304
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Mine is Zhuang Yuan.

305
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,270
I...

306
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,840
Zhuang Yuan.

307
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,510
Who is it?

308
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
I got Jiang's name.

309
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,440
Let's open the presents.

310
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,670
Okay.

311
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,870
Here you go.

312
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,000
This again, Huang Yingzi?

313
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,350
Be creative.

314
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,920
I thought

315
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,790
it should be the most practical gift.

316
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,030
No matter when

317
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,510
or where you are,

318
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,030
I will do anything I can

319
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,520
to fulfill your wish.

320
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,030
Okay, keep your word.

321
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,400
Any wish.

322
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,510
Yes.

323
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,310
I will keep my word.

324
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
All right.

325
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,750
It is my turn.

326
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,960
Where is my gift?

327
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,510
What is this?

328
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,200
Let me see.

329
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,960
A jigsaw puzzle?

330
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,830
You drew this?

331
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,640
Yeah.

332
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,240
When I was in the UK,

333
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,830
I almost forgot your faces.

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
So I drew this

335
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,640
and made it a puzzle.

336
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,110
As usual.

337
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,400
We can't exchange the gifts twice.

338
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
You are petty.

339
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,550
Can't I just take a look at it?

340
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,160
Let me see.

341
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,920
No.

342
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,640
Come on.

343
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,070
It is my turn.

344
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
Mingyu's turn.

345
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,880
I don't think

346
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,400
you bought this today.

347
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,110
Mingyu.

348
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's go for a movie

349
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,830
after eating in a restaurant.

350
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,070
Is it far?

351
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,030
No. It is opposite the restaurant.

352
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,680
Okay. By then...

353
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,240
Mingyu.

354
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,350
Zhuang Yuan.

355
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,590
Long time no see.

356
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,790
What brings you

357
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,110
to Jiangzhou?

358
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,510
I applied for a PhD course

359
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,110
at the university in Jiangzhou.

360
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,110
So I came to look around the campus

361
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,030
and visit you as well.

362
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,110
Mingyu, is he your friend?

363
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,440
Zhuang Yuan is my childhood friend.

364
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,350
This is Zhang Nan.

365
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,680
Hello.

366
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,480
Hello.

367
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,030
Mingyu and I are going
to eat in a restaurant tonight.

368
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,030
Do you want to join us?

369
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,920
My treat.

370
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't think so.

371
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,960
You guys go ahead.

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,830
Why, Mingyu's childhood friend?

373
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,790
Don't be a spoilsport.

374
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,680
I want to hear stories
about Mingyu's childhood.

375
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,830
Maybe next time.

376
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,030
I have a meeting with my advisor
from Hua University tonight.

377
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,270
I don't have time for that.

378
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,920
Let's meet up next time.

379
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Well, then.

380
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Let's go, Mingyu.

381
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,960
The roll call starts soon.

382
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,510
You should go now.

383
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,270
Okay.

384
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,310
Bye-bye.

385
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,480
See you next time.

386
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,680
Zhuang Yuan!

387
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,270
Why did you come out?

388
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,200
Do you have something to tell me?

389
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,790
I wanted to tell you

390
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,270
that I have changed my phone number.

391
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,830
I will send it to you later.

392
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,920
You should go now.

393
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,030
I owe you a meal.

394
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,270
Sure, see you next time.

395
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,790
Bye-bye.

396
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,310
Bye-bye.

397
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,000
Bye-bye.

398
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,510
Bye-bye.

399
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,640
(This present)

400
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
(may seem outdated now.)

401
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,440
But I have kept it with me
all this time.

402
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,240
I hope I can give it to you one day.

403
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,640
After all, I bought this

404
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,200
with my first scholarship.

405
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,550
Someone said to me

406
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,550
that when we played Truth or Dare
back then,

407
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,720
we were just telling fibs.

408
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,750
We didn't say what we meant.

409
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,030
But I did.

410
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,480
I said what I meant.

411
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,270
She also told me

412
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,750
that if I liked someone,

413
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,920
I must tell her what I felt.

414
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,000
Or else I would regret it forever.

415
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,030
Mingyu.

416
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,640
I liked you.

417
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,920
All right.

418
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
The present has been given,

419
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,160
and I got it off my chest.

420
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,350
We can move forward now.

421
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,920
I also hope the person who told me this

422
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
can move forward

423
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,440
like what I just did.

424
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,510
I like this gift.

425
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
It is not outdated at all.

426
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Zhuang Yuan.

427
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,200
I owed you a meal
when we were in university.

428
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,550
I will make it up to you.

429
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,960
Okay.

430
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,310
Thank you, Yingzi.

431
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Why?

432
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,270
Because of you,

433
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,350
I received a wonderful present.

434
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,000
I know

435
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
that no matter what lot I draw,

436
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,440
it will always be Zhuang Yuan.

437
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,400
This is the happiest eve I have had

438
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,440
in these years.

439
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,070
This is for you. Open it.

440
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,550
I have been keeping

441
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,240
Jiang Yi's gift well.

442
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,550
Now, it is time to return to its owner.

443
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,310
Whales are the guardians of the ocean.

444
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,680
They appear to be
a gentle yet enormous existence

445
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,750
when alive.

446
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,960
After death,

447
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,350
their bodies sink into the deep sea

448
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,960
and become

449
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,750
the most nurturing oasis.

450
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,440
(They provide shelter and food)

451
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,750
(for countless marine life.)

452
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,400
(Whales are the most gentle miracle)

453
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,790
(in the ocean world.)

454
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,310
No.

455
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,880
In this world.

456
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
Why are you still up?

457
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,070
Not tired?

458
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,550
You go to sleep first.

459
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,440
I couldn't celebrate the eve with you.

461
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,270
Never mind. You were working.

462
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
You celebrated with your friends, right?

463
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,670
Was it not fun?

464
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,720
It was fun.

465
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,830
What is this?

466
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,350
A New Year's gift from your friend?

467
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,880
What is this?

468
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,270
Your friend has bad taste.

469
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,700
This is kind of old-fashioned.

470
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
This was bought many years ago

471
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
and never given out.

472
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,680
Young boys always buy things like this

473
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,680
when they try to woo a girl.

474
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,720
Cheap but nice, right?

475
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,030
Your childhood friend

476
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,480
grew up with you.

477
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
It is normal for the boy

478
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,720
to like you.

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,110
Actually, we...

480
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,240
You don't have to explain.

481
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,590
Don't be nervous.

482
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,750
I'm not jealous.

483
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,880
You won't wear this.

484
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,350
Why do you think I won't wear it?

485
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,830
Come on, let's go to bed.

486
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,400
I have to reply to a few work messages.

487
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,510
You go to sleep first.

488
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't stay up too late.

489
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,960
How have you been?

490
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,350
Are you feeling stressed
about your studies?

491
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,070
Of course.

492
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,310
The national college entrance exam
is only a few months away.

493
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,960
I did quite poorly this time.

494
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,720
The questions are difficult.

495
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,400
Are they?

496
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,790
Are they not?

497
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,960
To be honest,

498
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,720
whether or not
the questions are difficult,

499
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,070
it doesn't make any difference to me.

500
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, my.

501
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,640
You are so calm,

502
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,030
even at this point in time.

503
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,790
I wouldn't be able to face myself

504
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,000
if I didn't have a positive mindset
about my grades.

505
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,960
If everyone had a positive mindset
like yours,

506
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
they wouldn't have had trouble eating

507
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,720
or sleeping.

508
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Do people really have trouble
eating or sleeping

509
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,030
just because of this?

510
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,590
No wonder she has dark eye circles.

511
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,160
Me?

512
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,920
No.

513
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,270
It is Huang Yingzi.

514
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,510
She has big dark cycles under her eyes.

515
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,110
She stays up late every night.

516
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,720
People might mistake her
for being in a fight.

517
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,590
Hmm.

518
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,680
My tiles don't look good.

519
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,070
Mingyu, you are here.

520
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,350
Hello, Madam Xu and Madam Guo.

521
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,510
Mom, I didn't bring the key.

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,720
Why are you getting so careless?

523
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,880
She is preparing
for the college entrance exam.

524
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
Studies have kept her mind occupied.

525
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,200
Exactly.

526
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,110
Zhuang Yuan can't even remember the date

527
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,350
when he is studying.

528
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,680
Because your son gets good grades.

529
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,350
I wouldn't blame her
if she had good grades.

530
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,240
By the way,

531
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,270
you didn't do well in math yesterday.

532
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,270
Did you get
the English paper back today?

533
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,160
That is your strong suit.

534
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,350
Yes, I got the paper back.

535
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
How about the overall ranking?

536
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,350
Zhuang Yuan got first place.

537
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,960
See.

538
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
And you?

539
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,680
Ninth.

540
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,590
Why did you drop so much?

541
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,110
Fluctuations in academic performance

542
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,720
are normal.

543
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Zhuang Yuan also didn't do well
sometimes.

544
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,590
They can try harder

545
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,960
next time, right?

546
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
It is different.

547
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,310
Zhuang Yuan only fluctuates

548
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,550
between the first and second places.

549
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,640
She has dropped to the ninth place.

550
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,590
Meng Shu, you are being too hard on her.

551
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,680
Yingzi has never

552
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,510
entered the top ten before.

553
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,960
If I were as strict as you,

554
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,510
I might as well upset myself big time.

555
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,960
No, it is not that.

556
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,920
Mingyu's situation

557
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,110
is different from Yingzi's.

558
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,960
What is the difference?

559
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,640
Let me put it this way.

560
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,400
Yingzi may not be good in her studies,

561
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
but she has a good personality.

562
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
She is lively,

563
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,830
eloquent,

564
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,830
and cute.

565
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,480
Besides, she has an edge

566
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,960
in writing good essays.

567
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,350
She has a promising future.

568
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,830
Mingyu is different.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,270
She only focuses on studying.

570
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,310
If she can't secure good grades now,

571
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,030
how is she going

572
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
to compete with others

573
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,590
when she enters society in the future?

574
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,200
Why so silent? You look down.

575
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,400
I ruined my test.

576
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,510
Well,

577
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,920
you can try harder next time.

578
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,590
I have been thinking about this.

579
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,440
Is being good at studying
and having good grades

580
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,680
the most important thing?

581
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,270
I don't know.

582
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,400
Anyway,

583
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,960
this is what we are good at.

584
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,030
Yeah.

585
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,270
People usually think

586
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,350
that what they are good at

587
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,790
is something they like.

588
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,830
Like Yingzi.

589
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,790
She is imaginative.

590
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,790
Jiang Yi is good at playing video games.

591
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,720
Yifei likes to dance,

592
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,240
and Guan Chao loves sports.

593
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,110
Except for me,

594
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,400
I have no specialty.

595
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,590
I find myself ordinary.

596
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,070
Not me.

597
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,640
Do you think

598
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,960
I have a dull character?

599
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
What makes you think that?

600
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
Be specific.

601
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
Sometimes, I envy Yingzi.

602
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,350
Her life

603
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,880
is interesting and fun.

604
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,030
Why do you think yours is dull?

605
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,920
My life

606
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,790
is mainly about studying
and taking exams.

607
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,790
At most, I listen to music
and read novels.

608
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,720
I always stick
to my favorite drink or dish

609
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,550
without a change.

610
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,160
Every day, when my parents return home,

611
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,590
they bring along the disinfectant smell

612
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,400
from the hospital.

613
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,400
I feel like my home is a hospital.

614
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,790
Everything is in perfect order
and routine.

615
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,680
Boring.

616
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,480
When I'm with you all,

617
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,740
I find it particularly fun.

618
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,790
Robinson took 26 years

619
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,960
before he met Friday.

620
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,200
Columbus spent 41 years

621
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,270
before he discovered the New World.

622
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,720
This interesting world
has always been there,

623
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,110
you just haven't discovered it yet.

624
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,200
I don't know. Maybe.

625
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,510
Perhaps I will only realize it

626
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,510
after I turn thirty.

627
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,310
Who knows.

628
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,960
You must believe

629
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,510
that the present you

630
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,830
is the best.

631
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,720
Okay.

632
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,750
Fine.

633
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,510
Can I have the Chocolate Planet Cup?

634
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,830
Sure. My treat.

635
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,240
But if I open it,

636
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
you can't sell the rest in the jar.

637
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,200
I will take it all.

638
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,880
It is all yours.

639
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,640
It is too sweet.

640
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,030
Are you sure you can finish all of them?

641
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,790
I can take my time to eat.

642
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,590
Thank you for your little whale.

643
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,270
Why thank me?

644
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,160
Mingyu gave you that.

645
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,270
I appreciate your good taste

646
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,750
and bought it back home.

647
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,480
Finally, it ends up in my hand
after years.

648
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
I want to ask you something.

649
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,840
Were you going to give me

650
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,800
the Zoro resin model?

651
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,670
You can think this way.

652
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,960
Zoro always keeps a straight face.

653
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,120
It matches you very well.

654
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,070
But now

655
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,280
it is with Zhuang Yuan.

656
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,590
Let's sit for a minute.

657
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,630
I can get Zoro back

658
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,710
when I go to Zhuang Yuan's campus
next time.

659
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,990
Do you often meet up with him?

660
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,000
No.

661
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,920
Recently,

662
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,510
I need to go to the library
to look up some information.

663
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,510
Look up some information?

664
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,000
I have an interview with Ding Ye,
remember?

665
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,320
Yes, why?

666
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,840
Are you having any problems?

667
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,360
I haven't started yet.

668
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,180
I used to think I knew him
more than others did

669
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,550
because I was his reader for years.

670
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,780
But now I realize

671
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,550
he isn't the person I thought he was.

672
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,480
Yeah, he has quite a few problems.

673
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,630
He has a bad temper

674
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,070
and a lot of pet peeves.

675
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,920
No.

676
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,190
I just feel

677
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,590
that he isn't like what he was like.

678
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,230
He has changed.

679
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,190
How so?

680
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,110
The previous him

681
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,630
was mysterious,

682
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,760
but he was also caring and warm-hearted.

683
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,400
But now,

684
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,440
he is an eccentric loner

685
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,070
who ices people out.

686
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,880
Dealing with him

687
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,920
is more difficult
than writing a hundred new reports.

688
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,510
He becomes more obnoxious.

689
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,510
That's not right.

690
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,550
Have you ever wondered

691
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,710
that the perfect image you had of him

692
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,300
was your imagination.

693
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,710
Impossible.

694
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
I had a hard time during my senior year,

695
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,590
do you remember that?

696
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,320
He wrote me a letter to encourage me.

697
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,710
So, do you like the person
who wrote the novel

698
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,000
or the person
who replied to your letter?

699
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,880
What difference does it make?

700
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,550
There's a huge difference.

701
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,480
What are you writing about?
You seem absorbed.

702
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,320
How did you get in here?

703
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,150
Dear Ding Ye...

704
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,510
Give it back to me.

705
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,360
I'm a big fan of yours.

706
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,440
My name is Huang Yingzi.

707
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
I would like to ask you

708
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,630
if you have ever felt lost

709
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,000
back in your high school days...

710
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,150
Sorry.

711
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,590
Never mind. I will write another one.

712
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,710
Don't write to him.

713
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,000
He won't reply to you.

714
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,510
How did you know?

715
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,480
He never

716
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,840
showed up at his book signing events,

717
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
let alone reply to your letter.

718
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,800
Anyway, I will keep writing to him.

719
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,670
Come on, just tell me.

720
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,630
How lost do you feel?

721
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,400
None of your business.

722
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,710
Fine.

723
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,000
My mom sent me some milk.

724
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,630
Remember to drink it.

725
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,710
Dear Huang Yingzi.

726
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,630
Thank you for writing to me.

727
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,670
This doesn't sound right.

728
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,510
This fellow won't say thank you.

729
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,510
Yingzi, I believe in you.

730
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,150
Gosh, who do you think you are?

731
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,590
You can't call her Yingzi.

732
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,030
After the pitch-black night,

733
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,710
there will eventually be...

734
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,480
Yingzi.

735
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Yifei!

736
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,710
Yifei!

737
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,550
What's wrong?

738
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,030
Ding Ye. It is Ding Ye.

739
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,920
He replied to my letter.

740
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,030
For real?

741
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Yes.

742
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,630
Let me read it to you.

743
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,070
Dear Huang Yingzi.

744
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm very happy to receive your letter.

745
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,070
You said that you were feeling down.

746
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,590
I can completely relate

747
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,510
to that feeling.

748
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,710
But please don't give up on yourself.

749
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,920
Don't lose your confidence.

750
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,360
When the darkness is torn apart,

751
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,480
the light awaits you.

752
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,190
Keep going.

753
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,880
Look.

754
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,550
But Ding Ye rarely replies
to his readers.

755
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,760
That means

756
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,760
I'm the lucky one.

757
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,360
I saw his handwriting before.

758
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,280
They look exactly the same.

759
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
This must be real.

760
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,190
That means your letter touched him.

761
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,510
I think so.

762
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,710
I'm alive again.

763
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,510
I hereby announce,

764
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,360
starting today,

765
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,000
Ding Ye is my most favorite author.

766
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,110
Yes!

767
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,840
Let's go.

768
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,480
Where to?

769
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,030
I'm going back to the classroom
to study.

770
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm full of hope now.

771
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
What are you giggling about?

772
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,800
Nothing.

773
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,800
All right.

774
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
I have to catch the last bus.

775
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,670
Or else I will miss it.

776
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,030
I'm off, then.

777
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,440
Get home safely.

778
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
Huang Yingzi.

779
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,280
I forgot to tell you.

780
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,070
Happy New Year.

781
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,760
Happy New Year.

782
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,230
By the way,

783
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,670
when you decide on your wish,

784
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,960
let me know.

785
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,030
I have already had one.

786
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,670
What is it?

787
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,710
Let me keep it a secret first.

788
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,880
I will tell you when there is a chance.

789
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,320
I knew you would say that.

790
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,710
All right.

791
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,030
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.
