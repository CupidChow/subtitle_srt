[Love Endures]

00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:29,456
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:40,106
The Olympics are nearing!

4
00:01:40,106 --> 00:01:41,156
They're playing guitar again.

5
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,186
Let's go and see.

6
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,546
The Olympics are nearing!

7
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,356
Yifei, time to practice.

8
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,026
Coming.

9
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,636
Guan Chao, time to practice.

10
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:52,356
Coming.

11
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:55,026
Catch.

12
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:56,906
Make way.

13
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:58,156
Slowly.

14
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,156
You can make the call.

15
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:03,746
I'll ask you again.

16
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,026
Am I prettier?
Or is Huang Yingzi prettier?

17
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:05,996
You're prettier.

18
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:06,956
You're the prettiest.

19
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,196
Fang Mingyu, Zhuang Yuan,

20
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:09,666
let's go.

21
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,476
Are you serious?

22
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,146
Get the biggest value.

23
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:17,706
Did you really do it?

24
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:18,586
Of course.

25
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,196
He's something else.

26
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:30,636
Of course.

27
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,266
It's too slow.

28
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,636
Find a faster song.

29
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:40,426
Play the thunder effect.

30
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,356
No, it's too low.

31
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:44,476
I need something brighter.

32
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:46,386
I need a thunderous feel.

33
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:47,516
You're so troublesome.

34
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,636
Remember to tighten all of these.

35
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,636
Tie this part tightly too.

36
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:51,266
Okay.

37
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:53,546
Stop writing.

38
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:54,756
Have you changed the script?

39
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,666
The NCEE is just a few months away.

40
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,036
You guys are actually doing this?

41
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:01,916
We're doing this

42
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,196
precisely because
we're going to graduate soon.

43
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,706
Don't tell me your only impression

44
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,106
of our senior year

45
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,516
is this book of mock exam questions?

46
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:09,546
Huang Yingzi,

47
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,516
I know you have no idea
what to do in the future.

48
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:12,866
But can you please not drag us down?

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,076
Sounds like you guys know
what to do in the future.

50
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:16,956
Tell me about it.

51
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:18,386
Give me some references.

52
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:20,356
I'm going to get into
a college in Beijing.

53
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,386
All of you know that.

54
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,706
Do you want to get into it?

55
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,196
Or does your mother
want you to get into it?

56
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:25,796
Both are the same.

57
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,196
I wish to get into
The National Ballet of China.

58
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,476
I wish to keep dancing.

59
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:31,796
Just listen to her.

60
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,826
That's what you call a true dream.

61
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,476
Mingyu, what about you?

62
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:39,076
I don't have any lofty aspirations.

63
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,826
I just want to be an office worker

64
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,756
and enjoy the air-conditioner
in the office while looking pretty.

65
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,036
Jiang Yi, what about you?

66
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:46,986
I haven't thought of it yet.

67
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,036
Anyway, I plan to play video games

68
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,756
the entire summer after the NCEE.

69
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,636
It's best if I can play it

70
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:52,666
for the rest of my life.

71
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:53,956
My goodness.

72
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,916
Your aspiration is actually
lowlier than mine.

73
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,516
I don't even need to ask Guan Chao.

74
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:02,666
I'm sure his first option

75
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,146
will be getting into the Olympics.

76
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,756
As for the second option...

77
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,316
Everyone shared their dreams.

78
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,146
What about you?

79
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:20,146
What do you wish to do in the future?

80
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,116
Me?

81
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,586
I never think about the future.

82
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,826
But now, I have a question.

83
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,076
I wonder how I can carry this

84
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:31,996
on my back.

85
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,026
(Today's the first day of 2008.)

86
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,556
As we bid farewell to the old
and welcome the new,

87
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,026
Hangtian City First High School

88
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,586
will hold
the Olympic Cultural Competition

89
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,316
to support the Beijing Olympics.

90
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,556
Our next program

91
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:50,706
features Huang Yingzi, Fang Mingyu,

92
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:54,146
Jiang Yi, Zhuang Yuan,
Guan Chao, and Lan Yifei,

93
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:55,266
six senior year students.

94
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,116
They will bring us a play titled

95
00:04:57,116 --> 00:05:00,026
"If Rice Cooker Is The Only Thing
At The End of The Universe."

96
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,316
Please give them a big hand.

97
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,706
I forgot my lines.

98
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:47,346
So many people

99
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,516
were looking at me.

100
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,756
I almost fainted.

101
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:51,556
Does anyone here remember their lines?

102
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:52,906
- Get the script.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:58,346
18th November 2039,

104
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,316
7:25 AM,

105
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:02,636
the mouse who kept me company

106
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:03,636
died.

107
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:08,756
Now, I'm the only person
left in the world.

108
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,586
I only have a handful of wheat left.

109
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,786
I don't know what happened.

110
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,706
I just remember that I saw no one else

111
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,346
after the explosion.

112
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,466
Do you remember them now?

113
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:29,116
Go now.

114
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:40,956
18th November 2039,

115
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,586
7:25 AM,

116
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:48,316
the mouse who kept me company died.

117
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:49,906
Say,

118
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:51,676
Huang Yingzi's acting is pretty solid.

119
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,676
I thought she would mess it up

120
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:55,026
due to the ridiculous script.

121
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:55,906
Say,

122
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:57,826
none of us wants to be an actor
in the future, right?

123
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,876
Why are we doing a play, then?

124
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,316
Didn't Yingzi say

125
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:02,196
that we should

126
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,706
challenge ourselves to try everything
at the age of 17?

127
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,676
I am full of sorrow

128
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,436
as I try to seek out

129
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:12,196
the rest of you, filled with joy.

130
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,076
Let's get ready.

131
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,196
It's our turn.

132
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:16,826
(That's right.)

133
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:18,826
(We always stayed together.)

134
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,076
(No matter how crazy things were,)

135
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,026
(we always kept each other company.)

136
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,826
(We grew up in this place called)

137
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,146
(Hangtian City.)

138
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:30,116
(We're true childhood friends.)

139
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,996
(This is Lan Yifei,)

140
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,146
(a rising star in the dancing world.)

141
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,706
(She's also my best friend.)

142
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:43,266
(This guy with ADHD
is called Guan Chao.)

143
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,146
(His nickname is Super Chao.)

144
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:46,906
(He'll achieve a record
of 10.30 seconds)

145
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,586
(for the 100m sprint.)

146
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:50,786
(This is Zhuang Yuan.)

147
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:51,906
(His nickname is Iron Teeth.)

148
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,466
(His body could never catch up
to the deterioration of his vision.)

149
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,146
(His favorite hobby is
to do exam questions.)

150
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,516
(The girl beside him is Fang Mingyu.)

151
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,226
(She's pretty and good at studying.)

152
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,196
(My mother always compared her to me
since young.)

153
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:07,706
(She's the ideal kid
in every mother's heart.)

154
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:09,376
Let's go.

155
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:10,436
Jiang!

156
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:11,826
Jiang!

157
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:12,706
Let's go.

158
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,026
(This blonde guy is called Jiang Yi.)

159
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,556
(He loves everything
unrelated to study.)

160
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:20,466
(His motto is:)

161
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,906
("Life is meant to be wasted.")

162
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:26,116
(Lastly,)

163
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,146
(there's one more amazing character)

164
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:29,076
(that I have to introduce.)

165
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,106
(That is me, Huang Yingzi.)

166
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:33,506
(My father said)

167
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,276
(we're the descendants
of Huang Feihong.)

168
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:38,276
(Therefore, helping the weak
and upholding justice are my duties.)

169
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:41,076
(My dream is
to rid the world of injustice.)

170
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:42,586
(Sometimes,)

171
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,226
(I would drag the other guys)

172
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,556
(to join me for ridiculous activities.)

173
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,156
(For example, this ridiculous play.)

174
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:54,826
(Although the audience has no idea
what the plot is all about,)

175
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,556
(all six of us know)

176
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,866
(that this tale)

177
00:08:58,156 --> 00:09:00,706
(started from the night
we first met each other.)

178
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:02,746
(Since that night,)

179
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:05,626
(all of us became an important part)

180
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,626
(in each other's lives.)

181
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,676
Is there a monster?

182
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,226
(Will we starve to death)

183
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,556
if the adults don't come back?

184
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,676
We won't. Look.

185
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,466
My house has a rice cooker.

186
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,156
We won't starve to death

187
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:37,316
with a rice cooker.

188
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:47,616
(I once thought)

189
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,656
(that the six of us would be like
the old city we resided in.)

190
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,416
(I thought we would be there)

191
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:56,336
(for each other forever.)

192
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:08,326
(However,)

193
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,486
(time changed us)

194
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:13,006
(and the world.)

195
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:32,656
Mr. Hao Ping,

196
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,496
I brought the goods you asked for.

197
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,616
Pay me, and you'll receive them.

198
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:39,736
I'll tell you the keyword

199
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:40,656
once you transfer the money.

200
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:43,056
You'll see the content

201
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,176
once you search the keyword.

202
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,056
How should I know

203
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,176
how much it's worth
when you don't have a picture of it?

204
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,776
Didn't we send some pictures to you
before this?

205
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:53,776
You mean those three pictures?

206
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,336
The pictures weren't even well-defined.

207
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,496
I know paparazzi like you all

208
00:10:58,816 --> 00:10:59,896
too well.

209
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,856
You think you can scare me
with just a few pictures, huh?

210
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,176
Girl,

211
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,776
you're too naive.

212
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,136
Those pictures

213
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,176
are on the house.

214
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,376
15th November, 9:15 PM,

215
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,896
you were wearing a black shirt.

216
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:17,616
You were meeting the lady in the picture

217
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:18,976
at Jiangzhou Park.

218
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,616
Her name is Su Jing.

219
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:21,376
She's 52.

220
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:22,656
She's a victim of the earthquake.

221
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:24,976
She received the aid
of your charity fund.

222
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,296
However, she didn't receive the money
after a long time.

223
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,656
Therefore, she contacted the media
and tried to expose you all.

224
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,056
You went there

225
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,936
to buy her silence.

226
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,696
Mind your words.

227
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:35,876
It's

228
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,296
condolence money.

229
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,376
I didn't buy her silence.

230
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:42,136
Sorry about this, Mr. Hao Ping.

231
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,176
I came here today

232
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,336
so that you could buy my silence.

233
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,336
Yingzi, the chief editor
is looking for you.

234
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:07,056
Okay, got it.

235
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,136
Chief Editor, were you looking for me?

236
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:12,616
Have a seat.

237
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:19,616
Have you obtained the thing you desired?

238
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:21,336
Yes.

239
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:22,936
I can organize

240
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,256
the recordings for you immediately.

241
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:26,656
However, I hope you can try your best
to protect the victim

242
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,656
with the level of exposure.

243
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,856
You're pretty considerate, huh?

244
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:31,616
What's next?

245
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,336
You don't know, huh?

246
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:37,216
I'll tell you, then.

247
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,656
Once this document is published,

248
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,136
you might receive

249
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,496
Hao Ping's lawyer letter tomorrow

250
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,696
for conducting an illegal interview.

251
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,016
But I found the truth.

252
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,216
This truth

253
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,456
will show the people

254
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,456
the true colors of a sanctimonious

255
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,096
elite investor.

256
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,296
We can prevent more people
from getting cheated.

257
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,576
Isn't that

258
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,616
the most important part?

259
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,096
Why must you guys

260
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,576
live like parasites?

261
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:03,976
You guys are so greedy,

262
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,256
making ridiculous demands
when there's a chance.

263
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,336
When I give you more,

264
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,136
you want more.

265
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,416
But you can't just say that.

266
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:11,856
After all, you were the one

267
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,736
who tried to "help" them
in the first place.

268
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,416
In the end, you used charity
as an excuse

269
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,776
to put the money you collected

270
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,576
into your own pockets.

271
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:20,576
How did you trick

272
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,176
all those who donated money?

273
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,136
I didn't trick them.

274
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:25,096
I just

275
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:28,136
gave them a reasonable pathway

276
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,776
to satisfy their overflowing sympathy.

277
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,896
In this world,

278
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,936
you can solve everything with money.

279
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,016
(If so, how much do you think)

280
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,496
my content

281
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:44,696
is worth, then?

282
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:49,016
Show me the thing
before you give me a price.

283
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,696
You were fooled.

284
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:52,696
What?

285
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,456
I meant,

286
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,896
the keyword is

287
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,576
"You were fooled."

288
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,336
Where's the interview?

289
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,096
I don't have it.

290
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:16,656
But I do have a voice recording here.

291
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,136
(I just)

292
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,016
(gave them a reasonable pathway)

293
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,416
(to satisfy their overflowing sympathy.)

294
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:26,216
Which media company are you working for?

295
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:27,296
How dare you trick me?

296
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,616
Aren't you afraid that I'll send
your company a lawyer letter?

297
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,176
You can go ahead.

298
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,296
I don't mind
letting this matter blow up.

299
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:35,576
What do you think?

300
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,256
You want money, right?

301
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,136
Let's negotiate a deal.

302
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:41,776
How much do you want?

303
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:45,176
I'm sorry, Mr. Hao Ping.

304
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:47,536
In this world,

305
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,736
you cannot solve everything

306
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,866
with money.

307
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:58,416
Dear Mr. Hao Ping,

308
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:03,496
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:15,216
Hao Ping, oh, Hao Ping.

310
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,256
(New Perspective is
a decent media company.)

311
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:18,576
We don't do
entertainment journalism here.

312
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,376
You don't get
to make the call by yourself.

313
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:24,056
If you want me to follow
the outline and say something nice

314
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,696
like all the other companies,

315
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:28,776
I would rather become a paparazzi.

316
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,576
Do you know how many clients
the other companies received

317
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,936
because of that?

318
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,216
How do you think New Perspective
was able to survive until now?

319
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:39,536
(This is the end of the case.)

320
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,696
Delete everything you have

321
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,696
and think about
how to apologize to Hao Ping.

322
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,456
(Why should I apologize to him?)

323
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,496
(Because you're a lowly reporter
who never got on the front page!)

324
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:49,736
(You're not upholding justice here.)

325
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:50,856
(You're just too full of yourself!)

326
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:57,016
(Chief Editor,)

327
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,536
I remember that on my first day

328
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,136
joining this company in Beijing,

329
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,216
you were the one who told me

330
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:07,416
that digging out the truth
was the duty of a reporter.

331
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:09,016
If so, do you remember

332
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,296
why you were transferred here
from Beijing?

333
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:11,576
Yes, I was transferred.

334
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,056
But I don't think that was my fault.

335
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,056
Even if I were to receive
his lawyer letter

336
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,016
because of this case,

337
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,296
I think it's worth it.

338
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,136
But have you ever considered the fact
that there are other people here?

339
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:18,816
(Zhou)

340
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,936
(and the entire company)

341
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:20,976
(will receive a lawyer letter from him.)

342
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,496
(What gives you the right to decide
that worth for them?)

343
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:26,336
(Huang Yingzi,)

344
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:28,136
(the truth is important.)

345
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:29,896
(However, in the adult world,)

346
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,336
(you don't get to change the world)

347
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:32,976
(just because you're willing
to break the rules.)

348
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:41,216
(Hello, Huang Yingzi at the age of 30.)

349
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:43,696
I'm sure you've already become

350
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,336
a famous reporter by now.

351
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,096
(There's no justice
that you cannot uphold)

352
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,656
(or villain that you cannot catch.)

353
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:50,976
(All villains will have
no place to hide.)

354
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,296
I believe that your friends

355
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,016
will still stand by you

356
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:56,576
at that moment.

357
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,716
No.

358
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,856
Not just 30.

359
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:02,416
We must stay together
even at the age of 80.

360
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:57,136
(Yang Fan and I will hold our wedding)

361
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:58,456
(at 7th December.)

362
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,016
(By then,)

363
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,296
(all of you must attend it.)

364
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,055
Yingzi, where are you going?

365
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:24,895
The wonton shop.

366
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,016
Be careful.

367
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,336
Huang Yingzi, you're speeding.

368
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,816
Why don't you say that I'm drunk riding?

369
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,096
GIANT? Is that a new bike?

370
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:50,856
Sorry about this.

371
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,856
I won't become your patron again.

372
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,336
That's hard to say for sure.

373
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,496
You're done?

374
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,896
Come again.

375
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,056
Yifei, go and clean the table.

376
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,656
Where's Huang Yingzi?

377
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,856
She won an award in the essay contest.

378
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,856
Her father agreed to buy her
a mountain bike.

379
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:12,896
I think she'll only come back
after riding it

380
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,136
around Hangtian City.

381
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,496
That lass.

382
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:18,016
She was good with essays
when she was in primary school.

383
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,696
I think she can become
a famous author in the future.

384
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,416
She might become a racer too.

385
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:27,656
What do you think?

386
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:29,576
Isn't it cool?

387
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,016
What kind of color is that?

388
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,176
What do you know?

389
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,456
This is midnight blue, the latest trend.

390
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,896
You should've chosen white.

391
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,016
I thought blue looked nice too.

392
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,216
It matches your bag.

393
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,256
Yifei is trendy indeed.

394
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,016
Yingzi.

395
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,776
Go and wash your hands.

396
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,656
Didn't you say you want to learn
how to make wontons?

397
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,616
You didn't pick it up
even though it has been half a semester.

398
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:48,336
Hurry up.

399
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,296
Roger that!

400
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,056
You scared me.

401
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,096
Mischievous girl.

402
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,616
I'll go and get the skin. Wait here.

403
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,976
My father gave me pocket money today.

404
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,816
Let me buy you guys a meal
at McDonald's.

405
00:20:03,656 --> 00:20:05,976
I thought you wanted to learn
how to make wontons from Grandma?

406
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:08,696
I can learn that next time.

407
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:10,696
McDonald's is introducing
a new item this week.

408
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:11,936
I don't know what it is yet.

409
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:12,616
Why don't we try it out?

410
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,016
Why don't I treat you guys to a movie

411
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,136
after having McDonald's?

412
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,616
"Turn Left, Turn Right"?

413
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:23,456
That's right.

414
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:25,536
Stefanie Sun sang the theme song.

415
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:26,456
Are you guys joining me or not?

416
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:29,536
Let's go!

417
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,096
This lass is really something else.

418
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:22,576
(Yifei,)

419
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:24,176
(Guan Chao is getting married.)

420
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,336
(You should've received
the invitation by now.)

421
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,176
(Will you be coming?)

422
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,096
(Hello.)

423
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,736
(Hello, Yingzi. It's me.)

424
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,336
(Yifei?)

425
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:04,336
Yifei!

426
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,136
What time is your flight?

427
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:11,256
Tonight.

428
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:12,536
I'll be going on a tour in Europe

429
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,536
with the ballet troupe.

430
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,696
You're leaving already?

431
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,536
But I'm truly happy for you.

432
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:19,696
Your dream has finally come true.

433
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,136
How have you been lately?

434
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,416
Are you doing okay with work?

435
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:26,536
Is it stressful?

436
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,696
Nope. My work has gone smoothly.

437
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:32,856
You've lost weight.

438
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:34,656
You look exhausted.

439
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:37,656
I don't look exhausted at all.

440
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,816
I didn't lose weight.

441
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,256
I'm as round as I was

442
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,456
when I was young.

443
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:42,896
Why?

444
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,376
Can't you tell me the truth even now?

445
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:49,016
That's not it.

446
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,176
I just...

447
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:56,656
I was just reminded
of our childhood lately.

448
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,416
Back then,

449
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,896
when the six of us were together,

450
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:02,016
it felt like I dared try
many ridiculous things.

451
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,216
And I thought I could succeed
at everything.

452
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,016
Now that our group has been disbanded,

453
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:08,816
it feels like

454
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,336
I can't do anything well

455
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,616
and that no one needs me anymore.

456
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:24,536
Why am I telling you this?

457
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,576
The older I get,
the more sentimental I get.

458
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:33,296
Yingzi,

459
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,256
find everyone back.

460
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:37,896
Let's return to Hangtian City together

461
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:40,016
and attend Guan Chao's wedding.

462
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,416
Find everyone back?

463
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,136
Everyone should be quite busy.

464
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,816
I think it'll be difficult
to find them back.

465
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,256
Don't underestimate yourself.

466
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:55,016
Maybe they're just like me.

467
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,096
All of us need you

468
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:58,416
at plenty of moments.

469
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,576
Don't you feel terrible

470
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,056
that Guan Chao is getting married?

471
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:14,376
We...

472
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:16,416
We are adults now.

473
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:18,176
We can't just keep looking back.

474
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:22,056
I hope that he can attain happiness.

475
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:23,816
I'm truly happy for him

476
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,376
that he's getting married.

477
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:29,936
Yingzi,

478
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,256
do you still remember
that you were the one

479
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:34,856
who led us to doing everything
when we were young?

480
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:38,936
This time, you're the only one
who can do this.

481
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:56,896
Trust me.

482
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:58,136
Guan Chao,

483
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,816
I'm sure he needs all of us.

484
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:10,256
It's a deal, okay?

485
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:14,976
Alright.

486
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,616
I'm running late for the flight.

487
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:19,656
I'll make a move first.

488
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:21,776
Take good care of yourself.

489
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:25,996
Hello?

490
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,256
Mingyu, it's me.

491
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,816
It's been so long
since we kept in touch.

492
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,736
You know that I'm in Jiangzhou, right?

493
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,816
You know that Guan Chao
is getting married, right?

494
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:41,096
Sorry about that,
I'm working overtime now.

495
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:41,896
I'll hang up first.

496
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,016
Sorry about that, Mr. Feng.

497
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,256
Please continue.

498
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,216
You see,

499
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,936
I emailed the HR Department last week.

500
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,256
Your KPI for this week

501
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:03,176
is to optimize half of the workforce
in the Marketing Department.

502
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,656
But now,

503
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,136
nothing has been improved.

504
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,736
You always knew your priorities.

505
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:12,376
I hope you can do the same this time.

506
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,536
If not,

507
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,296
maybe the HR Department

508
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,736
might appear on this list next time.

509
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:38,536
(It's fine. You can resume your work.)

510
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:40,216
(I just want to ask you)

511
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,696
(whether or not you want to
return to Hangtian City together)

512
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,456
(since Guan Chao is getting married.)

513
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:03,056
(Guan is getting married.)

514
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,176
(Will you attend it?)

515
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,496
Is it still open?

516
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,256
We'll close in ten minutes.

517
00:28:53,256 --> 00:28:54,256
Great.

518
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:55,456
Mister, what would you like?

519
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,416
I want three cups of iced Americano.

520
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,296
Milk without sugar.

521
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:59,416
Two Americanos with sugar
and without milk.

522
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,736
One with no sugar and milk.

523
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:01,816
One cup of hot latte with half sugar.

524
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:03,216
Two cups of iced latter without sugar.

525
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:04,296
Give me double espresso for all of them.

526
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,336
Two cups of mocha,
one cup of Long White,

527
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:06,496
and a cup of Caramel Macchiato.

528
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:07,456
Takeaway, please.

529
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:12,976
Mister, sorry about that.

530
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:16,216
Can you repeat your order?

531
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:21,056
Zhuang Yuan, where are you?

532
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:22,776
Stop urging me.
I'm already at Academy Road.

533
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:24,256
Ma urged me for the third time.

534
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:25,376
We have to pull an all-nighter tonight.

535
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,216
You're holding the key to our survival.

536
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,056
I know that.

537
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:28,616
I'll be there in a second.

538
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:29,616
Stop urging me.

539
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:38,896
Zhuang Yuan.

540
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:45,096
Yingzi?

541
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,296
These are the remaining ones.

542
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,536
That means

543
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,496
you'll be reprimanded

544
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,456
even if you bring them back.

545
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:58,456
That's why I've decided

546
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:00,016
to share them with you.

547
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,536
Great minds do think alike.

548
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,856
I thought of the same thing.

549
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:06,896
I bought a slice of cake too.

550
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:07,856
Perfect.

551
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:11,816
What are you doing here?

552
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:14,376
I was looking for you at your school.

553
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:15,056
Initially,

554
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:16,456
I wanted to sneak in
by pretending to be a student.

555
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:18,256
The security guard saw through me

556
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:19,576
and chased me out.

557
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:21,136
He's not blind, you know?

558
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:22,496
What?

559
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,656
Don't I look like a professor

560
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,576
who studies AI?

561
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,576
Let me take a good look.

562
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:33,176
It might've been better
if you wore glasses.

563
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:34,696
To hell with you.

564
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,376
I don't want to be a professor.

565
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,376
Being a professor looks tough to me

566
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:40,976
when I look at your current state.

567
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:43,456
Not only do you have to look at
those formulas all day long,

568
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,896
but you also have to serve your faculty.

569
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:47,336
You have no idea

570
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,976
how many people are envious of me.

571
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:50,656
They're envious of you?

572
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:51,776
For what?

573
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:53,536
For getting the chance to run
while buying coffee

574
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,256
and forking out your own money
to buy them?

575
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:56,136
People say

576
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:57,776
that this is the path
for graduate students.

577
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,336
It depends on
who's determined enough to stay.

578
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,776
In my eyes,

579
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:03,976
you can become a graduate student

580
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:05,096
with your abilities alone.

581
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:07,296
You don't have to do this at all.

582
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,256
Enough. Let's stop talking about me.

583
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,336
Tell me.

584
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:12,096
You came here to look for me

585
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,616
because of Guan's wedding, right?

586
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,816
I did have a favor to ask of you.

587
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,696
Do you need me to pick an outfit
or a present for you?

588
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,376
No, neither.

589
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:25,776
I want you

590
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,776
to join me in finding Mingyu.

591
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:35,576
I have to do my thesis proposal soon.

592
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,256
I have no time

593
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:37,376
for that.

594
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,856
Don't tell me
you still dare not see Mingyu?

595
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,056
Speak for yourself.

596
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:46,256
Fine.

597
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:48,656
I admit that I dare not see her.

598
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,456
So what?

599
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,176
Zhuang Yuan, I'm begging you.

600
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,176
Please join me.

601
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:55,096
Zhuang Yuan,

602
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,056
have I ever begged you

603
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,296
since young?

604
00:31:59,536 --> 00:32:00,496
In 2006,

605
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:01,816
you begged me to steal

606
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,176
the answers for our exams
in the teachers' office.

607
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:04,056
During the next semester,

608
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,016
in order to buy Stefanie Sun's album,

609
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:07,536
you begged me to finish
Ouyang Chao's homework for all subjects

610
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,176
for half a semester.

611
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,016
During the winter of 2007,

612
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,016
you begged me to lie to your mother,

613
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:11,976
saying that you...
Stop!

614
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:14,896
Okay. You found out, huh?

615
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:17,976
I never expected you
to have such a good memory.

616
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:20,256
Forget it.

617
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:20,856
I'll go there myself

618
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,616
if you're not joining me.

619
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:22,736
Give me the address.

620
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:23,736
What address?

621
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,136
Stop pretending to be ignorant.

622
00:32:25,136 --> 00:32:25,856
You were the first to know

623
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
when she moved.

624
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,336
Her company address should be the same.

625
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,816
However, her home address

626
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,376
is quite dated.

627
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,696
I don't know if she has moved or not.

628
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,136
I don't care.

629
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:41,296
Just give them to me first.

630
00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:45,856
Oh no.

631
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:46,736
What's wrong?

632
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:48,136
My supervisor will kill me for this.

633
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:49,056
I have to go.

634
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,576
Remember to send the address to me.

635
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:52,456
Got it!

636
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,416
Wait!

637
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:07,776
Sorry about this.

638
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:10,016
Sorry about this.

639
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,416
Ms. Fang, she's here.

640
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:23,976
Have you gotten her a drink?

641
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:26,336
Ms. Huang, here's your coffee.

642
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:26,936
Thank you.

643
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:29,136
How long do I have to wait?

644
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,536
Ms. Fang is in a meeting.

645
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:31,656
I'll call for you when she's done.

646
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:33,056
Ms. Fang,

647
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,056
can you give me one more chance?

648
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,176
My mortgage is over 8,000 yuan.

649
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:40,056
I have to sustain my children too.

650
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:41,776
My beloved wife is sick

651
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:42,976
and can't work.

652
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:44,976
If I lose my job now,

653
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:46,256
my whole family will be done for.

654
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:47,616
Mr. Wang,

655
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:49,936
I understand what you're going through.

656
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,136
But to be honest with you,

657
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:52,776
it's a waste of time

658
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:53,616
for you to remain in this position

659
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,416
with your current capabilities.

660
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,456
This is the company's compensation
for you.

661
00:33:57,896 --> 00:33:58,896
Please take a look.

662
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:00,896
There are two options.

663
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,616
If I were in your shoes,

664
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,176
I would choose the second option.

665
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:06,336
The company

666
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,936
will pay you three months' worth
of compensation fee.

667
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:09,936
You'll get the year-end bonus too.

668
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,456
If you wish to join
another company after this,

669
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:14,056
I can write
a letter of recommendation for you.

670
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,456
This way, we'll reach a deal.

671
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,416
And we'll be able
to part ways peacefully.

672
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:22,296
You do put it in a nice way, huh?

673
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:23,976
You guys are forcing me
to leave the company.

674
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,296
How is this a deal?

675
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,496
Mr. Wang, the ending has been decided.

676
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:29,336
This is the best

677
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:30,856
I can do for you.

678
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,456
The best you can do for me?

679
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:33,736
My foot!

680
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:35,176
You guys are burning the bridge
after crossing it!

681
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:36,936
You can only trust
that I'm helping you out here.

682
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:43,776
Do you think

683
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,456
anyone else in the company

684
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:48,736
cares about you besides me?

685
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,576
Stop pretending.

686
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:52,736
You said this was a deal?

687
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:54,536
What if I say no?

688
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,176
There's another solution for that.

689
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,816
Our company practices
an elimination system.

690
00:34:58,816 --> 00:34:59,896
If you don't reach your KPI,

691
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,216
the company has the right to sack you.

692
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:02,016
If so, you won't

693
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,536
even receive a single cent.

694
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:05,216
I've been working dedicatedly
in the company

695
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,496
for ten years.

696
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,896
Ten years, you know?

697
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:10,536
Is this all I'm worth?

698
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:11,416
That's right.

699
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,856
After our evaluation,

700
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,616
this is how much

701
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:16,976
your ten-year service is worth.

702
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,616
I heard that someone splashed her
with water

703
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:07,896
when she discussed
the termination of his contract.

704
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:09,815
You have no idea.

705
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,415
She put the cup of water there
on purpose.

706
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,616
I heard that it helps
to increase efficiency.

707
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,016
There's nothing much left to say
after the splash.

708
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,096
Maybe she can use that opportunity

709
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,736
to lower the compensation fee too.

710
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:22,616
Ms. Fang

711
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:24,656
is adaptable
and capable of great feats indeed.

712
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,776
It's a shame that she's emotionless.

713
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,936
Look at her cold face.

714
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:33,376
I don't think she has
a happy relationship.

715
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,656
What are you doing?

716
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,416
Sorry about that.

717
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:41,136
Watch where you're going!

718
00:36:41,136 --> 00:36:42,496
I'm truly sorry about that.

719
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:43,816
But I heard

720
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:45,176
that this could boost efficiency, right?

721
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:47,976
Well, good luck, then.

722
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,456
I...

723
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:55,496
Your friend left.

724
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:56,336
She left this behind.

725
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:57,656
Thank you.

726
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,496
Is this even nice?

727
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:25,576
You're too old-fashioned.

728
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:28,256
You had their pineapple pies
for so many years.

729
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,256
Time to have something else
for a change.

730
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,936
And they're only selling this
for a limited amount of time.

731
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:32,456
We won't get to buy them
once the period is over.

732
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,576
I'm loyal.

733
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:34,456
Unlike you.

734
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:35,496
You're fickle-minded.

735
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,176
That's right. You're right.

736
00:37:38,576 --> 00:37:41,776
I can't make a choice when it comes to

737
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,496
Daniel Wu, Jay Chou,

738
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:45,056
Hu Ge, and Eddie Pang.

739
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,216
I think they're helpless about it.

740
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:48,176
They had no idea

741
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:50,176
that they were part of this at all.

742
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:51,016
Eat up.

743
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:52,216
Otherwise, they'll go cold.

744
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:57,856
This is nice.

745
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,456
I think it's better than
the pineapple pie.

746
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:02,936
I think it's so-so.

747
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:05,096
Let me have yours, then.

748
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:08,096
What's wrong?

749
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:08,896
Nothing.

750
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,616
This is so nice.

751
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:10,416
It's super nice.

752
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,296
Eat up.

753
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,536
My teeth are all black.

754
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,376
You look disgusting.

755
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:58,936
Stay away from me.

756
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:03,696
You look disgusting.

757
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,096
Stay away from me.

758
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:29,176
Mister, go after that motorcycle.

759
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:43,856
Mister, catch up to him.

760
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,456
Mister, take the shortcut on the right
and intercept him.

761
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,456
Jiang Yi.

762
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,096
Is that you?

763
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:17,336
Long time no see.

764
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:20,896
Huang Yingzi.
