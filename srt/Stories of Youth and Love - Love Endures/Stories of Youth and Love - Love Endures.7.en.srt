[Episode 7]

3
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,750
(I'm sure you did it on purpose.)

4
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,390
Yes.

5
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,720
I did do it on purpose.

6
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,950
Who told him to be so mean to you?

7
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,360
I couldn't hold it in and insulted him.

8
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,870
Sorry.

9
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry for what?

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,110
I couldn't help you out.

11
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,920
Who said so? You helped me out big time.

12
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,200
But think about it.

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,670
He's hard to deal with.

14
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
How would he accept your interview

15
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,390
if you didn't leave behind
a deep impression?

16
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,280
So, does that mean I need to thank you?

17
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,750
You're welcome.

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,830
Why did you come all of a sudden?

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you worried
that I might go to prison?

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,390
Yeah.

21
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,880
You're a glutton.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,430
I'm afraid the prison
will run out of food.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Stop it!

24
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,390
Sorry about that.

25
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,990
I didn't control my strength.

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,990
But you're something else too.

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
You vanished during the meal.

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,990
I wondered where you went.

29
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,360
In the end, you were
at the police station.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,230
It was an emergency.

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,640
I didn't expect that either.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,880
I couldn't explain it to you in time.

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,320
I was muddle-headed too.

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
Before this, I imagined
all kinds of scenarios

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,950
where we meet.

36
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,040
But I never expected it to be like this.

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,510
Also, I realized

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,390
that he was stranger
than what I imagined.

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,160
If so, do you still wish
to be friends with

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,110
a strange person like him?

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,670
Do you still remember

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
our bet?

43
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,480
What's wrong?

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
What have you done?

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,040
I left this spot blank

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
so that Ding Ye could
sign his name there!

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,430
What have you done?

48
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,270
I...

49
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,320
I signed the book for you
ten years in advance.

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,390
Its value will skyrocket in the future.

51
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,480
Skyrocket my foot!

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,160
Buy me a new copy!

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,950
Do you have such low expectations of me
in the future?

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,950
It's not that
I have low expectations of you.

55
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,990
Pardon me for being blunt.

56
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,110
Unless the number of people
who play your games

57
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,040
is more than the number of people
who read Ding Ye's books,

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,710
if not, it's unlikely

59
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,640
that you'll achieve that goal, sir.

60
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,320
Who said it's unlikely?

61
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
If so, it's unlikely

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,270
that you'll become friends with Ding Ye

63
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,670
in the future.

64
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,360
You!

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,230
What?

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay.

67
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,670
Fine.

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,630
Why don't we make a bet, then?

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,280
What kind of bet?

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,670
Let's see

71
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,400
if I become friends with Ding Ye first

72
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,310
or you become
a famous game designer first.

73
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,360
Fine with me.

74
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,360
I already know

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,870
the reward I want if I win.

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,400
What do you want?

77
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,990
If I win,

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,750
you have to include me in your game.

79
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,800
What's with that reaction?

80
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,550
Anyway, I don't mind.

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,670
You can use my character for free.

82
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,870
Yeah.

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,360
You look like you don't mind.

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,190
But that games will never sell

85
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,720
with you in it.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
What did you say?

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,040
Stop!

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,670
You haven't said what will happen
if you lose the bet.

89
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,070
Me?

90
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,280
How could I, Huang Yingzi,
ever lose a bet?

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,990
My goodness.

92
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,480
I thought

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
you treated it as a joke we cracked
when we were young

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,990
and forgot about it.

95
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,230
As if.

96
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,720
I have a great memory, you know?

97
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,870
That means

98
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,110
the bet is still on, right?

99
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,750
Of course.

100
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,600
Anyway, I've met Ding Ye today.

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm one step closer to being friends

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,990
with him now.

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,280
What about you,

104
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,630
"famous" game designer?

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,550
Listen,

106
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,190
don't be too cocky yet.

107
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,960
No one knows for sure who'll win.

108
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,160
Fine.

109
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,110
Good luck
for the job interview tomorrow.

110
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,520
I owe you a meal today.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,990
I'll treat you to something nice

112
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,280
if you get the job.

113
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,430
Alright.

114
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,310
Deal?

115
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,990
Deal.

116
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,800
Let's go.

117
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,160
(Yifei,)

118
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,520
(Guan Chao's wedding photos
are finally ready to be posted.)

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,360
(The six-man group in Hangtian City
has finally reunited.)

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,230
(We just lack you.)

121
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,430
(By the way,
there's another piece of good news.)

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,750
(Jiang Yi has decided
not to return to the UK.)

123
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,480
(Now, the four of us can play Mahjong
in Jiangzhou.)

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,430
(Now, the TV is playing
"Chinese Paladin" again.)

125
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,670
(I'm reminded of the days
where we watched dramas together.)

126
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,310
(When you're back,)

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,190
(let's pick and watch)

128
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,720
(the longest drama together.)

129
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,400
Zhao Ling'er will appear soon.

130
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,720
Who do you guys think
Li Xiaoyao will fancy?

131
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,600
It must be Lin Yueru.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
They said they would stay together
until old age.

133
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,720
I think Li Xiaoyao and Zhao Ling'er
are a perfect match.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
But Lin Yueru and Li Xiaoyao
are the happiest

135
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,190
when they're together.

136
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,190
And they've been through
so much together.

137
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,550
Zhao Ling'er is the elusive beauty.

138
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,280
Do you even understand
how charming she is?

139
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,400
Enough. Stop fighting.

140
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,400
Lin Yueru is just like Yingzi.

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,520
She's cute and bubbly.

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,990
Zhao Ling'er is just like Mingyu.

143
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,600
She's gentle and smart.

144
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,630
If I were in his shoes,

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,600
I would pick both.

146
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,670
Jiang Yi.

147
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,950
Who would you fancy
if you were Li Xiaoyao?

148
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
How should I know?

149
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,880
That's why we're asking you.

150
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,350
If you were Li Xiaoyao,

151
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,640
would you choose Lin Yueru

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,880
or Zhao Ling'er?

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm not Li Xiaoyao.

154
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,950
Why are you asking me that?

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,070
Let's pretend that you're him.

156
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,430
Why would you choose if you were him?

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I choose Eddie Peng.

158
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,950
Eddie Peng is so handsome.

159
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,710
He's good-looking, and he has abs.

160
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Lin Yueru?

161
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,350
What on earth?

162
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,950
I don't understand
what you girls are thinking.

163
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,760
You made this in one night?

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,430
Every year, plenty of game designers

165
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,670
come to ATG for job interviews.

166
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,880
Only a handful of them

167
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
will give us a surprise.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,040
You're one of them.

169
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,400
Mr. Jiang,

170
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,000
you won many awards overseas.

171
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,000
You also participated in major projects
held by international top companies.

172
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
We have no doubts

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
about your abilities.

174
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,160
But I have a question.

175
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,430
Why did you choose

176
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,070
to develop your career in the country?

177
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,070
It's because I found my initial goal
in the country.

178
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,830
Therefore,

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,470
I decide to come back

180
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,520
and realize it here.

181
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
Can you tell us about it in detail?

182
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,800
Sorry.

183
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,550
This is kind of personal.

184
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,550
Alright, then.

185
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,400
We won't force you to speak

186
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,470
since you're not willing
to share it with us.

187
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,640
I hope you can share your story with us
in the future

188
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,190
if there's a chance.

189
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,120
I have no more questions.

190
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,040
I have a question.

191
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,280
I wish to join ATG.

192
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't have any demands

193
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
when it comes to wage, benefits,

194
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,590
and working hours.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,470
I will definitely complete
the tasks you assign to me

196
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,000
efficiently.

197
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,190
However,

198
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,470
I have one condition.

199
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,070
Please go ahead.

200
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,880
I wish to develop

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
my own game.

202
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,000
About that,

203
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm afraid we require further assessment
before we can proceed.

204
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,470
I won't let it affect my work.

205
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,160
He completed a project
that requires several people

206
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,550
to work on it for one week
in just a single night.

207
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,520
The rare thing is

208
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,190
that not only does he
possess technical skills,

209
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,070
but he's also creative and innovative.

210
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,550
I think it's worth considering.

211
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,000
If so, when do you wish

212
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,800
to start working?

213
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,400
Anytime.

214
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,280
Welcome to ATG.

215
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Thank you.

216
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,240
That must be real.

217
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,000
Ms. Fang.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,950
Are you guys free today?

219
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,190
You guys are chatting away
this early in the morning.

220
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,470
Ms. Fang,

221
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,470
this is yesterday's report.

222
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,240
Please take a look.

223
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,190
There's a typo in the first row.

224
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,160
Ms. Fang,

225
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,430
you have a meeting to attend at two.

226
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,120
Got it.

227
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,830
Ms. Fang,

228
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,430
I assume you still remember me.

229
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,280
You're Yue Tong, right?

230
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,160
That's right.

231
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,640
You interviewed me last month.

232
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
Today's my first day at work.

233
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,240
I came here to say hi.

234
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,400
Congratulations.

235
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,120
I don't know what you like.

236
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,550
I bought some dark chocolate for you.

237
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,430
This brand is nice.

238
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,400
Please try it.

239
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
You're too courteous.

240
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
You don't need to do this.

241
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,520
It's nothing.

242
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,950
It's just a token of my appreciation.

243
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,040
Mingyu.

244
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,430
Ms. Fang,

245
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,040
I need to confirm the name list

246
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,160
of the system engineers.

247
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I won't interrupt you, then.

248
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,310
The agricultural sector
and industrial sector

249
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,920
are vastly different.

250
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,240
Let me give you an example.

251
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,880
You didn't attend the conference.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,470
Ma was furious.

253
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
I knew it.

254
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,190
That's why I came here
to apologize to him.

255
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,070
Have you brought him a gift, then?

256
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,000
What gift?

257
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,310
Is that even required?

258
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,950
You studied too much.

259
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,920
You don't know how to be
a decent person.

260
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,350
I knew you wouldn't
bring a gift with you.

261
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,670
That's why I prepared it for you.

262
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,830
My mother gave me some red ginseng.

263
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,920
You can give them to Ma.

264
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,950
No need for that.

265
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,280
I've never given him any gifts before.

266
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,800
Just listen to me.

267
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,190
Just tell him that you brought them
from your hometown

268
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,160
and apologize to him sincerely.

269
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
The matter will be over, then.

270
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,190
A large batch of self-learning processes

271
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,310
need to be performed
according to the situation.

272
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,520
Jiang Yi.

273
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't you remember me?

274
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,310
We work in the same company...

275
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,350
I know.

276
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,000
You're Chloe.

277
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,000
I thought
you couldn't recognize me just now.

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,120
I was a little bit upset.

279
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,550
I was focused

280
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,590
on the job interview.

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,670
But I have to thank you

282
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,400
for putting in a good word for me.

283
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,550
How do you plan to thank me, then?

284
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,000
Why don't you buy me a meal later?

285
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,310
Sure.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,670
You came back in advance
before we were done

287
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,000
with the work in Hong Kong, China.

288
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,120
Those are the post-work processes.

289
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,670
It's all about entertaining clients.

290
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,760
I'm not good at that anyway.

291
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,670
I don't understand something.

292
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,310
Is that wedding that important?

293
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,240
Just give him a big red packet
when you come back

294
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,950
and it'll be fine, right?

295
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,920
The branch in Shanghai

296
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,350
stole all of the resources I wanted

297
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,040
all because you left early, you know?

298
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,640
Sigh.

299
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,350
My half year's worth of effort

300
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,470
went down the drain just like that.

301
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,950
When did you come to Jiangzhou?

303
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,350
Not long ago.

304
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,920
What about you?

305
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,550
It's been over three years.

306
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,670
I left the company

307
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,880
not long after you did.

308
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,520
At first, I went to Taiwan, China.

309
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,950
After that, I came to Jiangzhou.

310
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,310
I've been working at ATG since then.

311
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,190
It's been seven or eight years
since we met, right?

312
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,550
Thank you.

313
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,950
Try this.

314
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,640
Doesn't it taste familiar?

315
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,760
It tastes just like

316
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,920
the fries

317
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
in Southampton.

318
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Back then, you didn't eat outside.

319
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,470
You worked day in and day out.

320
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,710
You kept telling me to buy
fish and chips for you.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
If so, did I pay you back then?

322
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,710
Of course you did.

323
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,880
You even agreed to play games with me.

324
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,760
Play games with you?

325
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,120
I remember that it was Hideo Kojima's...

326
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,310
Metal Gear Solid.

327
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,280
You still remember that?

328
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,160
Of course.

329
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,470
Do you still remember our secret code?

330
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,760
Era is a monster.

331
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,590
We have to keep fighting it.

332
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,400
Although I'm a game developer,

333
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,160
I sucked at video games.

334
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Back then, you were the only one
who were willing to play with me.

335
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
Back then,

336
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,640
I already knew you were a gaming genius.

337
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,240
I've heard about

338
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,190
what happened between you and Sky City.

339
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,800
I know

340
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,670
it's very unfair to you,

341
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,830
but

342
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,950
we should drop the past.

343
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,520
Now that you've joined ATG,

344
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,190
I'm sure you can do even better.

345
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,550
Is that so?

346
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,710
I'm quite curious about something.

347
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
What kind of project is good enough

348
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,670
for you to give up
a better wage and benefits

349
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,470
just because you want to do it?

350
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,160
A sandbox game.

351
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,040
With what type of world view?

352
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,760
I don't think I can reveal that yet.

353
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,670
Let me ask you another question, then.

354
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,350
Do you have a girlfriend?

355
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,110
Hello?

356
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,630
Jiang Yi, how did the job interview go?

357
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,280
Did it go well?

358
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,800
I guess so.

359
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,390
What's the matter?

360
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,830
Great.

361
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,590
Let's hold a celebration tomorrow.

362
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,280
I'll tell Zhuang Yuan

363
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,520
and Mingyu

364
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,830
to join us at my house.

365
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,960
Hey, you don't need to...

366
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,720
It's decided, then.

367
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,350
See you tomorrow night.

368
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll see you there.

369
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Seems like I got my answer.

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
I was teasing you.

371
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm looking forward
to seeing you at work on Monday.

372
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,590
I'm not surprised

373
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,350
as to why Ding Ye smashed the car.

374
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,870
Those who read his novels

375
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,630
know

376
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,070
that he'll persist and fight
until the end.

377
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't see any result
from his persistence.

378
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,310
I beg to differ.

379
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,590
Maybe he was polishing his skills

380
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,870
for the past two decades.

381
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,440
And when people are about to forget him,

382
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
suddenly, poof,

383
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,150
he comes up

384
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,070
with a magnificent masterpiece.

385
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,590
But he rejected your interview.

386
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,960
He didn't reject my interview.

387
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,389
He just hasn't agreed to it yet.

388
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,550
I believe
that he'll definitely agree to it.

389
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
Even if he agrees to your interview,

390
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,630
it cannot resolve the issue.

391
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,200
What does that mean?

392
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,870
The producer told me to tell you

393
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,440
that not only do you need to complete
the interview,

394
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,760
but you also need to get Grade A for it
before we'll extend your contract.

395
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,240
I knew it.

396
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,910
Good luck.

397
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,720
Ding Ye.

398
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,630
Why are you here again?

399
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,000
You wrote that you went to the bookstore

400
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,870
in the police station.

401
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,110
I took a peak.

402
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,830
I won't accept any of your interviews.

403
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,870
Stop wasting your energy.

404
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,200
Why do you refuse
to accept my interview?

405
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,680
Why should I accept your interview?

406
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
Also, why exactly are you trying
to interview me?

407
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,390
I wish to know what you've been doing
for the past decade or so.

408
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,680
Do you still write novels?

409
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,590
I'm doing everything

410
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,440
except for writing novels.

411
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
I already gave up on literature.

412
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,440
I already burned all the books.

413
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,590
I only watch dramas now.

414
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,520
You're lying.

415
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,590
That's the line of Wang Hu,

416
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,910
the male lead of your second novel,

417
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,910
"The Maze".

418
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,960
So, you did read my novels, huh?

419
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,110
I did more than that.

420
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,240
I've read all three of your novels

421
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,350
plenty of times.

422
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,070
I even read the novels
you mentioned

423
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,960
within your novels.

424
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,240
Except for one.

425
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,910
"Ventriloquy" by Qiu Hui.

426
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,630
I couldn't find it.

427
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,800
It's because that book doesn't exist.

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
It's something I made up.

429
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,520
What?

430
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,000
You actually made it up?

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,800
You had no idea

432
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,150
how many libraries I visited

433
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,760
just to find that book.

434
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,110
I'm truly your fan.

435
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,520
I have plenty of fans.

436
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,800
Why should I accept your interview?

437
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,310
I wish to clarify the truth for you.

438
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,000
That's unnecessary.

439
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,070
If so, people might misunderstand you
for the rest of your life.

440
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,910
Being misunderstood is
the destiny of those who express.

441
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,910
Besides, how can I know
if this interview isn't the start

442
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,280
of a true misunderstanding?

443
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,350
If you don't clarify yourself,

444
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,550
the crooks might be at large
for the rest of their lives.

445
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,070
Do you think they'll receive punishment

446
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,480
just because you smashed the car?

447
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,310
No.

448
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,680
They'll only repair the car
using your money

449
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,550
and continue to twist the truth

450
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,630
and hurt other people.

451
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,310
If so, how can you be so sure

452
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,390
that I'm not a crook?

453
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,800
I told you before.

454
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,040
I read your novels.

455
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,630
An idealist

456
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,440
will never do things

457
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,870
that disgust them.

458
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,110
Usually, idealists

459
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,000
never have happy endings.

460
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,590
Don't think that you can understand
the current me

461
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,800
just because you read
the novels I wrote.

462
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,040
I might not

463
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,350
understand you completely,

464
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,310
but I trust my instinct.

465
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,200
This book is called "The Book Thief".

466
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,720
Steal this book.

467
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,280
Must I steal it?

468
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,680
Can't I buy it?

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,390
You have to steal it.

470
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,040
I'll accept your interview

471
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,590
if you dare steal it.

472
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,480
If not, just forget it.

473
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,270
You're something else.

474
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,070
But I'll show you what I'm capable of.

475
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,310
I never expected you to become
a book thief for real.

476
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,550
Will you accept my interview now?

477
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,630
Hold this.

478
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,550
Hold it higher.

479
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,240
Do a pose.

480
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,590
Smile.

481
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,150
Okay.

482
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,040
All done.

483
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,800
Why did you take a photo of me?

484
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,240
To prove that you stole something.

485
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,110
Don't do that!

486
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,280
You told me to steal the book.

487
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,680
This book is pretty good.

488
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,350
Finish it.

489
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,720
Hold it.

490
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,350
Excuse me, I want to buy this book.

491
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,310
Okay. No problem.

492
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,240
I'll get you the bill.

493
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you.

494
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
Some opportunities might not
come again

495
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,590
if you miss out on them.

496
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,480
If you don't intend to devote yourself
to your research and study,

497
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,630
you should give up now.

498
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,390
Go back and think about it.

499
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,960
Are you okay?

500
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm fine.

501
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,630
Good luck.

502
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,870
How was the wedding?

503
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,720
How do I put it?

504
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,000
It was okay, I guess.

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
Did I tell you to sit?

506
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,760
Sir, I'm sorry.

507
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,590
You shouldn't say sorry to me.

508
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,630
You should say sorry to yourself.

509
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,870
Zhuang Yuan,

510
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,070
the best thing about you

511
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,390
is that you haven't picked up
on those bad habits

512
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,200
that you think can bring you
to the shortcut of success.

513
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,240
However, you should know this too.

514
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,800
You may choose to give up
on certain opportunities

515
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,040
because of a wedding,

516
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,390
but do you know

517
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,520
how many people behind you

518
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,720
have their eyes on those opportunities?

519
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,280
I hope you can go back and reconsider

520
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,590
the new topic I gave you.

521
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,480
Graduating is your current priority.

522
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,550
Mingyu!

523
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,590
Are you okay?

524
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,440
Are you hurt?

525
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,070
I'm fine.

526
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,110
What's wrong with you today?

527
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,440
It's obvious
that you're not at your best.

528
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,310
I didn't sleep well
for the past two days.

529
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,630
Are you sure it's because of that?

530
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,440
I know.

531
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,070
You and your friends

532
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,760
grew up together in your hometown.

533
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
You guys have been very close
since young.

534
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,000
I understand.

535
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,550
But now,

536
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,070
everyone is leading their own lives.

537
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,040
Since you guys are already separated,

538
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,830
there's no need
to reunite everyone forcefully.

539
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,800
I know that.

540
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,760
But one of them is getting married.

541
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,550
I have no reason to skip the wedding.

542
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,000
Here's what I'm trying to say.

543
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,800
We should have a common goal.

544
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,630
We shouldn't dwell
on past relationships.

545
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,040
That'll only distract you.

546
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,390
It's not that serious.

547
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,110
Don't you have old friends too?

548
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,550
Of course I do.

549
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,960
But those old friends of mine

550
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,440
won't waste my social time.

551
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
So, according to you,

552
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,390
your social time is related
to your interest too, huh?

553
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,070
I'm concerned whether or not

554
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,350
I can improve myself
from all the socializing I do.

555
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,240
I can't just stop and look back
all the time, right?

556
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,040
Have you ever considered

557
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,520
why the windshield of a car

558
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,480
is huge

559
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,910
while its rear-view mirrors are small?

560
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,590
It's because you can only
see the path ahead.

561
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,070
Is anyone sitting here?

562
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,550
Nope.

563
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,630
May I sit here, then?

564
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,040
Is this all you're having for lunch?

565
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,040
It's quick.

566
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,910
But it's not good for your health

567
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,480
in the long run.

568
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,830
Why don't I pack a meal for you

569
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,480
from the canteen next time?

570
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,240
No need for that.

571
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
I haven't thanked you

572
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,870
for the chocolate yet.

573
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,630
Don't mention it.

574
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,480
So, what kind of food do you like?

575
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Do you like them spicy or savory?

576
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,630
Do you avoid anything in particular?

577
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,720
Yue Tong,

578
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,720
I didn't hire you

579
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,390
so that you could waste your time
on these things.

580
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,070
Whether or not you can remain
in the company

581
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,760
after three months,
that depends on your performance.

582
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,040
Your performance

583
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,200
is more important
than currying favor with me.

584
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,310
Ms. Fang, that's not what I mean.

585
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,440
Actually, before I attended
this job interview,

586
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,630
I was rejected by three companies.

587
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm older than the fresh undergraduates.

588
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,870
And I didn't graduate from
a famous college.

589
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,800
No one wanted to hire me.

590
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,550
After that, you told me

591
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,110
that I was passionate, steadfast,

592
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,390
and resistant to stress.

593
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,910
Only then did I feel that

594
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,720
I wasn't as useless as I thought.

595
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,800
Therefore, I truly wanted to thank you.

596
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,680
I'll stop bothering you now.

597
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,240
Yue Tong,

598
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,720
let's have lunch
in the canteen next time

599
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,240
when I'm free.

600
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,110
(Let's gather at my house tonight.)

601
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
(Jiang Yi got a new job.
Let's hold a celebration.)

602
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,350
I would've thought

603
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,280
that you inherited
Madam Guo's cooking skills

604
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,760
if I didn't know that you ordered these.

605
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,520
The food you ordered is pretty good.

606
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
You have my favorite liangpi.

607
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,150
You also ordered Mingyu's favorite,
fried eggs with chives.

608
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,550
When can we start?

609
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm starving.

610
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,630
Don't be impatient.

611
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,070
Mingyu will be here soon.

612
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
I guess I have to wait.

613
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,830
I think Mingyu is here.

614
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,000
What's wrong?

615
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,550
Mingyu said in the group chat
that she couldn't make it.

616
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,310
She's busy.

617
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,200
That's fine.

618
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
Jiang is the star of the day.

619
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,070
We can celebrate the occasion for him.

620
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,960
Am I right, Jiang?

621
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

622
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,630
Since Mingyu isn't coming,

623
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,680
let's dig in.

624
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,350
Let's eat.

625
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,150
Come.

626
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,910
Eat up.

627
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,800
Delicious.

628
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,280
Jiang,

629
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,310
I heard that ATG

630
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,440
is the best gaming company
in the country.

631
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,550
They won't employ ordinary people.

632
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,520
He's no ordinary person.

633
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,440
I always thought
that he would get the job.

634
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,280
How would you know?

635
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,590
It's because I have faith in you.

636
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,830
You weren't like this in the past.

637
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,550
Since when were you this mushy?

638
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,070
I'm serious.

639
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,070
Fine.

640
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's have a toast.

641
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,240
Come.

642
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,480
Let's celebrate
that Jiang Yi got a new job.

643
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,720
Let's celebrate
the start of his new phase in life.

644
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,150
Come.

645
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,040
Cheers.

646
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,200
What's wrong?

647
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,520
Don't tell me the power is out?

648
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,310
Hurry! We're running late!

649
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,240
Mingyu, hurry!

650
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,830
We have plenty of time.

651
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,150
Kick him!

652
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,040
One more kick.

653
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,630
Enough.

654
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,110
There's one hour left.

655
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,150
Please let us use the TV now.

656
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,550
What gives?

657
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,800
Today's the final episode
of "Chinese Paladin".

658
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,520
What has that got to do with us?

659
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,310
Precisely.

660
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,120
Why don't we watch it
at the wonton shop?

661
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,040
No.

662
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,110
This time,
we cannot compromise with them.

663
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,630
We must watch the final episode

664
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,910
on a big screen.

665
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,800
Leave it to me.

666
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,870
One more round.

667
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,800
Must you guys play video games today?

668
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,830
Must you guys watch drama today?

669
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,070
Of course!

670
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,040
You guys have no idea

671
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,000
how long we waited

672
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
for the final episode to air.

673
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,280
Buddy, I'll be honest with you.

674
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,310
No matter if you watch it or not,

675
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,280
the ending will stay the same.

676
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,550
Even so, I have to watch it.

677
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,310
I want to know

678
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,000
who Li Xiaoyao dated in the end.

679
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,960
Lin Yueru

680
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,480
is already dead.

681
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
There's no need to watch it anymore.

682
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,590
Get out of the way!

683
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,000
I dare you to say that again.

684
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Get out of the way!

685
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,830
I won't.

686
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
I'll chase you out if you keep this up.

687
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,070
If so, I'll unplug your console!

688
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,070
Go ahead!

689
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,720
Try it if you dare!

690
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Don't!

691
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,630
Try it if you dare!

692
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,590
I'll do it!

693
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,110
Try it if you dare!

694
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,590
What's going on?

695
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,960
I haven't unplugged it yet.

696
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,870
The lights are out?

697
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,310
I guess the power is out.

698
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,040
Fine.

699
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,310
I guess you won't get
to watch the final episode either.

700
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,200
My goodness.

701
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,310
Don't tell me

702
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,830
I'm destined to miss out
on the final episode?

703
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,480
How long do we have left?

704
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,040
50 minutes.

705
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,240
50 minutes?

706
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,310
Got it!

707
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,390
Power is out throughout Hangtian City.

708
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,040
Yingzi, where are you taking us?

709
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,440
I know a place.

710
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,550
We can make it in time
if we depart now.

711
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,760
Are you hopping on or not?

712
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,390
You're heavy.

713
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:58,960
No one else will fetch you

714
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
if you don't hop on.

715
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,150
You think I want to hitch your ride?

716
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll travel with Jiang Yi, then.

717
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,830
I'll travel with Zhuang Yuan.

718
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,640
Over here!

719
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,200
My shop is already closed.

720
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Mister,

721
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,430
can we borrow your TV for a second?

722
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,390
Yeah, mister.

723
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:23,950
Please do us a favor.

724
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,800
We traveled far

725
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,720
just to get here.

726
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,200
How long will you guys take?

727
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,160
We'll leave once the show is over.

728
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,910
Alright.

729
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,390
But there are six of you here.

730
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,950
You guys have to
at least order some food.

731
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,510
What about this?

732
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,430
We'll order 12 bowls of noodles

733
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,870
for the six of us.

734
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,430
Alright.

735
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,350
Twelve bowls of noodles?

736
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,470
We can't finish them.

737
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm so full.

738
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,200
Who told you to order that many bowls?

739
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,240
You can have mine too.

740
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,800
How could that happen?

741
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,600
That doesn't make sense.

742
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,950
It should've ended

743
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,760
while they were
in the middle of the lake.

744
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,160
It broke my heart.

745
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,470
I thought Lin Yueru could be reborn.

746
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,080
In the end,

747
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,680
she still couldn't be together
with Li Xiaoyao.

748
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,760
No choice.

749
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,030
In the end,
Li Xiaoyao still fancied Zhao Ling'er.

750
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,310
Just stop if you can't finish them.

751
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,640
That's the last episode, right?

752
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,030
Yeah.

753
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,390
Alright now.

754
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,200
Now that the final episode is over,

755
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,030
does that mean the TV

756
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,680
belong to us now?

757
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,160
Fine, have it your way.

758
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll never go there again anyway.

759
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,200
But why?

760
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,760
The NCEE is nearing.

761
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,990
I need to do my homework at home.

762
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,200
Are you addicted
to doing homework lately?

763
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,350
That's none of your business.

764
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,640
Fine.

765
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,910
Remember to lend them to me
once you're done.

766
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,720
You can borrow them
from Zhuang Yuan and Mingyu.

767
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,800
They do their homework perfectly.

768
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,470
I'm sure our teacher will figure it out
at first glance.

769
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Besides...

770
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,240
Where are you going?

771
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,120
To his bike.

772
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,870
We're staying in the same building.

773
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,350
Don't tell me you want Zhuang Yuan
to send you home just for fun?

774
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,430
No thanks.

775
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,950
I'll take your bike, then.

776
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,830
We'll make a move first.

777
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,800
Wait for us.

778
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,160
Hurry. They're leaving already.

779
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,950
Hurry up.

780
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,350
Back then,

781
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,280
it felt like the six of us

782
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,950
could accomplish

783
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
the impossible.

784
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,830
Maybe it's because

785
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,350
we were young and ignorant back then.

786
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,350
That's why we were fearless.

787
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,830
If only the six of us

788
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,310
could remain ignorant and fearless
for the rest of our lives.

789
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,830
Come, let's drink.

790
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,830
Have you rented a unit?

791
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,830
Yeah.

792
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,640
Where is it?

793
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,950
It's a little far from here.

794
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,030
I'll wait for your housewarming party.

795
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,160
Sure.

796
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,120
Let me tidy the house first.

797
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,800
It's a little messy right now.

798
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,830
Come, let's drink.

799
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,350
Come.

800
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,030
Cheers.

801
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,030
It would've been better
if Mingyu were here.

802
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,720
You guys can finish the wontons.

803
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,120
I'll leave this arduous task

804
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,030
to Jiang.

805
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,720
You two, eat up.

806
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,160
It's been so long
since I enjoyed myself.

807
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,600
Yeah.

808
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,870
You do look pretty happy too.

809
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,240
You can't even walk straight now.

810
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,720
Why don't we get a drink?

811
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,310
Sure.

812
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,600
A coin vending machine?

813
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,870
Look at the era we're in.

814
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,640
What's with
the old-fashioned vending machine?

815
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,870
Some people
do enjoy nostalgia, you know?

816
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,430
Do you have any coins?

817
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,200
Let me check.

818
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,120
I do have some.

819
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,310
Wait.

820
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,560
You kept Mingyu's photo until now?

821
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,600
I guess you're that person
who enjoys nostalgia, huh?

822
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,390
Stop talking about me.

823
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,240
Speak for yourself.

824
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,910
Do you still keep the meal card photo?

825
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,720
I threw it away long ago.

826
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,510
Wait.

827
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,600
I don't believe you at all.

828
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,430
What is this?

829
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,030
Fine.

830
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,310
I had the feeling that you haven't
forgotten about Huang Yingzi yet.

831
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,800
Is it still possible between you two?

832
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,990
We missed out on each other long ago.

833
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,510
Why do I feel like this isn't
the end of your story with her?

834
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,390
Forget about it.

835
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,280
If you have the time
to think about my story,

836
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,030
why don't you think about
your own story?

837
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
I no longer dwell on that.

838
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
To me,

839
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,120
being friends with her
is more than enough.

840
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,600
(What's wrong?)

841
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,470
You forgot to bring
your meal card again?

842
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,030
You can use mine.

843
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,870
When will you change

844
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,600
this bad habit of yours?

845
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,680
Thanks.

846
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,030
This is?

847
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,120
I got it after winning a bet
I made with her for the monthly exam.

848
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,280
You better keep it a secret.
