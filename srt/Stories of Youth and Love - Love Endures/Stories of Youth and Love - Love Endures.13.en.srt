00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,530
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,550
Ding?

4
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,160
Ding doesn't look like someone
who would serve others.

5
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,240
I can tell

6
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
he always puts his feet up at home.

7
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,350
He came here

8
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,960
because he wanted to learn
how to cook the Sichuan cold-dish fish.

9
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,390
Do you know why he wanted to learn this?

10
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,440
You ask me why?

11
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
How am I supposed to know that?

12
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,830
He doesn't give a fig about anything,

13
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,280
but he insists on learning this.

14
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,800
What is his reason?

15
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,600
His reason?

16
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,710
You are persistent

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,390
in finding out

18
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,280
what is on his mind.

19
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,390
He lost this job because of me.

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,670
I want to make it up for him.

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,070
Chef.

22
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,560
Do you think

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,150
he learns this dish

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
because of someone?

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,750
You remind me

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,070
of something.

27
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,600
He mentioned someone

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
who liked to eat this fish.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,030
I can barely remember that.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,000
All right.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,070
Thank you, chef.

32
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm leaving.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,390
Chef.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Is the manager here today?

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,390
Manager?

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,480
He is in the hall.

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,680
Thank you, chef.

38
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,280
Young lady.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,120
Just so you know,

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,230
maybe you should stop
speaking the Sichuan dialect.

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:41,920
Sure.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,510
We are responsible for his incident.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
He lost his job

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,710
because we distracted him.

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,840
I really feel bad for him.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,000
So I came here to ask

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
if you could have him back.

48
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,790
Please don't put me on the spot.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
I have said everything I had to say

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,840
last time.

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,790
If I ask him back,

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
how will I manage other staff?

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,950
Right?

54
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,510
Yes.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,640
I have something else to attend to.

57
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,120
Please excuse me.

58
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,070
I remember

59
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,480
when I worked on
the Map to Jiangzhou Delicacy,

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
this restaurant left me
with a deep impression.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,790
This location may not be strategic

62
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,759
nor does it rely on trendy decorations
to attract attention,

63
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,399
but the taste is exceptional

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,870
and the service is commendable.

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,760
I thought the manager of this restaurant

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,520
is very capable.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,560
I knew it.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,280
This restaurant is
doing a roaring trade now.

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm truly glad.

70
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,280
Did you write
the Map to Jiangzhou Delicacy?

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
You mentioned the interview with Ding Ye

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,190
is getting on well.

73
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,400
How come there has been no result
even now?

74
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,190
Well, Ding Ye

75
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,800
is a bit hard to approach.

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
Many have tried to interview him before,

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,310
but all failed.

78
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,000
So

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,430
Yingzi is not entirely to blame.

80
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,870
You gave up because you couldn't
show us any results.

81
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,870
I have been waiting for a long time,
you know?

82
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,240
We are not your fangirling companion.

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm sorry, Ms. He.

84
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,750
This is
your contract renewal application.

85
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,400
Take it back.

86
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,240
We don't need unproductive staff.

87
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,280
Ms. He, you might misunderstand her.

88
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,710
Huang Yingzi isn't
an unproductive staff.

89
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,000
The "Matchmaker Agency" proposal

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
received excellent internal feedback.

91
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,910
This is mainly because

92
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,470
of the thorough preparation
in researching

93
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,360
and collecting data,

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,280
which Huang Yingzi did.

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Sorry, Ms. He.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
I didn't report this to you

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,680
that I personally asked for help
from Yingzi.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
You are the project team leader.

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,470
You are entitled to decide
on your members.

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,710
Yingzi.

101
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you interested

102
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,590
in joining our topic selection team?

103
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,910
The material for "Matchmaker Agency"
is enough.

104
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,710
Next,

105
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,360
we have to approach
those blind date candidates.

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,470
I'm a mother.

107
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
So I need to count on

108
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,150
you young people.

109
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,560
Sure, I'm in.

110
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,680
(Ding Ye.)

111
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,310
(I'm sorry for what happened that day.)

112
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,680
(I went to that restaurant yesterday.)

113
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,359
(I persuaded the manager)

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,310
(to let you)

115
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,280
(stay on.)

116
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,510
(If you see this message,)

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
(please reply.)

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,270
Ding Ye?

119
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,920
I haven't seen him for several days.

120
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,600
He used to come here every day.

121
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Thank you.

122
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,920
I haven't seen Ding Ye

123
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,630
these days.

124
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,800
He probably feels defeated.

125
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,750
General.

126
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,750
Ma'am.

127
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,720
Have you seen the guy

128
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,070
who read the poem here last time?

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,240
No.

130
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,310
Why? Are you going
to do something else today?

131
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,480
Reading another poem?

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,750
No, we are not doing that again.

133
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,270
Oh, good.

134
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,160
We are not doing that this time.

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Hello?

136
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,070
(Miss.)

137
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,800
(I have news about the man)

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,630
(on the missing person notice.)

139
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,830
I'm going over right now.

140
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,430
I didn't see him in person.

141
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,190
But my customers said they saw him

142
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,430
delivering takeout around here.

143
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,160
His rented house is also nearby.

144
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Rented house?

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,830
Can you give me the address?

146
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,560
Sure, I will write it for you.

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
Thank you.

148
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,870
Jiang Yi, I have news about Lan Bin.

149
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,830
He rented this house
for nearly three years.

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
But he suddenly moved out
three days ago.

151
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,430
He may look scruffy,

152
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,600
but he is reliable.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,600
He pays the rent,

154
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,510
even though he is always late.

155
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,310
Do you know where he moved to?

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,870
He didn't say anything.

157
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,560
I don't even know his phone number.

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,750
He pays the rental in cash every time.

159
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
I can't believe he is still doing this

160
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,600
even in this modern age,

161
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,920
as if he lives in a world
from a decade ago.

162
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,920
Are you cops?

163
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,830
Is he involved in any illegal cases?

164
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,310
No, it's not that.

165
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,430
We are his friends.

166
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,750
Did he leave all of these?

167
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,920
Search me.

168
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
They are not mine.

169
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,430
Well.

170
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,160
May I confirm with you again?

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,040
Is he this man?

172
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,560
There is no need to confirm. It is him.

173
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
These are Yifei's favorite chips.

174
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,920
Zhuang Yuan.

175
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
Bayberry is running out.

176
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,950
Tell your mom to restock.

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,560
All right.

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,040
Why are you buying so many?

179
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,160
Chips for Yifei.

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,430
Chocolate of Mingyu.

181
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,720
Sachima for Zhuang Yuan.

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Cookies for Guan.

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
And sofa cracker for yourself.

184
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,680
Where is mine?

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,510
I don't know what you like.

186
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,240
Zhuang Yuan, tell him.

187
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,720
Your favorite is...

188
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
What is your favorite?

189
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,560
Fine. Just stop talking.

190
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,310
Our friendship

191
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,390
is so disappointing.

192
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,560
I thought we were friends.

193
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,270
I remember each of your preferences.

194
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,360
But none of you remembers mine.

195
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,120
Who put this here?

196
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,270
Who said

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,950
that she found our friendship

198
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,480
so disappointing?

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,310
She thought we were friends.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Well, Yi.

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,510
I will pay for the snacks.

202
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,510
I have a question.

203
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,680
Ask away.

204
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,560
Why did you swap seats with Ren Kaiji?

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

206
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,800
I asked you first.

207
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,160
I just want to sit closer
to the blackboard.

208
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,680
I have bad eyesight.

209
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,310
Is that true?

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,510
Yeah.

211
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,510
I almost got myself glasses.

212
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,950
No other reason?

213
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
What else could it be?

214
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
It is your turn.

215
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,830
Me? I have to focus on studying

216
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,870
for the national college entrance exam.

217
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,600
Yours sounds less convincing than mine.

218
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you want this?

219
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,360
My hands are full.

220
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,960
Why?

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,270
Bye.

222
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,440
We get here so fast.

223
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
What fast.

224
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,390
You walked me all the way here.

225
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,390
Is that Ms. Wan Fang?

226
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,270
I think so.

227
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't touch me here.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
Who is the guy next to her?

229
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I don't want people to see us.

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,510
Isn't he the deputy director
of the second factory?

231
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,480
My dad knows him

232
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,670
and brought me to his house before.

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,480
Is he married?

234
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,510
Yes, he is.

235
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,720
His wife is quite fierce.

236
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,080
She once scolded him in front of us.

237
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,720
So it is true.

238
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,600
What to do now?

239
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,670
What do you mean?

240
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,030
Should we tell Yifei?

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,150
Why can I tell her

242
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,200
when even you know nothing about this?

243
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,630
It is

244
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,390
still early now.

245
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
Oh, dear.

246
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,630
Stop eating.

247
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,120
Mom.

248
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,960
What brings you here?

249
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,910
Hello, Mrs. Lan.

250
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,720
Hi, Yingzi.

251
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,630
I got off work early today.

252
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,320
So I came to see you.

253
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,270
Mrs. Lan.

254
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,320
Yifei practices very hard.

255
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,270
She never lets up.

256
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,000
I know.

257
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,670
Yifei, show me the dance

258
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,480
you did it just now.

259
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,550
Okay.

260
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,910
Mom.

261
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,200
What is wrong?

262
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm fine.

263
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm just excited.

264
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,630
My daughter dances so wonderfully.

265
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm sure

266
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,390
you will be selected
for The National Ballet of China.

267
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,910
Mom.

268
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
You used

269
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,270
to only tell me

270
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,150
about what I danced wrongly

271
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,240
before.

272
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
You...

273
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,120
Why did you praise me today instead?

274
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,080
Because I have high hopes for you.

275
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,360
But I always thought you were
way better than me

276
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,600
and your dad.

277
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,510
I don't want you

278
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,200
to end up poorly like us.

279
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,840
What is this?

280
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,790
Open it.

281
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,150
Pointe shoe.

282
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,510
Do you like them?

283
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,510
Yifei, keep on dancing.

284
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,030
Don't give up.

285
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,960
No matter what your life will be,

286
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,200
dance will always bring you hope.

287
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Mom.

288
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,750
I didn't say I would give this up.

289
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,510
Yeah.

290
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Continue with your practice.

291
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,150
I will go home and prepare dinner.

292
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,390
Yingzi.

293
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,600
Please take care of Yifei for me.

294
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm leaving.

295
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,840
Mom.

296
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,270
You are coming here tomorrow. Will you?

297
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,150
I learned a new dance.

298
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,080
I want to show you.

299
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,720
Sure.

300
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,550
Grandma, we are back.

301
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Grandma.

302
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,240
Yifei.

303
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,240
Maybe your mom will
come back a few days later.

304
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,080
Earlier on, she promised

305
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,960
to watch you dance.

306
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
Probably

307
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,000
she will call you tonight.

308
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
She won't come back once she leaves.

309
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,550
Actually, I don't dare
to tell you something.

310
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,510
I saw your mom with someone
the other day.

311
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,750
I know.

312
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,200
You do?

313
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,910
Yingzi.

314
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,840
What have I done wrong?

315
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,440
Why does everyone leave me?

316
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,960
Yifei, don't be afraid.

317
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,750
I won't leave you.

318
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,670
I will never leave you.

319
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,790
Don't cry.

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,119
No, I won't.

321
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,149
There, there. Yifei.

322
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,200
It is all right.

323
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,000
What is with you?

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,030
Your dad stole money.

325
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,270
Your mom stole my husband.

326
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,829
All of you are nasty!

327
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:34,549
You can't beat her.

328
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,720
Your mom stole my husband.

329
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
What are you doing?

330
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,960
Tell me! Where is your mom?

331
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,240
I don't know.

332
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,829
Why are you taking

333
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,439
what her parents did

334
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,510
on her?

335
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
If not her,
should I come to you instead?

336
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,750
You are assaulting her.

337
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,109
I will call the police

338
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,159
to get you arrested.

339
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,640
No.

340
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,590
What are you doing?

341
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,240
Let go.

342
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,030
Move!

343
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,790
Call the police right now.

344
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,960
I will wait for them

345
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,590
to locate that hussy for me.

346
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm telling you.

347
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,510
She better hide herself well.

348
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,510
Got it?

349
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,000
Let's go.

350
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,400
Are you leaving after beating her?

351
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,350
Do you want to get beaten too?

352
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,750
Are you all right, Yifei?

353
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,510
Don't be afraid.

354
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,030
Don't be afraid.

355
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,830
Our efforts won't be in vain.

356
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,830
We will find Lan Bin.

357
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,160
The thing is, have you ever thought

358
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,550
that Yifei wouldn't want to see him

359
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
even if we found him?

360
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,000
You are acting very strange.

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
You seem not to want me to find Lan Bin.

362
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,510
No, I didn't mean that.

363
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,000
What I mean is

364
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,590
maybe Yifei still holds grudges
against him.

365
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,440
Besides, he has started

366
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
his own life now.

367
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
He might not want us to disturb him.

368
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Just say it.

369
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,200
You want to give up on the search,
right?

370
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,200
I just hope
you can consider this deeply.

371
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,720
What is there to consider?

372
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
Yifei has been looking for him
for many years.

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,750
Finding Lan Bin is her only wish.

374
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,790
Now we are in the same city as Lan Bin.

375
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,270
Shouldn't I find him?

376
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,550
It is fine

377
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,350
if you don't want to continue this,

378
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,550
I will look for him myself.

379
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,200
(Maybe Yifei still holds grudges
against him.)

380
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,000
(Besides, he has started)

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,440
(his own life now.)

382
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,110
(He might not want us to disturb him.)

383
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,830
(Yingzi.)

384
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,310
(How have you been lately?)

385
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,200
(Jiang Yi, Mingyu, Zhuang Yuan, and you)

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,880
(are in the same city.)

387
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,070
(I suppose you meet up often, right?)

388
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,480
(I envy you all so much.)

389
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,070
(I'm rehearsing and performing here
every day.)

390
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,680
(My life is fulfilling.)

391
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,680
(The people here are kind,)

392
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,960
(though I have trouble
speaking with them,)

393
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,160
(which sometimes bores me.)

394
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,830
(If I had known this,)

395
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,000
(I should have spent more time)

396
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
(on learning English)

397
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,640
(when I was in school.)

398
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
(Yingzi.)

399
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,310
(I know you well.)

400
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,640
(You must be trying to find my dad.)

401
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,400
(I'm truly grateful to you.)

402
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,680
(However,)

403
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,590
(if my dad still wants to see me,)

404
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,310
(he will look for me by all means.)

405
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,070
(But now he doesn't contact me.)

406
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,000
(Perhaps)

407
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,960
(he has his own reason.)

408
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,400
(Yingzi.)

409
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,750
(I believe you understand what I mean.)

410
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,590
(Obsessions)

411
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
(fade over time.)

412
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,310
(It is not because
it has become less important,)

413
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,590
(but we have known better.)

414
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,030
(I miss you.)

415
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,550
(I miss everyone.)

416
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,830
(Looking forward to the day
we meet again.)

417
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,110
Yifei.

418
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,510
I miss you too.

419
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,440
(What is truth)

420
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
(and what is falsehood?)

421
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,550
(Maybe truths exist)

422
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,720
(only when you believe in them.)

423
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,240
(I once quoted a famous saying)

424
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,720
(in my article.)

425
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,960
(Shakespeare said,)

426
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,830
("The biggest quality of a leader is)

427
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
(they don't want to be a leader.")

428
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,240
(In fact, I created this.)

429
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,750
(I have no idea)

430
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,110
(if Shakespeare said this before.)

431
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,000
(Having that said,
I came across at least three articles)

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,640
(that cite this quote.)

433
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,830
(So, can I assume)

434
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,070
(that authors who wrote those articles
actually believe)

435
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,440
(Shakespeare said that?)

436
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,510
Going out for lunch?

437
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,790
Staying here makes me revolt.

438
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,000
I want to get some fresh air outside.

439
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,680
Let's stop here.

440
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,790
I'm a bit off today.

441
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,240
Wait, let's play a while more.

442
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,960
No, I'm not playing.

443
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,880
I will play with you.

444
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,310
Zhuang Yuan, what are you doing here?

445
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,680
Come.

446
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,270
Again.

447
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,310
Yue Tong.

448
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,680
Yue Tong.

449
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,550
What is wrong with you?

450
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,310
I'm pregnant.

451
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,510
You know that very well, Ms. Fang.

452
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,000
What has happened?

453
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,790
Deng Hao has already told me
what I have to know.

454
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,270
I agreed with the proposal given.

455
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,510
Do you have something to add, Ms. Fang?

456
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,790
What proposal?

457
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,830
What did Deng Hao tell you?

458
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
There is no need for that.

459
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
Deng Hao is from your department.

460
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,310
He just informed me

461
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,920
to complete the transition
as soon as possible

462
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,750
before I leave.

463
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,310
I didn't tell Deng Hao anything.

464
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,270
I'm clueless about this.

465
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,920
Finally, I realize
what you meant before.

466
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,310
The HR department

467
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,310
can be dangerous.

468
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,160
This is a rare sight.

469
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
You never came

470
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,070
when I invited you to play.

471
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,680
It seems you went all out
at your first play.

472
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,510
The last time I played
was in Hangtian City.

473
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,960
I know.

474
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
You attended a wedding.

475
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,200
I remember

476
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,350
there is one guy

477
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,000
in Jiangzhou.

478
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
Let's invite him

479
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,510
when we play next time.

480
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,550
Invite Huang Yingzi and Miss Fang.

481
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,720
I can treat them to a meal
at the cafeteria.

482
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,790
Tianlin.

483
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,480
I used to think
that I couldn't make new friends

484
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,510
apart from them

485
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,160
until I met you.

486
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Why are you being so sentimental
all of a sudden?

487
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
Treating them to a meal at the cafeteria

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,830
is just a small deal.

489
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,550
I always see you as my friend.

490
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
I believe nothing is more important

491
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
than our friendship.

492
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,510
Don't you have anything to tell me?

493
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Fine, I will say it.

494
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,270
I would rather give you this opportunity

495
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,160
myself.

496
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,160
Zhuang Yuan.

497
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,550
I have been meaning to find a chance

498
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,070
to explain to you.

499
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,200
Don't need to explain.

500
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,240
I don't care anymore.

501
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,310
Wait, Zhuang Yuan.

502
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,880
Tianlin.

503
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,590
Do you know what upset me the most?

504
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,310
Out of over twenty thousand people
on the campus,

505
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,110
you are my only friend.

506
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,590
But now

507
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,590
you have thrown your friend away.

508
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,550
Bao.

509
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,790
Are you sure you arranged
a blind date for me

510
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,590
today?

511
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,200
(Yeah.)

512
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,790
(Based on your requirements,)

513
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,350
(we have selected Mr. Hong)

514
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,960
(who will watch a movie with you.)

515
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,110
The movie is starting soon.

516
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,680
Where is he?

517
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
I can't reach out to him.

518
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,590
(Hasn't he come yet?)

519
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,640
No.

520
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,640
(I see. I will call him now.)

521
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,310
Okay. Thank you.

522
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,400
Ding Ye?

523
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,030
What are you doing here?

524
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm here for the movie.

525
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,720
What are you doing here?

526
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,110
I'm here for the movie too.

527
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,590
What are the odds?

528
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,440
Yeah.

529
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,720
I sent you a message.

530
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
Did you see it?

531
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
Maybe.

532
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,640
I contacted the manager

533
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,680
of the restaurant,

534
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
and I talked to him.

535
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,070
He agreed to let you back to work.

536
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,480
Why did you do this?

537
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,960
You want to interview me?

538
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,350
No, it doesn't concern the interview.

539
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,270
After all,

540
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,680
you lost your job because of my friend.

541
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,440
We want to apologize to you.

542
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,310
Are you waiting for someone?

543
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,030
Yes.

544
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,750
Who?

545
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,200
Blind date.

546
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,000
No.

547
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
Don't get the wrong idea.

548
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,590
I'm working

549
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,400
on an interview
on the theme of blind dates.

550
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,590
So I'm meeting someone for a blind date.

551
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
You are fast to change your target

552
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,550
after me.

553
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
Why did you choose the cinema?

554
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,310
The agency introduced this person to me.

555
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,000
The guy is a college lecturer.

556
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
His surname is Hong.

557
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
He loves sports and movies.

558
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,030
I like movies too.

559
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,310
It is good to watch together.

560
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,030
The movie is starting soon.

561
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,510
Is your Mr. Hong coming?

562
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,160
He hasn't arrived yet.

563
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,590
Perhaps he stands me up.

564
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,160
Since he's not coming,
do you want to watch the movie?

565
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,270
Yes.

566
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,880
Care to join me?

567
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,920
Hello.

568
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,350
The subscriber you have dialed is busy.

569
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,920
Please try again later.

570
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
(Deng Hao is from your department.)

571
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,200
(He just informed me)

572
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,510
(to complete the transition
as soon as possible)

573
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,510
(before I leave.)

574
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,030
I really hate it

575
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,480
when people leave
without watching the credit.

576
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,270
It is nippy.

577
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,680
I thought

578
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,200
you didn't like romance movies.

579
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,160
But you were glued to it.

580
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,720
I do like romance movies,

581
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,790
but I'm not into that romance bit.

582
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,750
Love is scary.

583
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,030
Why is love scary?

584
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,750
Accept it calmly when love arrives.

585
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,440
Hopefully, you can be
as calm as you said

586
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,720
when love arrives.

587
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,750
Bye.

588
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,790
Ding Ye.

589
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,960
You are not disappearing again, right?

590
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,510
Why do you look for me

591
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,880
when you are not interviewing me?

592
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,480
I thought we met several times.

593
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,920
Even though there is no interview,

594
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,960
I don't want us to be on bad terms.

595
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,510
And also, my friend

596
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,160
you saw last time.

597
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,790
He has been meaning to contact you

598
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,960
to discuss the copyright of "The Maze".

599
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,030
Is that person very important to you?

600
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,350
Very important.

601
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,440
All right.

602
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,070
Arrange a meeting. I will meet him.

603
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,350
Thank you.

604
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,510
But on one condition.

605
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,830
You must be there.

606
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,790
No problem. I will be there.

607
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,110
Put this on.

608
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,200
Ding Ye.

609
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,270
I will return this to you
next time we meet.

610
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,790
Hello?

611
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,790
(Mr. Hong.)

612
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,070
(What is it?)

613
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,830
(I kept calling you,
but your phone was off.)

614
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,200
(The lady has arrived.)

615
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,640
(How could you stand her up?)

616
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm sorry about that.

617
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,880
Something came up just now.

618
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,750
(Are you meeting her next time?)

619
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,310
No.

620
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,160
(Well, Mr. Hong.)

621
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,550
(I need to tell you this in advance.)

622
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,920
(You can't get a refund)

623
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
(for the payment you made.)

624
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,880
Keep it for yourself.

625
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,440
I brought you a present.

626
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,270
I handpicked this myself.

627
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,510
Take a look.

628
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,790
Do you like it?

629
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,030
What is wrong?

630
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,350
Did anyone annoy you?

631
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Regarding Yue Tong,

632
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,680
you told someone in the company,
didn't you?

633
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,200
Yes, I did.

634
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,790
I was telling the truth.

635
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,310
Do you know

636
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,590
what that truth

637
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,350
could bring to her?

638
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,790
I did it for your own good.

639
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,550
Think about it.

640
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,270
If anyone in the company
were to find out,

641
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
you would be held responsible
for failing your duty.

642
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,790
This is my business.

643
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
Your business is mine.

644
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,550
I couldn't allow you
to make silly mistakes.

645
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,200
Every man for himself, isn't it?

646
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,510
Is it necessary

647
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,190
to draw a line between us?

648
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,480
All right, calm down.

649
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,960
You claimed you did this for my sake.

650
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,480
But you just want me to stay on

651
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,150
and help you get the position
of deputy general manager, right?

652
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,630
Fang Mingyu.

653
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,150
You can't be harsh to me

654
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,030
because of Yue Tong.

655
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,550
You only keep useful people
when you need them

656
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,150
and abandon them afterward.

657
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,440
Yue Tong, my childhood friends,

658
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,760
including myself,

659
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,880
do we mean differently to you?

660
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,110
You are taking this too far.

661
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
This is uncalled for.

662
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,150
Leave if you don't want to hear this.

663
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,030
I will see what you said

664
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,840
as if you were furious.

665
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,360
Calm yourself down.

666
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,030
Hello, Jiang Yi.

667
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,000
I went to the rental house again

668
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,800
and asked around.

669
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,110
There are a lot of stuff in his house,

670
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,360
and no moving company is hired.

671
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,070
I suppose Lan Bin didn't go far.

672
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,440
If you want to find him,

673
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,000
tomorrow...

674
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,840
Jiang Yi.

675
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,110
Thank you.

676
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,280
I shouldn't have quarreled with you

677
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,840
that day.

678
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,710
I'm sorry.

679
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,480
Why aren't you talking?

680
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,480
Honestly, I regret

681
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,880
that I didn't record this.

682
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,280
I have known you for 24 years.

683
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,480
I have never heard you apologize.

684
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,510
Yeah.

685
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,440
Huang Yingzi from Hangtian City
has grown.

686
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,360
Yes, you do.

687
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,400
Yifei sent me an email.

688
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,480
She asked me to stop
looking for Mr. Lan.

689
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,440
Probably, she has come around to it.

690
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Yes, maybe all of us have grown up.

691
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,480
Hello.

692
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,920
The subscriber you have dialed is busy.

693
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,360
Please try again later.

694
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,800
If you really want to find him,

695
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,630
it is fine,

696
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,280
I will go with you.

697
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,230
I doubt you will have the time.

698
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,230
Why?

699
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,630
I ran into Ding Ye today.

700
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,110
I watched a movie with him,
which was strange.

701
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,230
Then, I told him

702
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,710
about your game copyright.

703
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,030
He agreed.

704
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,400
Just two of you?

705
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,590
No.

706
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,510
With a janitor.

707
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
Did you invite him?

708
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,440
We met coincidentally.

709
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,150
What a weird coincidence.

710
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,150
Jiang Yi, are you jealous?

711
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,110
As if.

712
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,630
All right.

713
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,590
Check your schedule

714
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,760
and fix a date.

715
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
I will bring him to meet you.

716
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
Zhuang Yuan's call comes in.

717
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm going to take his call.

718
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,510
Hello?

719
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,590
Why are you calling me this late?

720
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,230
Nothing.

721
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,960
Impossible.

722
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,360
There must be something. Tell me.

723
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,670
Nothing.

724
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,760
I suddenly want to eat

725
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
at the restaurant
you took me to last time.

726
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,000
If you want,

727
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,230
we can go now.

728
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,630
It is too late.

729
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,480
Maybe next time.

730
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,800
All right.

731
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Let me know

732
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,630
if you want to go.

733
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,760
Okay.

734
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,110
Bye-bye.

735
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,280
What is the matter?

736
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Someone in the company found out
about your pregnancy

737
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,960
and tracked your medical record
at a maternity hospital

738
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,880
before you joined the company.

739
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,230
But I didn't report it to the company.

740
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,070
Have you not told anyone?

741
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,960
Anyway, none of this matters.

742
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,760
It is not your fault to get pregnant.

743
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,070
Legally speaking,

744
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,510
the company has no right

745
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,230
to dismiss you due to your pregnancy.

746
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,880
Even if things act up,

747
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,840
you can take legal action.

748
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,000
I realize that I can't get you.

749
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,400
Which side are you on?

750
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,110
I just want to help you.

751
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,190
You can't.

752
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,510
Yes, you are right.

753
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
The company can't fire me

754
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
because I'm pregnant.

755
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,480
But they have more means and ways

756
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,550
to force me out.

757
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,670
These are the rules of the workplace.

758
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm a sitting duck against it.

759
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,400
So are you.

760
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,710
Fang Mingyu.

761
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,670
You can never tell with people.

762
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,670
Watch your back.

763
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,960
Hello, Mr. Ding.

764
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,480
Jiang Yi is our game designer.

765
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,880
If we can find common ground
on the collaboration,

766
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,920
he will be in charge

767
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
of the game adaption of "The Maze".

768
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,070
What is your role here?

769
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm responsible
for putting you both in contact.

770
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,510
You will proceed with the details.

771
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,110
You can negotiate everything

772
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,150
with my agent.

773
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,920
Agent?

774
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,550
The prerequisite
for selling you my copyright

775
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,710
is that I want to hire Miss Huang

776
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,190
as my agent.

777
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,000
I...

778
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,880
I...

779
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,110
I can't.

780
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,360
I can't be your agent.

781
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,550
Mr. Ding.

782
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,150
Do you have any doubts
about the contract terms?

783
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,590
We can wait
until your lawyer reviews it...

784
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,230
You started this.

785
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,880
Are you leaving me alone with them?

786
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,510
Do you want some water?

787
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,670
If you are not feeling well,

788
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,400
we can talk about it the other day.

789
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,760
I doubt it.

790
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,030
Don't make a fuss about it.

791
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,480
Continue.

792
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,230
Let's talk about

793
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,590
the game adaptation.

794
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,920
Jiang Yi, please.

795
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,550
I think the core creativity
of "The Maze"

796
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,000
is the interaction
between parallel worlds.

797
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
The main character travels
from world A to world B

798
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,000
without causing any influence
in either world.

799
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,800
Which is an impressive idea
of "The Maze".

800
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,630
But I have a question.

801
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,480
When you were creating

802
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,110
"The Maze",

803
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,440
what did you want to express?

804
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,000
Or

805
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,630
what is its theme?

806
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,030
I don't know.

807
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,960
Mr. Ding, here's the thing.

808
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
During the process of adapting,

809
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,800
we need to know about the novel...

810
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,590
What do you think?

811
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,000
Summarize it for me.

812
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,630
Well, I will summarize it.

813
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,190
I believe "The Maze" is about

814
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,000
different life courses

815
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,400
in parallel worlds.

816
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,230
Hiding

817
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,510
in another world

818
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,480
isn't the way to resolve all problems

819
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,920
you face.

820
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,480
Because all of the worlds

821
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,000
are correlated.

822
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,230
A slight move might change everything.

823
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,550
I wonder if you are satisfied

824
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,800
with my explanation.

825
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,880
To me,

826
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,840
as an author,

827
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,440
having a reader

828
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,150
who knows my work better

829
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,710
than myself

830
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,800
is the happiest moment.

831
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,760
Well, that is my novel.

832
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,280
As for the game,

833
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,480
you can make it superficial.

834
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,550
Leaving that aside,

835
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,840
can you not be superficial?

836
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,440
Jiang Yi.

837
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,800
Anyway, it is all yours.

838
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,030
Alter anything if you want.

839
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,280
Talk to her if you have any problems.

840
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,760
Ding Ye.

841
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,190
Where are you going?

842
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,670
I will talk to him again.

843
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,840
Don't worry.
