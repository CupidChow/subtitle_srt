[Love Endures]

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,390
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,860
Jiang Yi.

4
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,410
Is that you?

5
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,530
Long time no see.

6
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,940
Huang Yingzi.

7
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Long time no see.

8
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,810
(The moment I saw Jiang Yi once again,)

9
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,340
(the door to my memory
was suddenly unlocked.)

10
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,660
(All those past moments)

11
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,100
(started flooding my mind.)

12
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,530
I'm here.

13
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,010
Why are you only here now?

14
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
It hasn't started yet.

15
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,660
Calm down.

16
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,620
Where are the others?

17
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,620
They want to watch this.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,690
"Devil in Suit."

19
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,250
"Devil in Suit"?

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,410
My foot.

21
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,970
"Devil in Suit"?

22
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,850
Don't even think about it.

23
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,530
I came here

24
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,010
to listen to Stefanie Sun's

25
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,130
theme song.

26
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
I want to watch this.

27
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,690
You have to think of something, then.

28
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,060
They came up with an idea.

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,780
You can only watch this

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,250
if you win against them.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,010
What idea?

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,620
The three of them want you

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,010
to identify them.

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,940
We can only

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,340
watch that movie
if you get them correct.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,340
You guys are pretty cunning.

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,850
You actually used tools, huh?

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,180
How can I win?

39
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,410
By guessing two of them correctly.

40
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,850
Jiang Yi,

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,810
don't think that you can pretend
to be Guan Chao by scratching your head.

42
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,810
Zhuang Yuan, Guan Chao.

43
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,780
Wrong.

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,730
Are you dumb?

45
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,570
You already guessed me correctly.

46
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,180
You should guess them one by one.

47
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,060
If he isn't Zhuang Yuan,

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
the other one must be Zhuang Yuan.

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

50
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,290
You didn't ask.

51
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,940
I...

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,380
How did you know

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,220
he was Jiang Yi?

54
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,940
His neck is as long as a giraffe's neck.

55
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,010
Everyone can tell.

56
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,100
So, which movie are we watching today?

57
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,250
"Devil in Suit."

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,900
Let's go.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,660
Let's go and buy the tickets.

60
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,380
I'm begging you. Please don't buy them.

61
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,220
Why are you begging us?

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,010
You can watch "Turn Right"

63
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,730
by yourself.

64
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,100
Hey!

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
It's called "Turn Left, Turn Right."

66
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,900
Do you think it's scary?

67
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,100
I think their shrieks are scarier.

68
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,170
Hey, the scene is over.

69
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,490
I'm sure there are more.

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,820
I'll finish the popcorn soon

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,100
if you don't have it now.

72
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,610
That won't do.

73
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,490
That was scary.

74
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,460
Was it that scary?

75
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,370
It's over?

76
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,730
This movie

77
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,260
isn't that scary after all.

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,850
Let's go.

79
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,100
You wasted a bucket of popcorn.

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,820
I hate it when people leave the cinema

81
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,970
before the credits are over.

82
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,970
Buddy,

83
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,340
you were terrified just now.

84
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
Why are you still watching the credits?

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,020
It's a type of respect.

86
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,410
Fine.

87
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,220
You can go ahead.

88
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,220
He's uncultured.

89
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,460
Let's go too.

90
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,170
No.

91
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
I have to find Mr. Bao after this.

92
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,730
I told him

93
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,900
not to turn on the light

94
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,170
before the credits are over
countless times.

95
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,260
He never listens to me.

96
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,820
I'll make a move first.

97
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,370
We'll make a move first.

98
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:26,930
Goodbye.

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,730
Here you go.

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,490
Where's Huang Yingzi?

101
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,460
She's giving Mr. Bao from the cinema
a lecture.

102
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,930
Will she come here later?

103
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,100
It'll take her

104
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,370
at least one hour.

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,660
That child is something else.

106
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,820
But we watched a horror film just now.

107
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm worried that she might be scared
to come back alone.

108
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,100
You. Call her.

109
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,930
Hurry, call her.

110
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,260
Her battery went flat

111
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,930
during the movie.

112
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,610
What should we do, then?

113
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,490
Don't worry.

114
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,850
Hangtian City isn't that big.

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,970
She won't be lost.

116
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,660
Don't worry.

117
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,780
Cloudy day, evening, outside the window,

118
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,410
in the future, a person...

119
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,170
Who's there?

120
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,780
What are you doing?

121
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,580
Can't you lower your volume
when it's midnight now?

122
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,020
I'm not guilty of anything.

123
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,170
I don't fear anything.

124
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,970
Turn left, turn right.

125
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,930
Waiting alone.

126
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,850
Huang Yingzi.

127
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,260
What are you doing?

128
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,780
You almost

129
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,970
scared me to death, you know?

130
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,100
Sorry about that. Were you scared?

131
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,340
Well...

132
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,460
Who said I was scared?

133
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,610
Why did you take this alley, then?

134
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,900
It's dangerous, you know?

135
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,580
I did it on purpose. Can't I do so?

136
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,700
Your tire is punctured?

137
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,340
I did it on purpose. Can't I do so?

138
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,820
You did everything on purpose, huh?

139
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,970
Why didn't you go to
the wonton shop with them?

140
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,780
I wasn't hungry.

141
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,930
Don't tell me
you came here to look for me

142
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,300
because you were worried about me?

143
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,700
Heartless guy,

144
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,130
since when did you realize your error?

145
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,580
Fine.

146
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,490
I'll go, then.

147
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,540
Jiang Yi.

148
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,580
Wait for me, Jiang Yi.

149
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,730
Wait for me!

150
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,700
Let's go back together!

151
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,700
Are they back?

152
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,490
From the subway and crowded people,
it is the sound of wind.

153
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,340
Holding a number plate of love.

154
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,610
I'll beat you up!

155
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,700
Do you know whose song is that?

156
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,460
It's Stefanie's.

157
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,010
Who's Stefanie?

158
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,730
What?

159
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,060
You don't even know who Stefanie Sun is?

160
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,970
Their bikes aren't around.

161
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,540
I think they're not back yet.

162
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,340
Let's go upstairs and check it out.

163
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,850
Let's go.

164
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,010
We'll wait for you guys.

165
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,890
Yifei, be careful.

166
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,940
Did you read the novels

167
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,820
I recommended to you?

168
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,770
I slept after reading five pages.

169
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,820
So ignorant and incompetent.

170
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,850
Speak for yourself.

171
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,100
You never passed the first level

172
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,820
on the game I recommended to you.

173
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,009
I'm already at Level 10

174
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,339
for Tetris, you know?

175
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,180
You call Tetris a game?

176
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,060
Is Tetris not a game?

177
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,850
I dare you to say that

178
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,540
in front of the entire Hangtian City.

179
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,250
I can only say that there's a huge gap
between our intelligence.

180
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,770
We can never be friends.

181
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,700
Wait for me!

182
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,250
Hurry up.

183
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,540
Did you see that?

184
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,130
I, Huang Yingzi, have plenty of friends

185
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,300
in Hangtian City.

186
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,460
I don't lack you.

187
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,010
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,890
I have friends too!

189
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,340
Daughter, you're back.

190
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,370
(Jiang Yi's parents were
constantly absent.)

191
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,940
(We were envious of him for being free.)

192
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,490
(But we had no idea)

193
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,650
(that he could only spend his time
with in-game characters)

194
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,340
(when we spent time with our family.)

195
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,650
(Mingyu)

196
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,610
(was always troubled by
how strict her parents were.)

197
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,970
(The table lamp on her desk
seemed to be on 24/7.)

198
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,650
(In her room, there's a soul who wishes
to explore the outside world.)

199
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,300
(Zhuang Yuan was always the first
to finish his homework.)

200
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,420
(We thought that was the mark
of an elite student.)

201
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,580
(Actually,)

202
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,890
(he was already helping his family
to manage the supermarket)

203
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,130
(long ago.)

204
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,490
Son, put them higher.

205
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,340
Okay.

206
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,100
(Guan Chao's father was drunk)

207
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,650
(most of the time.)

208
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,100
(Rumor has it)

209
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,100
(that Guan Chao grew up)

210
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,820
(sleeping among empty bottles of beer.)

211
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,460
(Whenever it was late at night)

212
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,970
(and one street lamp was left,)

213
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,100
(Yifei was still keeping
her grandmother company)

214
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,850
(until the last customer left.)

215
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,580
(And I)

216
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,010
(had my own troubles during my youth.)

217
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
(But back then,)

218
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,490
(it felt like everything would
become better after sleeping.)

219
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,340
(There was no thing I couldn't handle)

220
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,580
(or solve.)

221
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,130
(Maybe)

222
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,220
(that was our 18.)

223
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,460
(That ordinary age of 18)

224
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,370
(that belonged to us.)

225
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,060
What are you doing?
You're stealing food again.

226
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,940
Can't you wait for them to be served?

227
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,370
Why aren't they here yet?

228
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,180
Call them to come.

229
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,100
They'll be coming soon.

230
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,010
Urge them to come.

231
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,580
They'll be here soon.

232
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,490
Just go.

233
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,220
Coming.

234
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,820
Preserved meat made by my grandmother.

235
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,370
She told me to bring it here.

236
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,060
Come in.

237
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,130
These are the pork ribs
my mother made today.

238
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,770
Pork ribs and potato, huh?
I can smell that.

239
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,370
Clay oven rolls.

240
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,650
They're piping hot too.

241
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,300
Come in.

242
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,130
My mother couldn't cook in time.

243
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,850
I brought some food here.

244
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,730
That'll do.

245
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,300
You cannot enter without any food.

246
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,060
Zhong's Roasted Duck.

247
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,250
I queued for half an hour
just to buy it.

248
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,260
Please come in.

249
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,890
You can have mine.

250
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,180
None of you is keeping it for me, huh?

251
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,060
It's fine.

252
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,460
I have some duck skin left.

253
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,370
Why don't you have a taste?

254
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,770
Thank you, Yi.

255
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,970
You should have a taste too.

256
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,730
Did you do that on purpose?

257
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,180
You're so picky.

258
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,610
Jiang Yi,

259
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,180
why do you not take tomatoes?

260
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,010
Yeah.

261
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,180
Why do you not take tomatoes?

262
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
Why does he not take tomatoes?

263
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,130
I don't know.

264
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,460
Do you know why?

265
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,420
Come on.

266
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't tell me no one here

267
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,250
knows why?

268
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,540
Speak.

269
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,730
Jiang Yi, may I?

270
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,180
Please go ahead. It's fine.

271
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,490
When Jiang Yi was about eight years old,

272
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,130
his parents went on a business trip.

273
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,300
They entrusted him to his uncle.

274
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,490
But his uncle was busy with his date.

275
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,700
He didn't have time to look after him.

276
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,060
There was no food left in the house.

277
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,730
There were only two boxes of tomatoes.

278
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,540
After that,

279
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,850
I finished all two boxes of tomatoes.

280
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,970
I threw up after that.

281
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,770
Since then,

282
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,100
I never took tomatoes.

283
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,540
This is called PTSD.

284
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,220
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

285
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,420
What?

286
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,370
What PPT?

287
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,180
To put it bluntly,
he's just tired of them.

288
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Jiang Yi,

289
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,820
you were stubborn as a child.

290
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
You could've knocked on our door
and told me what you wanted to eat.

291
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,540
I would've made them for you.

292
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,250
Yeah.

293
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,770
Madam, I couldn't come at that time.

294
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,300
I was arguing with her.

295
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,540
Why am I involved again?

296
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,250
Why did we argue?

297
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,340
It's because you drew

298
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,460
a whale

299
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,540
on his first pair of basketball shoes.

300
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,890
You actually remember that?

301
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,100
I have a great memory.

302
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,220
I think a whale looks cute.

303
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,890
Not at all.

304
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,340
I think it's cute.

305
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,610
Two 6's.

306
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,540
One 6's.

307
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,890
Me too.

308
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,250
One 6's.

309
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,890
Skip.

310
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,730
Four 6's.

311
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,940
One...

312
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,770
Wait.

313
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll check your cards.

314
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,850
Here you go.

315
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
It must be fake.

316
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,250
Oh no, Yingzi, you're going to lose.

317
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,450
Here you go!

318
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,130
He lost again!

319
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,580
I won!

320
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,410
These are all yours now.

321
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,500
Again.

322
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,580
Let me stick it on your face.

323
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,740
Let's play again.

324
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,260
I'll go first.

325
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,690
Three 8's.

326
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,340
One 8's.

327
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,740
- One 8's.
- One 8's.

328
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,580
Me too.

329
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,370
Wait.

330
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,020
There are only four 8's.

331
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,340
There are so many people here.

332
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,370
Why are you only staring at me?

333
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
You must be lying!

334
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,300
He lost again!

335
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm the best actress in the world.

336
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,130
Yi, there's no space on your face.

337
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,410
It's filled with sticky notes.

338
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,930
Why don't you perform something for us?

339
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,300
Why don't you sing for us?

340
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:33,500
Sing for us!

341
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,780
Someone's knocking on the door.

342
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,130
Sing for us.

343
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,890
Huang.

344
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,449
Jiang? You guys are back.

345
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,259
Yeah.

346
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,340
I knew Jiang Yi would be here.

347
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,689
Jiang Yi, come, let's go home.

348
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,890
His classmates are here.

349
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,450
I'll send him back later.

350
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,500
Jiang Yi,

351
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,370
I bought plenty of
delicious food for you.

352
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,300
Why don't we go upstairs

353
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,060
and bring them here?

354
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,370
Yeah, let's go upstairs first.

355
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,780
Jiang Yi, it's rare
for your parents to come home.

356
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,370
You should keep them company.

357
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,930
Hurry.

358
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,930
Jiang Yi,

359
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,450
do you want us to call you
for the third time?

360
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,610
Forget it.

361
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,820
Just go back first.

362
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,740
We can play next time.

363
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,170
(In my memory,)

364
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
(I always saw Jiang Yi's back.)

365
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,980
(Happy,)

366
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,300
(disappointed,)

367
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,690
(cool,)

368
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,690
(and reluctant to part.)

369
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,980
(At this moment, it felt estranged.)

370
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,580
(But I know)

371
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,850
(that he's hiding secrets from me.)

372
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,540
How long has it been since we met?

373
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,580
12 years, I guess.

374
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,370
12 years, huh?

375
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,060
You're speaking
as if it was only 12 days.

376
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,210
I thought you went to the UK.

377
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,740
When did you come back?

378
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,850
How long has it been since your return?

379
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,650
(Jiang Yi,)

380
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,780
(it's been so long
since I heard from you.)

381
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,170
(Are you doing okay in the UK?)

382
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,450
(I'm going to get married next month.)

383
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,820
(You don't need to come back
and attend it if it's troublesome.)

384
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,130
(The UK is too far away.)

385
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,500
(I just)

386
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,300
(wanted to tell you this.)

387
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,170
(Look after yourself, okay?)

388
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,210
(Take care.)

389
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,500
(From Guan Chao.)

390
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,370
Hello, mister.

391
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,500
Here's the beer you ordered.

392
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:29,890
Okay.

393
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,890
Thank you.

394
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,890
Mister,

395
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,930
don't you need room service yet?

396
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,340
No.

397
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,740
If you need it, just tell...

398
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,210
(Jiang Yi,)

399
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,780
(will you attend Guan Chao's wedding?)

400
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,820
I texted you via QQ and emailed you.

401
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,740
Why didn't you reply to me?

402
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,300
I couldn't use them

403
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,890
after I went overseas.

404
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,210
Although it's been a long time,

405
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,060
you're still the same, huh?

406
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,100
You still suck at lying.

407
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,260
You disappeared for a long time.

408
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,170
And now, you came back
without telling anyone.

409
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,980
How have you been

410
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,340
all these years?

411
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,890
I guess I was fine.

412
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,260
What about you?

413
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,780
Yeah.

414
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,690
Me too.

415
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,410
I can't contain myself
after seeing you again.

416
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,820
Have you received the invitation
to Guan Chao's wedding?

417
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,580
Now that you're back,
you'll attend it, right?

418
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm glad that you're back.

419
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm glad that you're back.

420
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,690
You came back at the right time.

421
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,500
I'll bring you to see someone.

422
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,780
Where are we going?

423
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,930
You'll know when we get there.

424
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,020
Mingyu.

425
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm here.

426
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,690
You're here. Have a seat.

427
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,020
Dinner will be served soon.

428
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,340
Can I

429
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,580
help you with anything?

430
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,210
How well do you like your steak?

431
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,300
Medium.

432
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,020
I think it might be
a little tough, then.

433
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,930
Not bad. It's pretty good.

434
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,820
Who's that?

435
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,650
I don't know.

436
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,450
Mingyu.

437
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,020
Why isn't no one picking up the phone?

438
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,820
Are you sure this is the right address?

439
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,890
I'm not too sure either.

440
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,020
Zhuang Yuan gave me this address.

441
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,210
He said she was living here
a few years ago.

442
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,890
I don't know
if she's still staying here.

443
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,170
It's okay.

444
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,260
I'll keep calling her.

445
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,340
She'll pick up the phone somehow.

446
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,690
Mingyu, you're at home?

447
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,100
I was calling you just now.

448
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,980
Do you know them?

449
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,850
Is that your friend?

450
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,980
They're my childhood friends.

451
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,980
We haven't seen each other in so long.

452
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,260
Why don't I come and find you next time?

453
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,340
I'll leave you guys to it.

454
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,300
How about this?

455
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,980
Since it's been a long time,

456
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,410
you guys should catch up
with each other.

457
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,260
I'll head back first.

458
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,210
Sorry about this.

459
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,850
It's fine.

460
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,340
I'll make a move first.

461
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,170
Sorry about this.

462
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,820
It's fine.

463
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,650
Come in.

464
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,850
Did I interrupt you two?

465
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,650
What do you think?

466
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,130
Sorry about that, Mingyu.

467
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,060
I was afraid that you might be too busy.

468
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,930
That's why I didn't want to
interrupt you at the office.

469
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,930
You're already here anyway.

470
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,740
You don't need to explain yourself.

471
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,260
Have a seat.

472
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,850
Let's sit down.

473
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,980
Do we need to change into slippers?

474
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,580
No need for that.

475
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,340
Did you two argue?

476
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,890
It was like this when we were young.

477
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,610
You two weren't on such bad terms

478
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,340
when we were young.

479
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,500
I'll explain it to you later.

480
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,500
Jiang Yi.

481
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,370
Have a can of 7 Up.

482
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,850
I don't have the soda you like.

483
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,740
It's fine.

484
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,650
Plain water is fine.

485
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,850
It's good enough.

486
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,820
Why did you two come together?

487
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,690
I just came back.

488
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,900
We met by chance.

489
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,740
We never met each other by chance
in a small city like Hangtian.

490
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,780
But we actually met each other by chance
in a huge city

491
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,370
like Jiangzhou.

492
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,130
Jiang Yi,

493
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,170
you left
without telling anyone back then.

494
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,540
And there was no news of you at all.

495
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,450
We thought you vanished for real.

496
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,370
Yeah. Don't you intend to tell us

497
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,020
where you've been all these years?

498
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
You guys do know it.

499
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,500
I went to the UK
after graduating from high school.

500
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,610
I studied Game Design.

501
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,850
I did my internship
at a gaming company in the UK.

502
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,130
I don't think

503
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,370
she's asking you about your bio.

504
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,820
I...

505
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,370
Forget it.

506
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,540
That's what his character is like.

507
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
He's heartless.

508
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,500
Let's stop asking him.

509
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,300
Take out your phone.

510
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,820
Let's add each other on WeChat.

511
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,410
You can scan my profile.

512
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,060
I hope you won't vanish again.

513
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,340
Alright.

514
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,780
The six of us are finally
in the same group again.

515
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,930
Has it been a long time since you guys
returned to Hangtian City?

516
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,650
My father was asking me

517
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,650
when you guys were returning.

518
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,130
He wanted to make you guys a meal.

519
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,610
Also, it's been a long time

520
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,980
since we had Grandma's wontons, right?

521
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,410
Now that Jiang Yi is finally back,

522
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,650
why don't we head back
and hold a gathering?

523
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,340
I'll call Zhuang Yuan to join us.

524
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,740
What about next week?

525
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,020
Are you guys free next week?

526
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,370
Why won't we...

527
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,930
You said so much

528
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,740
to persuade me
to return to Hangtian City

529
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,370
and attend Guan Chao's wedding, right?

530
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,820
If that's the case,

531
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,100
I'll apologize to you in advance.

532
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,210
I can't go back.

533
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,370
I know you're busy with work.

534
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,780
But Guan Chao's wedding

535
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,450
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

536
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm sure he hopes
that all of us can attend it.

537
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,930
Jiang Yi,

538
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,100
he came back from the UK

539
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,820
just to attend Guan Chao's wedding.

540
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,610
Say something.

541
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,690
Actually, I didn't tell you earlier.

542
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,130
I can't attend it either.

543
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,740
Yeah.

544
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:17,980
You see,

545
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,890
I have important work to do
during the weekends.

546
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,850
You told me to get in the car

547
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,610
before I could figure out
how to break the news to you.

548
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,500
Work is important, I guess.

549
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,020
Yeah.

550
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,930
Hello, Mom?

551
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,450
Son, is the thesis defense over?

552
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,100
Yeah, it just ended.

553
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,740
How did it go? Did everything go well?

554
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,100
Yeah.

555
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,060
Mom.

556
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,740
I'm going to go back

557
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,650
this weekend.

558
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,450
I'll visit you

559
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,170
and attend Guan Chao's wedding.

560
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,780
You don't need to make a special trip

561
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,410
to attend Guan Chao's wedding.

562
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,610
You guys can gather in Hangtian City

563
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,650
during festive occasions.

564
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,650
Mom,

565
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,740
can you stop

566
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,130
making decisions for me?

567
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,500
It's decided, then.

568
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,650
Focus on your thesis.

569
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,450
Don't get distracted.

570
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,020
I'll give Guan Chao a red packet
on your behalf.

571
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,340
Alright, head to the library now.

572
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,780
I'll hang up first.

573
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,500
(During the three-month probation,)

574
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,850
the company will observe and rate

575
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,100
your performance

576
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,060
according to your behaviors.

577
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,740
Therefore, to you guys,

578
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,260
getting into the company
isn't worth celebrating over.

579
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,890
The probation period is the true trial.

580
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,980
There's one regulation I read just now.

581
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,260
Employees are not allowed
to date each other.

582
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,170
Is that a strict rule?

583
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,890
Of course.

584
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,930
This is related to the company's
operative mechanism.

585
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,450
What if we went against the rule?

586
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,410
You could only make a choice between

587
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,540
your career and relationship.

588
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:20,980
I'll try my best
to find a suitable lawyer.

589
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,260
And I'll keep you updated.

590
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,370
Thank you.

591
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,210
(Jiang Yi is in Jiangzhou.)

592
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,020
(I've prepared a welcoming feast for him
at my house.)

593
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,410
(Please come.)

594
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,340
(Alright.)

595
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,650
Good child, here's your food.

596
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,890
It smells great.

597
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,410
Slow down.

598
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:57,890
It's hot.

599
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,690
It's very hot.

600
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,170
It's so nice.

601
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,060
What's wrong?

602
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,450
Grandma.

603
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,370
Actually, I wanted them to come back.

604
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,580
But maybe they've made
new friends out there.

605
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,300
Since young,

606
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,060
they were

607
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,740
my only friends.

608
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:25,820
I don't want

609
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,060
our shot put coach

610
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,410
to be my groomsman.

611
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,340
Let's make a bet.

612
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,300
What kind of bet?

613
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,020
With Huang Yingzi around,

614
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,370
you guys will definitely
form a group again.

615
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,370
All of them will come back.

616
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
Wait.

617
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,020
Zhuang Yuan,

618
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,820
help me out.

619
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,260
Okay.

620
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,610
These are yours.

621
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,300
Extra shrimps.

622
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
This is Mingyu's.

623
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,450
She doesn't take Chinese parsley.

624
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,340
This is yours.

625
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,540
You don't take scallions.

626
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,410
What do you think?

627
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,210
I remember
your preferences correctly, right?

628
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,210
Try them.

629
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,650
See if they're different

630
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,780
from the ones Grandma made.

631
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,060
What do you think? Is it okay?

632
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,540
It tastes just like her cooking.

633
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,370
Jiang Yi, you've been abroad
for a long time.

634
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm sure you didn't have the chance
to have this again.

635
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,100
But I never forgot the taste.

636
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,610
Now that you're back,

637
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,810
you can have it

638
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,420
anytime you like.

639
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,250
I always couldn't figure this out.

640
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,650
I couldn't figure out

641
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,380
why Grandma only taught you

642
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,940
how to make wontons.

643
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,290
What's wrong with me?

644
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,250
When you were young,

645
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,730
you couldn't differentiate between

646
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,730
bak choy and Chinese cabbage.

647
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,100
Even so, you insisted on cooking.

648
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,210
You almost blew up the kitchen.

649
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,290
Do you only remember

650
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,610
the silly things I did?

651
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,290
I have a good memory when it comes

652
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,100
to remembering
people's embarrassing moments.

653
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,810
You have a good memory?

654
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,900
You lost your memories before, you know?

655
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,610
Yeah.

656
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,130
Back then, I almost fell for it.

657
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,170
Guo,

658
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,980
you're so lucky.

659
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,460
Your daughter is so filial.

660
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,540
She comes with you
to the marketplace every day.

661
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,420
We have eight people in the family.

662
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
I have to buy a lot of groceries.

663
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,940
I can't carry all of them myself.

664
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,970
The one holding the basket
must be your future son-in-law.

665
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,770
Madam Zhang, that's not it.

666
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,060
I'll sue you for defamation.

667
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,810
Mom, I want some tomatoes.

668
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,380
Tomatoes?

669
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,330
Come.

670
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,580
I don't take tomatoes.

671
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,020
So what?

672
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,290
I take tomatoes.

673
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,020
You're making it

674
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,900
as if you're the real child
of the family

675
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,170
while I'm the adopted one.

676
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,540
Huang Yingzi,

677
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,690
Sports Day is nearing, right?

678
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,460
Have you registered your name?

679
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,940
Of course.

680
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,650
If not, there's nothing to watch there.

681
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,610
I'll wait for you
to be the champion, then.

682
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,500
No problem.

683
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,130
Which event did you join?

684
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,540
Is it the 400m race?

685
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,610
If so, you'll be going up
against Guan Chao.

686
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,610
I might not lose, you know?

687
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,810
My goodness.
Where did you get that confidence?

688
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,100
You're going up against
Guan Chao, you know?

689
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,250
You'll never be the champion

690
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,940
unless he goes easy on you.

691
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,060
I said, I might not lose to you.

692
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,500
If you don't believe me,
why don't we make a bet?

693
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,210
We're not competing in the same event.

694
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,130
How can we make a bet?

695
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,380
The one

696
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,610
who's number one at their event

697
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,580
will win the bet.

698
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,860
If I win,

699
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,210
you have to eat five tomatoes.

700
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,170
Fine.

701
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,130
If I win,

702
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,580
you have to do my homework for a week.

703
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,770
Deal.

704
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,060
Quick, have some water.

705
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,900
Participant 38,

706
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,980
3.1m.

707
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,610
Only 3.1m?

708
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,060
I'm sure you can achieve 3.5m

709
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,980
and break the school record.

710
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:39,810
Don't be nervous.

711
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,020
Her result isn't good enough.

712
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,580
You're the seed here.

713
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,860
You just need to do
as good as you did last year.

714
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,170
Don't worry.

715
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,810
I'll win for sure this time.

716
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,330
Jiang Yi will have

717
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,210
to eat his tomatoes.

718
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,500
Participant 199.

719
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,500
Huang Yingzi.

720
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,860
It's your turn.

721
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,330
Go now.

722
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,650
No problem.

723
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,810
You can do it!

724
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,500
You can do it!

725
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,330
Huang Yingzi! Break the record!

726
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,420
You can do it!

727
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,860
It's that short?

728
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,170
Is she kidding me?

729
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,770
1.2m.

730
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,460
Only 1.2m?

731
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,940
I was careless.

732
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,810
But I still won.

733
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,130
I made a bet with Jiang Yi.

734
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,690
The one who's number one at their event
will win the bet.

735
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,420
But I didn't say
it must be in the correct order.

736
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,980
I'm still number one if you look
at the rankings in reverse.

737
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,250
Fine.

738
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,770
Men's Finals for the 400m race
will begin soon.

739
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,940
Athletes, get ready.

740
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,650
Men's Finals for the 400m race
will begin soon.

741
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,650
You'll be number one

742
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,610
as long as he's not.

743
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,170
Continue.

744
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,210
Guan Chao,

745
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,650
he'll definitely get number one.

746
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,810
You have a point.

747
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,100
Guan Chao, you can do it!

748
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,290
Guan Chao!

749
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,540
Guan Chao! Jiang Yi!

750
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,810
Jiang Yi!

751
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,860
Guan Chao! Jiang Yi!

752
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,580
Ready.

753
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,690
Guan Chao! Jiang Yi!

754
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:41,980
You can do it!

755
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,210
Guan Chao! Jiang Yi!

756
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:45,940
Guan Chao!

757
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:51,210
You can do it!

758
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,770
Guan Chao, you can do it!

759
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,170
Jiang Yi, you can do it!

760
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,540
Guan Chao, you can do it!

761
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,730
You can do it!

762
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,900
Guan Chao is catching up to him!

763
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,730
He's surpassing him!

764
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,210
Guan Chao, you can do it!

765
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,130
You can do it!

766
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,860
Guan Chao, you can do it!

767
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:14,380
You can do it!

768
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,610
Jiang Yi, you can do it!

769
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:37,330
You can do it!

770
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,460
I won!

771
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,980
Jiang Yi fainted!

772
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,380
Jiang Yi!

773
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,420
He's awake.

774
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,100
Yi.

775
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,580
Son,

776
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,130
you're finally awake.

777
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,580
Son.

778
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,610
Son, that was terrifying.

779
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,610
You're finally awake.

780
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,290
I'm glad that you're awake.

781
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,210
Mingyu's father examined you.

782
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,580
Yeah.

783
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,380
It's nothing major.

784
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,770
Yeah.

785
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,610
It's just some scratches.

786
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,060
Yeah.

787
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,460
And you received
a slight concussion to the head.

788
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:39,650
That's right.

789
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,100
You'll be fine after some rest.

790
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,250
You'll be fine.

791
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,460
Who are you guys?

792
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,540
Slowly.

793
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,380
Son, can you please don't scare me?

794
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,810
I'm your mother.

795
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,250
I'm your father.

796
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,380
I'm sorry.

797
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,770
I don't know who you two are.

798
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:19,980
Look at him.

799
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,580
Jiang Yi, are you okay?

800
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,980
Who exactly are you guys?

801
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,100
Also, why am I here?

802
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,290
Jiang Yi, stop fooling around.

803
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,500
Jiang Yi, did you lose your memory?
