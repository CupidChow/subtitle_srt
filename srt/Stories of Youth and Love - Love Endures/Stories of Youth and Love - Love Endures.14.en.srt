[Episode 14]

3
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,710
Ding Ye. Hey.

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,110
Anything else?

5
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,520
I want to return your coat.

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,320
Thank you for last time.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,000
You didn't dry clean it?

8
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,320
No, I return it in its original form.

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,120
As your agent ,

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,710
do you have anything to tell me?

11
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,840
You are quick to get into character.

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,430
Come with me somewhere.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,040
Let's go.

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,910
Okay. I will call a cab now.

15
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,550
Let's go.

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,310
Why the cab?

17
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,720
We are here for the collar coaster.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,910
Not for me.

19
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,439
You can ride it yourself.

20
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,800
I wait for you down here, okay?

21
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:27,990
Are you sure?

22
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,870
I'm sure.

23
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,720
Well, you are here.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
Why can't you join me?

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
Dude.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,710
I can accompany you

27
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,150
to do anything .

28
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,200
But this

29
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,120
is really out of my depth.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,910
Isn't this a self-punishment?

31
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,270
Forget it.

32
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,240
I'd better go.

33
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,240
Are you afraid of riding roller coasters?

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Nonsense.

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,790
I think

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,550
we should wait for Yifei

37
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,760
and let her decide.

38
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,320
Maybe Yifei

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,910
likes this.

40
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,790
Roller coasters are pretty good.

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,790
Our goal is to make Yifei happy.

42
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,990
She can ride this

43
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,400
to scream her stress out.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Mingyu, you have a wild preference.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,320
Actually, roller coasters are safe rides.

46
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,910
Due to the conservation of energy,

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,710
gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy,

48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,760
and then vice versa.

49
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,400
Humans' fear of riding it

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,320
comes from the sensation of weightlessness.

51
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:31,840
Speaking of weightlessness...

52
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,110
She is here.

53
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,910
Yifei.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,910
Guan Chao.

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,760
Yifei.

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,320
What took you so long

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,230
to fetch Yifei here?

58
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,160
Yifei...

59
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,110
Maybe I should go home.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm not in the mood to play.

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,760
Don't go.

62
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,950
We can't let you

63
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,320
stay at home alone.

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,110
What do you want to play?

65
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,880
We are with you.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,830
That's right.

67
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,350
How about the carousel?

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,600
I think Pirate Ship is more thrilling.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,830
Carousel is more romantic.

70
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,070
The Ferris wheel is good too.

71
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,070
We can enjoy the view.

72
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,560
Sure, the Ferris wheel is a good idea too.

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,600
Bumper cars are over there.

74
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,000
Yifei.

75
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,600
Which one do you want to try?

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,350
I...

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,950
This one.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,760
The roller coaster.

79
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,760
What is wrong?

80
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,350
Why are you laughing?

81
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
Nothing.

82
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,950
Because we all want to ride the roller coaster.

83
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,450
Come on.

84
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,670
Let's go.

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,230
Where is the queue?

86
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,320
Over here.

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,280
Come.

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,510
Um... I...

89
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,950
Just so you know,

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm not riding with you all.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,200
No?

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,630
I will never ride that in my whole life.

93
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,230
It is not that scary.

94
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,760
Well, stop forcing her.

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
Yingzi.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,600
You can wait for us down here.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:12,910
Sure.

98
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,280
I will wait for you.

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,200
But there are five of us.

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,720
Is that a problem?

101
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,320
There are two seats in a cart.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,070
How are we going to sit?

103
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,000
You... You can decide for yourselves.

104
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,390
I will sit with Yifei.

105
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's go and queue.

106
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,719
I sit with Jiang Yi.
I sit with Mingyu.

107
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,830
I... I will sit on my own.

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Zhuang Yuan, I will sit with you.

109
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Wait.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,680
I suddenly remember

111
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,510
the doctor told me

112
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,000
that I keep staring at the computer

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,320
and my retinas might detach.

114
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,920
I can't ride on the roller coaster.

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,470
It is good.

116
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,470
You can sit with Mingyu.

117
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,390
Let's go.

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Is there really something wrong with your retina?

119
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,200
Guess.

120
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,000
I guess it is fake.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
You were lying.

122
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,710
Zhuang Yuan can ride it even with a high myopia.

123
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,630
Why can't you?

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
Why would I lie to you?

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,590
I don't know .

126
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,830
Maybe you just dare not ride the roller coaster,

127
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,800
but you pretend otherwise.

128
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,070
Fine.

129
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,000
When you are ready

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,630
to ride roller coasters,

131
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,830
I will accompany you.

132
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,090
What if...

133
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,360
What if I never dare ride it?

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
I won't ride it either.

135
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,590
So, has his retina detached?

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,560
No.

137
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,630
He has eyes like a hawk's.

138
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,030
So he was afraid?

139
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,560
No.

140
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,710
Then why did he stay with you?

141
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,200
Everyone went for the ride

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,830
while I was alone. Poor me.

143
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,070
He is my friend.

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,710
Of course, he would stay with me .

145
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,240
Am I not pitiful?

146
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,200
You want me to ride alone?

147
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,920
Are you not my friend?

148
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,150
Well...

149
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Why do you insist on having me ride with you?

150
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,150
Are you scared to ride alone?

151
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,510
What is there to scare?

152
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,390
I just don 't want to sit with a stranger.

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,320
Please check for me.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
Am I all right?

155
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,030
Yes.

156
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,000
Is this safe?

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,760
Yes, very safe.

158
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,830
Check again for me.

159
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,560
Is it all right?

160
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Yes.

161
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,760
Are you sure?

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes.

163
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
Do I need to tie my hair?

164
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
No, it is fine.

165
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,070
What... What about my necklace?

166
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,200
You are asking too much.

167
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,710
I'm not scared. I'm not nervous.

168
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,680
Because roller coasters are very safe.

169
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,510
Due to the conservation of energy,

170
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,830
its speed is lower than driving cars.

171
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,150
Can you stop?

172
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,240
I'm nervous if I don't talk.

173
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,710
I'm scared.

174
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,390
I will try my best

175
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,760
not to shout later.

176
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,470
Ready.

177
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
Three, two, one.

178
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,070
Are you all right?

179
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,440
Can you walk?

180
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,870
You were scared,

181
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
but you insisted on taking the ride.

182
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,800
What for?

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
Near-death experience.

184
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,710
Are you afraid of death?

185
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,110
Yes, of course.

186
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,640
Why?

187
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm afraid

188
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,830
that I can't meet my family and friends.

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,990
I haven't had a chance

190
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,320
to do many things.

191
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,200
Also,

192
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm afraid of missing out on the person I like

193
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,160
if I die.

194
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,950
It means you are a blessed person.

195
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Because you have so many things you can't let go of.

196
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,470
You sound like

197
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,590
nothing in this world can keep you.

198
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,680
Is there anything in this world

199
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,350
worth staying for?

200
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,560
There's certainly a lot.

201
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,470
There are many beautiful things in this world.

202
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,040
If there is something that keeps you ,

203
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,920
you will realize

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,990
that you won't give up so easily

205
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,040
in the face of illness, suffering, and death.

206
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,640
You seem to have an interest in this topic.

207
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,070
No.

208
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
You brought this up.

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm just following along.

210
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,350
You saw it.

211
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,950
The bucket list.

212
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,320
So the list is real?

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
Yes.

214
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,440
Sorry.

215
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,160
I didn't mean to pry into your secret.

216
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,750
That day...

217
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,640
Since you know it is a secret,

218
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,400
you should pretend that you know nothing about it.

219
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,400
Don't worry.

220
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,560
I assure you that your secret is safe with me.

221
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
I won't tell a soul.

222
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
When I was young,

223
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,710
I always dreamed of meeting you one day.

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,520
I would like to see the person

225
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,040
who wrote such novels.

226
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,280
Finally, my wish has come true.

227
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,870
I met you.

228
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,440
But I didn't expect something like this to happen.

229
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,870
I feel sorry.

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,590
You shouldn't be sorry.

231
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,040
You should be happy.

232
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,320
Because you met me at the perfect time.

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,230
If it were a little later,

234
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,710
you wouldn't have met me.

235
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm quite interested in the things

236
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,280
on your bucket list,

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
I can complete them with you.

238
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,200
Out of sympathy?

239
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,950
How could that be?

240
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,560
What is it, then?

241
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,350
Like I told you.

242
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm also interested in the things

243
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,320
on your bucket list.

244
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,590
Since you are going to accomplish them alone,

245
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,710
why not I join you?

246
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,200
Tell me if there is a place you want to go.

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,160
I will go with you.

248
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,920
- Keep your word. - Certainly.

249
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,800
Why?

250
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,520
Do you want another ride?

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,300
Let's go.

252
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,230
Wait.

253
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,520
Help me up.

254
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Are you all right?

255
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,990
No.

256
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,520
Hello, Mom.

257
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,830
Yuan.

258
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,750
I couldn't reach you on the phone.

259
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,110
So I called Tianlin.

260
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,160
He said you weren't staying in the dorm these days.

261
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,280
What has happened?

262
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,160
Where are you staying?

263
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,320
Don't scare me.

264
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,920
I... I will come to see you.

265
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Mom, I stay at Jiang Yi's place.

266
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,560
Jiang Yi rented a big house.

267
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,830
It is better than the dorm.

268
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,470
All right.

269
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,990
It is quite good that you stay at his place.

270
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,070
You can have a good chat with him.

271
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
What is Jiang Yi doing now?

272
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,230
I want to talk to him.

273
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,590
He is out to work overtime.

274
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,470
He hasn't come back yet.

275
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,640
Well, Mom.

276
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,830
I will hang up.

277
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,950
I'm working on my thesis.

278
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,730
Bye-bye.

279
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,590
Why didn't you answer my call?

280
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,820
Answer me.

281
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,800
Now is working hours.

282
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,750
I don't want to talk about this.

283
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,800
Fine.

284
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,560
I know you are still angry.

285
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,870
I mishandled the incident of Yue Tong .

286
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,230
I apologize.

287
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,730
Fine.

288
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,560
Tell me, then.

289
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,750
Are you apologizing

290
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,280
because you think you are wrong,

291
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,710
or are you trying to please me?

292
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,590
It doesn't matter.

293
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,400
The things that matter are

294
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
we have a common goal to accomplish.

295
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
What goal ?

296
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,950
Using others as your stepping stone?

297
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,440
This is your goal,

298
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,470
not mine.

299
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,440
Guo Kai.

300
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,800
I think we need to spend some time apart.

301
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,800
Please come in.

302
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,440
Are you discussing something?

303
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,280
Yes.

304
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,110
We are done.

305
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,950
I have sorted out these materials for you.

306
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,800
The plot lines and character analysis

307
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,280
of "The Maze".

308
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,560
I have listed everything

309
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,200
for your reference.

310
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,750
Aside from the three novels,

311
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,440
Ding Ye published another seven articles.

312
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,950
I believe three of them

313
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,280
are related to "The Maze".

314
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,560
I have attached them to it.

315
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,710
You can refer to them.

316
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,750
Why are you giving me that look?

317
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,160
Did I say anything wrong?

318
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,040
Where did you go yesterday?

319
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,560
Amusement park.

320
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,350
With whom?

321
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,110
Ding Ye.

322
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,950
He wanted me to ride the roller coaster with him.

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,160
Did you do so?

324
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,750
Yes.

325
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,830
You used to be scared,

326
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,710
but now you are not.

327
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,830
Because of Ding Ye?

328
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,110
Jiang Yi, please listen to me.

329
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,680
Here's the thing...

330
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,560
Huang Yingzi.

331
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,830
In what identity

332
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,800
are you talking to me now?

333
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,990
A friend

334
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,470
or Ding Ye's agent?

335
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,520
Are these two identities contradicting?

336
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,350
Of course.

337
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,040
Don't you find yourself

338
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,230
overly concerned about him?

339
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,320
You were so nervous

340
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
when he just coughed a little.

341
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,470
It's not like he is dying.

342
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,200
Touch wood !

343
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,990
Don't be so harsh.

344
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,320
Talking about death doesn't sound good.

345
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,470
My words are harsh.

346
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,200
What about him?

347
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,350
Yes, he speaks harshly too.

348
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,800
In fact, I used to think the same as you.

349
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,640
I thought he was strange

350
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,750
and difficult to get along with.

351
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,160
But now I realize

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,830
his life is tough.

353
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,750
What do you mean?

354
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,230
Why tough?

355
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,710
He is not the only one who has a tough life.

356
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,199
I don't know how to explain it to you.

357
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,510
Because

358
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,510
- this concerns his privacy... - You don't have to.

359
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,789
I couldn't care less

360
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:37,949
about his privacy.

361
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,710
Jiang Yi.

362
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,950
Jiang Yi.

363
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,400
(The higher-ups are considering)

364
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,360
the candidates

365
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,710
for the deputy general manager.

366
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
But in yesterday's meeting,

367
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,270
I proposed a new candidate.

368
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,550
Who do you think

369
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,440
this new candidate is?

370
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,310
The person you are talking about

371
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,600
is me?

372
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,640
Excellent. As expected of my aide.

373
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,880
Although your current rank is a director,

374
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,160
that is not a problem.

375
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,230
I have already applied to the company

376
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
to give you a promotion.

377
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,680
Mingyu, you have been here for eight years.

378
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,920
I believe the Mingyu I know

379
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,310
won't back off

380
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,710
when such an opportunity arrives.

381
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,310
Thank you so much, Mr. Feng.

382
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,440
All right.

383
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,750
You should

384
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,640
get ready for this.

385
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm very confident

386
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,270
about my choice.

387
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,750
So you should be more confident

388
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,400
in yourself.

389
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,470
Hello.

390
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Hello, Jiang.

391
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,950
I need your help.

392
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,920
Just how big the conflict is

393
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,030
that made you decide to move here.

394
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,950
Jiang, you are here.

395
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,510
I would rather stay here

396
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,200
than see his face every day.

397
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,360
Come on in and sit.

398
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,750
What do you want me to do ?

399
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,270
I don't want my mom to worry about me.

400
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,950
So I told her I was staying at your place.

401
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,840
When you get home later,

402
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
please send her some pictures.

403
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
That will put her mind at ease.

404
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,440
Also,

405
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,710
if she video calls you,

406
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,470
tell her I'm on my campus.

407
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,510
Sure, I can do that.

408
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,750
But are you sure

409
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,120
you can focus on your thesis here?

410
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,710
The environment here isn't as good as the dorm.

411
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,880
But this place is quiet.

412
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,470
I bet it is.

413
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,080
It only happens sometimes.

414
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,550
All right. Let's go.

415
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,510
Why?

416
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,600
Move to my place.

417
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm not going.

418
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,790
I don't want to be your hassle.

419
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,310
I used to copy your homework back then.

420
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,840
I was once your hassle too.

421
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:41,990
Jiang...

422
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,880
Enough. Stop dawdling.

423
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
Pack your things now.

424
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,790
Are you sure this won't be your trouble?

425
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Yes.

426
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,310
But you have to keep a secret for me.

427
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,360
What secret?

428
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,640
(I think I have been to this neighborhood before.)

429
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
It seems familiar.

430
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,440
Isn't this where Yingzi stays?

431
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,230
You two

432
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,160
are living together?

433
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,840
Shut it.

434
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,530
Keep walking.

435
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,640
Put your things down first.

436
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,550
Look at this.

437
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,400
Can you see

438
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,230
the warm yellow light opposite us?

439
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,750
Isn 't that...

440
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,710
This is the secret you have to keep for me.

441
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,880
(Sorry.)

442
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,400
(The subscriber you have dialed...)

443
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,310
(Are you still angry?)

444
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
(I can accompany you anywhere you want.)

445
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,360
(Hello ?)

446
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,640
(Jiang Yi, don't you ghost me.)

447
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,270
You ignore me.

448
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,160
I will ignore you too.

449
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,880
No wonder you never told me where you live.

450
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
Well, this is a coincidence.

451
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,510
When I was planning

452
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,600
to find a job in Jiangzhou,

453
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
the housing agent told me

454
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
this apartment is pretty good...

455
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,360
Jiang Yi.

456
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,600
Look into my eyes.

457
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,030
How many years have I known you?

458
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,200
Twenty-four years.

459
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,120
I have known you for 24 years.

460
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Do you think I can' t tell

461
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,160
if you lie?

462
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,920
You are so stubborn.

463
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,510
I feel tired for you.

464
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,990
To be frank,

465
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,510
Yingzi and I are like

466
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,600
two planets on different orbits.

467
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,790
There is always a distance between us.

468
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,680
Yes, I can stay by her side.

469
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,750
But I feel like

470
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,640
I can never get close to her.

471
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,510
Physically speaking,

472
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,880
if a planet

473
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,510
reduces its speed,

474
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,790
the centripetal force changes,

475
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,080
it may change its orbit.

476
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,790
Excellent.

477
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,680
You really are so excellent.

478
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
Only you

479
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,510
will answer my question

480
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
in a serious manner .

481
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,260
That's why we are friends.

482
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,840
However, Jiang,

483
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,750
you should change

484
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,120
your speed.

485
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
Otherwise,

486
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,680
both of you will never meet.

487
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,470
Ding Ye.

488
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,230
What is next on the bucket list?

489
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,640
The next one...

490
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,360
One moment.

491
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,840
Visit the aquarium at deep night.

492
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,680
Okay, let's do it now.

493
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,510
Tonight?

494
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,400
Tonight, I...

495
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,600
Are you calling it quits

496
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,030
just after the first thing?

497
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,310
Do you have the spirit of the deal?

498
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,990
No, it is not that.

499
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,250
Forget it.

500
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,950
I will go myself.

501
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,160
I will go.

502
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
I will go with you.

503
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,470
No rush.

504
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,550
The aquarium closes at 8 PM.

505
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,950
Don't come too early.

506
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,510
What a relief.

507
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,640
I can rest assured

508
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
of seeing you both together.

509
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,200
You can take care of each other.

510
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,790
Zhuang Yuan

511
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,710
only knows about studying.

512
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,550
He doesn't know how to take care of himself at all.

513
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,920
Jiang Yi, please keep an eye on him.

514
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,080
Don't worry, madam.

515
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,160
All right, Mom.

516
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
We are not young kids anymore.

517
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay, I won't nag.

518
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,920
I'll leave you guys to it.

519
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,270
See you, madam.

520
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,990
Bye.

521
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,550
Finally, this is settled.

522
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,750
Do you have an extra bed sheet?

523
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,950
I want to lay it on the sofa.

524
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Sleep in my bed.

525
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,710
How can that be?

526
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,160
I'm already a hassle to you.

527
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,750
It is fine.

528
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,750
Actually, I always stay up late to work on my game.

529
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,790
It is convenient for me to sleep on the sofa.

530
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,750
No need to be so courteous.

531
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm not.

532
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,790
How about this?

533
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,510
I will pay you half of the rental.

534
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,880
You are still a student.

535
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,160
How are you going to pay?

536
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,270
All right.

537
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,790
Don't stand on ceremony.

538
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,200
You can pay me back

539
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,270
once you make big money.

540
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,030
I'm like a freeloader.

541
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
How about

542
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,990
buying me some beer?

543
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,790
Finally, you came.

544
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,200
The aquarium is closed.

545
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,640
Perfect timing.

546
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,790
Come on.

547
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,120
Is it okay if we go in like this?

548
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,790
Everything is arranged.

549
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,440
Marine life has excellent hearing.

550
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,310
Visitors swamp this place during the day,

551
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,680
which causes disturbance to them.

552
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Only at night,

553
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,710
when everything quiets down,

554
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,470
it is the best time to observe them.

555
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,990
So you chose

556
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,750
to come here at this hour.

557
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,080
Now is their calmest

558
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
and freest moment.

559
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,750
Hello. We meet again.

560
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,640
Do you think this ray

561
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,920
looks like a emoji on QQ?

562
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,990
What is wrong?

563
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,600
Do you think

564
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,640
the fish would reckon the aquarium as their home

565
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,200
after spending so much time here?

566
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,400
Possible.

567
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,550
Some of them are born in the aquarium.

568
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,830
The birthplace

569
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,160
is considered their home.

570
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,790
I disagree with that.

571
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,360
I believe every fish

572
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,680
has a concept of the ocean.

573
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,030
Maybe they want to go home,

574
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,120
back to the ocean.

575
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,710
(I told you)

576
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,440
there was no whale in the aquarium.

577
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,310
This place is too small for it.

578
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,600
This is Indo-Pacific sergeant .

579
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,680
Golden trevally.

580
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,680
And Verduya's hap.

581
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,990
Tuwei!

582
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,160
Hello, Jiang Yi.

583
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
Nice to meet you, Jiang Yi.

584
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
It looks like you, right?

585
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
This is ugly.

586
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
Come, look at this.

587
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,990
This shark is known as

588
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,310
nurse shark.

589
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,600
It is the most submissive

590
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
and mildest shark in the world.

591
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,750
How do you know so much?

592
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,640
Although there is no aquarium in Hangtian City,

593
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,840
it has a bookstore.

594
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,750
I often read about them.

595
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,230
Then why don't we just read books?

596
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,550
The difference between books and real creatures

597
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,160
is the difference between our IQs.

598
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,880
Understood?

599
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,880
Fine.

600
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,790
What is this?

601
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,680
This is ray,

602
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
also known as devil fish.

603
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,990
Devil fish?

604
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,200
It reminds me of the emojis on QQ,

605
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,470
Silly and Grumpy.

606
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,680
Well, I can see why it is grumpy.

607
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,790
But why is it silly?

608
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,200
It is over here.

609
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,080
I bite you.

610
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,550
I'm that shark.

611
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,790
What is wrong with you?

612
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,440
You have been silent since we left the aquarium.

613
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,360
Was it not fun?

614
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,640
It is not that.

615
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,360
The aquarium is too beautiful.

616
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,750
Let me see what is next on the list.

617
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,230
Sing "My Sun" in the bathhouse.

618
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,440
Dude, I really can't help you with this.

619
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,270
You make a copy of it.

620
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,640
Yeah.

621
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,510
In case I miss out on something.

622
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,360
I don't want the chance to slip off.

623
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,750
Are you not curious

624
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,360
why I have a bucket list?

625
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,270
That is your privacy.

626
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,030
If you don't want to say,

627
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,080
I won't ask.

628
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,790
But I know

629
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,990
why you wanted to visit the aquarium at night.

630
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,790
Why?

631
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,230
Your first novel is

632
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,710
"The Man Who Dreams of Whales".

633
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,750
So I suppose you love the ocean.

634
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,710
But the nearest place to the ocean in this city

635
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,840
is the aquarium.

636
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,710
It is a shame that there is no whale there.

637
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,310
And I suppose

638
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,310
you don't want to see a confined whale.

639
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,710
Whales belong to the ocean.

640
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,920
Yes.

641
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,680
I looked up online before.

642
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,710
There was once an aquarium

643
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,030
that tried to keep whales,

644
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,510
but they failed.

645
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,440
Because whales can't carry on

646
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,750
when they lose their freedom.

647
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,230
They are creatures of character, unlike humans.

648
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,880
Yeah.

649
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,790
You like the ocean

650
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,920
and movies.

651
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,360
I bet you like to watch

652
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,400
"The Big Blue".

653
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,120
Is there any connection between them?

654
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,230
This is just my guess.

655
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
I'm always emotionally overwhelmed

656
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,640
when watching this movie.

657
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,750
So, are you the type

658
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,080
who forcefully introduces your favorite movie

659
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,550
to others?

660
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,600
Yeah.

661
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,640
I have five friends

662
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,360
whom I grew up with.

663
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
Some like to watch sports,

664
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,840
some like animations,

665
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,310
and some like doing homework.

666
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,030
Hence, we always

667
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,600
argued about

668
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,840
our weekend activities.

669
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,270
At this time,

670
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,360
I would make everyone

671
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,790
watch a movie with me.

672
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,600
What did you watch?

673
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,550
There are many movies I like.

674
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,440
Films by Wong Kar -wai,

675
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,270
Lee Chang-dong,

676
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,310
and Shunji Iwai.

677
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,790
Which Shunji Iwai movies do you like?

678
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,880
"Picnic".

679
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,120
How special.

680
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,950
Normally, girls prefer "Love Letter"

681
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,030
or "April Story".

682
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,440
"Picnic"

683
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,230
may seem

684
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,080
like a dark movie ,

685
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,270
but to me,

686
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,120
it is a warm story.

687
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,080
The female lead is mentally ill.

688
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,840
But she has a friend

689
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,950
who always keeps her company,

690
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,510
no matter how the story ends,

691
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,360
whether it leads to the ocean

692
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,950
or death.

693
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,270
I used to imagine all of us

694
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,790
staying in the same city and often eating together

695
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,360
after graduation

696
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,440
just like what we did when we were kids.

697
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,640
But then I realized it wasn't realistic.

698
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,030
We all work in different places

699
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,230
and have partners.

700
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,160
Do you really think it is like "Friends"?

701
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,840
To be honest,

702
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,120
I have never expected

703
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,360
to be your housemate.

704
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,310
Besides, we are next to Yingzi's place.

705
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,400
Do you remember the last time

706
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
you went to the aquarium?

707
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,360
When I was in my senior year

708
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,920
in Jiangzhou.

709
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,640
It has been a long time.

710
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,270
With that childhood friend of yours?

711
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,710
During our time together,

712
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,600
I have found myself

713
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,680
doing things

714
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,200
I haven't done in a long time.

715
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,400
Sometimes, I wonder

716
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,440
if I'm in the present

717
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,640
or back in my childhood.

718
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,510
It was fun to do the same thing with the same group of people

719
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
when we were kids.

720
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,310
But it becomes less fun after we grow up.

721
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,200
Perhaps it is us who become less fun

722
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,360
as we grow older.

723
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,310
Thank you so much.

724
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,640
These days

725
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,950
often takes me back

726
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,990
to the days

727
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,880
I spent with my childhood friends.

728
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,920
Even though we have done many meaningless things,

729
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,200
I'm happy.

730
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
I have arrived home.

731
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
I will get going.

732
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,510
Huang Yingzi.

733
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
Throughout your life,

734
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,640
have you ever lost someone important ?

735
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,950
I did.

736
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,160
At the age of 18,

737
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,310
I said goodbye to him.

738
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,160
Back in that time,

739
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,400
I never thought of saying goodbye

740
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,680
would mean losing him.

741
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,470
But later, I realized

742
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,400
bidding goodbye

743
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,950
means the last farewell to many people.

744
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
Even if they meet again,

745
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,790
they can never return to where they used to be.

746
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,230
Whatever you lose

747
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,920
will come back to you in another way.

748
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Do you believe in this?

749
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,310
I did.

750
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,430
However, now I fault.

751
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,390
I'm the exact opposite.

752
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,600
I used to doubt it,

753
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,270
but now I begin to believe it.

754
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,200
Why?

755
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,390
No reason.

756
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,270
Being able

757
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,040
to meet a lost friend

758
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,230
means you're lucky.

759
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm off.

760
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,040
(Whatever you lose)

761
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,710
(will come back to you in another way. )

762
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,230
Being able

763
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,000
to meet a lost friend

764
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
means you're lucky.

765
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,390
Shall we start now?

766
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,430
Do you think you are a pessimist?

767
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,230
You could say that.

768
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,310
During the time with you,

769
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,160
I discovered

770
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,870
that you have experienced many strange things.

771
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,230
Being a taxi driver,

772
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,960
serving as a waiter in the restaurant,

773
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,520
reading poems aloud at the dating corner,

774
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
and even visiting the aquarium late at night.

775
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,000
Everything you have done

776
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,350
give me an impression

777
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,640
that you are an exploratory optimist.

778
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,960
Have you ever read " The Myth of Sisyphus"?

779
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,950
What do you think

780
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,000
about Sisyphus rolling the boulder up a hill every day?

781
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,640
Perpetual

782
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,520
and without any purpose.

783
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,120
But why does he seem to enjoy it so much

784
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,430
in Camus's narrative?

785
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,830
In my opinion,

786
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,200
perhaps he simply enjoys

787
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,270
the rolling process,

788
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,870
just like you,

789
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,270
You did those things because you enjoyed them.

790
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Right?

791
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
I did enjoy them.

792
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,480
But I believe if Sisyphus were given options,

793
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,480
he would definitely not choose to roll the boulder up a hill.

794
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,270
Is there anything else in this world, in your opinion,

795
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,430
worth trying?

796
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,040
Nothing.

797
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,600
I have experienced

798
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,600
family and friendship.

799
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,960
Except for love relationships.

800
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,310
That's why you don't believe in love?

801
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,430
Not all things are certain.

802
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,630
What about you?

803
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,200
What do you think of love ?

804
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,200
I'm interviewing you.

805
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,000
Why the other way around now?

806
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,750
Can't I interview you?

807
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,270
Just a casual chat.

808
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,310
Well, you can.

809
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,830
However, I have already

810
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,560
sent my love relationship away.

811
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,830
Is it

812
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,160
Jiang Yi?

813
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,600
What do you think is the difference between a friend and a lover,

814
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,640
or

815
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,310
between a friendship and a love relationship?

816
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,350
Love means mutual destruction.

817
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,710
When you are in love with someone,

818
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,480
you will have to enter their life.

819
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,600
(Selfishness, ignorance,)

820
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,870
(cowardice, softness, kindness, and generosity,)

821
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,640
(all of these qualities will be laid bare.)

822
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,830
(Your true self will have to face a trial.)

823
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,160
(Still, this is also an excellent opportunity)

824
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,750
(to know yourself deeper.)

825
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,200
(But friendship is different.)

826
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,590
(Friendship won't lead to mutual destruction.)

827
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,390
(No matter how close you are,)

828
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,160
(there is always a distance between you both.)

829
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,040
(Sometimes far and sometimes near.)

830
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,390
(You wouldn't pull your friend)

831
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,120
(into your own life.)

832
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,200
So

833
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,600
friends walk shoulder to shoulder?

834
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,040
While lovers stand head to head.

835
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,680
So, what is the result

836
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,710
when you and Jiang Yi face each other head-on?

837
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,600
The rain hasn't stopped yet.

838
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,750
I forgot to bring an umbrella.

839
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,160
I never brought one with me.

840
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
Because I will always lose it.

841
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,000
Why do people always lose their umbrellas?

842
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,910
Because rain stops eventually.

843
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,160
When the rain stops,

844
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,560
they won't need an umbrella.

845
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
Do you think you can find

846
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,160
the lost umbrella?

847
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,830
It doesn't matter.

848
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,480
The moment you lose the umbrella,

849
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,640
it is meant

850
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,080
for the next person who finds it.

851
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Aren't you my godsend?

852
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,350
Come.

853
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,310
The rain is heavy.

854
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,560
The umbrella can't shelter us.

855
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Your head is big.

856
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,160
My head is smaller than yours.

857
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,080
You never fit in my hats

858
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,000
since we were little.

859
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,430
Fine.

860
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,600
Take this.

861
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,390
Why do you have two umbrellas?

862
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
I picked it somewhere.

863
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,480
You don't want this?

864
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,120
Give it back.

865
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,910
I want it,

866
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,350
of course.

867
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,310
Did you really pick this up?

868
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,200
Yeah.

869
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,790
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

870
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,710
It is too late.

871
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,830
The umbrella is now mine.

872
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,790
Where did you

873
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,160
pick this umbrella from?

874
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,080
A bubble tea place.

875
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,480
Speaking from your experience,

876
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,230
how much time is needed

877
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,160
to draw this whale?

878
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,560
If waterproof glue is used,

879
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,600
it is around three to five days.

880
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,480
How did you know about the waterproof glue?

881
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,560
Oh, please.

882
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,230
This is an umbrella.

883
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,520
How come the whale is missing an eye?

884
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,310
Let me see.

885
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,040
Is it?

886
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:57,310
The eyes

887
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,350
are here.

888
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,000
Why are you so nervous?

889
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,480
It was a mistake.

890
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,910
This person chose to paint the whale

891
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,120
on a transparent umbrella.

892
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,430
I suppose he must have hope

893
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,750
that the whale could be seen at once

894
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,960
when the umbrella was open.

895
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,000
I think

896
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,830
the painter

897
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,790
must be very gentle.

898
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,870
The whale is drawn so beautifully.

899
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,390
He must be talented and handsome.

900
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,910
Why are you smiling?

901
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,390
I didn't.

902
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,870
You did smile.

903
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:36,680
No.

904
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,270
You smirked.

905
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,790
I didn't.

906
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,480
You heard that wrong.

907
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,910
You did.

908
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:41,960
I did not.

909
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,430
You did.

910
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,910
I did not.

911
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,600
Why did you smile?

912
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,000
I didn't.

913
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,830
Care to share?

914
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:45,600
I didn't smile.
