00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,610
[Episode 28]

3
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,080
I will kill you!

4
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
Give Yifei back to me!

5
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,590
Give her back to me!

6
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,470
You killed Yifei!

7
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,750
It's all your fault!

8
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
(Dai Wei.)

9
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,470
(We received a report)

10
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,470
testifying against you
for sexual assault,

11
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,750
illegal detention,
and kidnapping for ransom.

12
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,870
Please cooperate with our investigation.

13
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,520
Guan Chao.

14
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,680
Your dad is here to pick you up.

15
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,400
You can leave now.

16
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,150
You're not a kid anymore.

17
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,120
Won't you think about your future?

18
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,510
I'm talking to you.

19
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,160
Speak up!

20
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,750
Yifei is dead.

21
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,800
What do you want to do?

22
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,630
Do you want to kill Dai Wei?

23
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,870
Are you sending yourself to death
as well?

24
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,510
You disappoint me.

25
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,830
I disappoint you?

26
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
She was a living person.

27
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,630
The one I loved.

28
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,040
She is dead!

29
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
When she died,

30
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,630
I didn't even see her for the last time.

31
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,950
I couldn't do anything at all.

32
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,830
I can only seek justice for her.

33
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,510
You don't even know what love is.

34
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,600
You only love yourself.

35
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,240
There is no one else in your heart.

36
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,270
You are a selfish person!

37
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm leaving soon.

38
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,360
Take care of yourself.

39
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,630
If you leave,

40
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,240
what are you going to do
about university?

41
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,510
If you leave everything behind,

42
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,270
we will have to delay another year.

43
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,360
How much time do we have to waste?

44
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't care.

45
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,870
You can't go!

46
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,310
Are you going to forsake your future

47
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,600
for Huang Yingzi?

48
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,240
If it were not for Huang Yingzi,

49
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,750
I may still not know

50
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,950
what I want to do in the future.

51
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,510
I wouldn't even have come back with you.

52
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,630
She's in trouble now.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
I can't ignore her.

54
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Yi.

55
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,310
Think about it again.

56
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
(Today is Monday, August 18th,)

57
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,800
(the eighteenth day
of the seventh lunar month.)

58
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,430
(The tenth day of the Beijing Olympics.)

59
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,870
(The schedule is
already halfway through.)

60
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,310
(The Men's 110m Hurdles)

61
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,120
(will be held as scheduled
at Beijing Bird's Nest Stadium.)

62
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
(Chinese athlete Liu Xiang withdraws
from competition due to injury.)

63
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,720
(My daughter,)

64
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,240
(your dad and I are out
to do some errands.)

65
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,950
(It's muggy and hot today.)

66
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,630
(Just stay at home, don't go out.)

67
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,390
(I will make crayfish
for dinner tonight.)

68
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,360
Yifei.

69
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,360
Honestly,

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,390
I quite envy Yingzi.

71
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,750
Because she can forget

72
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,360
her unhappy memories.

73
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,510
But I can't.

74
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,750
I still remember the first time
I saw you.

75
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,310
You were dancing then.

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,750
You were wearing a little white dress.

77
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,750
You looked just like a little swan.

78
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,800
I was thinking at that time.

79
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,870
How could there be such a beautiful girl

80
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,750
in this world?

81
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,480
Thank you, Yifei.

82
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,750
Yifei.

83
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,160
Yifei, it was you who made me realize

84
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
that I could be the one who is loved.

85
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,870
Yifei.

86
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,320
I miss you.

87
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Guan Chao.

88
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,510
Keep your voice down, she's sleeping.

89
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,270
I woke up long ago.

90
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,150
If I continue sleeping,

91
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,750
wouldn't I become a sleepyhead?

92
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,000
Where have you been?

93
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
Did someone die?

94
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,480
A colleague.

95
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,270
Who is it?

96
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
Someone from the factory.

97
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
You don't know them.

98
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,600
I grew up playing in the factory.

99
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Is there anyone

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
that I don't know?

101
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Well,

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
not a colleague.

103
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
It's the child of a colleague.

104
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
Child?

105
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,200
Dying at such a young age.

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,390
What a pity.

107
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,550
Yingzi,

108
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,960
look, after the heat stroke,

109
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
you look haggard.

110
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
I will make some delicious food for you.

111
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,030
Replenish your nutrition.

112
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,550
No, thanks.

113
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,200
I've been staying at home
these past few days.

114
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,239
I want to go out for a walk.

115
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,150
No.

116
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,480
It's too hot outside.

117
00:09:57,789 --> 00:09:58,959
I feel so bored staying at home.

118
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,200
I want to see Yifei.

119
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,150
I sent her a message

120
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
but she didn't even reply.

121
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,510
Our university classes are starting

122
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,150
in two weeks.

123
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,910
If we don't get together now,

124
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,510
we might not have a chance later.

125
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,790
I am going out.

126
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,390
Hurry up.

127
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,510
Mingyu.

128
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,630
I am Mr. Huang.

129
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,840
Well,

130
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,720
Yingzi is going to the wonton shop.

131
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,480
She said she was going to see Yifei.

132
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,720
You must be cautious.

133
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,390
She's here.

134
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,030
Why are you two manning the store today?

135
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,120
Grandma's old illness has relapsed.

136
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,270
It's back pain.

137
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,320
She's resting at home.

138
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,480
It's okay, we're both on holiday now.

139
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,390
We have nothing better to do.

140
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,120
So we're helping out.

141
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,200
Have a seat.

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
You haven't eaten, have you?

143
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,550
I'll make you a bowl.

144
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,550
Why did you come out

145
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,440
without wearing your shoes properly?

146
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,200
I remember tying my shoes.

147
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
Oh, no.

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
My memory

149
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,320
is getting worse recently.

150
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,790
I don't know what's going on.

151
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,390
Put in more seaweed for me.

152
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,910
Has Yifei contacted you guys recently?

153
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,550
Yi...

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Yifei is with the dance troupe.

155
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,390
They're performing in Jiangzhou.

156
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,910
She could at least reply to my messages.

157
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,240
I sent her messages on QQ

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
and text messages,

159
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,670
but she's not replying.

160
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm a little worried about her.

161
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,150
What's there to worry about?

162
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,030
This is her first official performance.

163
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,840
She must be busy.

164
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,630
Have you heard about that girl?

165
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,080
How pitiful.

166
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,510
I heard she was only 18 years old.

167
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,600
She's gone just like that.

168
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
We saw her last time.

169
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,720
She looked quite beautiful.

170
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,510
Eat up.

171
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,360
Here.

172
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,960
What a shame.

173
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,840
I heard she committed suicide.

174
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,240
She was so young,

175
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,960
I wonder what she was depressed about.

176
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,510
Madam.

177
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,720
Who did you just say committed suicide?

178
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
It's 12 yuan in total.

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,670
We haven't finished eating yet.

180
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,670
She doesn't know.

181
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,150
Okay.

182
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Quick, let's eat.

183
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,030
I'll give you
two more bottles of drinks.

184
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,910
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,550
Thank you.

186
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
I haven't finished asking yet.

187
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,750
Why did you chase them away?

188
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,150
They have finished eating.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
You obviously drove them away.

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,000
Zhuang Yuan.

191
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,000
Mingyu.

192
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,150
Why are you two acting so weird?

193
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,390
Are you hiding something from me?

194
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,080
Yingzi.

195
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,360
Actually...

196
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Huang Yingzi.

197
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,750
Look,

198
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,320
you almost ruined the surprise.

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,870
When did you come back?

200
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,790
Today.

201
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
Huang Yingzi!

202
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,120
It's not easy for me to come back.

203
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,200
Is this how you treat me?

204
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm afraid you'll still
be angry with me.

205
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,670
Yes.

206
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,390
I am indeed still angry with you.

207
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,630
I wanted to stay in the UK all my life

208
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,150
and never come back.

209
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,480
Didn't you leave me a lot of messages?

210
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,670
You should have a lot
to say to me, right?

211
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,670
You don't want to talk?

212
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,150
I'm leaving, then.

213
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,630
I saw you at the Internet cafe entrance

214
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,840
that day.

215
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,000
I did it on purpose.

216
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,750
(I held hands with Zhuang Yuan
on purpose.)

217
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,910
(I wanted to make you angry and leave,)

218
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,840
(so I came up with such a stupid idea.)

219
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,480
(I was worried you'd stop studying
in the future.)

220
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,390
(I was worried you'd be
too depressed here.)

221
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,790
I was presumptuous

222
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,200
and made you angry in this way
to chase you away.

223
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,670
On the day you left,
I went down and chased after you.

224
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,030
But you didn't see me.

225
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,840
Your car was going too fast.

226
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,510
I kept calling out to you.

227
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,200
Jiang Yi!

228
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Jiang Yi!

229
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,150
Your car moved farther and farther away.

230
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,320
In the end, I couldn't chase you.

231
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,840
The game you gave me,

232
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,720
I played it over and over again
many times.

233
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,870
(I saw it too,)

234
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,960
(the Easter egg
you got me in the game.)

235
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,670
I regretted it the moment I saw it.

236
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,550
Can you forgive me?

237
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,320
I shouldn't use

238
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,910
a presumptuous method

239
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,960
to force you to leave.

240
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,030
I was really too...

241
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,480
I knew you were doing it

242
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
to force me to go abroad.

243
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,240
In fact, I regret it too.

244
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I didn't get to see you one last time
before I left.

245
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,440
Sorry.

246
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,720
Sorry.

247
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
During my time away,

248
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,200
were you unhappy?

249
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,240
You've only been gone for two months,

250
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,750
but it feels like you've been gone
for an eternity.

251
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,000
Moreover, I feel...

252
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
I feel like many things have happened.

253
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,790
Everyone is saying

254
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,200
that Yifei

255
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,440
went on a ballet tour.

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,270
But I couldn't contact her
no matter what.

257
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,880
Just like how I couldn't
get in touch with you.

258
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,750
I feel...

259
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,349
I feel like everyone seems
to be leaving me

260
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,029
one by one.

261
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,830
I'm back, am I not?

262
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
Well, since you're back here,

263
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,110
will you still leave?

264
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,590
No.

265
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,110
Jiang,

266
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,920
that's how it is now.

267
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,830
I've told you the specifics

268
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,240
over the online chat.

269
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,920
None of us know

270
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,510
if she will remember it.

271
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,590
We can only stay with her like this.

272
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,350
We can't keep hiding this from Yingzi.

273
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,400
If she doesn't face it,

274
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,510
she can never come out of it.

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,720
But what are we going to tell her?

276
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
Who is going to tell her?

277
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Let me do it.

278
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,240
If you really want to say it,

279
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,030
you have to find the right time.

280
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,510
That also depends on her condition.

281
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,070
Why are you all here?

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,960
Why did you come here?

283
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,830
Here, it's your spare key.

284
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,750
I thought now that you are back,

285
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
I should

286
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,750
give it back to you.

287
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
It's okay.

288
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
Just keep it for now,

289
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,240
won't you?

290
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,200
Well, well, guys.

291
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,720
Holding a meeting behind my back?

292
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,160
What if we say this meeting

293
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,590
is actually for you?

294
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,160
For me?

295
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,510
Yes.

296
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,440
We

297
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,160
were actually thinking about

298
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,440
taking you out for a trip.

299
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,640
Did you not get a heat stroke?

300
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,750
And you didn't have the chance

301
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,400
to relax properly during the holidays?

302
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,070
Right?

303
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,880
Really?

304
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,510
When?

305
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,590
This weekend.

306
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,790
This weekend?

307
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm afraid it won't work.

308
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,790
I have to go see Yifei's performance.

309
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,550
Yifei?

310
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,510
Where are you going to meet Yifei?

311
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,270
Don't you guys

312
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,790
keep track of Yifei's news?

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,830
This place.

314
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,960
I haven't contacted Yifei
in a long time.

315
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,510
Moreover,

316
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,200
this is her first official performance.

317
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,070
I want to see it.

318
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,640
Yifei.

319
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,110
Isn't Yifei performing
with a dance troupe?

320
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
Won't you disturb her

321
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,480
if you meet her?

322
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,310
Is our graduation trip

323
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,440
not attractive enough for you?

324
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,310
It's quite attractive.

325
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,750
But without Yifei
on the graduation trip,

326
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,110
it feels like something's missing.

327
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,880
How about this?

328
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's set our destination

329
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,830
to Jiangzhou, and we'll watch
Yifei's performance. Sounds good?

330
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,350
No objections, right?

331
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,440
Sure.

332
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
Let's

333
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
go to Jiangzhou together.

334
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,550
Yingzi,

335
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,440
what's wrong with you?

336
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,960
We're on a trip.

337
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,270
Why are you so solemn?

338
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm not.

339
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,590
Aren't we going to watch
Yifei's performance?

340
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,510
I'm a little nervous

341
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,070
and excited now.

342
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,480
Yingzi,

343
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,350
what do you have in that bag?

344
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,270
You're hugging it so tightly.

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,830
I brought some food.

346
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,920
I forgot to give it to you guys.

347
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,310
Take it and eat it.

348
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,160
I'll take this potato chip.

349
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,510
No.

350
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,350
Later, when we arrive in Jiangzhou,

351
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,310
I can give it to her.

352
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,440
No one is allowed to eat this.

353
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,400
This is for Yifei.

354
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,030
Well,

355
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
if Yifei is busy

356
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,310
with her rehearsal,

357
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
will we disturb her?

358
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,590
Just wait until her performance is over.

359
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,110
What if we can't find Yifei?

360
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,400
What do you mean by that?

361
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,440
After her performance,

362
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
we can definitely meet her.

363
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Moreover,

364
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,270
aren't we going to Jiangzhou

365
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,350
to see her?

366
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,000
Do not worry.

367
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,720
We'll definitely be able to meet her.

368
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,160
You're right.

369
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,680
I wouldn't have imagined

370
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,480
that this graduation trip

371
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,070
would gather the six of us together.

372
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,310
Even Jiang Yi is back.

373
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,880
We'll see Yifei soon, too.

374
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,240
How wonderful.

375
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,350
What if the journey's end

376
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,160
is not what you imagine?

377
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,720
Come out for a moment,

378
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,030
I have something to tell you.

379
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,590
Just right.

380
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,960
I have something to tell you, too.

381
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,510
- I have something to...
- I have something to...

382
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,400
After you.

383
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,590
In another week,

384
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,030
you will be going off to Beijing.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,270
Before that,

386
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,310
there's a thing

387
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
I have to make clear to you.

388
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay.

389
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
Then you say it first.

390
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm listening.

391
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,160
Two months ago,

392
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,110
I ran to the UK by myself.

393
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,640
But if I knew you were so unhappy

394
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,110
after I left,

395
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,000
I wouldn't have left in the first place,
no matter what.

396
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,790
It's okay.

397
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,440
Anyway, you are back now.

398
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,440
The two of us

399
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,680
can choose again.

400
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,400
Choose again?

401
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
Upon your return,

402
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,070
I gave it a lot of thought.

403
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
I thought of a way

404
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,510
to prevent us from being separated.

405
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,070
Jiang Yi.

406
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,310
If you aren't leaving this time,

407
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,640
go to Beijing with me.

408
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,640
We both have already
made the wrong choice once.

409
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,720
This time,

410
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,400
let's not make the wrong choice again.

411
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,750
Let's not be separated again.

412
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,750
Yes, I understand.

413
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,640
I also want to go to Beijing with you.

414
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,960
But actually, a lot of things
happened in the meantime

415
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,350
that you don't know.

416
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,880
So before going there,

417
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,590
I need to make it clear to you.

418
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,030
What... What do you want to say?

419
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,110
During the time I was away,

420
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,920
I... I...

421
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,750
Wait a moment.

422
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,110
Are you sure

423
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,480
what you have to say
is what I want to hear?

424
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,790
You probably don't want to hear it.

425
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,640
But I have to say it.

426
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,240
Yingzi...

427
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
If you want to reject me,

428
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,510
please wait until after the trip
before telling me.

429
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,110
I don't want to hear it now.

430
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,350
Well,

431
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,830
who of these do you think is Yifei?

432
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
They're all wearing masks.

433
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,590
I can't tell.

434
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,030
Indeed.

435
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,440
I guess

436
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,030
it's definitely not
one of the two on the left.

437
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,400
Neither is the one on the far right.

438
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,070
She's probably the one in the middle.

439
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,440
What do you think?

440
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,550
Yifei has just joined the dance troupe.

441
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,510
She's probably not the lead dancer.

442
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,400
That makes sense.

443
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,550
Guan Chao?

444
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,350
What do you think?

445
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,070
Yifei is definitely the prettiest one.

446
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,350
Of course.

447
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,680
It doesn't matter if Yifei is playing
the leading or supporting role,

448
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,000
she is surely the prettiest.

449
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,750
But if Yifei

450
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,350
really becomes a ballet dancer,

451
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,920
she must control her diet
very carefully.

452
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,070
Then she can't eat potato chips
anymore, right?

453
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,070
It's almost time.

454
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,400
Let's go in.

455
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,070
Yeah.

456
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,720
Let's go.

457
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,790
Hurry up!

458
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,790
Yifei is so beautiful.

459
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,000
She is dancing so well on stage.

460
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,270
How beautiful.

461
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,550
I'm going to see Yifei.

462
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,720
I'll go look for Yifei.

463
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,350
Yifei.

464
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,590
Yifei.

465
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,510
Yifei.

466
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,270
Sorry.

467
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,880
Have you seen Lan Yifei?

468
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
Lan Yifei?

469
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Who is that?

470
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,200
She's new to your dance troupe.

471
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
The one who just led the dance.

472
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,480
Excuse me,

473
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,270
there is no one named Lan Yifei
in our dance troupe.

474
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,350
Why are you all standing here

475
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,510
and staring at me?

476
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,960
Please help me look for Yifei.

477
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,310
Yingzi.

478
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,590
Yifei is...

479
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,310
What happened to her?

480
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,510
She... She's not here, actually.

481
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,550
Is she not here?

482
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,790
Where could she be?

483
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,510
Didn't we come here from Hangtian City

484
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,480
just to watch her performance?

485
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Why are you three
looking at me like that?

486
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,270
What does that mean?

487
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,720
Yingzi, listen to me.

488
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,750
I know it's difficult for you to accept

489
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,640
the truth in a short time.

490
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,830
What do I need to accept?

491
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,070
Yifei has

492
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,440
already

493
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,590
left us.

494
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,310
What are you talking about?

495
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,790
Didn't we just see

496
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,110
Yifei dancing on stage?

497
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,750
You've all seen it.

498
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,440
Yifei was dancing just now.

499
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,240
Guan Chao.

500
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,310
Didn't you

501
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,830
see Yifei on stage just now?

502
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,720
She was dancing so beautifully.

503
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,830
You saw it, didn't you?

504
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,000
Mingyu.

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,480
Did you see Yifei?

506
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,110
She was dancing on stage just now.

507
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,310
Zhuang Yuan.

508
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,590
Did you see Yifei?

509
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,790
You saw her, didn't you?

510
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,680
Yingzi.

511
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,270
I want to look for Yifei.

512
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,240
I must find Yifei.

513
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,550
Yingzi, don't be like this.

514
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,200
Why are you stopping me?

515
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,640
Yingzi.

516
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,440
What are you doing?

517
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
Let me go!

518
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,350
Huang Yingzi!

519
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,030
Yifei is dead!

520
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,960
She can never dance again.

521
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,510
It's just the five of us now.

522
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,790
Yingzi.

523
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,030
Go away. Go away!

524
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,440
I have to find Yifei.

525
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,270
I have to find Yifei.

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,270
I'm going to find Yifei.

527
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,510
I have to find Yifei.

528
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,110
Yifei.

529
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,310
Yifei.

530
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,880
Yifei.

531
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,240
Yifei.

532
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,920
Yifei.

533
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,440
(Yingzi.)

534
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,480
(I'm a little hungry.)

535
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,030
(I want some potato chips.)

536
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,750
Can you buy it for me?

537
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,880
(No problem.)

538
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,960
(I'll buy you potato chips.)

539
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,640
(Wait for me.)

540
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
(I will be right back.)

541
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,400
(Accompany me to see my mom.)

542
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,230
(I miss her.)

543
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,230
She missed me so much.

544
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,000
(Yingzi.)

545
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,320
She told me to dance well.

546
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,630
(Take good care of Yifei for me.)

547
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,070
(She'll see my performance
in the future.)

548
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,630
(I'm going to Beijing.)

549
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,880
(I will lead a new life,)

550
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,590
(and)

551
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,710
embrace my passion, which is dancing.

552
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Cheers!

553
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,590
You're a lightweight, stop drinking.

554
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,000
Your face is red already.

555
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,360
The NCEE is over just like that.

556
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,510
It feels so unreal
when I think about it.

557
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,400
The adults always said

558
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,670
that after the NCEE,

559
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,590
we can do whatever we want.

560
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,800
Now that it's really over,

561
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,230
my heart feels empty instead.

562
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
Didn't everyone say

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,840
that the summer after the NCEE

564
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,670
should be the happiest summer

565
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,000
in one's life?

566
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,110
Yes.

567
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,440
Now that the NCEE is over,

568
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,150
all the pressure from studying is gone.

569
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,030
What's left

570
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,150
is only the longing and yearning
for the future.

571
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,030
What do you want to do
this summer holiday?

572
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,230
Me!

573
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,230
I'm going to see
the Olympics in person!

574
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,670
I want to see Liu Xiang
win the gold medal!

575
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,590
Then I want to go to
the National Ballet of China,

576
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,320
stand on the stage of the Grand Theater,

577
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,880
and give my first official performance.

578
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,960
We will all go and support you, then.

579
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,510
Well, I will prepare
your favorite flowers

580
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,400
and the biggest flower basket.

581
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,960
I've thought about it too.

582
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,710
I'm going to learn to drive.

583
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,230
I want to get a driving license.

584
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,630
After that,

585
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm going to play badminton.

586
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,030
After preparing for the exams
these past few months,

587
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,000
I've really gained a lot of weight.

588
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,630
Of course, I need to manage
my physique.

589
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,360
I will report to the university
with a pretty body.

590
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,360
There's nothing in particular
that I want to do.

591
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm going to learn English.

592
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,550
As soon as the university starts,
I will pass the CET-4.

593
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,190
Boring.

594
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,960
Jiang Yi.

595
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,440
What about you?

596
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't have as big and lofty ideals
as you guys.

597
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,230
I'm a very simple guy.

598
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,360
First, I want to make a lot of money.

599
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,280
Secondly,

600
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,550
I just wish

601
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,960
someone could clear the game

602
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
that I created.

603
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,070
Soon.

604
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,510
How about you?

605
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,190
Me?

606
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,630
I hope we can have

607
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,670
a graduation trip.

608
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,400
Go to the beach for a barbecue.

609
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
Watching the sunrise on the mountain.

610
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Eating and having fun together.

611
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,190
Wait a second.

612
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,760
That's not right.

613
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,320
Let's say this beforehand,

614
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,070
I won't be staying
in the same room as you.

615
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,000
I... I think you've had
too much to drink.

616
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,230
What... What nonsense
are you talking about?

617
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,960
We... We ended up sharing a room then

618
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,230
because I didn't have
my ID card with me.

619
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,280
I was left with no choice.

620
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,510
Let me tell you.

621
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,550
When we were

622
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,230
in Jiangzhou,

623
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
we were staying in the same room.

624
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,150
You...

625
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,280
What's more,

626
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,920
she snored the whole time.

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,320
I almost didn't sleep all night.

628
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,480
Yingzi, you snore?

629
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
You were the one snoring.

630
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,670
You couldn't hear your own snore.

631
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,480
You were snoring.

632
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,280
Yingzi.

633
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,230
Don't you snore?

634
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,280
You were even grinding your teeth
and picking your feet.

635
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,920
Who... Who would pick their feet
while sleeping?

636
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,800
You two.

637
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,840
Every time you two quarrel,
you will hurt someone else.

638
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
Yingzi.

639
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,510
Stop throwing.

640
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,320
Stop it.

641
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,550
(Do not worry.)

642
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,630
I will definitely cure you.

643
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,070
Why are you here with me?

644
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,760
What are you doing?

645
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,920
Mr. Huang told us

646
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,710
that you wouldn't wake up.

647
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,670
We were worried

648
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,840
so we came to check on you.

649
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,760
How long have I slept?

650
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,230
Why am I so dizzy?

651
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,400
I feel so sore all over my body.

652
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,030
Well... Well, do you not

653
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,440
remember anything at all?

654
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,440
What do I not remember?

655
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,550
Yesterday,

656
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,920
you guys...

657
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,070
Yesterday, we...

658
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,960
What do you mean?

659
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,760
After getting the admission notice,

660
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,480
didn't the four of us
go out to have fun?

661
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,320
Our destination was Jiangzhou.

662
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,960
We went to see Yifei's performance.

663
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,590
What's next?

664
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,800
What's next?

665
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
Are you silly?

666
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,070
We took the train there.

667
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,880
Then you took my potato chips.

668
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,440
Then

669
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,920
we were at the entrance of the theater.

670
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,510
We looked at that poster.

671
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,840
Zhuang Yuan and I made a bet.

672
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,360
Zhuang Yuan lost in the end.

673
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,710
I got it right.

674
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
She was the most beautiful one
in the middle.

675
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,550
Then we went in to watch
Yifei's performance.

676
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,030
Yifei was so beautiful on stage.

677
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,960
She danced extremely well.

678
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,150
Guan Chao.

679
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,960
Guan Chao, you even cried watching it.

680
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,590
Later,

681
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,880
I went to look for Yifei.

682
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,840
We both chatted for a while.

683
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,030
And we came back after that.

684
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,150
I just went to bed then.

685
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,880
Well,

686
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,360
was it just the four of us?

687
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,670
Of course.

688
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,960
Who else was there

689
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,760
other than the four of us?

690
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,960
Yifei was performing on stage.

691
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,400
Jiang Yi is in the U.K.
and couldn't make it back.

692
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,880
Of course, it was just the four of us.

693
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,590
What's wrong with you all?

694
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,800
You're acting weird.

695
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,630
It's fine.

696
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,510
Well,

697
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,400
since you guys are here,

698
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,550
why don't I make a meal
for you all later?

699
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,110
Sure.

700
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,630
Discuss about it.

701
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,070
What do you guys want to eat?
