[Love Endures]

2
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,680
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,560
That guy

4
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,710
has gone beyond being a weirdo lately.

5
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,120
How so?

6
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,200
Like a sicko?

7
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,350
Not to that extent.

8
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,710
More like a wacko.

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,870
That sounds normal.

10
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,790
He pretended to agree to my interview,

11
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
and made me recite poetry

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,510
at the matchmaking corner

13
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,790
in front of the old folks.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,870
What poem did you recite?

15
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,400
Pushkin's poem.

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,200
Isn't that the poem you recited

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,680
at the poetry recitation competition
as a kid?

18
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,640
You remember it so well.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,510
Why?

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Do you adore me that much?

21
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,400
Yes.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,950
Of course I should.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
I have never seen someone

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,710
forget their lines even with the script.

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
Huang Yingzi.

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Huang Yingzi.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,360
"Before me like a vision fleeting,

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,080
a beauty's angle pure and clear,

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,680
my heart is beating in ecstasy.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,590
For it,

31
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,630
old joys anew revive.

32
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,150
God-filled,

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,590
inspired,

34
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,750
life,

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,470
tears,

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,430
and love."

37
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,630
I didn't forget my lines.

38
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,870
That was

39
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,360
an emotional pause.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
What are you up to lately?

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,430
If you have nothing to do,

42
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,680
come with me to find Lan Bin.

43
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,560
I don't mean to be negative.

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
But no matter how hard we try,

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,910
our efforts might end up in vain.

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,190
Whatever the outcome may be,

47
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,630
if I don't try my best,

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,310
I'll never be at ease.

49
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,430
Okay.

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,080
When?

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,190
These few days.

52
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,310
But before we go,

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,840
I have to drop by

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,470
that wacko's reading event first.

55
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,630
To go from one place to another,

56
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,560
there has been

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,630
four ways we can choose
since ancient times.

58
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,800
The first is obviously to walk there.

59
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,400
That includes crawling.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
The second is to swim there,

61
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,960
provided that you can swim.

62
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,000
The third is to fly there.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,710
Grab the swan's tightly by the neck

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
and clearly tell it

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,430
your destination.

66
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,960
The last method

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
is the most common.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,590
That is to roll there.

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,480
It's boring, isn't it?

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,390
Everyone is sleepy.

71
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,800
This book is
a little hard to understand.

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
To be frank,

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
we wish to hear you read your work.

74
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,360
That's right.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Read your book.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,390
I would feel sick reading my novel.

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Maybe tell us about your new work?

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm a Sagittarius.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
Sorry, that was a joke.

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,920
The truth is...

81
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,040
I haven't written a new novel
in a long time.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,310
If I may ask.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,630
Why haven't you?

84
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,430
Is it because there's no topic
you're interested in?

85
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,950
That's one of the reasons.

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,830
What are the other reasons?

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,360
Ma'am.

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,070
May I ask what you do for a living?

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm a journalist.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Why did you choose to work
as a journalist?

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,870
This is your reading event.

92
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,160
I think we should talk about you.

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
I'm interested in

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,190
getting to know

95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,160
why you chose to be
a journalist at my reading.

96
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,190
(In the town where I lived as a child,)

97
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,040
(there was an accident.)

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,720
My best friend's father

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,000
was deemed the culprit.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,510
From a skilled worker

101
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,600
with a guaranteed job,

102
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
he became a complete failure.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,070
He left his family in the end

104
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,360
and has never returned.

105
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,680
I want to find him for my friend.

106
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,040
I want to know the truth.

107
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,950
Perhaps my subconscious

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,390
influenced my choice of career.

109
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,630
Did you manage to find it?

110
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,830
The truth.

111
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,830
I'm still far from it.

112
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,870
But at the very least,

113
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,870
he has shown up.

114
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,240
If it's possible in the future,

115
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,630
keep a lookout for me.

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,720
Why should I help you look for him?

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,510
(You wrote seven articles)

118
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,920
(when you were in university.)

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,630
(Four of them)

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,070
(were about your best friend.)

121
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
That's why I think

122
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,160
you can

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
empathize with me in this matter.

124
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,120
Flying across the city.

125
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,680
Flying right above the protagonist

126
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,870
so that the protagonist sees them

127
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,720
and looks up to them.

128
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,390
It would definitely look impressive
to appear in the sky.

129
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,560
Got a minute?

130
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,800
Let's talk.

131
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,950
We'll get back first.

132
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,680
See you later.

133
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,630
Go ahead.

134
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,190
Sit.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
I come here to eat every week.

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,630
I always see you sitting there alone.

137
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,630
I know you saw me too.

138
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Why did you only approach me today?

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,390
I didn't feel like
talking to you before this.

140
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,160
But now I do.

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,750
Jiang Yi.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,160
I hope there can be
more honesty between us.

143
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,750
That's what I wanted to tell you.

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,270
Is that so?

145
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,830
Just come straight to me

146
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,270
if you have something to say
in the future.

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,160
You don't have to go through Chloe.

148
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,950
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

149
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,310
I'll be frank, then.

150
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,870
You have two options.

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,270
One,

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
maintain the status quo.

153
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,510
Get our respective jobs done.

154
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,920
I will do what I can to help you.

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,950
You can take all the credit.

156
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,550
Two,

157
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
you can be upset.

158
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,120
You can also threaten to resign.

159
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,480
But even if you quit,

160
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,550
I will lead the team

161
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,120
and complete the game at once.

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,270
It won't be hard at all.

163
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
Do you believe that?

164
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
Zhao Yuan.

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,550
I don't want to be enemies with you.

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
But I hope you understand

167
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,870
that I joined ATG

168
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,630
to accomplish something very important,

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
not to be considerate of your feelings.

170
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,510
Does it have to be this way?

171
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Gao has agreed

172
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,670
that as long as you use
this story concept

173
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,630
as the shell,

174
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,150
you can develop "Floating City".

175
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,720
Chloe, my decision remains the same.

176
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390
I don't want to put what's mine

177
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,790
in someone else's story.

178
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Instead of seeing it as
putting what's yours

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,670
in someone else's story,

180
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,270
why not think of it as
using the worldview of this novel

181
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,440
as a medium?

182
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,150
You can use your characters and story.

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,510
At the end of the day,
it will still be "Floating City".

184
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,390
It takes a lot of people cooperating

185
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,120
to make a game.

186
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,200
You can't render

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,789
every scene model by yourself.

188
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:03,789
But what if

189
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,270
I'm the only one who knows those scenes?

190
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,510
Then you must learn

191
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,440
to share your ideas with the team.

192
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
You can't

193
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,840
shoulder everything alone.

194
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,320
"Floating City" has been put on hold

195
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
for some time now.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,870
This is your fastest chance

197
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,720
to make your own game.

198
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,150
If you agree to do this,

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,870
I will deal with
the copyright issues now.

200
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay.

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,510
The company assigned

202
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,550
the annual performance tasks
so soon this year.

203
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,550
It's going to be hard
to find an excuse to not perform.

204
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,750
We can't run away from it.

205
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,240
Manager Wang even made it mandatory

206
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,670
for all new employees
to perform on stage.

207
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,120
We must even sing and dance.

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
The manager makes a casual remark,

209
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,240
but we're the ones who suffer.

210
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,480
Mingyu.

211
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,790
Do you want to try this?

212
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,840
It's quite tasty.

213
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,510
Mingyu.

214
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,750
I'd like to ask you for a bit of advice.

215
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,670
The annual party will be held soon.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,390
The company made it mandatory
for us to perform.

217
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,600
But I've never attended

218
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,120
any talent classes before.

219
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,870
I have no idea what to perform.

220
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,870
Don't feel pressured.

221
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,390
Get more people

222
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,840
to do one performance.

223
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,600
If you perform together,

224
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,550
you will be less awkward.

225
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,600
The thing is,

226
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
many of us never learned how to dance.

227
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
How do we come up with the dance?

228
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,390
There are many dance studios these days.

229
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,030
Sign up for a group class

230
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,720
and submit a claim
for team building expenses.

231
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
The company will reimburse you.

232
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,790
Really?

233
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,550
But we don't have the time to go.

234
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,630
It will be the New Year soon.

235
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,390
We are already swamped with work.

236
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,720
We have no free time.

237
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,270
Here's what.

238
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,150
I'll try

239
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,390
to work around your schedules

240
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,080
to free up some time
for you to rehearse.

241
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,550
It might not be long,

242
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,080
but it's still better than nothing.

243
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,600
Thank you, Mingyu.

244
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,240
Don't sweat it.

245
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,390
See you later.

246
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:01,960
Okay.

247
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,000
You frightened me, Chief Editor.

248
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,080
How is it going with Ding Ye?

249
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
Still not in the bag?

250
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,550
I've been shamelessly pestering him.

251
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,200
Even though he never agreed verbally,

252
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,840
he has been acting more cooperative.

253
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,750
If he can stand someone tenacious

254
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,080
like you,

255
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,550
he must be a tough one.

256
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
The process is hard,

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,390
but I'm sure

258
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,840
the outcome will be good.

259
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,960
It's almost the time
that you promised the director.

260
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm waiting to see you
make a remarkable turnaround.

261
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,960
You got this.

262
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,480
Our kid is sick.

263
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,150
Why can't you take care of it?

264
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,240
I wish to set aside my work too.

265
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,960
If I can do that,

266
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
I wouldn't have to beg you.

267
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,550
Yes. Hello.

268
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,150
The video for
the feature story has been edited.

269
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,670
Once it's been proofread,

270
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,510
I'll have them email it to you.

271
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,320
Alright.

272
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,960
Goodbye.

273
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,600
Yiran.

274
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,150
Have some water.

275
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
Why don't you apply for leave

276
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,960
with the director
to attend to family matters?

277
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,150
I'm used to it.

278
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,320
When I was a newbie at the company,

279
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
I was just like Song Ke.

280
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,200
I will do

281
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
whatever was assigned to me.

282
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,630
I will fight for tasks

283
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,630
that weren't assigned to me.

284
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,480
In this line of work,

285
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,910
you will be forgotten

286
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,030
if you don't have output.

287
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
After a long time,

288
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,550
I have forgotten

289
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,670
how to say no to work.

290
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
Let me help you

291
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,960
with the matchmaking agencies.

292
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,910
You'll help me?

293
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,000
Field visits.

294
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,550
Field research.

295
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,720
Character experience.

296
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,240
All these take time.

297
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,550
I can help you with these things
off the record.

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
You don't have to thank me.

299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,750
Didn't you let me have

300
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,750
the topic on Ding Ye?

301
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
Think of it as me repaying you.

302
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,870
Yingzi.

303
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,720
Why do you always

304
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,870
like to do thankless jobs?

305
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,600
No one sees your contribution.

306
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,840
Are you happy

307
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,270
forever being invisible?

308
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,670
It has always been my dream
to be a journalist.

309
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,360
So all these don't matter to me.

310
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Never forget why you started.

311
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,240
Then you won't be knocked down easily.

312
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
You got this, Yiran.

313
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Marriage

314
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,840
is a form of cooperation.

315
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,870
You won't get married
if you don't have someone you like?

316
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,080
Miss Huang,

317
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,550
that's such an absurd opinion.

318
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,480
Listen.

319
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,000
Passing on marriage

320
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,550
is like breaking a good hand.

321
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,270
Let me see.

322
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,840
This year,

323
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,670
you will be turning 30.

324
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,080
That's right.

325
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,390
Your annual salary
is less than $200,000.

326
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,670
Non-local household registration.

327
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,390
No property. No car.

328
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,670
Good.

329
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,510
You have no loan records.

330
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,720
You have a good credit score.

331
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
In my opinion,

332
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,200
your level of attraction
is within the range

333
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,030
of C plus.

334
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,360
However,

335
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,480
you do have a bonus point.

336
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
Do I?

337
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Then

338
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,870
what bonus points do I have?

339
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,270
For example,

340
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,390
you have no criminal records.

341
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,510
In that case,

342
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,750
do you think there's hope for me?

343
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,480
Of course.

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Just trust me.

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,630
I can certainly find you a good man

346
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,240
who has a house,

347
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,790
a car,

348
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,510
and an annual salary of more than

349
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,720
$300,000.

350
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,150
I'm counting on you.

351
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,510
Consider it done.

352
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,630
Please accept my toast.

353
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,630
That's more like it.

354
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,200
This is the condition you should have.

355
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,150
Do you remember
why I love rock climbing?

356
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,720
You said you were from
an ordinary family.

357
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,550
If you want to be successful
in this society,

358
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,790
you have to climb up.

359
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,720
That's right.

360
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,270
But there is another reason.

361
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,870
Rock climbing

362
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,670
is going against your gravity.

363
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,200
The heavier your burden,

364
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,600
the harder it is to go up.

365
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,790
Sometimes, these burdens

366
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
are mental burdens.

367
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,360
So whenever I come
rock climbing with you,

368
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,400
I know if there is something
weighing on you.

369
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,070
Are you really that good?

370
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,640
Tell me about it.

371
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,750
I can break it down for you.

372
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Yue Tong.

373
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,000
That new colleague
who gave me chocolate.

374
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,310
I know.

375
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,680
The new staff from the project team.

376
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,270
What about her?

377
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,240
She might be pregnant.

378
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,960
Mingyu.

379
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Thank you for helping us

380
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,790
with the annual party.

381
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
Otherwise, we wouldn't know what to do.

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
There's a first time for everything.

383
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,510
There's nothing unusual
about being pregnant.

384
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,070
Didn't she just join the company?

385
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,880
I checked the date.

386
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,720
She might have been pregnant
before joining the company.

387
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
But she didn't mention it
during her interview.

388
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,000
That means she got the job
while hiding her pregnancy.

389
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
What do you plan to do?

390
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
I haven't decided.

391
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:24,959
Mingyu.

392
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,239
I think you should tell the company.

393
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,000
If the company discovers
that she's pregnant in the future,

394
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,790
you will be held accountable as HR.

395
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,109
Mingyu.

396
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,589
Whether it's Yue Tong,

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,960
the nerd who gave you a present,

398
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,550
or even your group of six.

399
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,069
These are all burdens to you.

400
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,720
If you want to climb up,

401
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,550
you have to let go of your burdens.

402
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,030
(Mingyu.)

403
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,110
(If the company discovers
that she's pregnant in the future,)

404
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,790
(you will be held accountable as HR.)

405
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,590
(Perhaps it's mainly because
people don't know you well.)

406
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,070
But you're someone
who people can be friends with.

407
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,550
If you can make friends,

408
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,270
you will feel happier at work.

409
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Yue Tong.

410
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,070
Mingyu.

411
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's talk.

412
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,510
Yue Tong.

413
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,070
Be honest with me.

414
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,270
At the time of your interview...

415
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,110
Did you know you were pregnant?

416
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,030
I didn't.

417
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,550
There's no explicit rule

418
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,880
that the company will dismiss you

419
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,030
for being pregnant,

420
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,830
but you are still under probation.

421
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,790
Deliberately hiding your pregnancy

422
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,350
will certainly affect the company's

423
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,070
evaluation of you.

424
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,920
I want to hear the truth.

425
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,270
Mingyu.

426
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,790
I'll be honest.

427
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,830
I really need this job.

428
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,310
My husband was laid off six months ago.

429
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,350
Both our families aren't well off,

430
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,680
so they can't help much.

431
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,400
So I had no one to count on but myself.

432
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,350
You know

433
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,030
how hard it is
for us women in the workplace.

434
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,480
I would always get asked
at every interview.

435
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,030
"Do you have plans to get married?"

436
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,920
"Do you have plans to have kids?"

437
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,400
If you were in my place,

438
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,960
would you be able to be honest?

439
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,790
The company has its concerns.

440
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,720
I know that.

441
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,030
I get it.

442
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,440
But who has ever considered

443
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,750
my concerns?

444
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,110
I had my last job

445
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,680
for four whole years.

446
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,480
I never had a child

447
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,270
for the sake of not affecting my job.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,960
The company shut down all of a sudden.

449
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,920
They promised us severance pay,

450
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,480
but I have yet to receive it.

451
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm not trying to cheat
maternity leave or subsidies.

452
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,480
All I want is a job.

453
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,240
I need an income

454
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,640
to help us get by in this city.

455
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,640
I promise you.

456
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,960
My pregnancy won't affect my job.

457
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,790
Alright.

458
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,310
That's enough.

459
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,240
Zhuang Yuan.

460
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,550
Cheng Jia.

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,790
My term paper has finally been approved.

462
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,110
Thank you for your help.

463
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,590
I bought you coffee.

464
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank.

465
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,830
Yours has been approved.

466
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm still struggling with mine.

467
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,350
Your brain must be overloaded

468
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,720
deciding on a topic lately.

469
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,400
Tell me about it.

470
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,920
Speaking of which,

471
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,030
there's something that I find strange.

472
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,750
The database
of your dissertation proposal.

473
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,720
Did you do it yourself?

474
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,160
Yes, I did it.

475
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,960
The department asked me
to review some theses last week.

476
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,720
I happened to come across
the data you submitted.

477
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,920
It was completely different from

478
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,270
the first draft that I saw.

479
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,440
Based on my understanding of you,

480
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,350
that's not a mistake you would make.

481
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
If it wasn't

482
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,680
an amendment you made,

483
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,440
then someone must have

484
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,110
replaced your database.

485
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,160
Here.

486
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,590
You can't stop
when you drink with pork jerky.

487
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,790
Come up. Drink up.

488
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Cheers.

489
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,030
You're back.

490
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,790
Want some?

491
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,920
Tianlin got an admission
to continue his studies here.

492
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,880
Let's celebrate together.

493
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,510
He's treating us to hotpot tonight.

494
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,960
Would you like to join us?

495
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,680
I'll pass.

496
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
I need to work on my thesis.

497
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,750
Yours hasn't been approved?

498
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,480
Look at Tianlin.

499
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,350
He's the winner in life.

500
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,590
His topic was approved without issues.

501
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,270
He even got an admission
to continue his studies here.

502
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,030
Every day, we work so hard on our thesis

503
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,830
to get our degree.

504
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,750
But after graduation,

505
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,160
the job market might not
necessarily welcome us.

506
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
Don't be silly.

507
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,960
We have worked hard for years.

508
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm sure we will get the fruit
of our hard work.

509
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,240
I have a good news and a bad news.

510
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,110
Which one first?

511
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,830
The good one.

512
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,270
Mr. Gao has approved

513
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,310
the proposal for "The Maze".

514
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,310
He even personally
emailed the publisher.

515
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,550
I must thank you
for your suggestion, then.

516
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,030
How about repaying me

517
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,200
with dinner tonight?

518
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,240
Sorry, I have an appointment.

519
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,480
Why is it always the case

520
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,680
whenever I ask you out?

521
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,070
Is this some kind of
disguised rejection?

522
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,960
Are you meeting Huang Yingzi?

523
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,680
I went abroad at a very young age.

524
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,310
So I don't know much

525
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,000
about the relationship
between childhood friends.

526
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,310
Must you always hang out together
to be considered childhood friends?

527
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,270
We're sort of different compared to

528
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,270
ordinary childhood friends.

529
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,030
How so?

530
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,830
In short, there are certain things
that we must face together.

531
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,310
It's nothing.

532
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,920
Tell me about the bad news.

533
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,270
About the adaptation of Ding Ye's novel,

534
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,590
we're facing some hiccups.

535
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,830
Mr. Gao thinks highly of this project.

536
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,440
But the publisher replied

537
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,480
that we can only
buy the adaptation rights

538
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,070
with Ding Ye's consent.

539
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,440
I have asked the publisher
to reach out to him.

540
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,110
But he turned us down straight away.

541
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll see what I can do.

542
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,030
You have a way to get in touch with him?

543
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't tell me it's Huang Yingzi again.

544
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,510
She has indeed been

545
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,110
working on an interview
with Ding Ye lately.

546
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,070
If you can get in touch
with him personally,

547
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,550
that's obviously good news.

548
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,030
But

549
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,830
does that mean you two have

550
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,030
one more thing to face together now?

551
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,030
Hello.

552
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,590
Hello. Do you want
a hair wash or haircut?

553
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,480
I just want to ask

554
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,030
if you have seen

555
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,920
this person at your shop?

556
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,590
It does ring a bell.

557
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,720
Really?

558
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,590
Where did you see him?

559
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,400
Have a seat first.

560
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,550
I'll get my mother.

561
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,200
Thank you.

562
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,310
Jiang Yi.

563
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,310
Where are you?

564
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,030
I'm at a hair salon in Fuyou Lane.

565
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,480
I'll go to you.

566
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
Okay. You can come now.

567
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,110
Yingzi.

568
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
My mom said

569
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,070
that she

570
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,030
must give your hair
a good treatment today.

571
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,070
Yingzi.

572
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,510
Although you have healthy hair,

573
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,000
you must still have a hair care routine.

574
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,110
Madam Wan.

575
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,070
I'm busy with my studies.

576
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,510
I don't have the time for hair care.

577
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,350
You're just lazy.

578
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,790
Don't worry.

579
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,680
Just use the conditioner I give you.

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,830
Use it often.

581
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
By the way, Madam Wan.

582
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,400
We ran into someone not long ago.

583
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,590
He said he worked at
the same workshop as Mr. Lan back then.

584
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,920
Who is he?

585
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
Mr. Jia from the engineering department.

586
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,400
Do you know him?

587
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
It's been so long ago.

588
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't exactly remember.

589
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,440
He does sound familiar.

590
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,750
Mr. Jia said

591
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,310
he looked into the details
of the entire factory.

592
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,240
The explosion back then

593
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,200
was not only due to
equipment degradation,

594
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,880
but more so it was human-induced.

595
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,750
My father was on duty that night.

596
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,270
He was just looking for a place
to take a nap.

597
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,750
He never went into the boiler room.

598
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,790
That's why it couldn't have been him.

599
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,750
If that's the case,

600
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,310
that means Mr. Lan

601
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,920
have been wrongfully blamed
all these years.

602
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,000
He has been gone for three years.

603
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,680
So what if we manage to find the truth?

604
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,270
Mom.

605
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,830
If we can find the truth

606
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,200
and vindicate Dad,

607
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
perhaps...

608
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,200
Perhaps he can come back.

609
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,270
Don't bother.

610
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
Even if he comes back,

611
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,440
I don't want to see him again.

612
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,400
Hello. Would you like
a hair wash or a perm?

613
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
We can do it right away.

614
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,880
Who is Wan Fang?

615
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,000
I am.

616
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,240
What's the matter?

617
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,680
So you're the one my husband
has been messaging every day.

618
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,790
Do you have no shame?

619
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,480
Your husband left.

620
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,270
So you go around
seducing someone else's husband.

621
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,750
Don't be rude.

622
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,830
Let's calm down for a minute.

623
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,750
Who is your husband?

624
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,590
Wang Yongxiang from the second factory.

625
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,590
He hides in the toilet every day

626
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,590
to send you messages.

627
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,880
Don't think I have no idea.

628
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,880
I don't know anyone
named Wang Yongxiang.

629
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,160
Stop playing dumb.

630
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,000
I've checked his phone.

631
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,510
Ma'am, could you be mistaken?

632
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,110
There are many people called Wan Fang.

633
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,640
If I did seduce your husband,

634
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
wouldn't I ask him to save my number

635
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,880
under a different name?

636
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
The name of my salon is "Fang Fang".

637
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,790
Would I be dumb enough

638
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,750
to let you find me easily?

639
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,000
Fine.

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
I hope it's not you.

641
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,200
Otherwise,
I won't let you get away with it.

642
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Have a nice day.

643
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,110
Mom, what's going on?

644
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,590
She's crazy.

645
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,310
She came looking for the wrong person.

646
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,160
Yingzi.

647
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
You two must be hungry.

648
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,400
Go to the shop to have some wontons.

649
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,510
Mom, tell me...

650
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,310
Go now.

651
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,440
Let's go.

652
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,350
Goodbye, Madam Wan.

653
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,270
Yifei, stop thinking about it.

654
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,160
Madam Wan explained earlier.

655
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,200
Whatever the lady said...

656
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,160
It's definitely not true.

657
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,400
That's right. I'm sure it isn't true.

658
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,880
I'm sure Madam Wan

659
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,400
missing Mr. Lan more than anyone else.

660
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,920
She just doesn't admit it.

661
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,510
She's just stubborn.

662
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,880
She and my dad

663
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,270
were together since she was 20.

664
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,830
They were very loving.

665
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,640
Many times,

666
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
I saw her hiding

667
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,030
in her room by herself,

668
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,590
looking at my dad's photo in tears.

669
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,030
Exactly.

670
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,160
So stop thinking about what

671
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,350
that lady said.

672
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,920
She didn't look like a nice lady.

673
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,030
I'm sure she came to
mess with you on purpose.

674
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,000
Anyway, our family

675
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
has suffered enough criticism and rumors

676
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,310
over the years.

677
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,240
It's okay.

678
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,240
As long as I trust my mom,
that's enough.

679
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,160
Young lady, did you ask for me?

680
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,880
What's the matter?

681
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,640
Yes, I did.

682
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,030
I'd like to ask you.

683
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,680
Have you seen this man?

684
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,550
Well...

685
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,790
It feels like I have.

686
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,160
But it also feels like I haven't.

687
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,350
I seriously don't remember.

688
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,830
How did it go? Did you get anything?

689
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,110
I'm in the middle of it.

690
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,400
How about this, ma'am?

691
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,640
Perhaps

692
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,240
I could leave this poster

693
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,640
at your shop

694
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,920
and you can keep a lookout for me.

695
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,480
I can't do that.

696
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,350
He looks like a wanted criminal.

697
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,480
If you leave it here,

698
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,590
it would affect my business.
Don't you think?

699
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,070
I understand.

700
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,750
I think this lady is right.

701
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
You're asking for her,

702
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,000
but you're not spending a dime.

703
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,070
How can you expect her to help you?

704
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,350
I say

705
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,720
you should get a perm.

706
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,510
A perm?

707
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
I don't think so.

708
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,480
Didn't you say that you're balding

709
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,680
because you're so tired from work?

710
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,790
I think that hairstyle suits you.

711
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,590
It will add volume to your hair.

712
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,550
You're the one balding.

713
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,480
Young lady.

714
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,550
You do seem to have thin hair.

715
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,350
Your hairline is receding.

716
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,110
Your parting is also getting wider.

717
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,070
Alright.

718
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,750
Just sit tight

719
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,350
and enjoy.

720
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,960
Ma'am.

721
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,920
We are giving you business.

722
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,110
Do you think

723
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,350
you can help us out?

724
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Sure, of course.

725
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,680
You are my customer now.

726
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,270
I'll definitely do you this favor.

727
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,720
Do you think she looks better

728
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,510
with big curls or small curls?

729
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,880
Any size is fine.

730
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,960
Ma'am.

731
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,720
What kind of hairstyle suits him?

732
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,960
Give him a perm too.

733
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,680
It's okay. I'm good.

734
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,000
Aren't we friends?

735
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,350
Shouldn't we be in this together?

736
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,110
My treat.

737
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,110
Ma'am, go for it.

738
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,750
That's right.

739
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,200
Come.

740
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
Let me give you a perm.

741
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,590
Come on. You will like it.

742
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,550
I really don't need it.

743
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:14,960
Try it.

744
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,830
I spent all morning styling my hair.

745
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,640
I guarantee you'll like it.

746
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,110
Just give it a try.

747
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,510
That's enough. Stop hiding.

748
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,510
Fei Yuching.

749
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,160
I'd say the same to you.

750
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
Dick and Cowboy.

751
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,510
Were you taking a picture of me?

752
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,350
Delete it.

753
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,590
You delete it first.

754
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm not deleting it.

755
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Fine. I won't delete it either.

756
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Fine.

757
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,110
Since we already got a perm,

758
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,240
how about...

759
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,440
A picture together?

760
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,310
Okay, then.

761
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,880
Let's do it.

762
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,160
Come closer.

763
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,350
Don't forget to send it to me later.

764
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,550
Got it.

765
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,440
One, two, three.

766
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,510
Mingyu.

767
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,590
Yue Tong.

768
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Get some loose-fitting clothes.

769
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,750
That will hide your bump
for another month or so.

770
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,110
If you discover your pregnancy then,

771
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,350
it will be considered
after you are onboard.

772
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,200
That's not withholding information.

773
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,070
Thank you.

774
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
I have asked your colleagues
in your department.

775
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,550
All of them recognize

776
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,510
your competence.

777
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,630
I don't want the company
to lose a good employee.

778
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,320
Mingyu.

779
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,360
You are HR.

780
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
But you're also a kind person.

781
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,360
HR

782
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,550
can be bad too.

783
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,000
See you.

784
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,150
Anyway,

785
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,190
at least we didn't come in vain.

786
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,480
We did get something out of it.

787
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,150
It must have exhausting lately.

788
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,920
It has.

789
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,320
I have to look for Mr. Lan

790
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,550
and interview Ding Ye.

791
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,150
How did the reading go?

792
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,440
There is

793
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,150
only one word to describe Ding Ye.

794
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,840
That is "weird".

795
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,360
Got it.

796
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,590
Thought of dealing with a freak like him

797
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
is making me exhausted.

798
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,440
What do you mean?

799
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,320
You have to deal with Ding Ye?

800
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,840
Tell me about it.

801
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,960
My company is interested in buying

802
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,110
the rights to his novel.

803
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,000
We even made a high offer,

804
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,320
but he gave a flat no.

805
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,510
Seriously?

806
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
Which novel is it?

807
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,510
Wait. Let me guess.

808
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
Is it "The Maze"?

809
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,000
I knew it.

810
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,150
It's definitely "The Maze".

811
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,880
Your company has good taste.

812
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,590
"The Maze" is about an old person

813
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,590
traveling across multiple universes.

814
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,920
If it's made into a game,

815
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,480
that would be awesome.

816
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
If he says yes,

817
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
does that mean you will be

818
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,030
the developer of this game?

819
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,670
Maybe.

820
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,000
But to be frank,
I haven't figured it out.

821
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,230
Novels and games

822
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,550
are two completely different concepts.

823
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,230
Is this very important to you?

824
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,670
The company said
I can only develop my own game

825
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,670
if I get the adaptation rights.

826
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,800
Got it.

827
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,670
Sir, turn around.

828
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,480
We're going somewhere else.

829
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,030
Where to?

830
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
I can't help you with other things.

831
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,030
But looking for Ding Ye

832
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,440
is something I can do for you.

833
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,670
Let's go.

834
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,030
Are you sure Ding Ye
will come to this place?

835
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,440
Look at your two o'clock.

836
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,840
That's on your right, man.

837
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,190
Do you see Ding Ye?

838
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
He has been acting very strange lately.

839
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,030
He's either playing chess with old men

840
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,280
or reading poetry
at the park's matchmaking corner.

841
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,280
As if he's completing
some sort of mission.

842
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,590
How did you know he'd be here?

843
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm a journalist.

844
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,550
It isn't hard for me to find someone.

845
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,230
Waiter!

846
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,030
Coming!

847
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,840
Yes, you.

848
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,400
Come here.

849
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,590
You do quite a wide range of work.

850
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,320
Just like your hair.

851
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,000
It's pretty wide.

852
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,150
I'm at work now.

853
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,960
I won't accept any interview.

854
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,550
You got it wrong.

855
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,550
I'm not here to interview you.

856
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,710
This is my friend.

857
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,760
You've met him before.

858
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,150
He's looking for you.

859
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,190
Yes.

860
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,360
I didn't get to
introduce myself last time.

861
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,030
Jiang Yi.

862
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,030
What would you like to order?

863
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,230
Ding Ye.

864
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,070
If you have some time,

865
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,630
why don't you
have a chat with my friend?

866
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,400
He is a designer

867
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,030
at a gaming company.

868
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,230
The company wants to buy
the adaptation rights

869
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,760
to your novel.

870
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,230
Our signature dish
is the Mouth-Watering Fish.

871
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,960
Lots of people order it.

872
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,190
Then we'll take one of each dish,

873
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,230
except Mouth-Watering Fish.

874
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,000
We'll have Mouth-Watering Fish.
Slight spicy.

875
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,880
For two?

876
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,880
Please wait a moment.

877
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,110
Chef, try it.

878
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,590
How is it?

879
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,760
A score of five.

880
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,400
A perfect score?

881
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
Five out of 100.

882
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,070
Listen.

883
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,480
Skills like that

884
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,590
take more than a week or two to master.

885
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,840
I started at 15.

886
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,550
I had to cook this dish
over 30 times a day.

887
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
Do the math.

888
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,030
How many fishes
have I cooked since then?

889
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,630
30 times 365.

890
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,400
That's 10,950.

891
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,480
How old are you, chef?

892
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,800
Are you a blockhead or what?

893
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,760
Are you seriously calculating?

894
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,320
What I'm trying to say

895
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,190
is that this skill is hard to learn.

896
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,880
No matter how hard it is,
I will keep learning

897
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,400
until I can do it.

898
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,630
I can tell that you

899
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,000
are not from this line of work.

900
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,440
Why must you learn to make
Mouth-Watering Fish?

901
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,630
Are you planning to open a restaurant?

902
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,190
You promised me

903
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,030
that you would teach me
the most authentic Mouth-Watering Fish.

904
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,960
You must keep your word.

905
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,280
You're unbelievable.

906
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,000
Listen.

907
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,150
When he comes later,

908
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,590
talk to him nicely.

909
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,320
He might be interested.

910
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,920
Let's forget about it.

911
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,070
Didn't we make a bet?

912
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,190
Don't you want to win?

913
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,840
If I win,

914
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,880
you'll lose.

915
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,320
Still, I'd be happy to lose.

916
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,070
Our specialty. Mouth-Watering Fish.

917
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,760
Thank you.

918
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,320
Ding Ye, don't be eager
to turn him down just yet.

919
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,800
Maybe his idea for the game

920
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,280
goes well with your novel.

921
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,190
I'm not interested in games.

922
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,320
Then instead,

923
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,550
let's talk about your novel.

924
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,630
Sure. What do you have to say?

925
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,070
Many people don't understand "The Maze"

926
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,440
because of its confusing connection
between universes,

927
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,880
and going back and forth in time.

928
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,590
Under this near-neurotic

929
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,550
worldview,

930
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,030
it's actually

931
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,150
a story about searching for a friend.

932
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,150
Am I right?

933
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
You did your homework.

934
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,800
Unfortunately,

935
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,550
it's too tacky.

936
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,710
Whatever game you're trying to make,

937
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,510
it's still a business.

938
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,510
Just like cooking a fish.

939
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,110
Some people pretend the basa is a sole.

940
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,280
Even in disguise under someone's name,

941
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,190
a schlock is always a schlock.

942
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,840
Who made it a fact
that the basa is a schlock,

943
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,230
while the sole isn't?

944
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,960
Why must they be categorized?

945
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,190
Isn't that a business mindset?

946
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,400
It doesn't matter what mindset it is.

947
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,070
My work

948
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,880
must be presented the way
I want it to be.

949
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,070
If you try to force something

950
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,000
in another thing,

951
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,840
the taste will force.

952
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,070
It will even taste worse.

953
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,280
What's wrong with pretending?

954
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,440
Look at this restaurant.

955
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,360
It has clearly lasted

956
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,800
a hundred years
by relying on their skills.

957
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,670
But now,

958
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,150
they have to rely on these

959
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,030
out-of-place gimmicks.

960
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,070
Aren't they pretending too?

961
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,800
Waiter.

962
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Can you prepare the noodles?

963
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,150
Well...

964
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,630
It's fine.

965
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,710
It's okay if you can't toss noodles.

966
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,360
You're here pretending
to be a waiter anyway.

967
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,320
Coming.

968
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,070
What are you doing?

969
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
What on earth are you doing?

970
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,590
What did I tell you?

971
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,960
Talk to him nicely.

972
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,670
We came to ask him to work with you.

973
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,150
Why did you attack him?

974
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,630
I just couldn't stand him

975
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,480
being on his high horse.

976
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,440
Those noodles
could be cooked in the water.

977
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,760
Why must it be tossed?

978
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,000
Besides, it's all business.

979
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,320
No one's a schlock.

980
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,480
He doesn't get it,

981
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
but still wants to be stubborn.

982
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,400
Who's the one being fake here?

983
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,510
Zip it.

984
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,670
I'm sorry.

985
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,280
What's wrong with you?

986
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,070
I'm sorry.

987
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,280
Do you know how to do it?

988
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,280
Go get your manager.

989
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
What kind of service is this?

990
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,590
Ding Ye.

991
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,590
Are you serious about training?

992
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,760
How dare you toss noodles

993
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,030
for the customers
before getting it right?

994
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,030
I'm sorry, sir.

995
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,550
I didn't think
it would be so complicated.

996
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,840
I don't want to hear that.

997
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,190
Tell me.

998
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,440
How many complaints have I gotten

999
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,150
ever since you came?

1000
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,110
How many bills have I waived?

1001
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,800
You can deduct my salary.

1002
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,440
As if it's enough?

1003
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,880
Here's what.

1004
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,110
From tomorrow onwards,

1005
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,280
you can stop coming to work. Okay?

1006
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,440
No, sir.

1007
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,480
Give me another chance.

1008
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,880
Then who's going

1009
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,920
to give me a chance?

1010
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,510
Please leave. I beg you.

1011
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,070
Okay?

1012
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,670
If you don't leave,

1013
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,670
I'll lose my job too.

1014
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,710
Ding Ye.

1015
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,840
Are you okay?

1016
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,400
I got fired.

1017
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,150
What do you think?

1018
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,150
I'm sorry.

1019
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,150
Do you know how much effort it took

1020
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,320
for me to stay?

1021
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,070
I can tell.

1022
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,590
You did learn a handful of things.

1023
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,030
Besides tossing noodles,

1024
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,510
you've also learned to quit.

1025
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,760
I still want

1026
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,190
to sincerely apologize to you.

1027
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,920
I honestly

1028
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,070
didn't come here
to force you to accept my interview.

1029
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,110
I just wanted to bring my friend.

1030
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
If you're interested,

1031
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,510
you might be able to help him.

1032
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,800
But I never thought

1033
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,320
it would cause you so much trouble.

1034
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,630
If I have hurt you

1035
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,280
with my actions,

1036
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,550
I'll stop pestering you from now on.

1037
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,670
You'll give up on the interview?

1038
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,230
I shouldn't have shamelessly

1039
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,400
asked you one request after another.

1040
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,840
I have made up my mind on the way here.

1041
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,360
If you're willing to help my friend,

1042
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,280
I will give up on the interview.

1043
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,000
Deal.

1044
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I'll sell him the rights.

1045
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,550
He can set the price.

1046
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,230
But no more interviews.

1047
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:52,880
Wait a minute.

1048
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
What are you talking about?
