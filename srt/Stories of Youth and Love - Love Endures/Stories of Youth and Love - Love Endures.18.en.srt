[Episode 18]

3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,280
Jiang Yi.

4
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,400
What's wrong with you, Jiang Yi?

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
What did I do to upset you?

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,150
Why did you run away when you see me?

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,680
Say something, Jiang Yi.

8
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,760
Jiang Yi.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
What's the matter?

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,590
I have no idea either.

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,760
Mr. Jiang, Madam Wang.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll get going now.

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,230
Take care.

14
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
What's it, Jiang?

15
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,470
Zhuang Yuan.

16
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,470
How do you solve
the third question from the last

17
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,840
of the NCEE Mock Test,

18
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,590
Mathematics paper?

19
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,470
Help me with it.

20
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,800
Hold on.

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are you screaming?

22
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,310
I'm not dreaming.

23
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,870
Jiang.

24
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,630
Are you in your right mind?

25
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,710
Hurry up.

26
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,190
Cut to the chase.

27
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm waiting.

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Hurry up.

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Which question?

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Listen.

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,710
Translate the graph of
the function Y equals 4X plus 3

32
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,520
by the vector A to obtain Y equals 4X.

33
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,520
Silicon is a non-metallic element,

34
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,360
primarily existing in
the form of silicon dioxide

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,560
and silicates.

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Silicon dioxide is
the most important compound of silicon.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Naturally occurring silicon dioxide
is also known as silica.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Silicon dioxide that is extremely pure

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
is commonly known as quartz.

40
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm full.

41
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,680
I'm going to school.

42
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,750
Ren Kaiji.

43
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,360
Guo Yude.

44
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Jiang Yi.

45
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,950
I can share

46
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,040
his score with you.

47
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,750
Jiang Yi.

48
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,870
102.

49
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,680
Where are you going?

50
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,000
Restroom.

51
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm such a genius!

52
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,360
I obtained a score of 102!

53
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,430
Huang Yingzi!

54
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,430
I'm a genius!

55
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,830
- Good morning.
- Morning.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,120
Thank you.

57
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,160
Why are you up this early?

58
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,510
Aren't you here for the sunrise?

59
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,240
I don't want you to miss it.

60
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,270
You didn't sleep at all, did you?

61
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,950
I have a question.

62
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,240
What is it?

63
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
You did so many things.

64
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,390
For example, you played chess.

65
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,190
You learnt the recipe
for Mouth-watering Fish.

66
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,600
You took a ride on a roller coaster.

67
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,190
You don't seem

68
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,040
to be interested in these.

69
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
Why did you do these activities?

70
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,270
What if I tell you
that these aren't my wishes?

71
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Those aren't your wishes?

72
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,720
Why did you include those wishes

73
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,510
in your dying wish list, then?

74
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,680
Earlier, you inquired about
the release date of my upcoming book.

75
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,600
Actually, I've been writing it
since a long time ago.

76
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,440
I started writing it a decade ago.

77
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,910
However, throughout the years,

78
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,360
I couldn't write a single word.

79
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,000
To me,

80
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,720
you have written the best book.

81
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,790
I was a weird kid.

82
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,630
I was always alone,

83
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,840
and I didn't like to play with others.

84
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,510
So I locked myself up in the room

85
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,630
and wrote things on my own.

86
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,670
Then, I realised

87
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,200
that good things

88
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
are meant to be shared with friends.

89
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
That's why I'm really envious of you.

90
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,120
You have your friends in Hangtian City.

91
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Now,

92
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,270
I became your friend too.

93
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,320
But the person I envy the most

94
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,240
is Jiang Yi.

95
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,150
That's quite a punch.

96
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,720
Thank you.

97
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,670
Why are you thanking me?

98
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,320
I could fulfill all the wishes

99
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,670
because I met you.

100
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,080
Hurry up and look.

101
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
The sun emerged on the horizon.

102
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
It's really mesmerising.

103
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
What a breathtaking sunrise!

104
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,790
Jiang.

105
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,790
Well, well.

106
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,150
Enough.

107
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,840
Stop sighing already.

108
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm just feeling upset
that you didn't fight for it.

109
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,670
Let's not start a dispute.

110
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,440
You're no better than me.

111
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,550
By the way,

112
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,510
for your information,

113
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,750
I won't be at home today.

114
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,630
I need to attend an interview
at Mingyu's company.

115
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,840
Really?

116
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,480
I have a different research topic
in mind

117
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
compared to what my supervisor suggests.

118
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,960
So he shuts down my research lab.

119
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,200
Coincidentally,

120
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,790
Mingyu's company is
offering a related project.

121
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,910
So I want to try my luck out.

122
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,670
Is Mingyu aware of this?

123
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,390
No.

124
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,960
I don't want to put her
in a difficult position.

125
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,080
All the best.

126
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,910
Okay.

127
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm home.

128
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,750
You should hurry and go home now.

129
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,390
Goodbye.

130
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm leaving.

131
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,390
(The number
you have dialed is unavailable.)

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,510
(Please try again later.)

133
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,150
(Sorry.)

134
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
I've read through

135
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,120
the agreement.

136
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Jiang Yi hasn't come back
to work, has he?

137
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,720
That's right.

138
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,670
Did he apply for leaves?

139
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm not sure about that.

140
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,120
Thank you.

141
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,630
Sure.

142
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,030
Huang Yingzi.

143
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,720
Are you also unable to locate Jiang Yi?

144
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,840
Yes.

145
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,630
Is he absent at work today?

146
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,150
We have a project meeting
for "The Maze" today.

147
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,270
He needs to be there.

148
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,000
However, he's still not showing up.

149
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,480
This situation

150
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
isn't favourable to him.

151
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,390
I understand.

152
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,750
I'll look for him.

153
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,790
Huang Yingzi.

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,510
About what you
witnessed at the company.

155
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,480
Actually...

156
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,870
He has explained everything to me.

157
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,320
It's all right now.

158
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,600
How is it?

159
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,320
The data you collected for the thesis

160
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,150
aren't suitable.

161
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
I still need to do some research.

162
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Okay, let's do more researches.

163
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,840
Zhuang Yuan.

164
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,030
I need to go.

165
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,670
Stop.

166
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,720
Come here.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,390
Ma'am.

168
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,630
What do you want?

169
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm so done with you.

170
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,960
(Hello.)

171
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,750
(The number
you have dialed is unavailable.)

172
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,390
Look.

173
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,360
He switched off his phone.

174
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,750
I told you.
You won't be able to find him.

175
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,440
How can I find him, then?

176
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,630
It's not like we're living together.

177
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,670
What did you say?

178
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
What did I say?

179
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,670
You don't live together?

180
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
A few days ago,

181
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,270
he had some affairs nearby my place.

182
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,030
What was it?

183
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,670
He accompanied me to fix my laptop.

184
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,790
Where?

185
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,030
Pingle Digital Mall.

186
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,600
What happened after that?

187
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Then, I took the cab
back to my university.

188
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,270
What are you doing?

189
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,360
Are you interrogating a criminal?

190
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,960
How could you doubt me?

191
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,870
You have a history of lying.

192
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,200
Back then in school,

193
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,120
you always teamed up to lie to me.

194
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,240
You don't have the appetite
to eat today too, right?

195
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,030
Give me the drumstick.

196
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,840
How could you do that?

197
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,550
Put it back.

198
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,870
Our dear Yingzi won't look pretty
if her face is too skinny.

199
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,150
She needs to eat more meat.

200
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,910
Well, you look

201
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,200
pretty...

202
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,200
You have a mysterious face.

203
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,600
Should you compliment her again?

204
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,510
She's not flattered.

205
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Eat up.

206
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,790
What's the point
if I have a hidden past?

207
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,270
Jiang Yi...

208
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,360
Jiang Yi...

209
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,630
What's wrong with Jiang Yi?

210
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,910
He's avoiding me like I'm a ghost.

211
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,270
He runs away when he sees me.

212
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,870
Since when did I make him upset?

213
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
I couldn't eat and sleep well.

214
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,000
I've lost so much weight.

215
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,840
The NCEE is approaching.

216
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
The minimum passing score
for Communication University of China

217
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,670
is extremely high.

218
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
If I couldn't get a good score,

219
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,240
my whole life would be ruined.

220
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,910
If I'm doomed,

221
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,670
I can no longer mingle with you.

222
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,120
If I can't mingle with you,

223
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,150
I'll be left alone in Hangtian City...

224
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,270
Okay, that's enough.

225
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Fine.

226
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,600
I'll tell you, okay?

227
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,000
Look at the graph.

228
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,320
Because D'D is perpendicular
to the plane ABCD,

229
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,440
D'D is therefore perpendicular to AC.

230
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,910
Is this clear?

231
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Write it down.

232
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,750
However, Jiang,

233
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,310
why are you acting weirdly recently?

234
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,400
I want to go to Beijing
with Huang Yingzi.

235
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
Don't tell anyone about this.

236
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,070
This is supposed to be a surprise.

237
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
I'll keep that a secret.

238
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,590
But I still don't get it.

239
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,590
What do you like about her?

240
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,160
Her nose, eyes, or mouth?

241
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,310
Those look basic.

242
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,310
But she looks okay overall.

243
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,110
Enough about that. Hurry up.

244
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,640
Next question.

245
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,400
Okay.

246
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,310
Okay.

247
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,110
The next step.

248
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,240
Because BD is perpendicular to AC,

249
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,200
AC is thus perpendicular
to the plane B'BDD'.

250
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,480
It's my first seeing Jiang

251
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
doing something so dedicatedly.

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,070
He scored 60 marks
higher than his previous exam.

253
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,640
If he didn't cheat,

254
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
he must be a genius.

255
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,680
Actually, we have

256
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
misunderstood Jiang.

257
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,790
He's willing to be a weak student.

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,510
If he puts his mind into something,

259
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,920
he will definitely do it well.

260
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,110
He told me

261
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,589
that whenever he feels sleepy,

262
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
he would just draw a whale,

263
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,240
and he won't feel sleepy anymore.

264
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,030
Why are you crying?

265
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,750
Fool.

266
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,640
Why are you following me?

267
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,550
You're the one who's following me.

268
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,790
You're following me.

269
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,880
Fine.

270
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm following you.

271
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,880
I'll always follow you, okay?

272
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,070
Fine.

273
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,880
Little follower.

274
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
That's a promise, then.

275
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,240
Promise?

276
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,160
I don't understand.

277
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,640
Well,

278
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,830
should I just call you
Bull-headed Jiang?

279
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,790
Bull-headed Jiang!

280
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,030
Bull-headed Jiang.

281
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,240
You're Bull-headed Jiang.

282
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,320
Bull-headed Jiang.

283
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,070
(Bull-headed Jiang.)

284
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,830
You're back, Yingzi.

285
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,790
Where are you heading?

286
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,960
Your dad has been waiting for you
to check your marks, Yingzi.

287
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,110
Hold on, Mom.

288
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
Where are you going, Yingzi?

289
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,110
Jiang Yi.

290
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,590
Jiang Yi.

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,350
Jiang Yi.

292
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,790
Good news!

293
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,830
584.

294
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,200
You'll definitely get in it!

295
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,680
Yingzi manages to get the offer!

296
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,920
Yi.

297
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,070
Are you asleep?

298
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,110
I'm coming in.

299
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Have a cup of milk, Yi.

300
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,110
Yi.

301
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,350
Don't get too upset.

302
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,200
I know

303
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,590
you've worked hard.

304
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,880
As long as you tried your best.

305
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,590
Look.

306
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,400
You've just studied hard
for a short while.

307
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,310
Yet, you managed to get a good score.

308
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,270
This means that you have potential.

309
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
When you're in the UK,

310
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,200
I'll make sure you
get admitted to a good college.

311
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,750
Then, you can study hard.

312
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,830
You'll grow up to be a capable man.

313
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,880
When did I agree to go to the UK?

314
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,830
I'm

315
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,550
discussing it with you.

316
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,070
I wondered why you came back.

317
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,110
You're waiting for me
to fail my studies,

318
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,880
so you can use it as an excuse

319
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
to take me to the UK.

320
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,350
No.

321
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,830
That's not what I meant.

322
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,680
How could you say that?

323
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,270
We're

324
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,510
truly concern about your future.

325
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,880
If you couldn't get into college,

326
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,750
what do you do?

327
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,790
That's my own business.

328
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,160
It's none of your business!

329
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,030
I won't ever go to the UK.

330
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,510
Calm down, Yi.

331
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,750
Listen carefully.

332
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,070
You can't be so stubborn about this.

333
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,550
That's enough.

334
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,070
Stop it.

335
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,680
Please leave.

336
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,270
Please.

337
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,960
I'll talk to you again.

338
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,880
Drink the milk.

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,960
Why are you acting like my parents?

340
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,830
I didn't get admitted
to a top college. That's all.

341
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,880
That doesn't mean
that my future is doomed.

342
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,440
If you get into a good college,

343
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,880
you'll have more options.

344
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,510
You'll have a brighter future too.

345
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,350
Fine.

346
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,830
Let me tell you an example.

347
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,920
If we have ten laptops,

348
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
but there are twenty people

349
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,880
who want to play games with them.

350
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,920
Some people will not be able

351
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
to use the laptops, right?

352
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,000
The admission quota is
very limited for good colleges.

353
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,920
Among the six of us,
five of us get the offer.

354
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,770
I'm just giving up the good resources

355
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,350
for people who need it more.

356
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,790
However, you've just
studied hard for a while,

357
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,000
but your scores surged up.

358
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,720
That means your efforts are recognised.

359
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,550
Do you want to retake it next year?

360
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,110
I know of a good tuition centre.

361
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,110
Forget about it.

362
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,790
I'd rather take my own life

363
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,110
than retake NCEE.

364
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,550
Or

365
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,550
you can go to college overseas?

366
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,640
Didn't your parents

367
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,200
arrange everything for you?

368
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,920
That's what they want.

369
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm not interested.

370
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,400
You can attend college overseas
and come back.

371
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,480
You'd become an overseas returnee, then.

372
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,440
I wanted to go, but I can't.

373
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,110
Do you despise me that much?

374
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,240
Why are you chasing me away?

375
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,200
But we'll go to college.

376
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,750
What about you?

377
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,550
If you have plans already, tell us.

378
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,030
Aren't we still in summer holidays?

379
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,830
I haven't thought about it yet.

380
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,680
Maybe I don't need to go to college.

381
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,310
I can

382
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,160
get a job at a cybercafe.

383
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,310
Or I can join Esports gaming.

384
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,880
Some of you will go to Beijing,

385
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
some are going to Jiangzhou,

386
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,070
while some are going to Hangzhou.

387
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,270
I can take turns to work in your city.

388
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,240
I can then visit you.

389
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:56,920
Yingzi.

390
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,240
Why do you keep quiet?

391
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,590
Talk some sense into him.

392
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,400
He has made up his mind.
What else can we say?

393
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Let him be.

394
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,480
This is his life.

395
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Whether he decides
to squander his life or cherish it,

396
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,070
the choice is within his free will.

397
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,680
Enjoy.

398
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm going home.

399
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,480
Mr. Huang.

400
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Jiang Yi.

401
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,440
Madam Guo.

402
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,640
Come on, the meal will be ready soon.

403
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,750
Have a seat.

404
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,110
Okay.

405
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,920
Mom.

406
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,240
What's the matter?

407
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,510
Why are you giving me a hard stare?

408
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,270
Jiang Yi's parents are back.

409
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,590
Why is he still eating with us?

410
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,400
Gosh. Yingzi.

411
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Don't listen to her, Jiang Yi.

412
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,750
Here, have a seat.

413
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,030
Okay.

414
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,720
We'll eat shortly.

415
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,240
Listen.

416
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,030
Wang Dan can't cook.

417
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,790
Didn't you know?

418
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,160
He's used to eating
the food we prepared.

419
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,550
Of course he's not used
to eating the food she makes.

420
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,720
Am I right, Jiang Yi?

421
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,710
You're right, Madam Guo.

422
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,440
I'm used to enjoying
good food prepared by you.

423
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,350
I can't help it now.

424
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,030
Thus,

425
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,960
if you crave for it,
just come downstairs.

426
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
Our dining area is your canteen.

427
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,920
We'll always prepare good food for you.

428
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,240
Okay. Thank you, Madam Guo.

429
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,400
All right. We'll eat soon.

430
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,310
I don't like prawns.

431
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,270
Hold on.

432
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
You don't like prawns?

433
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,510
Don't you love prawns?

434
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,440
I used to like it.

435
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,400
But my preferences have changed.

436
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
I don't like it anymore.

437
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,310
Your preferences have changed?

438
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,680
You're really erratic.

439
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,270
Jiang Yi.

440
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,030
Yingzi.

441
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,920
Have you, along with

442
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Mingyu and the others,

443
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,790
discussed

444
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,880
where to visit
during the summer holidays?

445
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,960
We've discussed about it, Madam Guo.

446
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
We're planning to visit Jiuzhai Valley.

447
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,550
Jiuzhai Valley is a nice place to visit.

448
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,510
It's scenic.

449
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
I'll sponsor your trip.

450
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
Dad.

451
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
I'm not going.

452
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,480
If I can get into
Communication University of China,

453
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll have assignments to do
during the summer holidays.

454
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,880
Assignments during summer holidays?

455
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,310
NCEE is finally over.

456
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,310
Why aren't you going out
to enjoy yourself to the fullest?

457
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,110
Mom.

458
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,830
In high school,

459
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,830
my teachers and you forced us to study.

460
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,200
It's different in college.

461
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
We need to study on our own.

462
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,590
Besides,

463
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,960
I need to consider about my future.

464
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,720
How can I play every day

465
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,750
and make no effort at all?

466
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,400
My daughter is an adult now.

467
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,480
You're so thoughtful now.

468
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
You and your friends

469
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,310
will go on separate ways in college.

470
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,880
You should gather more before college.

471
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:33,830
That's right.

472
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,270
Mr. Huang is right.

473
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,720
I'll go to Beijing too.

474
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,440
I can still visit...

475
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,880
Dad.

476
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,440
They are my childhood friends.

477
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
But everyone has their goals.

478
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,310
Some will live a successful life,

479
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,550
while some will waste their life.

480
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
We can never gather, then.

481
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,550
Huang Yingzi.

482
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,270
You don't have
to tell me this every day.

483
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,160
I'm going to Beijing
not just because of you.

484
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,030
I'm saying all this

485
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,350
not just for you.

486
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,550
I mean what I say.

487
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm full.

488
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,920
Jiang Yi.

489
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,000
Are you leaving so soon?

490
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,070
It's okay, Madam Guo.

491
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
Tell Yingzi that I'm leaving.

492
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,310
I'll leave now.

493
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,320
Yingzi.

494
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,400
I heard that you've
achieved a good score.

495
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Congratulations.

496
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,880
It's nothing much.

497
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,070
We're

498
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,000
working overseas.

499
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,510
We have failed

500
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,310
as a parent.

501
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,030
Thus,

502
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,790
I arranged for him a college in UK.

503
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,680
He wants to take game design

504
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,830
and we've agreed as well.

505
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,880
However,

506
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
now he refuses to go overseas.

507
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,270
I know

508
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,270
he's closer

509
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,030
to you and the others compared to us.

510
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
I know, Madam Wang.

511
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,160
I'll talk to them

512
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,590
and see how we can persuade Jiang Yi.

513
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,480
No.

514
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,640
You're the only one who can do this.

515
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,270
Although all six of you
are close friends,

516
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,920
I know

517
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,240
that deep down,

518
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,200
he cares about you the most.

519
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,640
All this while,

520
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,000
thank you for taking care of Jiang Yi.

521
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,730
I really appreciate it.

522
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,110
I can only

523
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
count on you now.

524
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,750
You don't have to do this, Madam Wang.

525
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,720
Don't worry, Madam Wang.

526
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,710
I know what I should do.

527
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm so baffled.

528
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,230
Jiang was so stubborn.

529
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,550
No one could persuade him.

530
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,360
Why did he suddenly

531
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
go overseas with his parents?

532
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,320
Zhuang Yuan.

533
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It has been years.

534
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,510
Didn't you know?

535
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,230
I don't know.

536
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,630
He decided to go overseas

537
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,670
because of me.

538
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,400
I could guess

539
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,480
that it's because of you.

540
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,440
However,

541
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,630
how did you convince him?

542
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,960
It's because of you too.

543
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,190
Me?

544
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,710
Look at the word parts
of the character 'Xian'.

545
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,480
The right part.

546
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,710
It's 'quan', isn't it?

547
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,920
Remember that.

548
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,000
Come on, copy it for a few times.

549
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,070
Yingzi.

550
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,400
Zhuang Yuan.

551
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,760
What are you doing?

552
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,360
I'm giving tuition to Madam Liu's son.

553
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,360
I need to meet you.

554
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,630
See you half an hour later.

555
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,070
Zhuang Yuan.

556
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,360
Did you apply makeup again?

557
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,800
Do you have a problem with that?

558
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Never mind.

559
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,480
Why do you want to see me?

560
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,110
Let's take a stroll together.

561
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,030
Where are we going?

562
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,400
Zhuang Yuan.

563
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,110
You always think

564
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,190
that Jiang Yi is unambitious, don't you?

565
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,510
I wouldn't say that he's unambitious.

566
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,550
He wants to stay by your side.

567
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
That's considered as an ambition too.

568
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,480
But one day, he told me

569
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
that he has a dream too.

570
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,440
What is your dream, then?

571
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,440
To be a game designer.

572
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,000
(I was really happy.)

573
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,070
As I thought

574
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,510
I'm the first person
to know about his dream.

575
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Yingzi.

576
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,190
Why are you acting weirdly today?

577
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Why are you

578
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
telling me all this?

579
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,110
Let's go.

580
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:43,880
Wait...

581
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,840
Why are you holding my hands?

582
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,150
A boy is courting me recently.

583
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,760
He keeps harassing me.

584
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,920
Please play along and help me

585
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,230
to chase him away.

586
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,000
I see.

587
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,630
You should tell me earlier.

588
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,320
Where is he?

589
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,630
Don't look back.

590
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,880
He's right behind us.

591
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,590
I won't look back.

592
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,190
Has he left?

593
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,030
No.

594
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,920
Don't look back.

595
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,030
What's wrong?

596
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,360
Why are you crying?

597
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,760
It's nothing.

598
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
I've got sand in my eyes.

599
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,840
You...

600
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,590
I'm sorry.

601
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,670
I owe you one.

602
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,550
I will repay you.

603
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,800
You're really something else.

604
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,710
How did you bear to do that?

605
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,000
Of course

606
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,880
I couldn't bear to do it.

607
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,190
But I couldn't bear

608
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,800
to see him acting unambitious

609
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
just to stay by my side.

610
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,000
He's so talented,

611
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
and smart.

612
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,150
I shouldn't be

613
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,920
the only one recognising his merits.

614
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,070
He deserves to
be acknowledged by others as well.

615
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,030
Won't you regret it?

616
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,320
I'd be lying if I said no.

617
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,510
But I regret more

618
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,230
that I didn't tell him

619
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,150
the truth behind the incident.

620
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,590
So he still thinks

621
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,360
that there's another man

622
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,550
between us.

623
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,840
Hold on.

624
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,030
Do you mean

625
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,670
that he still thinks
that we were a pair?

626
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,670
Well, not quite.

627
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,150
Gosh.

628
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,630
After he came back,

629
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,960
he acted like nothing happened.

630
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,230
I couldn't find a chance
to explain about it.

631
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,550
No.

632
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,590
You must explain this to him.

633
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,400
That's right.

634
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,630
I must explain myself.

635
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,360
Please explain to him thoroughly.

636
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,800
Explain to him thoroughly.

637
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,880
Give him a call.

638
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,590
I'll explain to him.

639
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,920
Yes, let me call him.

640
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,480
I'll ask him out now.

641
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,070
Why couldn't you explain it to him?

642
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,000
He's picking up.

643
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,230
Isn't his phone switched off?

644
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,280
You lied to me again.

645
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,670
Jiang.

646
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,760
Why did you ask me out in a hurry?

647
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,000
Can't we talk about this at home?

648
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,880
Home?

649
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,550
Which home?

650
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,150
I need to grab something
from his place later.

651
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,800
If it's nothing, I'll leave now.

652
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,150
I have something to say.

653
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,360
Come on.

654
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,400
Have a seat first.

655
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,400
Jiang Yi.

656
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,150
You ignore me on Wechat,

657
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,400
and you're not returning my calls.

658
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,590
I have no choice

659
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,000
but to lure you out

660
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,230
through a middleman.

661
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,480
Middleman?

662
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,320
Me?

663
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,760
Fine.

664
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,630
Go on.

665
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,030
I won't charge you both for my service.

666
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,280
Sit here.

667
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,230
Jiang Yi.

668
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,150
I'm here to apologize to you.

669
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,590
Please don't be upset.

670
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,400
Do you want any drinks?

671
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,230
I'll order it for you.

672
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,880
You're the middleman, right?

673
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,360
Please tell her

674
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,030
that I don't want to drink anything.

675
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,070
He said he's not thirsty.

676
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,360
Help me to ask him

677
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,510
how long of a time
he needs to cool down.

678
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,150
Yingzi said

679
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,230
you shouldn't be so petty.

680
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,110
Hurry up and calm down.

681
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,550
I didn't say that he's petty.

682
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,510
He's not petty.

683
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,000
She said that you're not petty.

684
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,150
I'm upset with her
as she didn't keep her promise.

685
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,510
He said...

686
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,190
Tell him

687
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,230
that it was an emergency.

688
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,590
I didn't mean it.

689
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,360
Hold on.

690
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,150
You are sitting across each other.

691
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,480
Can you talk to each other on your own?

692
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,590
Jiang.

693
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,840
Yingzi asked you out

694
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,760
as she has something to tell you.

695
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,440
Jiang Yi.

696
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,880
I'm here

697
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,030
to apologize to you sincerely.

698
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
If I were in your shoes,

699
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,960
I'd be pissed off too.

700
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,400
But I hope

701
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,070
that you could give me
a chance to explain myself.

702
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,590
After work,

703
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,880
I saw Ding Ye at the exit.

704
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,590
He pulled me into the car

705
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,070
without telling me where we were going.

706
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,230
In the car,

707
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,440
I sent you a message immediately.

708
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,190
As I thought it'll end very quickly.

709
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,440
I didn't expect

710
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,840
that we went to a mountain.

711
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,400
There's no signal in the mountain.

712
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,070
Can't you leave on your own?

713
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,630
You are free to leave at your own will.

714
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,920
Yet, you chose to spend the night there.

715
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,110
I wanted to leave.

716
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,280
But he said he wanted
to see the sunrise.

717
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,440
I couldn't reject him.

718
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,960
Why must you see the sunrise
on that day?

719
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Would you die if you don't?

720
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,710
He...

721
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,440
I got it.

722
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,670
You'd tell me
that it's his personal matters.

723
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,230
Am I right?

724
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,590
Do you still remember, Huang Yingzi?

725
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,440
Previously,

726
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,150
right here,

727
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,880
what you told me.

728
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,920
You said you're just friends.

729
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,000
Very well.

730
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,760
You stood me up because of him.

731
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,590
What do you mean?

732
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Am I not your friend, then?

733
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,880
You're different.

734
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,000
Yes, I can see that.

735
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,190
He's more important than me.

736
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,230
No, Jiang Yi.

737
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,710
Can you not twist my words?

738
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,960
Stop fighting.

739
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,880
I'm feeling awkward here.

740
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:44,800
Yingzi.

741
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,440
You haven't changed a bit.

742
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,670
You wanted Jiang to leave the country,

743
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,400
so I became the scapegoat

744
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,230
and the other man.

745
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,880
That's not true.

746
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:53,880
Never mind.

747
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,360
I don't mind being regarded
as the other man.

748
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,840
However, I hope

749
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
that you two can have

750
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,760
an open and honest conversation today

751
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,440
and clear up
the misunderstandings from before.

752
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,440
