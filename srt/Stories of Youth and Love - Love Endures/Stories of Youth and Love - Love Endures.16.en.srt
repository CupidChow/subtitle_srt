[Episode 16]

3
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,280
Guan Chao, thank you.

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
You always help us out.

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
It is a small deal.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,510
Grandma, go and get rest.

7
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,310
I can clean them up.

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,590
Stop cleaning.

9
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,030
Leave it to me.

10
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,800
No, I can.

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
I can handle this.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,750
I will pick it up.

13
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,080
Are you all right?

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Does it hurt?

15
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,910
Yifei.

16
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,800
See Guan Chao out later.

17
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,710
You should also go
and take a stroll outside.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,470
Don't always stay in the store.

19
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,150
All right.

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,470
Thank you, Grandma.

21
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,870
Guan Chao, thank you.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,710
You don't always have to thank me.

23
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Grandma is kind to me.

24
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
It's my duty to help her out.

25
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,310
Well, you don't have to come every day.

26
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,590
I can manage by myself.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,800
Do... Do you find it annoying
that I'm in the store every day?

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,360
No.

29
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,030
Then, I will go there every day.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,470
Thank you.

31
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,120
Yifei, um...

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,630
Hasn't your mom contacted you yet?

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,030
Actually, I want to say...

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,910
That is, if...

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,520
If you don't mind,

36
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,030
I can look after Grandma

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,030
and the wonton store with you.

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
Are you pitying me?

39
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,310
No, I didn't mean that.

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
What do you mean?

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,800
I...

42
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,950
Well, I...

43
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,680
Guan Chao.

44
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,510
Thank you.

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,270
Do you have a selection

46
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,390
for the track and field team soon?

47
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,830
Next month.

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Let's compete.

49
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,680
Now?

50
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,680
Do you see the tree ahead?

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,430
Whoever gets there first

52
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,390
is considered the winner.

53
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,480
It starts now!

54
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,240
You won.

55
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,310
I won.

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,360
You will have a prize.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
A prize?

58
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,310
I will head home first.

59
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,120
Guan Chao.

60
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,800
Bye.

61
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Huang Yingzi.

62
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,630
Can you stop shaking?

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,040
I didn't move a muscle.

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,360
You are shaking yourself, okay?

65
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,630
Stop shaking.

66
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,270
I'm going to vomit.

67
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,390
How about this?

68
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,040
Feeling any better?

69
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,600
Much better.

70
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,190
What is with you, Jiang Yi?

71
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
You are never a good drinker.

72
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,430
Why did you drink so much?

73
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,510
What for?

74
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,310
Are you aware that you are very heavy?

75
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,240
Don't you feel embarrassed?

76
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
A grown man

77
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
actually puts his whole weight on me.

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,600
You are drunk.

79
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,950
Who is drunk?

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,270
I'm not drunk.

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,070
I told you I'm not drunk!

82
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,920
What is that loud noise
this late at night?

83
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,270
I'm not drunk!

84
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,120
You are disturbing my night!

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm so sorry about that.

86
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,560
Are you sure you are not drunk?

87
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,310
Please, I beg of you.

88
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Keep your voice down.

89
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,120
People always say

90
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,950
that we won't remember the booze talk

91
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,190
after waking up?

92
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,720
But I remember everything.

93
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,430
What is it that you remember?

94
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,270
I remember

95
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,190
when I played Truth or Dare

96
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,950
back then,

97
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,430
I lied.

98
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,120
What did you lie about?

99
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,120
Actually, I...

100
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,840
What is that?

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,270
Come closer.

102
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,550
Actually, I

103
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,510
want to eat instant noodles.

104
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,360
With sausage

105
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,790
and fried egg.

106
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,750
Be careful.

107
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,150
He is really heavy.

108
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,150
Oh, my. What is this?

109
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,150
Why is he so plastered late at night?

110
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,910
I couldn't find his ID card

111
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,360
to get a hotel room.

112
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,440
So I brought him back here.

113
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,030
What is wrong with his dad?

114
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,910
His son is back.

115
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
Why doesn't he come back?

116
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,120
It is no use to say this now.

117
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,440
He already sold his house.

118
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
He has no home here.

119
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,270
Go and get him some honey water

120
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,840
to help with his hangover.

121
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,080
I will go now.

122
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,960
Take his shoes off.

123
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,789
I will get him a blanket.

124
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:55,749
Tonight,

125
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,840
he can make do with it here.

126
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,630
Okay.

127
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
I will take your shoes off.

128
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,670
Come.

129
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,790
Hold on.

130
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,630
What are you up to again?

131
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,510
Listen.

132
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm not the kind

133
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,240
who takes off shoes
at someone else's place.

134
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,600
Cut your crap.

135
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,440
You were here bared-foot before.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,550
Come on.

137
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,670
Seriously, I don't want
to take my shoes off.

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,720
Hurry.

139
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,750
It is not like
I'm taking off your clothes.

140
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,120
She wants to undress me!

141
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,870
Shut up. Come on.

142
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
I did nothing.

143
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,150
I just helped him take off his shoes.

144
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,790
Actually, I can do that myself.

145
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,030
That's not what you said just now.

146
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,150
Yingzi.

147
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,480
You two are not teenagers anymore.

148
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,630
Behave appropriately.

149
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,960
That's right.

150
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
Are you seeking trouble for yourself,

151
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Jiang Yi?

152
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,870
Instant noodles.

153
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,630
What did you say?

154
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,240
I want instant noodles!

155
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,630
Not so loud.

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,790
I want sausage, egg, cheese,

157
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,870
and some vegetables!

158
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,120
I swear

159
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,120
if I ever drink with you again,

160
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,630
I'm a dog.

161
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,510
I will go and make you
an instant noodle.

162
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
Stop shouting, please.

163
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,960
No coriander.

164
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
What are you looking at?

165
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,390
Your dress...

166
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,550
It looks nice, right?

167
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,120
Yes, it's quite nice.

168
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,030
Did you steal your grandma's dress?

169
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,480
Stop.

170
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,270
The pot

171
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,360
will flip.

172
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
You know nothing.

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,150
I saved up for a month

174
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,240
to buy this dress.

175
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,670
The latest fashion.

176
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,000
You don't understand. I'm so speechless.

177
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,120
Come over.

178
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,750
I see.

179
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,030
Wait.

180
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
I think one is enough.

181
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,750
The national college entrance exam
is approaching.

182
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,150
You need two eggs.

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,510
They give you protein.

184
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,790
Look at you.

185
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
You are so eager to eat the noodle.

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
And look at you.

187
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,670
You came to my place to steal crops.

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
It is almost the exam.

189
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,960
Yet you still have the mood
to play this?

190
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,670
I keep a balance
between studying and enjoyment.

191
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,670
My results have been on a steep rise.

192
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,750
With this improving trend,

193
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,480
I will get into my dream university.

194
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,240
What about you?

195
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,670
Which university do you plan to go to?

196
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,120
I do terribly in my studies.
I don't have high hopes.

197
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,390
Anyway, I won't get into
any universities.

198
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,150
How about we choose the same city?

199
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,440
We can't stay in Hangtian City forever.

200
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,550
Big cities are pretty good.

201
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
But the heavy traffic

202
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,870
and confusing roads

203
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,080
are troublesome for me.

204
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,750
We won't be able to meet everyday

205
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,360
if we are in different cities
in the future.

206
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,240
Isn't that good?

207
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,390
You won't be able
to use my laptop every day.

208
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,320
All right, I will do the dishes.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,670
You won't be able

210
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,360
to eat delicious noodles again.

211
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,320
Here.

212
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,150
Try it.

213
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,150
You are quick to sober up.

214
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,910
By the way,

215
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,840
what do you think about Guan's matter?

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, Guan...

217
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,120
What is your plan for tomorrow?

218
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,470
I have some personal stuff to settle.

219
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,840
What is it you have

220
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,390
in Hangtian City?

221
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,750
Something important.

222
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,240
Fine.

223
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,670
After you finish your things,

224
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,480
I will give you commands.

225
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,030
Okay.

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,320
Is the noodle that yummy?

227
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,240
I didn't say that.

228
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,270
Then don't eat it.

229
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
Delicious. Absolutely delicious.

230
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,750
I want to eat it.

231
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,030
However, I think this noodle tastes good

232
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,910
probably because...

233
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,750
Because of what?

234
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,790
Because you cooked it.

235
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,390
Scoundrel.

236
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,790
So you were pretending to be drunk.

237
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
Let's have a round.

238
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,510
The two of us?

239
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,150
Why? Are you scared?

240
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,550
Bring it on.

241
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,030
Yang Fan.

242
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,200
Yingzi.

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,870
Grandma.

244
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,880
You are here.

245
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,160
It must be tough for you.

246
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,030
Not at all.

247
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,880
Have a seat.

248
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
I will go and prepare you some wonton.

249
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,160
Grandma, there is no need for that.

250
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
I'm not eating today.

251
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,650
It has been some time
since I came back to Hangtian City.

252
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,070
I want Yang Fan
to take me out for a stroll today.

253
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,790
Sure.

254
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,160
Take a walk with Yingzi.

255
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,240
Sorry for the trouble.

256
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's go.

257
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,880
Yingzi.

258
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
Are you helping Guan Chao
to convince me to go back?

259
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
No.

260
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
That is his business.

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
I can't do anything about it.

262
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,550
I want to thank you

263
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,510
for looking after Grandma for us.

264
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
After all,

265
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,920
this isn't what you are supposed to do.

266
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,270
(You are still in good shape.)

267
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,070
I thought you had stopped exercising

268
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,160
after working in the office.

269
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,720
I go jogging sometimes,

270
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,070
but I don't play much basketball.

271
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,400
I feel that only my life
is still the same.

272
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,070
Every day, I go to school, exercise,
and play basketball.

273
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,440
No.

274
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,750
You have Yang Fan now.

275
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,720
Thus, I think

276
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,160
you should make some changes

277
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,400
for the sake of her,

278
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,640
even not for yourself.

279
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,440
I did.

280
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
She enjoys eating.

281
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,880
So I learned to cook.

282
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,550
She likes watching drama,

283
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,750
and I watch with her.

284
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,920
I have never thought

285
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,349
of doing all these

286
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,919
before.

287
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:33,789
(You know what?)

288
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,879
I married Guan Chao

289
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,640
because he has been doing things

290
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,110
that are not his responsibilities.

291
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,270
In fact, all of you are the same.

292
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,310
Every one of you

293
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,160
take care of Grandma

294
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,830
as if she is your own.

295
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,350
I think people who do that

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
must be a good person.

297
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
However,

298
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,160
humans are conflicted.

299
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,200
I like him because he is simple

300
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
and kind.

301
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,120
But I know

302
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,640
there is a part of his life
that I have missed out.

303
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,030
Like a puzzle piece

304
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
I can never find,

305
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
and I can never complete the puzzle.

306
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah.

307
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,550
But not everyone

308
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,030
can complete their own life puzzle.

309
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,000
Although you weren't there

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,070
in that piece of his puzzle,

311
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,160
you are destined

312
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,480
to complete
most of Guan Chao's life puzzle

313
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,350
together with him.

314
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,790
That is more than enough, is it not?

315
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm his childhood friend,

316
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,550
but I won't take his side.

317
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,240
Yesterday, my dad said

318
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
that even though he saw
Guan Chao as his own,

319
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
he wouldn't let him off

320
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
if he mistreated you.

321
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Yingzi, he didn't mistreat me.

322
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,350
The thing is,

323
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm sometimes confused
about what he is thinking.

324
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Have you explained to her

325
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,270
the matter she isn't comfortable with?

326
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,000
As I said,

327
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,350
you do more than you say.

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,110
You have been like this
since you were little.

329
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,000
(Don't bother with him.)

330
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,000
He is like this.

331
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,070
He is reticent and hardly speaks up.

332
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,160
Apologizing and making concessions

333
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,110
are never his things.

334
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
Do you want to hear

335
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,590
what happened when we were young?

336
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,790
I remember there was this one time

337
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,920
when he made me so angry

338
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,440
that I wanted to cut him off for good.

339
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,590
What did he do?

340
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,440
Well,

341
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,830
he did something

342
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,680
very silly.

343
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,310
Mingyu, Zhuang Yuan, Yifei.

344
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,480
I earnestly need your help.

345
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,480
What is it?

346
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,920
Steal the crop.

347
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,480
My ranking has dropped.

348
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,830
Someone keeps stealing my vegetables
in the middle of the night.

349
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,400
This is really driving me crazy.

350
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,480
I can't even sleep well.

351
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,480
He

352
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,590
is quite a good friend.

353
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,200
He recorded the planting

354
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,440
and harvest period

355
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
of the players in my friend list

356
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
into a table.

357
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,960
You can steal their crop
based on this table.

358
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,880
You gather us here for this?

359
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Happy Farm should reward you
with a VIP membership.

360
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,440
If you can use the time

361
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,310
to solve a few questions,

362
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,510
your ranking can at least rise
by five places.

363
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm not doing this

364
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,070
for my own sake.

365
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm defending the honor

366
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,960
of the Six of Hangtian City.

367
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
Does a thief have honor?

368
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,920
Please.

369
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,160
I beg of you.

370
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,920
How about this?

371
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,640
I will buy you a one-month
Yellow Diamond membership on QQ.

372
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,440
Is that okay?

373
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,510
I think this video game

374
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,160
brings harm to teenagers.

375
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,550
I can't encourage this.

376
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,510
You should behave yourself.

377
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,880
As you know,

378
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,270
my mom forbids me
from playing video games.

379
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,920
I would rather use this time

380
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,720
to solve a few more questions.

381
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
I have dance practice.

382
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,640
Guan Chao!

383
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,400
You came at the perfect time.

384
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,160
Only you can help me now.

385
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,590
Sure. What is it about?

386
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,590
Steal vegetables for her.

387
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,480
Steal vegetables? What vegetables?

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,590
Any vegetable will do.

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,270
All right. I will help you.

390
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,030
There's a fish in the northern sea
named Kun.

391
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,510
Kun is gigantic,
exceeding thousands of li.

392
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,350
When it turns into a bird...

393
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,270
Yingzi, here is your vegetable.

394
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,270
You got to be kidding me.

395
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,270
Where did you steal this?

396
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,160
From the farm.

397
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,720
You didn't tell me

398
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,880
what species you want.

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,240
So I picked the biggest one.

400
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,000
Did you get caught?

401
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,550
Can't you tell?

402
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,240
If he got caught,

403
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
how could he be here now?

404
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,400
That's right.

405
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
No one could catch me.

406
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,030
But you know what?

407
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,590
I dared not steal it.

408
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,880
Before I left,

409
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,590
I put the money there.

410
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,480
So, have I done you this favor?

411
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,510
Guan Chao.

412
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,720
Impressive.

413
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,550
There's a big fish in the northern sea
named Kun.

414
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,480
It's gigantic,
exceeding thousands of li.

415
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,200
When it turns into a bird,
it goes by the name Peng.

416
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,440
Peng has a wide back,
exceeding thousands of li.

417
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
This is pretty big, though.

418
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,240
Everyone laughed at me
for the whole semester.

419
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
The entire school knew about this.

420
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,510
Guan Chao never plays video games.

421
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,720
He wouldn't know about this.

422
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
Couldn't he ask

423
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,110
if he doesn't know?

424
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,790
You should know him.

425
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,920
He does more than he says.

426
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,030
Look, you know him quite well.

427
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,920
It has been a long time
since I came back here.

428
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,200
Let's go for a walk.

429
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,400
Come.

430
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:23,880
Sure.

431
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,030
I knew no one would forget

432
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,270
this embarrassing incident.

433
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,550
You mustn't tell my students about this.

434
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,000
Otherwise, I will feel ashamed
to face them.

435
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
Guan Chao, you are 30 years old.

436
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,160
Your hair has grown less,

437
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
can you be braver?

438
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,960
Besides,

439
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,750
apologize if you did something wrong.

440
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,680
Try to explain yourself
when there is a misunderstanding.

441
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,480
Don't upset yourself

442
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
and the person you love.

443
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,590
He did many silly things in the past.

444
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,830
I used to find it

445
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,350
funny and annoying.

446
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,160
But now, when I recall it,

447
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,720
it is quite cute.

448
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,000
So, Yang Fan,

449
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,880
let's not be angry
with a silly person, okay?

450
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,200
Give him one more chance.

451
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,200
Listen to what he thinks.

452
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,200
No matter what decision you make,

453
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,790
I'm always on your side.

454
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,400
Bye.

455
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,480
I'm not good

456
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,440
at expressing myself.

457
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sorry for having done you wrong.

458
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,590
You were quite eloquent today,
weren't you?

459
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,480
Chao.

460
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,590
I can understand the situation of Yifei.

461
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,270
Let bygone be bygone.

462
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,640
Why?

463
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,000
You must be tired after wearing heels

464
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,270
this whole day, right?

465
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,510
It is fine. I'm used to it.

466
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,440
What are you doing?

467
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880
Come up.

468
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,110
We are almost home.

469
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,790
Just walk.

470
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,550
Never mind.

471
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,480
We are a married couple.

472
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,350
Come on.

473
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:34,880
Come.

474
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,880
Let's go.

475
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,880
I have been thinking
about something big recently.

476
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
What thing?

477
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,070
I think

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,070
we can have a baby.

479
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
I don't want to.

480
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,590
What if the baby

481
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,880
is born reticent like you?

482
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,200
How do you know

483
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,160
our child would be reticent?

484
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,350
Maybe

485
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,550
it has long legs and runs very fast.

486
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,790
I don't believe it.

487
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,350
You don't?

488
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,440
Let me show you

489
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,270
what excellent genes are.

490
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,070
Don't you...

491
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,830
Slow down.

492
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,240
What do you think?

493
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,480
What do you think?

494
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,240
(Huang.)

495
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,440
Hurry up. Everyone is hungry.

496
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
Bring the chopsticks here. Hurry.

497
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,830
The dish is ready.

498
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,790
Jiang Yi, your favorite romaine.

499
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,310
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

500
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,030
Yingzi.

501
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:29,920
Come.

502
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,960
He looks more like
the son of this family.

503
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,640
He is my son.

504
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,070
Did you hear that?

505
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,310
Thanks, Dad.

506
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,070
Quick, eat up.

507
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,750
Slow down. No one will steal the food
from you.

508
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,750
You have been overseas for years.

509
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,310
Haven't you learned good table manners?

510
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,240
What are you talking about?

511
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,830
Table manners aren't needed at home.

512
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,680
Exactly.

513
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,680
Why didn't Zhuang Yuan come with you?

514
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
Why would he come with me?

515
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,880
He is working on his thesis.

516
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,750
You see,

517
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,680
Zhuang Yuan and you

518
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,590
grew up together.

519
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,750
You know each other very well.

520
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,350
In my opinion, stop waiting.

521
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,310
Once he graduates,

522
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,440
we will pick a good date

523
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,680
for your wedding.

524
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
Zhuang Yuan and I...

525
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,720
You can't really rush us.

526
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,270
That is right.

527
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
I also think

528
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,790
you can't rush them.

529
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,750
Exactly.

530
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,880
I also think

531
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,000
we should give her more time to prepare.

532
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,200
Right.

533
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,350
Wait.

534
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,200
We know

535
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,070
that going from childhood friends
to a couple

536
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,830
can be difficult, right?

537
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,960
You might find it weird.

538
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,750
However,

539
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
you must break through
the barrier, right?

540
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,720
Holding his hand

541
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,240
might help change
your relationship subtly.

542
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,510
Stop, Dad.

543
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,400
Zhuang Yuan doesn't like me at all.

544
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,200
What?

545
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,030
Look what you have done.

546
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,310
Don't be sad.

547
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,920
Our daughter is great.

548
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,510
Even if he doesn't appreciate her,

549
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,960
many appreciate her, right?

550
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,750
Yes, I'm not sad.

551
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,960
Wait. Why would I feel sad?

552
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,030
I don't like Zhuang Yuan either.

553
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,400
Wait. Hold on.

554
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,350
How do you explain

555
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,200
what you were doing
at the coffee shop then?

556
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
Were you putting up an act?

557
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,110
Putting up an act?

558
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,030
What is this about?

559
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,810
Did you know?

560
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
They looked

561
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,350
so sweet being together

562
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,920
and chatting away happily.

563
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,110
I saw that with my own eyes.

564
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,880
We didn't look sweet at all.

565
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,070
Zhuang Yuan was sitting far away

566
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,680
from me.

567
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
It is like the distance

568
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,440
between me and Dad.

569
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,920
We were chatting normally.

570
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,030
Besides, we were trying

571
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,350
to please you, okay?

572
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,750
What? To please us?

573
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,830
You can't joke about this.

574
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,000
Your mom is right.

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
You can't joke about this.

576
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,510
Look,

577
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,510
Jiang Yi is more sensible than you
about this.

578
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,480
That's right.

579
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,240
That is why Jiang Yi has a girlfriend,

580
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,960
and you are single.

581
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,110
Jiang Yi, how is it going?

582
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,160
Me?

583
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,350
Yeah.

584
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,310
How are things going on
with your foreign girlfriend?

585
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,030
Is everything all right?

586
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,510
Girlfriend?

587
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,830
You can't forget about this.

588
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,240
You showed me her photo before.

589
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,680
She is tanned

590
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000
with big eyes.

591
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,030
She is a celebrity.

592
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,680
She dumped him.

593
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,550
She left him.

594
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,400
We separated

595
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,070
because of cultural differences.

596
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,830
You see.

597
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,240
It is better to find a partner

598
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,440
whom you know very well.

599
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,550
So, are you single?

600
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,960
What do you think about Yingzi?

601
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,400
Enough.

602
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,880
You...

603
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,590
Don't

604
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,200
shove them up together.

605
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,070
You are so eager

606
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,400
as if our daughter can't find a husband.

607
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,640
Stay out of this.

608
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,830
Don't interrupt.

609
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm asking Jiang Yi.

610
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
Jiang Yi, answer me.

611
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
Madam.

612
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,750
Someone is calling me.

613
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,110
I need to take this.

614
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,720
Why don't you

615
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,440
set me up with Guan Chao?

616
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,550
Do you hear yourself?

617
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,200
Guan Chao is already married.

618
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,790
You are not

619
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,790
interfering with his marriage.

620
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,400
That is unethical.

621
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,790
You can't be a homewrecker.

622
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,830
This is the bottom line.

623
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,720
I will shut up.

624
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,310
Regarding the character design
of "The Maze",

625
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
do you have something to tell me?

626
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,110
No words?

627
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,590
Let me ask you this.

628
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,590
Why did the character

629
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,830
change from an old man

630
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,400
to a high school girl?

631
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,350
If I'm not mistaken,

632
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,790
the high school girl is Huang Yingzi,
right?

633
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,480
How are you going to explain this?

634
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,000
I will settle this.

635
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,070
Jiang Yi.

636
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,310
A commercial game

637
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,310
consists of various costs

638
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
and will eventually be launched
in the market.

639
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,680
If you only care about expressing
your own ideas

640
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,000
and even your personal preference,

641
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,510
I don't think

642
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,720
it's what a professional game designer
should do.

643
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,510
Tomorrow, Mr. Gao and I
will be in the office.

644
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,200
We expect a convincing answer from you.

645
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,920
This is caused by circuit aging.

646
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,200
There.

647
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,310
Get me the test pencil.

648
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Grandma, the season is changing.

649
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,200
You ought to bundle up.

650
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,350
Don't catch a cold.

651
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,680
Don't worry,
we will take good care of her.

652
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,200
Guan Chao,
you are so blessed to have her.

653
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,790
Of course.

654
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,880
I know.

655
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,030
Grandma.

656
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,720
We are heading
to the railway station later.

657
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,350
We will visit you again next time.

658
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,240
There is something

659
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,070
I wanted to do.

660
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,270
But I can't recall it now.

661
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,590
I'm old, and I have become forgetful.

662
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,270
Give me some time.

663
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,070
It is fine, Grandma. Take your time.

664
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,110
Tell me when you remember it.

665
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,920
Grandma.

666
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,790
Are you going to give them wonton?

667
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,960
Yes. Wonton.

668
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,590
My memory is so terrible.

669
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,350
I will go get it.

670
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,200
I prepared it for you,

671
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,830
Jiang Yi,

672
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,480
Zhuang Yuan, and Mingyu.

673
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,920
Thank you, Grandma.

674
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,310
I'm glad

675
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,680
to see you all doing so well.

676
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,400
It is fixed.

677
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,440
Don't eat so fast.

678
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,480
No one is taking the food from you.

679
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,400
Jiang. Did you know?

680
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,030
When you were away these days,

681
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,000
I have been eating instant noodles.

682
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,230
I'm so sick of it.

683
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,670
What is wrong with instant noodles?

684
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,550
They taste great.

685
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,030
Did Huang Yingzi cook you
a cheese instant noodle?

686
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,550
Jiang, I smell a rat.

687
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,670
You'd better own up.

688
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,110
Out with it. When did that happen?

689
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,110
Two days ago.

690
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,760
Where was it?

691
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,510
Her place.

692
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,630
Her place?

693
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
You stayed at hers during these days?

694
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,480
Is that a problem?

695
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,590
You don't think it is a problem?

696
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,840
You stayed at her place, you know?

697
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,710
I have been there before.

698
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,710
Ms. Guo would be doing the cooking,

699
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,070
not her.

700
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,800
It means

701
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,920
that only the two of you
were at home during those days.

702
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,510
But if it was just you two at home,

703
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,760
you could have gone
to Grandma for wonton

704
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,800
or eaten out.

705
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,760
From what I know about Huang Yingzi,

706
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,400
she rarely went back,

707
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,760
and she wouldn't miss the chance

708
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,070
to eat as many Hangtian delicacies
as she could.

709
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,480
There is only one truth.

710
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,510
That is,

711
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,070
it was a deep and quiet night,

712
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,030
and all shops were closed.

713
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,190
It is a great shame

714
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,280
that you are not

715
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
a detective.

716
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,480
It hurts.

717
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,190
What else did you do?

718
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,030
Nothing happened.

719
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,710
Impossible.

720
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,590
Your face betrays you.

721
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,150
Zhuang Yuan.

722
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,480
Don't you think

723
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,360
you look exactly the same as your mom

724
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,070
when you're gossiping?

725
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,920
I'm just concerned about you.

726
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,550
Out of the six of us,

727
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,000
Guan

728
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,550
has started a new life

729
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,670
and a family.

730
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,360
Nothing will happen
between Mingyu and me.

731
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,280
But you and Yingzi

732
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,550
are the first couple

733
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,000
I have been shipping
since before.

734
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,480
If you two can't get together,

735
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
I won't believe in love anymore.

736
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,920
All the more reason

737
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,960
it is hard for childhood friends

738
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,800
to change their relationship.

739
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,280
There are also six people

740
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,840
in "Friends".

741
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,710
All of them

742
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,760
get along with each other well.

743
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,800
They are good friends.

744
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,190
They only met each other
in their twenties.

745
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,280
It is different from us,
who met at six.

746
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,710
What about that umbrella?

747
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,440
You went through so much to find it.

748
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,800
Why didn't you give it to her?

749
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,710
I can't find a chance yet.

750
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,670
Why do you even need
a right chance to do so?

751
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,000
I will call her for you.

752
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
Don't call her.

753
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,230
Also, it is not raining now.

754
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,360
Why give her the umbrella?

755
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,710
Are you sure it has to do with the rain?

756
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,030
Fine.

757
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
I will wait for the next rainy day.

758
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,280
I don't want to see this umbrella here
anymore.

759
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,070
Zhuang Yuan.

760
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,960
This seems to be my house.

761
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,670
Even the food can't make you quiet.

762
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,000
Yingzi.

763
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,760
The "Matchmaker Agency" article is done.

764
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,750
It will be published online
a few days later.

765
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,150
Do you want to review it again?

766
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,920
Sure.

767
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,110
Zhang.

768
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,190
Why does my name come before yours?

769
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,070
I want it this way.

770
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,280
But

771
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,670
this is your project.

772
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,190
The initiator of this topic

773
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,070
is supposed to put their name first.

774
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,360
Isn't this the rule?

775
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,920
Since when

776
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,590
did you begin to talk to me with rules?

777
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
Without you,

778
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,670
I would have given up on this project.

779
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,230
So your name should come first.

780
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,670
By the way, I have good news.

781
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,000
Your renewal contract is
in progress now.

782
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,360
Really?

783
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,150
This good news is not only for you

784
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,480
but also for me.

785
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,360
You look so happy.

786
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,480
Aren't you afraid I might surpass you

787
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,840
and take over your position
as the ace journalist?

788
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,000
To be honest,

789
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm already tired

790
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,360
of being the ace journalist.

791
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,400
New Perspectives needs a successor.

792
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,670
If I were to choose one,

793
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,280
I hope it is you.

794
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
What are you talking about?
You look so happy.

795
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,960
Chief Editor.

796
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Since when did you become so close?

797
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,630
I have been seeing
the two of you together lately.

798
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,480
You will see more of this later on.

799
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,280
No, not for now.

800
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,800
Chief Editor, I want to take a leave.

801
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,480
Why?

802
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,280
What about your work?

803
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,320
I have Yingzi.

804
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,400
After the article is published,

805
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,320
I'm going to take my son on vacation.

806
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,280
Bye.

807
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,760
Huang Yingzi.

808
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,880
You have a lot on your plate.

809
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,110
How is the interview with Ding Ye
coming along?

810
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,320
Are you going to write
a biography of him?

811
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,760
It is almost done, Chief Editor.

812
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
You will see the result soon.

813
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,710
Make it quick.

814
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes, sir.

815
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,760
This adaptation

816
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
is totally unacceptable.

817
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,710
This is the result

818
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,110
after careful consideration
of the company.

819
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,320
Can you tell me

820
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,110
why you find it unacceptable?

821
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,110
Female special forces soldier?

822
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,800
You must be kidding me.

823
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,760
As for the high school girl,

824
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,400
what is good about it?

825
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,510
Or does this character

826
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,230
mean something important to you?

827
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,510
If you can convince me,

828
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,960
I may consider it.

829
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,070
Mr. Gao, I think what Jiang Yi means...

830
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,360
Jiang Yi, to be fair,

831
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,840
let's go back to the nature
of a commercial game,

832
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,280
a special forces soldier

833
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,280
is way more attractive
than a high school girl.

834
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,400
You have played

835
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,960
"Resident Evil"...

836
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,440
"Resident Evil" and "The Maze"

837
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,960
are two different concepts.

838
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
You can't mix them up.

839
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,030
It is you who mix up
your personal expression

840
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,480
and business.

841
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,960
Jiang Yi.

842
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,800
You are capable and talented,

843
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,550
so you have your own principles
to stick to,

844
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,880
which I can accept.

845
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,670
But you need to understand

846
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,590
that you bring this game to the company.

847
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,000
It means

848
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,880
you can't decide this alone.

849
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,440
Jiang Yi.

850
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,550
Tell us

851
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,230
whatever thoughts you have.

852
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,480
We can communicate.

853
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,710
Is this what you call communication?

854
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,070
You are pressing me to obey you.

855
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,230
I'm the prime creator of this game.

856
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm the only one

857
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,150
who knows what this game
is supposed to look like.

858
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,400
You are forcing me

859
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
to alter my creation

860
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,400
into a cheap product

861
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,030
to cater to the market's preference.

862
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,590
If that is the case,

863
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,400
I quit.

864
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,150
Hello?

865
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,800
Is this Huang Yingzi?

866
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,360
Yes, it is me.

867
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,280
May I know who I'm speaking to?

868
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,190
I'm Chloe.

869
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,320
We met before.

870
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,320
I called you

871
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,710
to ask for your help.

872
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,920
About Jiang Yi?

873
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,110
What has happened to him?

874
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,400
He has a conflict with the company

875
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,230
regarding the character design
of "The Maze".

876
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,280
I would like to seek your help

877
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,150
to persuade him

878
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,550
to communicate calmly with the company.

879
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,800
Okay.

880
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,190
Got it.

881
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,480
Hello, do you know where Jiang Yi is?

882
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
In the office, I suppose.

883
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,590
Go straight down that way.

884
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,400
Thank you.

885
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
I like you, Jiang Yi.
