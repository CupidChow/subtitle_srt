[Episode 30]

3
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,120
Yifei,

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,079
is that really you?

5
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,480
I dreamed every day,

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,840
and I always dreamed of you.

7
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,198
But you weren't there anymore

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,000
when I woke up.

9
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,079
I kept asking myself

10
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,000
where you have been.

11
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,319
But I just found out

12
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,800
that I've lost you a long time ago.

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Yifei...

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,919
Yifei,

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm too daft.

16
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,919
If I hadn't left you

17
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
to buy potato chips then,

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
would that stop you
from doing what you did?

19
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,840
Stop blaming yourself.

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,039
I don't blame you at all.

21
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,560
We were all too young

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,879
at that time.

23
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,198
We were not brave enough,

24
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,439
and we didn't know how to face things.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,639
So

26
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,918
that was my own choice.

27
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
I don't blame you at all.

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,719
It's on me.

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,479
It's all my fault!

30
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,399
If only I hadn't left

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,919
and kept you company then,

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,919
you wouldn't have taken your life.

33
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,919
If I gave you a hand at that time,

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,520
we would be growing up together.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,159
You would forget the negative things

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,159
and fulfill your dream.

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,400
You would also get married

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,680
and have children with the man you love.

39
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,960
It's all my fault!

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
It's not.

41
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Yingzi,

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
do you still remember

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,719
what I told you?

44
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,519
I have

45
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,918
always felt

46
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,319
that I'm never a fortunate person,

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
unlike you guys

48
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,960
who have parents who love you.

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,199
I have always

50
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,360
envied you guys,

51
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,360
but

52
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,759
things are different now.

53
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,399
I have my father, my mother,

54
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,120
and my grandmother who love me

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,599
over here.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Everything I wanted before

57
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,759
has all been realized here.

58
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,233
So

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,439
don't worry about me.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,319
I'm having a really good time here.

61
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,199
All these years,

62
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,959
you bear

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
too many of my wishes.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,759
It's time to let go.

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,279
There are so many people who love you

66
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,759
in the world,

67
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
they are all waiting for you.

68
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,279
Please get well soon.

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
But, Yifei,

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,079
are you leaving me again?

71
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,639
Stay, okay?

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
As long as

73
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,399
your heart is

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
always thinking of me,

75
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,240
I will forever

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
and always

77
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,920
be with you.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,879
Do you remember

79
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,920
that game we played together

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,199
when we were kids?

81
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,199
Yes.

82
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,319
Let's play again, shall we?

83
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,800
Sure.

84
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,360
As long as you think of me,

85
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,240
I will always be here.

86
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
Yingzi,

87
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,879
return to your world.

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,519
(Treat this as a little promise)

89
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,800
for our thirties, alright?

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm the witness.

91
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,720
Pinky promise.

92
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,399
Pinky promise.

93
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,519
Stamped.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,279
(Yingzi,)

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,879
(in fact,)

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
(although people leave,)

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
(as long as you)

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
(always,)

99
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,959
(always have her in your heart,)

100
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,680
(she will always be there.)

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Bye now.

102
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,079
(Bye.)

103
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,600
For so many years

104
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,319
you have been hiding
somewhere I can't see,

105
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,279
pretending to be Yifei,

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
because you wanted to keep me company.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,639
Yes.

108
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,879
I have been waiting

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,439
for a better time to tell you.

110
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,160
So you thought of

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,519
the game?

112
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,399
I have no other choice.

113
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,000
I only know this.

114
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,960
If this method fails,

115
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,120
I will keep looking

116
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
until it works.

117
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,480
What if you keep looking
but you can't find any solution?

118
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,159
Do you want to never see me again
for the rest of your life?

119
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
Actually, when I saw you in my vision

120
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
when I was making the game,

121
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,439
I often wonder

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,600
how you'll react

123
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,679
when you see all these.

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
However, as I thought about it,

125
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,240
I became a little afraid to meet you

126
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,879
because I was afraid
you couldn't accept it,

127
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,120
I was even more afraid
that you would forget me.

128
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm the one who should apologize.

129
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,159
All these years,

130
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
I had no idea what happened.

131
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,240
I've been blaming you
for hiding this from me.

132
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
I even blamed you for so many years

133
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,720
because I didn't hear from you at all.

134
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,519
I've been living happily

135
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,759
in my imaginative world

136
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,000
when you were keeping
this secret from me.

137
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
It must be very hard for you.

138
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,159
Not at all.

139
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,120
For you,

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm willing to do anything.

141
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,000
Yifei, I'm late.

142
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,799
Sorry,

143
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,360
I only came to see you now.

144
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,759
I brought you your favorite lilies.

145
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,039
I'm not crying.

146
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,679
Yifei,

147
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,600
it's been a long time
since you saw me, right?

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,759
What do you think?

149
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,039
Have I changed?

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,759
Although you weren't around

151
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,759
these years,

152
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,120
I always felt like I was dreaming

153
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,159
with you around.

154
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,679
(Whenever I was sad, upset,)

155
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,840
(or encountering difficulties,)

156
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,039
(it felt like you were there
encouraging me.)

157
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,879
Yifei,

158
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm a reporter now.

159
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Although I'm not really excellent yet,

160
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,159
I fulfilled my childhood dream

161
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,080
and the promise we made at that time.

162
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm awesome, right?

163
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
I've been alright,

164
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,519
you do not need to worry.

165
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,039
Over the years,

166
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,679
everyone together has woven
a very beautiful dream for me.

167
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,039
In hindsight,

168
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,559
I was pretty useless.

169
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,439
I didn't do anything for anyone.

170
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,519
Yifei, I won't cry anymore.

171
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,720
Do not worry.

172
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,480
I've moved on.

173
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I just...

174
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,759
I just miss you a little.

175
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,120
How are you doing over there?

176
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,679
Have you become

177
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
a great dancer?

178
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm sure no one bullies you anymore

179
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
over there.

180
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,679
If you miss me,

181
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
you should come to my dream for fun.

182
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,480
You can tell me

183
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,159
what you want to eat and do.

184
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
I'll make it happen, okay?

185
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,840
Yifei,

186
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,759
do not worry.

187
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,919
I'll be fine.

188
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,319
We will all be fine.

189
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,159
It's getting late,

190
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,439
they are all waiting for me.

191
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I'll take off first.

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,559
I will come to see you often
in the future.

193
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
Bye, Yifei.

194
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:20,720
Let's go.

195
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,720
Yingzi, do you still remember this?

196
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,519
Isn't this the point-and-shoot camera
that Yifei gave us

197
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,200
during our graduation?

198
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,039
This is what she left for you.

199
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,000
I haven't had the chance
to show this to you these years.

200
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,399
It's time to check it out.

201
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,320
(Yifei, didn't you say
even dummies can use)

202
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,360
(a point-and-shoot camera?)

203
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,439
(Click on this.)

204
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,399
(It's filming.)

205
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,639
(It started filming already.)

206
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,600
(It's filming.)

207
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,000
(What does this mean?)

208
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,039
(This can only mean)

209
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,639
(you are worse than a dummy.)

210
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
(Well, it's already filming.)

211
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,080
(Let's all say one thing to this camera)

212
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,840
(and to our thirty-year-old selves.)

213
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,720
(What kind of trick are you
playing now?)

214
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,559
(Right.)

215
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,320
(It's like we have to write an essay
for an exam.)

216
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,919
(I think this is a pretty good idea.)

217
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,720
(Let's film this down.)

218
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
(This will be memorable.)

219
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,639
(Each of us will keep one copy,)

220
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,320
(and we'll take it out again
when we're 30.)

221
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,960
(How meaningful would that be?)

222
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,840
(That's right.)

223
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
(You understand me well.)

224
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
(Let me think.)

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,879
(I need to think about it.)

226
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,039
(I'll go first.)

227
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,039
(Hello, 30-year-old Huang Yingzi.)

228
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,679
(Not expecting to see me here, are you?)

229
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,679
(At 30,)

230
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
(you must have become
a very famous journalist.)

231
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,639
(There is no justice
that you cannot deliver)

232
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,240
(and no truth that you cannot discover.)

233
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,679
(Let all the bad guys
have nowhere to hide.)

234
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,639
(Is this what a reporter should say?)

235
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
(It sounds so much
like you're quoting One Piece.)

236
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
(Shush. I'm not done yet.)

237
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,720
(I believe that when I'm 30,)

238
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
(these friends around me)

239
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,039
(will still keep you company.)

240
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,519
(No, it should be over 30.)

241
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,920
(When we're all 80,)

242
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,799
(we'll still be together always.)

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,279
(I hope that we won't)

244
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,640
(be forced by you to do
dumb things like this anymore)

245
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,440
(when we're 80.)

246
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,519
(Fine, you can speak now, right?)

247
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,240
(You are the next one.)

248
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,920
(Zhuang Yuan!)

249
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,480
(I'll do the interview.)

250
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,079
(Zhuang Yuan,)

251
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,799
(why do you sit inside this tire)

252
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,799
(every time you come to the rooftop?)

253
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,639
(That's because I like this tire.)

254
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,359
May I ask if you can actually drink

255
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,559
(from this straw?)

256
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,639
(It doesn't matter if I can't,)

257
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,960
(the important thing is to have fun.)

258
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
Are you using this tactic

259
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,640
(to attract girls around you?)

260
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,640
(Fine!)

261
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,799
I'll film.

262
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,319
Thirty-year-old Zhuang Yuan,

263
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,680
I think

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,720
you have become a professor
by that time, right?

265
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,839
No, not necessarily a professor,

266
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
(just do what you like,)

267
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,799
(and that'll suffice.)

268
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,879
Zhuang Yuan is awesome!

269
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,359
(Zhuang Yuan!)

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,880
(Next.)

271
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,839
(I've thought about it.)

272
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,000
(Mingyu!)

273
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
(Is this alright?)

274
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,279
Yes.

275
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,319
I'll make you appear slimmer.

276
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,599
Just my face will suffice.

277
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,359
Sure.

278
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
Hello, 30-year-old Fang Mingyu.

279
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,440
(I don't know where you are)

280
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,640
(and what you are doing,)

281
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,599
(I have to leave you with a question.)

282
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,680
(Are you happy now?)

283
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,480
(I'll be waiting for
your beautiful reply.)

284
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,079
(Alright.)

285
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,359
Mingyu, that was great.

286
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,559
I'm done.

287
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,319
It's your turn.

288
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,440
Who's next?

289
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
(Yifei? Guan Chao?)

290
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,720
(Yifei...)

291
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,000
(Jiang Yi!)

292
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,559
(I have nothing to say.)

293
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
(Why do you always drop the ball?)

294
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,559
(If you don't say anything,)

295
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,680
I'll do it for you.

296
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
I hope that 30-year-old Jiang Yi

297
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
will become a true man.

298
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,599
(What does that mean?)

299
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,799
(Am I not a man?)

300
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,200
(Did you forget when you were little?)

301
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,799
(Wasn't he a crybaby
when he was little?)

302
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,240
(He cried when he couldn't find
his way home after class.)

303
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
(He also cried
when he didn't have toys.)

304
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,240
(Film that down.)

305
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
(Fine, I'll talk.)

306
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,359
(Famous game designer Jiang Yi,)

307
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,240
(I guess now)

308
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
there are many people

309
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
playing your game, right?

310
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,679
But I also guess

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,839
(nobody would be able to defeat you.)

312
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,720
You're so smug.

313
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,160
Alright, it's your turn next,

314
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,599
athletic boy Guan Chao.

315
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,200
Here.

316
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
(Thirty-year-old Guan Chao,)

317
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,359
(you will)

318
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:42,960
(definitely be with)

319
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,759
(your favorite girl,)

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,599
(but you have to promise me)

321
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,759
(to take good care of her.)

322
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,599
(If you dare make her angry,)

323
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,519
(I'll fly over and beat you up.)

324
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't make fun of me.

325
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,960
Stop it.

326
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,799
Next, let's interview

327
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,400
the girl Guan Chao was talking about.

328
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,599
(Don't film me.)

329
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,599
(What's wrong,)

330
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,720
(future dance star?)

331
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,119
(Why are you getting shy?)

332
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,319
(I'll say a few words, then.)

333
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:07,759
(Sure.)

334
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,799
(Hello, 30-year-old Lan Yifei.)

335
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,720
(Hello there.)

336
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,200
(Nice to meet you.)

337
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,440
(I suppose)

338
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
(you have become)

339
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,759
(the principal dancer
of a ballet troupe now.)

340
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,640
(Then,)

341
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,319
(I think you would)

342
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,759
(travel around the world)

343
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,279
(and leave your footprints there.)

344
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,639
(You might even have many fans.)

345
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,160
(You will definitely have fans.)

346
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,000
(Nobody can compete with me by then,)

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,880
(I want to become the president of
Yifei's fan club.)

348
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,279
(Me!)

349
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,240
(I'll be the vice president.)

350
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,960
(Sure.)

351
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,400
(We'll be lifelong members.)

352
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,200
(Sure.)

353
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,680
(Yifei, can you see?)

354
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,160
(Many people like you.)

355
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,879
(I quite envy you.)

356
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,279
(Oh, right.)

357
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,160
(At the age of 30,)

358
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,279
(you should already have)

359
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,680
(a very, very happy family.)

360
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,319
(You might even have an adorable)

361
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,440
(and playful child.)

362
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
(When the family is together,)

363
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,960
(you will be so, so happy.)

364
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,839
(You will never be apart.)

365
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,079
(Together forever!)

366
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,000
(Stop filming!)

367
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,599
(Enough.)

368
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,279
(Let's all talk to)

369
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,319
(our 30-year-old selves.)

370
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,240
(Let's do it together.)

371
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,920
(30 years old!)

372
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,960
(30 years old!)

373
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,880
(30!)

374
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,480
(30!)

375
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,039
(30 years old!)

376
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,680
(30!)

377
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
(30 years old!)

378
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,599
(Is this getting filmed?)

379
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,240
(Yes.)

380
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,119
(30!)

381
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,679
(Is this getting filmed?)

382
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
(Of course.)

383
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,720
(I swear,)

384
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,279
(all of us were filmed.)

385
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,240
(Yingzi,)

386
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,960
(your face isn't showing.)

387
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,519
(Film it again.)

388
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,160
(Do it again.)

389
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,920
(Show your face.)

390
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
(I...)

391
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,920
(I'll hold it for you.)

392
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,559
(Here. Right, Jiang Yi is taller.)

393
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,119
(30 years old!)

394
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,759
(30!)

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,119
(It is)

396
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,279
(August 11, 2008.)

397
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,000
(Those words I said on the rooftop
two months ago)

398
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,720
(may no longer come true.)

399
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,160
(When you see this video,)

400
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,519
(I may not be here anymore.)

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,599
(During this time,)

402
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,039
(I felt like)

403
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,240
(I had a very, very long nightmare.)

404
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,839
(It is finally coming to an end.)

405
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,319
(My friends, I'm sorry)

406
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,039
(I chose this way
to bid farewell to you guys.)

407
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,480
Although I'm gone,

408
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,720
I hope

409
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,599
all of you can be happy

410
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,399
and be brave enough
to live your own lives.

411
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,359
Guan Chao,

412
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,639
I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

413
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,079
I can't go to Beijing with you,

414
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,640
but you must remember
your Olympic dream.

415
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
(You might face many difficulties)

416
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,519
(and suffer a lot in the future,)

417
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,680
(you must not give up.)

418
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,519
(Guan Chao,)

419
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,680
please be happy.

420
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,839
Mingyu,

421
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,200
you are the strongest, the coolest,

422
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,559
(and the most sensible big sister
among us.)

423
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,839
(So when I'm gone,)

424
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
please help me take care of everyone.

425
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,160
Zhuang Yuan,

426
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,319
our academic overachiever,

427
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,039
the life coach of Six of Hangtian City,

428
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,159
(it is a pity)

429
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,440
(that I won't have a chance)

430
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,399
(to hear your life philosophies
anymore.)

431
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,920
However, those dummies need you
very much.

432
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,759
So after I left,

433
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,000
please don't break down.

434
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,079
Jiang Yi,

435
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,359
although you are not with us now,

436
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,440
I will tell you secretly

437
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,559
(that Huang Yingzi)

438
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,399
(actually misses you very much.)

439
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,599
(So after I left,)

440
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,799
(if there's anyone who can
accompany her on my behalf,)

441
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,400
(that person has to be you.)

442
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,920
(You can definitely do it,)

443
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,160
(Yingzi,)

444
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,079
(don't cry.)

445
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:13,686
(You are the one
I worry about the most.)

446
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
(However,)

447
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,759
(I still selfishly made this decision.)

448
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,119
(You must never blame yourself.)

449
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,559
(I'll leave
all the ups and downs of my life)

450
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,639
(in this summer,)

451
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,000
(but)

452
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,519
(I still have many things left to do.)

453
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,119
(I still have many dreams
that have not come true.)

454
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,039
(You have to take my place)

455
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,200
(by living well)

456
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,799
(and helping me finish them.)

457
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,119
(As for you,)

458
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,920
(you have to realize your dream, too.)

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,440
(You must be bold)

460
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,519
(in loving someone
who also loves you very much.)

461
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,440
(Do not ever forget)

462
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,159
(that you are Huang Yingzi
from Hangtian City,)

463
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,240
(the forever sunshine of the six of us.)

464
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,960
Alright, friends.

465
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,160
(Bye now,)

466
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,359
(my friends.)

467
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,960
We have waited for this day
for far too long.

468
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,319
Yes, way too long.

469
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,319
We finally made it.

470
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,119
What's wrong?

471
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,200
Nothing.

472
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
You've looked troubled
since you got home.

473
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,679
You didn't eat much food either.

474
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,519
What's up? Do you think I can't see it?

475
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,319
Yingzi is back.

476
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
We went to visit Yifei together.

477
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,000
How is Yingzi?

478
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,799
She finally stepped out of it,

479
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,920
we can finally let it go.

480
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,279
Chao,

481
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
from now on,

482
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,359
if you miss her,

483
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,799
I will follow you to visit her.

484
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,680
Thank you, Yang Fan.

485
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,440
We are family.

486
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,720
Why so courteous?

487
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
Since Yifei's departure,

488
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,640
my father left, too.

489
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,799
I used to think that I was
the most unfortunate person

490
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,045
in the world

491
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,480
until I met you.

492
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,559
We even have a child together.

493
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,160
I finally think

494
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,480
the world

495
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,559
turns out to be fair.

496
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:42,599
Hello?

497
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,880
Alright.

498
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,519
Thanks.

499
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,559
What's wrong?

500
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,960
Grandma is not in good health.

501
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,759
Look at all of you making such a fuss.

502
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,759
It was just a fall.

503
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,879
I was even rushed to the hospital.

504
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,919
Why didn't you listen?

505
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,759
The doctor said you're not allowed
to be discharged,

506
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,119
but you just had to flee.

507
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,799
I can't get used to the hospital bed.

508
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,799
As soon as I open my eyes,
I see a blank white wall.

509
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,000
People come to check on me every time.

510
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,079
How uncomfortable.

511
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,720
Grandma, we have to follow
the doctor's orders.

512
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,200
I know my own body,

513
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,839
it's no big deal.

514
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,559
The doctor just likes scaring me.

515
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,000
Grandma, don't worry.

516
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,079
Just leave the wanton shop

517
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,240
to us from now on.

518
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,200
You, just go home and have a good rest.

519
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,920
You are all lecturing me.

520
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,960
If I rest,

521
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,559
who will make you wontons?

522
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,599
You don't come back often,

523
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,159
how can you go back
with empty stomachs?

524
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
I was lying on the hospital bed

525
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,079
when I thought

526
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,319
life and death are up to fate.

527
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,359
If something really went wrong
after the fall,

528
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,720
that is my destiny.

529
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,160
It's no use being cautious.

530
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,440
No, Grandma.

531
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,519
Touch wood.

532
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,400
Guan Chao's child isn't born yet,

533
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
you haven't become
a great-grandmother yet.

534
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,480
How could you say such a thing?

535
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,400
Grandma, he's right.

536
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,559
And we

537
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,039
haven't even gotten married yet.

538
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,359
You have to be there for us
as we get married and have children.

539
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,759
You have to give us red envelopes.

540
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,639
Indeed.

541
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,039
All of you are aware of this.

542
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
Grandma,

543
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,000
what do you want to do

544
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,039
if the wonton shop
is closed for a few days?

545
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,559
Well, I used to want
to do a lot of things.

546
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,799
I wanted to travel and have adventures

547
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:57,639
but I stayed in Hangtian City
for close to a lifetime now.

548
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,559
I got old as I stayed here.

549
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,439
Grandma,

550
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,039
isn't it a pity

551
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,440
that you never left Hangtian City?

552
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,680
I just hope

553
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,880
all of you can live
different lives from mine.

554
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,440
Just seeing you all live well

555
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,359
makes my life complete.

556
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,559
Why didn't you tell us

557
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,960
about Grandma's condition?

558
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,200
She is afraid that you will worry

559
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,440
so she specially asked me

560
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,799
to hide it from you.

561
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,839
It's all my fault.

562
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,039
She wouldn't have fallen

563
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,799
if I stayed with her all the time.

564
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,359
Don't think that way.

565
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,079
Grandma is old.

566
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,720
It's not your fault.

567
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,279
When I was little, I used to think
Grandma was like a superwoman.

568
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,000
It's like whenever we talk to her
about something,

569
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,359
she would assure us that it's fine

570
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,919
and help us solve it.

571
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,160
I always thought

572
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,359
when I become capable,

573
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,079
I'll be good to her.

574
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,519
Now that we are all capable,

575
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,440
Grandma does not have much time left.

576
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,599
Let's

577
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
stop feeling bad here.

578
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,359
We should think about

579
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,079
what we can do for her

580
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,639
in her remaining time.

581
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,319
What else can we do?

582
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,599
Have you already forgotten
what she just said?

583
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,119
(Grandma,)

584
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,039
don't you want to leave Hangtian City?

585
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,240
We came up with an itinerary
for you overnight.

586
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,200
Jiang Yi, tell us about it.

587
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,720
Right.

588
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,160
This is it.

589
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,280
Grandma, look.

590
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,079
This is Jiuzhai Valley.

591
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,480
This is Yulong Snow Mountain.

592
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,280
This is Xi Lake.

593
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,519
This is Huangguoshu Waterfall.

594
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
My arms and legs are old,

595
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,320
can I still visit so many places?

596
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,518
You're not old at all.

597
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,678
I was thinking of taking you
to ride elephants in Thailand.

598
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,119
Elephants are huge,

599
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,800
I wouldn't dare to climb up.

600
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,678
Fine, let's play it safe, then.

601
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,480
Huangpu River.

602
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,599
What do you think about Huangpu River?

603
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,719
Aren't you used to love

604
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,960
watching "The Bund" the most?

605
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,000
Huangpu River sounds good.

606
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,559
Huangpu River sounds good.

607
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,519
Huangpu River is good.

608
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,039
Let's go straight north after Shanghai.

609
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,159
Let's go see the Great Wall

610
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,119
and Tiananmen.

611
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,519
Let me check.

612
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,159
We can go to Hulunbuir Prairie straight,

613
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,480
and finally Yunnan.

614
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,400
The weather

615
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,239
and temperature there are ideal.

616
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,199
You can stay there
for as long as you want.

617
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,079
You want me
to travel across the country?

618
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,960
That's not really enough.

619
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,039
After traveling all over the country,

620
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,199
we'll take you
to travel around the world.

621
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
That's great.

622
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,119
I must visit

623
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,760
all the places I haven't been to
in one go.

624
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,519
Do not worry.

625
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,638
No matter where you want to go,

626
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,760
we'll keep you company.

627
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,559
Grandma, do you remember?

628
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,840
The first time we left Hangtian City

629
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,159
was because of you.

630
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
Yingzi.

631
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,239
Are you working hard?

632
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,320
Remember to take breaks.

633
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,159
Got it.

634
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,000
Look. Do you see it?

635
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,679
This is

636
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,800
where Stephanie Sun will have
her Beijing concert.

637
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,920
It would be great
if we were born in Beijing.

638
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,400
Not only could we watch the concert,

639
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,480
we could also watch the Olympics.

640
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,159
I have always wanted to
go to Qingbei University.

641
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,320
I heard the campus is pretty nice.

642
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,159
I haven't had a chance to see it.

643
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,039
Besides, there is a National Library
in Beijing

644
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,679
with more books than you can read
in a lifetime in there.

645
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,519
Stop grabbing my hair.

646
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,479
The Olympic Games are about to start.

647
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,719
I, the future world champion,

648
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,800
don't even know where the entrance
of National Stadium is.

649
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,719
Right, we have never left Hangtian City.

650
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,760
We don't know what big cities

651
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,199
like Beijing and Shanghai are like.

652
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,400
We only saw them on the television.

653
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,479
Want to go to Beijing?

654
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,159
Isn't that simple?

655
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,800
Let's just go.

656
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,840
Us? To Beijing?

657
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,159
I really do want to go there.

658
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,599
We actually want to go, too.

659
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,679
If you want to go to Beijing,

660
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,920
don't count me in.

661
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,320
I'm not interested.

662
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,920
Why?

663
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,000
If all of us are really

664
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,239
going to Beijing

665
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,559
and leaving you in Hangtian City alone,

666
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,679
are you going to cry out of jealousy?

667
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,000
Right, Jiang Yi.

668
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,599
Let's go.

669
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,199
Six of Hangtian City

670
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,000
wouldn't be complete without you.

671
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,360
Let's not talk about Beijing first.

672
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,639
I have one question.

673
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,039
Do you have money

674
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,239
to travel to Beijing?

675
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,320
Sir, how much for
the leopard coral grouper?

676
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,039
I usually sell these

677
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,079
for 148 yuan per pound.

678
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll make it 140 yuan per pound for you.

679
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,360
It is what it is.

680
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,599
Pick a big one for me.

681
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,480
Sure.

682
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
That's quite generous.

683
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,679
It's not an easy job, they get up early
and stay up late at night.

684
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,079
We can't take advantage of them.

685
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,280
Look at that old lady
selling duck eggs.

686
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,800
She had to spend a huge amount
because she was sick.

687
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,760
Wang who sells tofu

688
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,639
also needs money
to send his brother to college.

689
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,039
Zhang who sells pork...

690
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,800
What's up with Zhang?

691
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,599
Just say it.

692
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,320
Don't keep me in suspense.

693
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,079
He lost thousands of yuan
buying lottery tickets.

694
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,039
If his wife found out,

695
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,760
Hangtian City

696
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,920
would see another bloody storm.

697
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,840
Dad, you are eager to help others.

698
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,159
You should also sponsor your daughter.

699
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,039
Crabs, oysters, red king crab,

700
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,639
take whichever one you like.

701
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't want these.

702
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,559
Stationery, CDs, extracurricular books,

703
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,960
these are nothing.

704
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,360
No, I don't want these.

705
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,559
Aren't those what you like?

706
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,280
What's the matter? What do you want?

707
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,239
I want to go to Beijing.

708
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,320
That's far.

709
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,039
Have you ever traveled this far?

710
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,439
I want to go

711
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,519
because I've never been there.

712
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,519
Just let me know

713
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,759
when your plan is ready.

714
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,360
No,

715
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,199
I want you to sponsor me.

716
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,000
How much?

717
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,320
Not much.

718
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,639
The ticket plus the round-trip expenses

719
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,639
are around 1,000 yuan.

720
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,880
Dear,

721
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,039
let me tell you a secret.

722
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,840
About that lottery ticket
that Zhang bought,

723
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,679
I bought it with him

724
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,400
so...

725
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,400
The fish is ready, right?

726
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,280
Coming.

727
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,480
Men are all liars.

728
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,840
You're having a concert?

729
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,638
Serve this for me.

730
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:17,920
Yes.

731
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:24,840
Mom,

732
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,880
I heard that Dad looked like Danny Chan

733
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,119
when he was young,

734
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,000
Is that true?

735
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,759
Why would you compare
your father to Danny Chan?

736
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
He can't even compare
to one strand of his hair.

737
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,960
What do you mean?

738
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,920
Yingzi, listen.

739
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,400
Danny Chan

740
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,039
used to be

741
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,840
the prince charming

742
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,960
in many girls' hearts.

743
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,440
He was handsome,

744
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,199
and he sang passionately.

745
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,719
Our female classmates secretly agreed

746
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,840
that someday

747
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,079
they would definitely

748
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,320
go to his concert
and listen to him sing live.

749
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Yet, I never got to listen to it
as I got old,

750
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,519
it has become a lifelong regret for me.

751
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,480
How tormenting!

752
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,960
Mom,

753
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,840
do you wish your daughter

754
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
to have lifelong regrets just like you?

755
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,199
What do you mean?

756
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,280
Stefanie Sun will have a concert
in Beijing next month.

757
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,959
Can you sponsor me a ticket?

758
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,920
No.

759
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,400
Didn't we have a good chat just now?

760
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,760
You just said

761
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,000
it was a huge pity for you

762
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that you never saw Danny Chan.

763
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,119
Can't you understand my feelings?

764
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,039
I was only halfway done
with my sentence.

765
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Sure.

766
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,280
It was indeed a regret
that I never saw Danny Chan,

767
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,960
but what I regret more is

768
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,599
because I was addicted
to listening to music,

769
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,880
I did not put much effort
in my studies.

770
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,559
I didn't even get into college.

771
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,199
I will definitely go...

772
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
Not only did I not get into college,

773
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,960
I also met your father,

774
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,320
the counterfeit version of Danny Chan.

775
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,880
With a small ponytail

776
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,639
and singing a couple of lines
of a Cantonese song,

777
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,840
he managed to win my heart.

778
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,199
Tell me, don't you think
idolizing celebrities can be harmful?

779
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:57,880
Listen,

780
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,400
there's no way I'm going to
let my daughter make the same mistake.

781
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,159
Even Danny Chan doesn't help.

782
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,199
Mom, this is my monthly exam result.

783
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,360
I did particularly well this time,

784
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,239
I got first place.

785
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,159
Son,

786
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,760
the nearer you are to
the third year of high school,

787
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,360
the more potential you seem to have.

788
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,880
Are you tired, Mom?

789
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,519
Let me reward you
by treating you to a meal outside.

790
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,279
What do you think?

791
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,639
Mom, I don't want to eat outside.

792
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:32,840
What do you want, then?

793
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm thinking...

794
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,719
I want to go to Beijing.

795
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,559
Beijing is good.

796
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:42,159
You should try Qingbei University
based on your result.

797
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,039
If you get in,

798
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,239
I will follow you there.

799
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,239
I'm not talking about the future,

800
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,360
I mean now.

801
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,119
Why do you want to go to Beijing now?

802
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,920
Me, Yingzi, Jiang Yi, and the others

803
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,239
agreed to go for a Beijing trip.

804
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,480
Listen, have you ever traveled far?

805
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,559
That is precisely the reason

806
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,519
I want to go.

807
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,320
Let me ask you again,

808
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,000
have you considered safety issues?

809
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,280
Have you considered the feasibility
of this matter?

810
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,719
Does Guan Chao's family have money?

811
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,360
There's also Yifei.

812
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:10,920
If you go,

813
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,880
how about Grandma?

814
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,800
Even if I agree,

815
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
will Fang Mingyu's mother

816
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,679
and Huang Yingzi's mother agree?

817
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,719
Mom, just let me go.

818
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:23,159
Stop it. No way.

819
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,519
Mom,

820
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,399
I want to leave Hangtian City

821
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,199
and visit Beijing with my friends.

822
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:28,639
What's wrong with that?

823
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,400
Can't I?

824
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,480
Are you blaming me now?

825
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,320
Go ask Huang Yingzi's parents, then.

826
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,440
I will not stop you

827
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,800
if they agree.

828
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,440
I'll get last place in the next exam.

829
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:43,639
Brat.

830
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,800
Essential items for studying
and entertainment.

831
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,960
Would you mind taking a look?

832
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
Why didn't I think of selling books?

833
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,639
Must-have books for entertainment
and learning.

834
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,840
Mingyu.

835
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,800
I may really not be able
to go to Beijing.

836
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,239
Don't be so pessimistic.

837
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,280
What if Yingzi convinces her parents?

838
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,360
Her parents can advise your mother

839
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,440
and you'll have hope.

840
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,199
Don't you know my mother?

841
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,400
She just said it casually.

842
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,280
Even if Yingzi's parents
allow her to go,

843
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,679
she still won't let me go.

844
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
That's true.

845
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,239
Luckily,

846
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,880
I didn't tell my parents at all.

847
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,719
I have to rely on myself.

848
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,320
If my sales are alright,

849
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,679
I can help you with it.

850
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,159
Come take a look,

851
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:44,679
does anyone want to buy books?

852
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,519
We have all kinds of books here.

853
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,359
Check these out.

854
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,159
We have all kinds of books here.

855
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,559
Well,

856
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,159
do you have that kind of book

857
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,119
with extremely thrilling plots?

858
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,639
Thrilling?

859
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,519
Not this kind.

860
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:09,158
I mean

861
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,079
plots that make your heart beat faster.

862
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,559
It makes your heart beat faster.

863
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,598
No.

864
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,639
Don't you understand?

865
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,400
I mean

866
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:27,279
the kind where people my age

867
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,639
would enjoy very much.

868
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,719
After reading, men will be silent

869
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,360
and women will cry.

870
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,440
Do you know what I mean?

871
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,719
Do you get it?

872
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,719
Why would I have such a book here?

873
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,320
Then there is nothing?

874
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm not buying, then.

875
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:48,480
Wait!
