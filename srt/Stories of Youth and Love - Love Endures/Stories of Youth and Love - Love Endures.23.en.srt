[Episode 23]

2
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,680
Huang Yingzi.

3
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,920
Why are you here?

4
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,598
I'm here to fetch you home.

5
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,359
Let's go.

6
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,599
What's wrong?

7
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,079
It's nothing.

8
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm just tired from work.

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
I need you to recharge my battery.

10
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,598
You can lie down, then.

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,719
Who is this?

12
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,198
Why is he sending you
messages late at night?

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,159
No.

14
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,918
It's an advertisement.

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,159
Jiang Yi.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
I feel like something
is going to happen to Ding Ye.

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
He's not responding on WeChat

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,159
or replying to my messages.

19
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,478
Why are you talking about Ding Ye again?

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Hasn't the reading event
that you organized for him

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,719
already concluded?

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,400
I think

23
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,039
he's acting oddly.

24
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,319
Isn't he always odd?

25
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,319
No.

26
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,360
It's different this round.

27
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,519
Huang Yingzi,

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,319
don't you think

29
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,918
you're too sensitive about Ding Ye?

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
I hope so.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,919
I hope that I'm just too sensitive.

32
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,638
What's wrong?

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,639
Are you upset?

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,599
I'll be honest.

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,919
I never once

36
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,439
doubted our relationship.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,719
But sometimes I'd wonder.

38
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,879
Did you choose to date me

39
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,680
because

40
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,919
you were already used to me?

41
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,839
Or

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,919
are you just

43
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,319
missing the time

44
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,560
we spent together?

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,759
Jiang Yi.

46
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,280
Why would you think so?

47
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,879
Okay.

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Speaking of habits,

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm more used

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
to being friends with you.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
Speaking of missing the past,

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,000
I miss

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
the days we spent together as a couple.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,719
I'm dating you

55
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,759
as I love you.

56
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,478
I like you.

57
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,960
I want to be with you.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,280
This has never changed
since we were young.

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,918
I thought you'd understand,
even if I didn't say it.

60
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,120
How could you think like that?

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
Fine.

62
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Be honest with me.

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,519
What happened to him?

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,600
Why are you helping him to this extent?

65
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,879
I promised him

66
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,120
that I wouldn't tell anyone.

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,199
But rest assured,

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,959
I'll surely tell you

69
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,399
when I have the chance.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
Huang Yingzi.

71
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,719
Perhaps to you,

72
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,600
friends are more important.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
No, Jiang Yi.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
If that's so,

75
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,600
let's go back to being friends.

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,639
I'm leaving.

77
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,519
Jiang Yi.

78
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,120
Yingzi.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Have you seen

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
Ding Ye's latest news?

81
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,439
News?

82
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,319
The editor

83
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,639
who exposed him
for harassing a female passenger

84
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,920
has released new news.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
She managed

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
to reveal Ding Ye's dark past.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,120
She even scrutinized your articles,
word by word,

88
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
and interpreted the underlying meanings.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
It's going viral on the Internet.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,639
Unknown dark past

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,279
of Ding Ye, an ex-best-selling author.

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
The article even stated

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,040
that he caused the death
of his best friend in college.

94
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,519
No.

95
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,040
How is that possible?

96
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
This is completely nonsense.

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm not sure how credible this is,

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,120
but the article's

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,639
analysis seems well-founded.

100
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,920
It satisfies the audience's imagination.

101
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll call Ding Ye.

102
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,800
Don't be anxious.

103
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,959
He's really weird.

104
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
He gave me

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,759
all the books in his collection.

106
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,680
I had a glance at it.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,079
These books

108
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,920
were sourced by him.

109
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,199
Yet, he's giving all of them to me now.

110
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,199
He doesn't want the books anymore?

111
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,199
He said

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,439
he wouldn't read it anymore.

113
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,199
What else did he say?

114
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,600
That's right.

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
He has two books for you.

116
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,000
Here you go.

117
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,040
Has he ever acted like this previously?

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,720
He's been a little strange recently.

119
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
As an author,

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
it's normal to face a writing block.

121
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
Why is he so depressed?

122
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,279
Did he tell you

123
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,000
where he was going?

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,399
No.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,959
Thank you.

126
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,560
Thank you.

127
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,200
Hello.

128
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,480
Ding Ye.

129
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,919
You're finally picking up your phone.

130
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,960
Where are you?

131
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll go to you.

132
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,679
Ding Ye.

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
I know you've seen
the posts on the Internet.

134
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,360
I saw it too.

135
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,759
Don't bother these people.

136
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,919
It's all nonsense.

137
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,720
They did this for fame.

138
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,360
I've completed the bucket list.

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
Don't look for me.

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Ding Ye.

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Ding...

142
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,000
Hello?

143
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,559
(If, after we died,)

144
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,079
(we ended up like a whale fall,)

145
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,360
(nourishing the sea with its carcass,)

146
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,279
(seeking peace on the ocean floor,)

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
(death)

148
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,879
(wouldn't be that scary after all.)

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,080
The sound of waves.

150
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,079
Come in.

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,519
Chloe.

152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,080
I need

153
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
your favor.

154
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,840
Have a seat.

155
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,120
What's the matter?

156
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
What happened?

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,000
I hope you can host a presentation

158
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,279
about

159
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960
the encrypted part of Sky City.

160
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,559
I was about to talk to you about this.

161
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,639
Why are you agreeing to this now?

162
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,960
I know,

163
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
if I can't

164
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,279
explain to the company,

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,879
the project will be canceled.

166
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,159
I don't have time to waste.

167
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,120
Okay.

168
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
That's all.

169
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll get going.

170
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,120
Okay.

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Oh yes.

172
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,559
This morning, Ding Ye

173
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,439
suddenly transferred
all his earnings from his copyrights

174
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,480
to a foundation.

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,639
Strangely enough,

176
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,120
the person handling the matter

177
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,759
is a succession lawyer.

178
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
He's still healthy.

179
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,679
Why is he handling his will now?

180
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,519
Jiang Yi.

181
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,519
Where are you?

182
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,759
I'm at the seaside in Jiangzhou.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,399
What?

184
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,639
Your connection is poor.

185
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,639
Which seaside are you at?

186
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,159
No. Hello?

187
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,240
Hello?

188
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,720
Jiang Yi.

189
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,720
Hello?

190
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,399
Ding Ye.

191
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,039
(When night falls,)

192
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
(the lights in different brightness)

193
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,079
(and different temperatures)

194
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,480
(leave various traces)

195
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,960
(on our retinas due to the distance,)

196
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,759
(forming a picture)

197
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,840
(of an ever-changing neon map.)

198
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,839
He went to a high place,

199
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
wanting to overlook
the city, yet he realized

200
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,919
that the so-called
glimmering city lights

201
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,000
had faded away.

202
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,039
(Lu Dong could only see)

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,039
(thousands and millions of noctiluca,)

204
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,159
(repeating the cycle)

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,399
(of flying,)

206
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,000
(entanglement, competition,)

207
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,960
and death.

208
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
Special thanks
to the guitar accompaniment,

209
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
Shi Xiaohuan.

210
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,200
Ding Ye!

211
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Ding Ye!

212
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,879
Huang Yingzi?

213
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,960
Why do you come here?

214
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,679
I'm worried about you.

215
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,159
You're not upset anymore, are you?

216
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,759
I'm sorry for saying

217
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,960
harsh things to you

218
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,559
and being petty.

219
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,879
I should be the one apologizing.

220
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,600
Let's not talk about this.

221
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,320
Do you have news about Ding Ye?

222
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,519
I tried to look for him

223
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,960
but to no avail.

224
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm really worried...

225
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,039
That he might commit suicide?

226
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,039
Did you know?

227
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,480
Chloe told me

228
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,080
that he was handling
his assets for the will.

229
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,399
I roughly guessed it.

230
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,879
Are you sure that he's here?

231
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
During my last call with him,

232
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,679
I heard the sound of waves.

233
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,279
I wanted to try my luck here.

234
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,879
It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

235
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,960
Don't you have other clues?

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,240
He left me with two books.

237
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,320
These books.

238
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,159
What's this?

239
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,720
Let's go.

240
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,240
Hurry up.

241
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,919
- Ding Ye.
- Ding Ye.

242
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,360
- Ding Ye.
- Ding Ye.

243
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,960
Ding Ye!

244
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,159
Ding Ye!

245
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,000
Ding Ye!

246
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,840
Ding Ye!

247
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,919
Ding Ye!

248
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,319
Calm down.

249
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,919
He might not be here.

250
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,759
- Ding Ye.
- Ding Ye.

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,200
Didn't I ask you not to look for me?

252
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,559
You told me over the phone

253
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,519
that you'd completed your bucket list.

254
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,799
I thought...

255
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,120
Didn't you ask

256
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,759
if my bucket list was true?

257
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,519
The list is real.

258
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,799
But it isn't my bucket list.

259
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,279
I have a childhood friend.

260
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,799
His name is Shi Xiaohuan.

261
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,319
I like literature,

262
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,600
while he likes music.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,879
I know.

264
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,960
He's your best friend.

265
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,480
Well, where

266
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,799
is Shi Xiaohuan?

267
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,960
He's dead.

268
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,399
It was a suicide.

269
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,079
The time spent with him

270
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,400
was the happiest moment in my life.

271
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,240
(Xiaohuan's music
is really extraordinary.)

272
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,720
(Accompanied
by the melody of his guitar,)

273
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,119
(when I read the novels I wrote,)

274
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,879
(the words appear deeper)

275
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
(and more meaningful.)

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,359
(Without his company,)

277
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,119
(it's impossible for me
to get a spark of idea.)

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
How's your new novel going?

279
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,000
I think my first three books

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,519
have used up all my ideas.

281
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,319
I don't want

282
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,720
to repeat my ideas.

283
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,519
But I really don't know
what to write about.

284
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,680
You can never find your true self

285
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
without going through ordeals.

286
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,559
You won't be able
to produce better work either.

287
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,119
What if I couldn't

288
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,960
be your reader anymore one day?

289
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,079
Why?

290
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,920
It's nothing.

291
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,519
It's just

292
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,400
that I want to travel.

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,920
Do it, then.

294
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,240
It's good to travel around the world.

295
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,759
Have you seen Blue Tears?

296
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:28,480
No.

297
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,079
What are they?

298
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
It's said that they are beautiful

299
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,240
and surreal.

300
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,839
(I didn't know)

301
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,599
(that Xiaohuan had
severe depression all along.)

302
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,319
(It was like any other normal day.)

303
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,480
(I was still talking)

304
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,039
(about my novel,)

305
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,200
(while Xiaohuan
was quietly listening to me.)

306
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,039
(Only then did I realize)

307
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,519
(that he was saying his last goodbye.)

308
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,039
(Xiaohuan left.)

309
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,119
(He didn't leave anything behind)

310
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,839
(apart from his bucket list.)

311
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,240
So, your bucket list

312
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,119
actually belongs to your friend?

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,599
Yes.

314
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,399
We wrote that as a joke
when we were little.

315
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Ironically,

316
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,240
the playful list is now

317
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,599
my only connection

318
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,720
with Xiaohuan in this world.

319
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,799
I spent a decade

320
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,880
to complete the list.

321
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,720
I thought I could finally let this go

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
and somehow feel contented.

323
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,960
However, as I stood in the sea,

324
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
watching the vast ocean,

325
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,799
with Xiaohuan in my thoughts,

326
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,639
all I felt was the emptiness.

327
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,240
A despairing emptiness.

328
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
How do I navigate the days ahead?

329
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,119
Can I face it?

330
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,799
Should I face it?

331
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,199
Should I just commit suicide
like Xiaohuan

332
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,839
to end all the troubles

333
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,440
since I have

334
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,480
nothing to miss in this world?

335
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,640
But I don't have the courage.

336
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,759
After listening to your story,

337
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,359
I don't know why,

338
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,079
but I can empathize with you.

339
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't know why,

340
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,599
but it feels like

341
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,519
I've experienced this as well.

342
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,000
All right.

343
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,519
Since you've tried it,

344
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,640
let's not trouble ourselves anymore.

345
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
I mean,

346
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,160
if your friend were still alive,

347
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,160
he wouldn't hope
to see you in this state.

348
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,319
He'd definitely hope

349
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,000
that you could live a happy life

350
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,720
and live a fulfilling life

351
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,240
on his behalf.

352
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,279
He's right.

353
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Your friend wouldn't wish

354
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
to see you in despair.

355
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,200
He'd certainly hope

356
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,759
that you could write greater works.

357
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,960
Without a reader,

358
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,200
it's meaningless to be an author.

359
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Of course you have readers.

360
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,359
You have a lot of loyal readers.

361
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,799
I'm one of them.

362
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,639
He is, too.

363
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,839
He's your reader too.

364
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,440
Have you ever thought about it, Ding Ye?

365
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,039
Xiaohuan wanted

366
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,759
to pull you out of the darkness,

367
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,960
so he left you his bucket list.

368
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,200
When I was just getting to know you,

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,920
you looked really upset
with your poker face.

370
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
However, after our roller coaster ride,

371
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,079
aquarium trip,

372
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,720
and sunrise,

373
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,519
I noticed you'd cheered up.

374
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,279
I guess that's the purpose
behind the bucket list.

375
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,200
Well.

376
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,599
Look.

377
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
How gorgeous the sunset is.

378
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,400
Am I right?

379
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

380
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,359
Sunset and sunrise

381
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
feel totally different,

382
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,839
but they are both pretty.

383
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,759
(The message changes every night,)

384
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,599
(but there's no instruction)

385
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,159
(to help Lu Dong find Zhang Fan.)

386
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,279
(He runs not to search,)

387
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,839
(as Lu Dong has no direction.)

388
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,279
Let's go.

389
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,279
Where are we going?

390
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,319
Thank you.

391
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,559
Your sudden presence

392
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,000
makes me realize
that someone still cares

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,559
about me in this world.

394
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Well,

395
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,599
the world is still lovely.

396
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,160
There is so much good food
waiting for us to discover

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
and new friends we should get to make.

398
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,119
Isn't that so?

399
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,319
New friends,

400
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,319
as in you?

401
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Can't we be your new friends?

402
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,759
You don't have to thank me.

403
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,720
We're even now.

404
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,639
When I was at my lowest in high school,

405
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,720
you replied to my letter
and encouraged me.

406
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,000
I was just

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,359
returning your favor.

408
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,599
Didn't I tell you already?

409
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,519
I really didn't write that letter.

410
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,279
I understand.

411
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,880
You think that the letter you wrote then

412
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,480
is cringey,

413
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,960
so you don't want to admit it, right?

414
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,639
I know.

415
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,720
Okay, let's not talk about it, then.

416
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,400
No.

417
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,079
Back then, I received
a lot of letters from my readers.

418
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,799
I didn't know you back then.

419
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,000
Why would I reply to your letter?

420
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,159
You didn't write it?

421
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,000
Who wrote it, then?

422
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,159
Who knows?

423
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,639
It might be one of your admirers.

424
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
The boys who liked me then

425
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,279
were Liao Xing, Zhu Baoming,

426
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,519
and you.

427
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,759
Did you write the letter?

428
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,640
No.

429
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,359
That's impossible.

430
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,559
All right.

431
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,839
Stop the PDA.

432
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,079
What do you plan to do next?

433
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,919
I haven't thought of it yet.

434
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,439
I might start writing

435
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,720
my new story.

436
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,200
Can you reveal some sneak peeks,

437
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
the great author?

438
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,400
I haven't thought of it yet.

439
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,960
But are you willing
to be my first reader?

440
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,000
Of course!

441
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,799
Pinky swear.

442
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,039
Pinky swear.

443
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,039
Cheers.

444
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,720
So back then,

445
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
the letters from Ding Ye

446
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,839
were from you.

447
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,759
That's right.

448
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,159
Someone

449
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,759
was so upset then.

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,359
She kept lingering around me.

451
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,359
I found her bothersome.

452
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,799
Why didn't you tell me, then?

453
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
The same one

454
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,839
also told me firmly,

455
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
"I'll definitely meet Ding Ye one day.

456
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,839
I empathize with his novels,

457
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,440
so we'll surely be friends."

458
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,159
You were so confident about it.

459
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,039
I couldn't bear to burst your bubble.

460
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
You copied his handwriting,

461
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
and it looked exactly the same.

462
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
You put a lot
of effort into it, didn't you?

463
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,799
Well, it's nothing much.

464
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,839
His handwriting

465
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,039
is easy to copy.

466
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,160
So,

467
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
you, the weak student, were the one

468
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,359
who helped me
overcome the low point in my academics.

469
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,839
So, what you've been keeping a secret

470
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,480
is his bucket list?

471
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,599
That's right.

472
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,079
I made a promise,

473
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,359
so I must not break it.

474
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,960
I'm sorry

475
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,559
for making you jealous.

476
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,399
Who's jealous?

477
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,440
How is it possible?

478
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,799
Do you still remember

479
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,240
the nickname I gave you
when we were little?

480
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,759
Nickname?

481
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,319
Bull-Headed Jiang.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,440
Okay, fine.

483
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,359
What's wrong?

484
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,200
Hey, we're a couple now.

485
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,720
This is what friends do together.

486
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,279
Stop hugging me like that.

487
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Come here.

488
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,680
Is this okay?

489
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,119
You must have searched for me

490
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,559
for a long while by the seaside, right?

491
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,240
Well, it's nothing.

492
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,319
You're so huge. I found you right away.

493
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,319
Hey!

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,880
The coastline is so long.

495
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,200
How did you find me?

496
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,079
Didn't I tell you?

497
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
No matter where you are,

498
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,039
I'll surely find you.

499
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,039
I don't want to play
the handkerchief game.

500
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
That's for juniors in kindergarten.

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,799
We're seniors now.

502
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,519
What do you want to play, then?

503
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,519
Let's play Eagle and Chicks.

504
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,079
I want to be the almighty eagle.

505
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,680
No.

506
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,640
We're slower than you.

507
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,680
Let's play Rubber Band Skipping.

508
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,920
That game is for girls.

509
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,720
Let's play Hide and Seek, then.

510
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
The last person who's still hiding wins.

511
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,720
I don't want to hide.

512
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,680
If I stained my shirt,

513
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
my mom would nag me.

514
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,799
You can catch us, then.

515
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,839
Fine.

516
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,839
Ninety-nine.

517
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Ninety-eight.

518
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,720
Ninety-seven.

519
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,279
Ninety-six.

520
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,799
Ninety-five.

521
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,519
Ninety-four.

522
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,480
Huang Yingzi.

523
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,359
Where are you heading to?

524
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:04,960
Ninety-two.

525
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,279
I'm going to a place
where no one else can find me.

526
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
Eighty-nine.

527
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,799
Eighty-eight.

528
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,319
Three, two, one.

529
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,599
Start.

530
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,000
I got you.

531
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,839
I got you!

532
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,200
Come on.

533
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,119
I got you!

534
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,640
Come on.

535
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,759
Let's find the rest.

536
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,039
Haven't you found Huang Yingzi yet?

537
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
- No.
- No.

538
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
Has she gone home already?

539
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,839
That's right.

540
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,599
She must have run back home

541
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,039
in order to win us.

542
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,839
She did that previously too.

543
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's go home, then.

544
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,000
If I don't go home now,

545
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,839
my parents will get worried.

546
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,480
Well, let's go, then.

547
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,079
Come on.

548
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
Let's see who will reach home first.

549
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,519
Is anyone there?

550
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,319
Save me.

551
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,480
Yifei.

552
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
Mingyu.

553
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,640
Are you there?

554
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,119
Huang Yingzi.

555
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,480
Please help me!

556
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,279
Huang Yingzi.

557
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,400
Where are you, Huang Yingzi?

558
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,519
Huang Yingzi.

559
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,200
Huang Yingzi.

560
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,559
I'm here, Jiang Yi.

561
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,680
Jiang Yi.

562
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,799
I'm here, Jiang Yi.

563
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,079
Don't be scared.

564
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,119
I'll stay by your side.

565
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,919
The adults are coming to pick us up.

566
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,279
I thought

567
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,599
you'd left me behind.

568
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,399
I won't.

569
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,319
No matter where you are,

570
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,720
I'll find you.

571
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,319
Stop crying.

572
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,480
Jiang Yi. I didn't expect you

573
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,519
to have feelings for me since then!

574
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,400
I didn't.

575
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,359
You cried so pathetically

576
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,199
and even got all snotty.

577
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,839
Who would like you?

578
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:09,759
Then, tell me.

579
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,399
When did you start
having feelings for me, then?

580
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,000
I can't recall.

581
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,559
No way.

582
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,079
Was it when I acted in the play

583
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,240
or fought with others?

584
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,640
Or...

585
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,359
No.

586
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,200
No.

587
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,799
How could you forget the moment

588
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,559
you started liking me?

589
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,680
Good job.

590
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,680
If I were to put it into words,

591
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,639
perhaps even long before

592
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,799
I understood

593
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,079
what love was,

594
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,640
I had already liked you.

595
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,319
Do you still want to be friends with me?

596
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,359
Of course not.

597
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,599
However, you're a good friend.

598
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm really blessed.

599
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,359
I met you when we were little,

600
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,039
and we became best friends.

601
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,279
We went our separate ways
halfway through

602
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,519
and lost touch for a few years.

603
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,039
Yet, we met again.

604
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,240
Now,

605
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,400
not only are we best friends,

606
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,640
but we're also the best couple.

607
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,559
Jiang Yi,

608
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,079
you told me

609
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,559
that in my heart,

610
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,200
friends hold
more importance than my lover.

611
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,279
I can tell you

612
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,680
that, to me,

613
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,359
you're more
important than my friends and lover.

614
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,799
Hence,

615
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,519
you're doubly important to me.

616
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,880
Doubly important, huh?

617
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,679
Where have you been?

618
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,920
Why have you returned so late?

619
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,679
I accompanied
Huang Yingzi to look for Ding Ye.

620
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,599
Look for Ding Ye?

621
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,119
Where did he go?

622
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,400
Jiangzhou Island.

623
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,280
That's so far.

624
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,719
Did he really intend
to commit suicide by the seaside?

625
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,719
Look at you.

626
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,599
Yes, he attempted suicide.

627
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,800
Going out late at night
to save their love rival

628
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,639
and ended up getting the flu?

629
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,559
You're the first who did it.

630
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,159
I should award you

631
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,559
the most magnanimous
boyfriend of the year.

632
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,360
I did that not for Ding Ye

633
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,880
but for Huang Yingzi.

634
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,920
For Yingzi?

635
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,519
Think about it.

636
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,960
If Ding Ye

637
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
really committed suicide
before Huang Yingzi's eyes,

638
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,519
what would happen to Huang Yingzi?

639
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,800
I won't allow this to happen again.

640
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,679
So, it was

641
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,599
a close call today.

642
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,079
Whose cactus is this?

643
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,159
It's yours.

644
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,159
In this round,

645
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,719
only two quotas are available

646
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,920
for the selection of senior journalists,

647
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,000
which belong to you and Zhang Yiran.

648
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,320
So, is this

649
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,400
a gift for my job promotion from you?

650
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
Not really.

651
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,800
It's from Ding Ye.

652
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,639
Ding Ye?

653
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,000
Did he come to our company?

654
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,280
He asked me to pass you a message.

655
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,079
This time, he's taking
the initiative to ask you

656
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,039
for an interview.

657
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,238
Thank you, Chief Editor.

658
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,119
I noted that.

659
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:13,760
It's quite cute.

660
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,000
When you did exclusive interviews,

661
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,199
did you look

662
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,199
for a big studio

663
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,280
and set up a lot of lighting

664
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,400
with many cameras?

665
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,599
That's right.

666
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,079
Then, why didn't
I get the same treatment?

667
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,639
I guess that you wouldn't like it.

668
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,519
Have another guess, then.

669
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,239
Why did I gift you a cactus?

670
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,360
Why does the interview

671
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,360
always turn into you interviewing me?

672
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,960
As you're one of the few

673
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
who could provide me
with answers over the years.

674
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,440
So, it is a question and answer
with prizes.

675
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
And the cactus is my reward?

676
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,880
In high school,

677
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,159
I had a cactus

678
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,519
in the classroom.

679
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,159
After I dropped out of school,

680
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,000
I went back to pack my belongings,

681
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,119
and I found it withered.

682
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,440
What happened, then?

683
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,599
Then,

684
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,559
I hosted a funeral for the cactus.

685
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,199
That sounds like
the things you would do.

686
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,960
I once believed I was akin to a cactus,

687
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
that I was self-sufficient,

688
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,519
unbothered by temperature fluctuations,

689
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:23,840
and prickly enough

690
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
to deter anyone from provoking me.

691
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,599
That day, I realized

692
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,000
that cactus would wither too.

693
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,320
Of course it will.

694
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,559
All living beings
will inevitably experience death.

695
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,039
Not long after,

696
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,559
you published
The Man Who Dreams of Whales

697
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,639
and became the youngest

698
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,760
and most popular best-selling author.

699
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,480
You're already very impressive.

700
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,920
Have you ever thought of it?

701
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,840
If I hadn't dropped out of school,

702
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,400
would everyone have still liked me?

703
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Or

704
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,800
does everyone like my literature,

705
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,279
or is there another reason?

706
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,718
They like

707
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,679
the news of a college dropout

708
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,639
who became a best-selling author.

709
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,559
Through the news,

710
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,280
they could make me

711
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,119
into a fictitious character.

712
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,599
Once I don't match
the image they have of me,

713
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,800
I will become
a total loser in their eyes.

714
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,239
But this is part of you too.

715
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,559
The disappointing part of you

716
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:21,960
is still you.

717
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,960
He said that too.

718
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,280
Before I met you,

719
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,559
I couldn't fathom a lot of things.

720
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,840
But now, I've slowly found the answers.

721
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,840
Do you

722
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
still fear letting others down?

723
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,639
Of course I do.

724
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,920
But what can I do about it?

725
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,320
It's quite cool to feel at ease

726
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,920
with disappointing others.

727
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,639
Congratulations.

728
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,880
You've become the prickly

729
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,760
cactus again.

730
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,360
What about you?

731
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,559
Have you found the answer

732
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,480
to my question?

733
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,960
Is the answer you're seeking

734
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,519
for your friend

735
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,199
or yourself?

736
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,159
Initially, it was for my friend.

737
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,880
But unknowingly,

738
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,039
it has turned

739
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,280
into something I must do in life.

740
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
Have your palms face each other.

741
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,039
When we breathe out, lift our chests

742
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,159
and do a back-bend.

743
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,280
Eyes on your thumb.

744
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Hold the position. Three, two, one.

745
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,679
Breathe in, back in position.

746
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,199
Breathe out,
and fold your body forward and down.

747
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,480
Using your hands, hug your...

748
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,280
Are you all right?

749
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,719
I'm okay.

750
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,800
Lift your right leg.

751
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,760
Grab the toe of your foot.

752
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
Move it outward to your right.

753
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,800
Release your left hand at the same time.

754
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
I really can't do this.

755
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:51,959
Besides...

756
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,679
Maintain your position.

757
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,400
You can do it!

758
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,400
Fold your body forward and down.

759
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,480
Push with your right foot.
The back of your hand faces backward.

760
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,559
This is called
the Lord of the Dance Pose.

761
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,199
Exhale.

762
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,559
Do a partial bank-side
bend to your left.

763
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,960
This is the Reverse Warrior.

764
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,360
Look toward the direction
your upper arms open.

765
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,760
Three.

766
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,239
Two.

767
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,719
Are you okay?

768
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:13,920
Okay, our lesson...

769
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,400
I'm fine.

770
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,440
I'm perfectly okay.

771
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,199
It's finally over.

772
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,880
Drink some water.

773
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:30,880
How is it?

774
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,639
Did you enjoy it?

775
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,119
It's quite fun.

776
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,679
It's rare to see a man practicing yoga.

777
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:39,159
Don't you guys
always lift weights or play with balls?

778
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,760
I think yoga is quite nice.

779
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,800
The environment is lovely,

780
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,920
and the air quality is good.

781
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,400
I can breathe in
the spiritual energy of nature

782
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,719
and absorb the essence
of the sun and the moon.

783
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,559
I think

784
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
you're just worried
about me, aren't you?

785
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,239
I can do this.

786
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,880
I've moved on.

787
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,039
Mingyu.

788
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,319
You're tougher now
than you were when you were little.

789
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Really?

790
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,000
I thought
I was quite resilient when I was little.

791
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,960
That's right.

792
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,280
You were only resilient on the outside.

793
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,159
When you were little,

794
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,480
you were the "someone else's child".

795
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,079
You set clear goals,

796
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,639
and you knew what you really wanted.

797
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,079
This is the part I envy most about you.

798
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,079
You

799
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,119
are more moderate now.

800
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,598
The contrast

801
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,559
is quite attractive.

802
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,519
Well, I've worked for so many years,

803
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,199
yet I haven't attracted any new friends.

804
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,679
I'll be your new friend, then.

805
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,039
Let's get to know each other again.

806
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,199
My new friend,

807
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,760
are you ready

808
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,920
to join me for yoga again?

809
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,880
Sure.

810
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,559
You should join me in gardening too.

811
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,320
Definitely!

812
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,559
Let's go.

813
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,679
Now?

814
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,400
I know,

815
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,280
all this while,

816
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,000
everyone is questioning

817
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,840
the encrypted credit cookie

818
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,400
I wrote in The Maze.

819
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,119
Some said I took on a side job.

820
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,559
Some accuse me of plagiarism.

821
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,519
So, I extracted the part

822
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
as a confession to the company.

823
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,280
It's also

824
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,079
to clarify the game.

825
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,480
I'm really curious.

826
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,519
The worldview of The Maze

827
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,839
is extraordinary and substantial.

828
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Why did you pick a small town

829
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,360
as the setting of the final stage?

830
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,440
I've thought about this

831
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,679
since the initial drafting of the idea.

832
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,119
Without the small town,

833
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,079
this story wouldn't exist.

834
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,679
Jiang Yi.

835
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,400
Do you remember when you first

836
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,800
attended the interview at ATG?

837
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,559
You said you wanted to come back

838
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:08,199
to find your initial passion for games.

839
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,239
I want to know

840
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:12,199
what your initial passion is.

841
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,280
It's for the sake of my friend.
