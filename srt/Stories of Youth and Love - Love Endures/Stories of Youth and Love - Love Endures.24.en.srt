[Episode 24]

2
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,318
Is this where you want to take me?

3
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,159
I saw people painting here

4
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,599
every time I passed by,

5
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,680
and I've wanted to try it
for a long time.

6
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,159
I can't draw either.

7
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,400
Do you not know how to draw,
or are you just afraid to draw?

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,640
Are you afraid of getting paint
on your clothes?

9
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,158
When we were young
and you got paint on your clothes

10
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,439
during art class, you cried
and demanded compensation from me.

11
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,039
I wasn't petty like that.

12
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,760
Not only were you petty,

13
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,159
but you were also a mysophobic,

14
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,040
and you had
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,319
Did you call me here today

16
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,760
to scold me?

17
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,238
No.

18
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,480
Try painting.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,479
Fine,

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,959
we're already here anyway.

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Watch me.

22
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,359
What are you painting?

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,159
You.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,479
Me?

25
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,560
Apart from the glasses,

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
this looks nothing like me.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
Watch me.

28
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,879
What do you think?

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,919
What is that?

30
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,560
You.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,919
What is that?

32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,400
A lollipop.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,879
It's as big as my head.

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,560
It's a gigantic lollipop.

35
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,280
That is not me.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,000
Watch.

37
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,239
This is me.

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,439
Are you drawing red lips?

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,959
Sexy, charming, and beautiful.

40
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,638
Well, Miss Fang,

41
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,439
do you have
any misunderstandings about yourself?

42
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,399
I...

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,759
Wait.

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,520
I can't wash this off
if you spray it on my body.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,280
Spray on the wall instead.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
But,

47
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
I'm thinking,

48
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,960
we're vandalizing
other people's graffiti,

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,159
and our drawings are ugly.

50
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,599
Are they going to reprimand us?

51
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,478
No.

52
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,680
This is a free art zone.

53
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,599
Everyone is allowed

54
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,719
to leave something here.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
I've been observing for a while

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,520
that the graffiti on this wall

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
will be covered up

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
after some time

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,879
as new graffiti is created.

60
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,519
That means

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,159
ours will disappear too.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,319
They're not really disappearing.

63
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,799
They will just be hidden
in a more hidden place.

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,759
Okay.

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,879
Since that's the case,

66
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,679
I

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,919
will start

68
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,360
creating art boldly.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
What are you planning to do?

70
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
Watch.

71
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,920
Stream of consciousness?

72
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,639
Come on, do it.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll make one, too.

74
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
This is really exciting.

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,199
My graffiti!

76
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,800
Didn't you say

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,079
that no one would come looking for us?

78
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,199
Did you actually believe me?

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,600
Run!

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Here.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,600
Congratulations again
to Mingyu for resigning

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,759
and breaking up successfully

83
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,199
to enter a new stage of life.

84
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

85
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,759
What are your plans next?

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
Are you going
to look for a job directly?

87
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,079
I plan to take a break.

88
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,920
I may travel a little.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,759
An unplanned,

90
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,120
spontaneous trip.

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,399
Didn't you particularly dislike

92
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,519
that kind of life
in which you didn't know

93
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,879
what would happen tomorrow?

94
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,920
I used to.

95
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,600
Everything had to be planned

96
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,759
because I feared making mistakes.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,759
Later, I realized

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,360
I seemed to have ignored
my true feelings.

99
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,480
So now,

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,879
it's better to just go with the flow

101
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,120
and follow my heart's desires.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,800
I really didn't expect

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
these words to come out of your mouth.

104
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,639
How about you two?

105
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,839
Don't you have anything to tell me?

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,800
I do.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,120
I finally got Ding Ye's interview done,

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,879
and the editor-in-chief
wants to renew my contract,

109
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,319
so I plan to reward myself
with a small car.

110
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm going to pick up the car next week.

111
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,279
I have something, too.

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,360
My game

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,279
is finally going
to be officially produced.

114
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,040
That's all?

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,319
Nothing else?

116
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,759
I've been worried about you
for more than ten years.

117
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,079
Aren't you two

118
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,839
going to tell me?

119
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,639
Zhuang Yuan,

120
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,160
you are really like your mother

121
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,959
when it comes to matters
you shouldn't speak about.

122
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Such a blabbermouth.

123
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,399
Yes,

124
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,480
we got together.

125
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,759
We got together.

126
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,360
Congratulations.

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,279
Blessings to you two.

128
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Six of Hangtian City

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,319
have no secrets, right?

130
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,199
Fine,

131
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,600
I will make amends

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
by telling you another secret.

133
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,199
What is it?

134
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,959
Say it.

135
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
I've decided

136
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,079
to leave school.

137
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,759
What?

138
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,800
I have lived up
to my mother's ideal image

139
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,360
since I was young.

140
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,199
I studied well,

141
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,240
got into an ideal university,

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
studied for a Ph.D.,

143
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,240
and

144
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,519
followed my instructor's request

145
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,680
to do research
on autonomous driving after that,

146
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,920
before finally staying in school.

147
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,519
None of these are what I want,

148
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,839
so I've decided

149
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,000
that from now on,

150
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,920
I will live the way I want.

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
It's like you are experiencing
a second adolescence

152
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,319
in middle age.

153
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,439
You can celebrate
my return to 18 years old, then.

154
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,879
Here, cheers on being 18 again.

155
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,279
Cheers.

156
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,639
Here.

157
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

158
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,639
It's such a happy day.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,759
It's a pity
that we are missing two people.

160
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,879
Isn't Yifei touring abroad?

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,000
How about we give Guan a call?

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,680
Sure.

163
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,759
Sure.

164
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,279
Give Guan a call

165
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,279
to check what he's doing.

166
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,959
Hello.

167
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,879
Hello, Guan.

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,040
What are you doing, Guan?

169
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm on my way home.

170
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,240
The four of us are gathering together.

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,558
We're going to tell you some good news.

172
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,879
Good news?

173
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,360
What is it?

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,679
Are the four of you together now?

175
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,799
(Cut the nonsense.)

176
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,639
(No.)

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,799
I don't care.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm expecting four red packets

179
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,480
for my baby's full moon celebration,

180
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,519
not one less.

181
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,840
A full moon celebration?

182
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
What does that mean?

183
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,840
Is Yang Fan pregnant?

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Guan, you're really something.

185
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,240
You didn't even tell us.

186
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I don't care.

187
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,039
I want to be the first
to see my goddaughter.

188
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,879
Me, too.

189
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,960
Wait,

190
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,399
how do you know it's a girl?

191
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,919
It has to be a girl.

192
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,480
If it were a girl,
she would look like Yang Fan.

193
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
If it were a boy like Guan Chao,

194
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,279
he would be just as silly.

195
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,799
How horrifying is that?

196
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
I think it would be pretty nice
if it were a boy like Guan,

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,960
someone honest

198
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,720
and steadfast.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
Isn't that right, Guan?

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,120
Zhuang Yuan,

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,919
are you praising

202
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,879
or insulting me?

203
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,120
I was just kidding, Guan.

204
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
Regardless of gender,

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,120
we all hope to see him or her soon.

206
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,879
Yingzi is right.

207
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,600
It's time for the few of us

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
to get together.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,720
(Right.)

210
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,559
(That's a promise.)

211
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,879
You should go.

212
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,600
Bye.

213
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Bye.

214
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,320
That's it. Bye.

215
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
How nice.

216
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,039
Another one.

217
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,799
Here.

218
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,279
Let's go.

219
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,159
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

220
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,759
Take care, Yingzi.

221
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,519
We'll get going, then.

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,279
All right.

223
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,559
That's it.

224
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,039
I'll send them both back first.

225
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:55,919
Take care.

226
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,159
Text me on WeChat when you arrive.

227
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,240
Go.

228
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,919
(Yifei,)

229
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
(how have you been?)

230
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,559
(I'm very happy today.)

231
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,360
(Six of Hangtian City)

232
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,639
(all started a new phase in life.)

233
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,039
(After your tour ends,)

234
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
(we have a big surprise to tell you.)

235
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,360
(I hope this day comes soon.)

236
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,519
I left my phone here.

237
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,679
What's wrong?

238
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,840
Has Yifei contacted you recently?

239
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,759
Isn't she touring abroad?

240
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,240
Why would she contact me?

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,039
I'm a little tired.

242
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,840
You should go.

243
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,360
All right.

244
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,399
I'll go back first.

245
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,399
(Yifei,)

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,279
(where are you?)

247
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,720
(Have you kept in touch
with Jiang Yi over the years?)

248
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,639
(Yifei,)

249
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,439
(I have something to ask you.)

250
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,799
(Can we have a phone call?)

251
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,240
(Yifei,)

252
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,279
(when are you free?)

253
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,919
(I want to meet you.)

254
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,080
How come you're working overtime
until this late again?

255
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
You must not have eaten.

256
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,679
Here,

257
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,720
it's still hot.

258
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,200
Let's drop the act

259
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,919
and just say it.

260
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,240
You know what I mean.

261
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,960
Why can you log in
to Yifei's email account?

262
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,879
I don't know how I should face you

263
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,519
before you provide me
with a reasonable explanation.

264
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,759
If I tell you I logged into her email

265
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,120
to get to know you better,

266
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,559
will you believe it?

267
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Yes, that's right.

268
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,679
I want to know you better.

269
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,919
That is why I'm living
opposite your house.

270
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,919
I want to know you better.

271
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,480
That is why I hacked Yifei's email.

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,799
I did all of these

273
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,960
because I wanted to know you better.

274
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,519
Besides,

275
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
hacking someone's email

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,960
couldn't be easier

277
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
for me, right?

278
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,360
For the past 12 years,

279
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Yifei was the one accompanying me

280
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,000
through all my ups and downs.

281
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:14,919
Fine.

282
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,240
Since you said you saw our emails

283
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,639
from long ago,

284
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,480
you should be able to see

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
all my feelings, right?

286
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,200
I don't believe
that after you saw everything,

287
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,519
you still didn't come to me.

288
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:27,960
Jiang Yi,

289
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,799
we've known each other
since we were six.

290
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
I always feel that you are the person

291
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,759
who is the most familiar

292
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,080
and knows me best in the world.

293
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,919
Although you disappeared for 12 years,

294
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,439
that hasn't changed at all.

295
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,159
I understand too well

296
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,600
what kind of person you are.

297
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,559
Do you think I believe

298
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,799
what you just said?

299
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,720
Jiang Yi,

300
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,399
what are you hiding from me?

301
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,039
It's your birthday next week.

302
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,080
Don't you like birthdays the most?

303
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,559
Let's spend time together.

304
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,559
You must be crazy.

305
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,679
Three packs of Ziyun Cigarettes
are 150 yuan,

306
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,720
Huangjiu is 80 yuan,

307
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
Laobaigan is 75 yuan.

308
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,279
That'll be 583 yuan.

309
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,080
580 will do.

310
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,200
Thanks, Madam.

311
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,639
You

312
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,320
are going to be a father.

313
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,279
When your child is born,

314
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,039
you'll have to spend money everywhere.

315
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,439
Don't be extravagant.

316
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
My dad often runs up a tab with you.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm embarrassed.

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
You should advise him.

319
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,519
He's not young anymore,

320
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,960
so he should cut down
on smoking and drinking.

321
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,720
Speak of the devil.

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,360
Guan,

323
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
your son is here to pay your tab again.

324
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,519
You don't have

325
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,399
to pay for my tab.

326
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,919
Why are you getting another drink?

327
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,360
Tell me,

328
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,919
how long do you plan to live?

329
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,679
That's none of your business.

330
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,759
The doctor already said

331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,159
that you'd have a cerebral hemorrhage

332
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,600
sooner or later if you kept
drinking like this every day.

333
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,000
Can't you wish your old man well?

334
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,759
I actually wanted to tell you

335
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
that Yang Fan is pregnant.

336
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,559
The due date is in September.

337
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
After the child is born,

338
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:11,199
he will recognize people,

339
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,200
call you Grandpa,

340
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,920
study,

341
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,480
and also go to college.

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,279
If you want to witness that day,

343
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,240
stop drifting through life,

344
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,880
can you?

345
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,319
Do you have time to worry about me?

346
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,319
Just go.

347
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,119
Keep your wife company.

348
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,839
Hurry.

349
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,720
Go.

350
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,079
Go quickly.

351
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,400
Madam, I'll get going first.

352
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Take care.

353
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,519
Keep a tab.

354
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,319
(You have a phone call)

355
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,319
(from Jiang Yi.)

356
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,359
(Would you like to answer?)

357
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,240
Mr. Jiang,

358
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,160
why are you thinking of me
right after starting a new relationship?

359
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,359
Guan,

360
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,119
I have a favor to ask.

361
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:43,919
Fine.

362
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,240
The omnipotent Mr. Jiang,

363
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,680
please speak.

364
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm listening.

365
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,559
It's because of Yifei this time.

366
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,519
It's for Yingzi, right?

367
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,960
You will definitely help me,

368
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,879
right?

369
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,279
Of course,

370
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,000
just like you helped me back then.

371
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,920
Just say it.

372
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,559
What is it?

373
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,160
Mr. Hu,

374
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,839
I'd like to participate in
the Olympic Cultural Competition.

375
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,440
Sure.

376
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,440
A literary and art
committee member of your class

377
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
wants to perform Latin dance,

378
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
and he needs a dance partner.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,519
Do you think I can dance Latin

380
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,000
with my body coordination?

381
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,799
Well...

382
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,119
You can join

383
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,959
Chao Tingting's crosstalk.

384
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
You like to talk,

385
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
so that'll be perfect for you.

386
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,000
Playing a supporting role
for Chao Tingting?

387
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Isn't that burying my talents?

388
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,000
You

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,799
don't want any of my suggestions.

390
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
What do you want to do, then?

391
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,599
I want to act in a drama

392
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,480
with Fang Mingyu

393
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,720
and Lan Yifei.

394
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
Fang Mingyu is fine,

395
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,079
but Lan Yifei is not.

396
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,519
Why?

397
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,480
She is from Class 8.

398
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Are only athletes from the same province

399
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
allowed to form teams

400
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
to compete in the Olympic Games?

401
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,079
Not really.

402
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,119
That is why.

403
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,880
The Olympic Games
are a high-level sporting event

404
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,440
that embraces
and welcomes the entire world.

405
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,079
Since we are welcoming
the Olympic Cultural Competition,

406
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,079
it cannot be limited

407
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,119
to only classmates
forming teams to participate.

408
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,240
Are you sure

409
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,240
that they are willing
to cooperate with you and participate?

410
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Certainly.

411
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,039
We understand each other the best.

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,839
Just the three of you?

413
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,000
There are three more.

414
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,640
Huang Yingzi,

415
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,000
do you think
you're getting groceries here?

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,960
After sparing you three,

417
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,359
you're getting three more in?

418
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Please, Mr. Hu.

419
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,440
I beg you.

420
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,319
No.

421
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,759
Please,

422
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,039
Mr. Hu.

423
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,399
Fine.

424
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
Fine, then.

425
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
You said that yourself.

426
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,480
What did I say?

427
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Anyway, you said that,

428
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,960
so I assume you agreed.

429
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,720
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

430
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
Bye, Mr. Hu.

431
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,759
This child...

432
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:17,839
Here,

433
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,000
please pass this on.

434
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,559
What is this?

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,279
I've thought about it all night.

436
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,079
I finally thought of one show

437
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,200
that the six of us
could perform together,

438
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,839
a stage play.

439
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,119
Hence,

440
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,000
I came up with this script overnight.

441
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I'll play the role of the rice cooker.

442
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
The rice cooker does not count.

443
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,160
Everybody knows

444
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,480
that in order
for a stage play to succeed,

445
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,759
there are two factors needed.

446
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
Firstly,

447
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,839
a very impressive script.

448
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,440
As you can see,

449
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
we already have that.

450
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Secondly,

451
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,039
we require a director

452
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,480
who has great cohesion and creativity.

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,440
If you don't have any comments,

454
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm going

455
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,000
to take on the additional role.

456
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,759
I have a question.

457
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,559
Go ahead.

458
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,440
Why are you both
the director and the screenwriter?

459
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,720
That's because I've given
all the leading role opportunities

460
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,799
to you guys.

461
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,799
I have a question.

462
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,359
Go ahead.

463
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,839
I've read two pages.

464
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,240
What is the story of this script?

465
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,720
That's a good question.

466
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
This story

467
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,799
is inspired

468
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,519
by the night when I was six.

469
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,839
There was a big explosion,

470
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,799
and you were all there.

471
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,039
After that explosion,

472
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:34,799
we became the only six people left

473
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,920
on Earth

474
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,960
with the rice cooker.

475
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,240
In short,

476
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
this is a story about friendship.

477
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,200
If you don't have any issues,

478
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,359
from now on,

479
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,919
we need to make time

480
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
to practice

481
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,240
and script-reading.

482
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,119
Henceforth,

483
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,079
this place

484
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,599
is our rehearsal venue.

485
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,319
Why?

486
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,440
This is my house.

487
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,079
You are the male lead.

488
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,240
What's wrong with providing the venue?

489
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,519
Male lead? What male lead?

490
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,240
I'll play the role of a rice cooker.

491
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,160
Am I the male lead?

492
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
I am the director.

493
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
If I say you are the male lead,

494
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
you are.

495
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,519
Besides,

496
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,359
I have left

497
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,000
all the most brilliant scenes

498
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
to you.

499
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,000
Brilliant?

500
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,759
Which part of this is brilliant?

501
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,039
The singing parts.

502
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,279
Huang Yingzi, listen,

503
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,400
I can break my neck or bleed,

504
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,559
but I will never sing.

505
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,599
Sure.

506
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,799
You take on the role of a corpse, then.

507
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,119
I'm fine with that.

508
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,759
From now on,

509
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,960
we have 20 days

510
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,440
until the official performance.

511
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,400
I hope that you, my comrades,

512
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
can commit all your time
outside of studying

513
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,319
to the rehearsals.

514
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,680
We don't have any time
outside of studying.

515
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
So, what should we do?

516
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
No?

517
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,039
You make time, then.

518
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,319
This is the first time all six of us

519
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,879
have had the chance to perform together
since we were young.

520
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,679
I think

521
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,599
all problems are not problems

522
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,119
in the face of such a significant event.

523
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,920
Okay.

524
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
Since there are no issues,

525
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,759
let's read the script together

526
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
now.

527
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,240
(Yingzi, I'm really sorry.)

528
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,839
(The first audition
for the ballet troupe)

529
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,799
(is also scheduled for January 1.)

530
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,359
(I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up)

531
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,480
(with the drama performance.)

532
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,880
Director,

533
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,839
you have been staring at the phone

534
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,039
for half an hour.

535
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
Are we changing the script or not?

536
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,160
The female lead suddenly stopped coming.

537
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,640
How can I change the script
after so many rehearsals?

538
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Yifei

539
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,200
has her own dreams.

540
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,440
I know,

541
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,799
but Six of Hangtian City

542
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,839
is a group.

543
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,359
It won't be complete without Yifei.

544
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,199
Very good.

545
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,759
I have an idea.

546
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,640
What is it?

547
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,599
Let's not participate anymore.

548
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,279
Don't even think about it.

549
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:05,880
Listen,

550
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,200
you're definitely acting as the corpse.

551
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,519
I've checked this out.

552
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,680
There are three routes

553
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
from the theater to the school.

554
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,279
This is the first one.

555
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,000
It's also the route
that most people will choose.

556
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,039
The journey takes 40 minutes.

557
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,640
The second one
is to take the elevated road

558
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
and then make a U-turn
to cross a central divider.

559
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
It's the shortest route,

560
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,720
where one can arrive
in less than 30 minutes.

561
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,640
It's just that there
is a divider in the middle,

562
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,599
so crossing it
means violating traffic rules.

563
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,720
We can't do that.

564
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
There's another one, a short path,

565
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,279
having the shortest distance
between two places,

566
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,079
but

567
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,480
there is an elementary school
in the middle of it.

568
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,519
5 o'clock happens to be dismissal time

569
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,480
with the largest flow of people.

570
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Cars wouldn't be able to pass at all.

571
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,559
I can ride an electric bike
to pick up Yifei.

572
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,599
Her interview ends at five,

573
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,639
and our show is around half past five.

574
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
We'll need 35 minutes in total.

575
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,920
Still, we will not make it in time.

576
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,680
After our discussion,

577
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,879
Yifei still can't make it to the show.

578
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,119
I'll figure out

579
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,839
the extra five minutes.

580
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm Chao Tingting
from Class 3, Grade 12.

581
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,519
I am Wu Yude from Class 3, Grade 12.

582
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,160
Today,

583
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,240
we'll be performing crosstalk.

584
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,359
There are so many people
in the audience today.

585
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,720
There's a crowd.

586
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,720
Director,

587
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,119
are you all right?

588
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,439
Is Yifei really unable to make it?

589
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,079
Let's keep waiting.

590
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,440
We still have some time, don't we?

591
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,799
Yes.

592
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,440
Rice Cooker Is The Only Thing
At The End of The Universe, right?

593
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,240
Get ready.

594
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,559
It's your turn next.

595
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,160
All right.

596
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,119
I'll call Yifei first.

597
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,039
It's fine.

598
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,079
Let her perform with peace of mind.

599
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,639
The dance troupe examination
is more important.

600
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
If Yifei really can't come,

601
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,079
let's get her the first place.

602
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Girl,

603
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,079
you have solid basic skills,

604
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,039
and your rhythm

605
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,119
and power control are not bad.

606
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,480
But I'd like to know

607
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
why it was scripted in a way

608
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,319
where you omitted one section

609
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,440
and increased the difficulty

610
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,879
of the original actions.

611
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,880
Teachers, I'm sorry.

612
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,519
I omitted the front part

613
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,440
and increased difficulty here

614
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,160
because

615
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,039
I had something
very important to do later.

616
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,039
I had to shorten the interview.

617
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,000
All right.

618
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,079
Your interview is over,

619
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,519
but I hope you understand

620
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,119
that you'll have many choices like this

621
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,919
to make in life.

622
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
You need to think clearly

623
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,119
about what's really important to you

624
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,599
and not make choices you regret.

625
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,119
I understood.

626
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,039
Thank you, teachers.

627
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,759
Where are Guan Chao and Jiang Yi

628
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,200
at this critical moment?

629
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
What should we do now?

630
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,039
No idea.

631
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,599
Where are they?

632
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,440
Go look for them.

633
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,839
Weren't they here just now?

634
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,279
What's going on?

635
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:54,880
There is a power cut.

636
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,839
♪I asked the girl♪

637
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,919
♪Why she sent me a text message♪

638
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,000
♪And why did you♪

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,920

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,960
♪I shouldn't have believed

641
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,319
♪You didn't want
to just go through the motions with me♪

642
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,319
♪I still understood that you
no longer want to redeem anything♪

643
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,359
Didn't he say that he would never sing?

644
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,079
How was it?

645
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,200
Did it go well today?

646
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,480
It was all right.
Let's talk about it when we're back.

647
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,039
Here, the helmet.

648
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,000
Yingzi,

649
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,799
look who's here.

650
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,839
Yifei!

651
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,480
You came here in time.

652
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,519
We only have this one opportunity
for all six of us

653
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,359
to perform together.

654
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,759
I came over as soon as I finished.

655
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,480
That's great.

656
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,400
Did you arrange all this?

657
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,079
No.

658
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,519
I sang just because I wanted to.

659
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,519
The next show

660
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,119
is a performance

661
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,759
full of surprise and imagination.

662
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,720
It's almost time for our show.

663
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,480
Come.

664
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,039
We can definitely do it.

665
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,279
One, two, three.

666
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,599
We can do it!

667
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,200
Mr. Jiang, a delivery for you.

668
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,759
Alright, thank you.

669
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,559
You're welcome.

670
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,440
Yifei?

671
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,200
Yingzi.

672
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,159
Yifei.

673
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,639
Yifei!

674
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,960
(Yifei,)

675
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,319
(it's been a long time
since I heard from you.)

676
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,160
(Are you all right?)

677
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,240
(I really miss you.)

678
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,839
(I'm also worried about you.)

679
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,400
(Some things happened these days.)

680
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,480
(I don't want to tell you)

681
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,200
(by email anymore.)

682
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
(If it is convenient for you,)

683
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
(I'll fly over to you this week)

684
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,000
(so that I can tell you face to face.)

685
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,319
(Is that all right?)

686
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
(Sorry, Yingzi.)

687
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,639
(I'm too busy with the performances.)

688
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,719
(I have to fly to Zurich
to perform again tomorrow.)

689
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,360
(I'm afraid I won't be able
to meet you in time.)

690
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,039
(I heard the snow-capped mountains
there are beautiful.)

691
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,719
(I can help you take a look.)

692
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,719
(It's your birthday this weekend.)

693
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,840
(My blessings
will definitely reach you.)

694
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,880
(Do you still remember
the promise we made for our thirties?)

695
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,320
This must be warm.

696
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,280
It's sheepskin.

697
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,719
It's so soft.

698
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,960
Yingzi,

699
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,079
I will return the money after a while.

700
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,000
What are you talking about?

701
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,199
Return the money?

702
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,880
Just see this

703
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,559
as a gift we got for Uncle together.

704
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,880
What about your new Stefanie Sun album?

705
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
Haven't you not
wanted it for a long time?

706
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
That album seems a bit average.

707
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,000
Never mind.

708
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,480
I happen not to want to buy it anymore.

709
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,039
What was that?

710
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:04,800
Why did I hear

711
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,239
the sound of heartbreak?

712
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,719
You got me.

713
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,679
It's fine.

714
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,360
When I get rich later,

715
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,880
I'll get you

716
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
any Stephanie Sun album you want.

717
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,360
That's good.

718
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,360
You'll become

719
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,559
the principal dancer
of the ballet troupe when you grow up.

720
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
You'll be a superstar,

721
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,239
so you'll be rich, of course.

722
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,559
I'll rely on your support.

723
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,079
We'll be

724
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,440
good friends of a superstar, then.

725
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,320
You will reserve
VIP seats for us, right?

726
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,639
Of course.

727
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,480
Why be the audience

728
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,320
when the time comes?

729
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,079
What do you want, then?

730
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,280
I want to be her manager, of course.

731
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,760
That's all right.

732
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,440
You can be the manager.

733
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:36,760
Fine.

734
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,880
I'll be the bodyguard.

735
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,559
A bodyguard?

736
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,239
When crazy fans

737
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,199
and perverted paparazzi

738
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,559
dare to follow you,

739
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,639
I'll just give them punch-by-punch

740
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,400
till they're dead.

741
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,599
Isn't that how bodyguards act

742
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,719
in television shows?

743
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,760
Get off!

744
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,679
You,

745
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,519
no photography allowed.

746
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,000
You,

747
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,840
delete the photos.

748
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:52,920
Get out of the way.

749
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,719
Miss bodyguard,

750
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,159
aren't I the manager?

751
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,880
Sorry.

752
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,320
Will

753
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,159
I get the chance

754
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,400
to get to know Stephanie Sun
after entering the artistic industry?

755
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,320
After going in circles for a while,

756
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,440
you still desire
Stefanie Sun's new album.

757
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't know if you'll get to know her,

758
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,960
but if I get really rich,

759
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,920
I can buy you

760
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
any album you want.

761
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,800
I wonder

762
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,199
if she will still

763
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,679
be releasing albums at that time.

764
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,440
Of course.

765
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:21,879
However,

766
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,679
based on my understanding
of Stefanie Sun,

767
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,119
she'll probably be very family-oriented

768
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,880
when she gets married and has kids.

769
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,039
I don't know
if she will still release albums.

770
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
She can still sing for
at least ten more years, though.

771
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,320
We will be almost 30 then.

772
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,079
So what?

773
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,239
Nothing.

774
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,039
I will gift you albums in your thirties.

775
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

776
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,559
Consider this

777
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,000
a tiny promise
for our thirties, all right?

778
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,039
I am the witness.

779
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,078
Pinky promise.

780
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Pinky promise.

781
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,400
Stamped.

782
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,519
What are you laughing at?

783
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,879
Get out of here.

784
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,039
You can't do this.

785
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,960
No, I'm the manager.

786
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,280
Get out of here.

787
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,800
Hurry.

788
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,599
I still remember
Huang Yingzi's birthday that year.

789
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,119
Yifei dragged me along

790
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,320
as she searched all over Hangtian City
for Stefanie Sun's records.

791
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,679
She said

792
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,480
that was what she promised Yingzi.

793
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,480
Thank you for telling me that.

794
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
It's us.

795
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,280
So why are you being courteous to me?

796
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320
Haven't we both

797
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,480
been keeping this secret all along?

798
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,760
However, Jiang Yi,

799
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,599
you can hide it for a while,

800
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,639
but it will still be revealed one day.

801
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,599
Are you really going to keep hiding this

802
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,400
and lying to her?

803
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
I know.

804
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,920
I just hope this day comes later,

805
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,519
at least

806
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,000
when I'm ready.

807
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,480
Tianlin told me the reason

808
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,159
your thesis proposal isn't approved.

809
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,360
Zhuang Yuan,

810
00:37:59,039 --> 00:37:59,800
sorry.

811
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,760
Tianlin,

812
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,760
you can go back first.

813
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:08,800
By the way,

814
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,880
we have rechecked your thesis proposal.

815
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,159
After correcting the database,

816
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,039
we discovered that your research

817
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,519
has high theoretical value.

818
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,279
Therefore,

819
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,440
I've consulted with the department,

820
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,159
and your thesis proposal
has been approved.

821
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,239
Thank you, sir.

822
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,360
Besides,

823
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,119
Tianlin's qualification
to stay in school has been canceled

824
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,559
and reassigned to you.

825
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,280
Are you all right?

826
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
I went to see our supervisor today.

827
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,480
He knew

828
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,159
the reason my thesis proposal
wasn't approved,

829
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,880
so he helped me

830
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
reapply for a place to stay in school.

831
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,079
Isn't that a good thing?

832
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,920
The thing is,

833
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,400
I don't even know
if I still want this spot.

834
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,239
I want to go to the research farm.

835
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,559
Compared to being in the server room,

836
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,880
I prefer walking in the fields

837
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,119
to sow seeds

838
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,159
and look at them

839
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,079
grow up healthily.

840
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,760
Is that why

841
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,880
you can give up staying in school?

842
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm not sure either.

843
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,840
What's so uncertain about this?

844
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,360
Just do whatever you want.

845
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,880
Don't have any regrets.

846
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,719
Do whatever you want to do.

847
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,199
Grandma,

848
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,920
why are you working by yourself again?

849
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,280
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

850
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,199
Slow down, Grandma.

851
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,199
It's fine.

852
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,159
It's even more uncomfortable
not to move every day.

853
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,000
It's fine.

854
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,280
I brought you some
freeze-dried strawberries

855
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,960
and nuts.

856
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,960
You should eat them more.

857
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
They're good for your health.

858
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,000
Grandma,

859
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,199
you can't keep doing this.

860
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:02,960
I'll take you for a physical examination

861
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,280
in a bit.

862
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,039
Your dizziness
is becoming more frequent.

863
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
It's all right.

864
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,119
This is an old ailment of mine.

865
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,280
It's all right.

866
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,199
Don't worry about it.

867
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,920
I heard

868
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,639
your father
is not in good health either.

869
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,960
He always drinks

870
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,159
to the extent of damaging his gastric.

871
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,719
You should take some time to see him

872
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,280
instead of running to me every day.

873
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
Whenever we meet,

874
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,880
we just end up making things
difficult for each other.

875
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
It's better not if we don't meet.

876
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,079
What are you talking about,

877
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,199
kid?

878
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,440
He's your biological father.

879
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,000
Even if you always fight,

880
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,599
you always think about each other.

881
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,199
I know

882
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,119
your parents

883
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,760
left you when you were young.

884
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,880
You have taken care of me
for so many years

885
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,039
and treated me as family.

886
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,000
However, your biological family

887
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,280
is irreplaceable.

888
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,119
I know.

889
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,000
In fact, for you,

890
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,239
the same goes for Yifei.

891
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,559
Here, your coriander.

892
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,079
Thanks.

893
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,039
You always order the same thing.

894
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:37,920
Do you want something else?

895
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,960
It's fine.

896
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,239
Sure, enjoy the meal.

897
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,719
Is Order 32 ready?

898
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,800
It's on the table. Look for it yourself.

899
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,119
This is my friend's father.

900
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,959
Do you remember the man we met

901
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,880
when we were at the restaurant?

902
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,599
If I'm not mistaken,

903
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:01,920
that was him.

904
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,760
If possible, please help me
keep an eye on this

905
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,599
in the future.

906
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,440
I'm taking it.

907
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,280
Sure.
