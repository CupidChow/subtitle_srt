00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,380
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,640
Who got you breakfast?

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,640
My neighbour gave it to me.

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,400
Your neighbour?

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,230
Looks like your neighbour
can't really cook.

7
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,920
It doesn't look good

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,350
but it actually tastes good.

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,350
All right.

10
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,960
(Change your profile picture.)

11
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,870
(Done.)

12
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,590
Why are you hitting me?

13
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,870
Can you try to be more serious?

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,240
I was walking.

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,910
What should I be serious about?

16
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,150
This is not about walking.

17
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,150
Then what is it about?

18
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,360
What do you think?

19
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,910
I got it.

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,150
It must be because

21
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,840
the weather forecast says
there will be rain later.

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,910
That's why you...

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,150
No...

24
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,030
Wait for me!

25
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,120
Why are you mad at me again?

26
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,710
This is the love announcement I made.

27
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,150
The first one has been completed.

28
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,870
The second one...

29
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,150
When the atmosphere was so good earlier,

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,910
you interrupted.

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
This is why, for the third one,

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm going to make it harder for you.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,190
It's just wear matching outfits.

34
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,120
It's not a big deal.

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's go.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Now you know how to hold my hand.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Still want to play video games?

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,030
Nope.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,630
Jiang Yi.

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,910
Are you done?

41
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,080
Wait a minute.

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,750
Not yet.

43
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,470
I've done putting on the shirt.

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,870
What takes a grown-up man like you
so long?

45
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,870
It's just...

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,960
We have known each other for so long.

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
Can you let me off the hook?

48
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,040
No way.

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
Let me see.

50
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,830
You look good in pink!

51
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,950
This is embarrassing!

52
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,040
It's not cute at all!

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Stop it.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,270
No.

55
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,120
You promised me.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,750
You said you want to wear
matching couple outfits with me.

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,240
Forget it.

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,630
Let me go.

59
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,270
No!

60
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,750
This is what I wanted to feel!

61
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,600
That's the way to wear it!

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,360
It is!

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,190
Miss!

64
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,920
Checkout!

65
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,680
Can you urry up a little bit?

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,430
The list says we need to do
a puzzle together.

67
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,750
Why don't we go do one?

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,870
I'm good at it.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,870
You wish.

70
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,270
You won't get away with any of them.

71
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,870
If you keep playing like this,

72
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,360
you won't get anything
until Chinese New Year.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,870
Show me how you do it, then.

74
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,159
If I manage to get

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,040
the biggest one,

76
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,040
can I change my outfit?

77
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,270
Watch me.

78
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
For you.

79
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,870
I'll go get changed.

80
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,560
Please come in.

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,190
You're still here?

82
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,160
You haven't eaten anything, right?

83
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,680
I noticed how busy you've been.

84
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
I bet you haven't eaten anything.

85
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,430
I bought your favourite oden

86
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,600
and stir-fried rice cake.

87
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,390
Do you cook by yourself now

88
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,950
or you eat at the school cafeteria?

89
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,310
I used to eat at the cafeteria.

90
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,560
Since I'm staying at Jiang's house now,

91
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,510
I am becoming an expert

92
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,390
when it comes to instant noodles.

93
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,000
Instant noodles?

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,070
Since you're staying
at Jiang Yi's house,

95
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,000
you must be sick of their pink bubbles.

96
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
Since when you knew that?

97
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,430
Of course.

98
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
When Yingzi went to her dates,

99
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,070
guess who picked her clothes

100
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,480
and lipstick shades.

101
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,120
Based on Jiang's character,

102
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,430
they've been fancying each other
all these years,

103
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,000
who instigated him to confess?

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I think all these years,

105
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,870
we seem like living in circles.

106
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,240
Everything is the same
as when we were young.

107
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,360
I have changed.

108
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,870
I know myself.

109
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't think you've changed.

110
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Tell me your opinion.

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,480
Always striving to be the best,

112
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,030
competing in everything,

113
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,790
even if the opponent is your fiance.

114
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,630
You're right.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,440
Regardless of who it is,

116
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm not willing to lose.

117
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,670
As long as you are willing to strive,

118
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,750
you can definitely make it.

119
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,200
I believe you will definitely succeed

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
in this performance review.

121
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,030
Thanks for your blessings.

122
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,120
I give you my blessings.

123
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,360
Help me find that piece.

124
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,750
This?

125
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,270
Are you sleepy?

126
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
No, I'm not.

127
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,390
I'm not sleepy.

128
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,240
You finally became my boyfriend,

129
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,720
I want to do more things with you.

130
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,200
What do you mean?

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,390
Do you want to break up in morning?

132
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,080
Touch wood!

133
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
Truth be told,

135
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,280
which couple would do a puzzle at home

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,480
on the first day of dating?

137
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,670
Show me his eyes again.

138
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,240
Here.

139
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,240
By the way,

140
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,510
please don't forget.

141
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,790
Return the test papers

142
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,630
with your parents' signatures tomorrow.

143
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,790
Anyone who dares sign them
by themselves,

144
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,510
I will invite their parents

145
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,240
to school

146
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,150
and sign for 100 times each person.

147
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,120
Am I clear?

148
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes, sir!

149
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,510
Great.

150
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh, right.

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Our school

152
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,360
will be having its anniversary.

153
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,480
We need to change the bulletin board
at the back.

154
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,200
Huang Yingzi,

155
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,550
you are in charge of this.

156
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,360
Sir,

157
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,630
what did you say?

158
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,870
All of a sudden you're deaf!

159
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
When you listened to CDs in class

160
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,910
while shaking your head,

161
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,960
you didn't seem deaf to me.

162
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
Sir.

163
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,120
Sir.

164
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
I...

165
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,910
What?

166
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,910
Decision made.

167
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,670
School's over!

168
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,870
Mingyu.

169
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,150
Mingyu!

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,440
A sea of people...

171
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,910
Zhuang Yuan!

172
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,080
My mom's waiting for me
to deliver goods.

173
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,720
Bye!

174
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,960
What are we going
to draw for the poster?

175
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,910
Hold on!

176
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,030
It's only me,

177
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,000
not us.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,550
Well, I can help out too.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
Until now, have you ever passed
your art classes?

180
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,150
Everyone has their shortcomings.

181
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,200
Even Huang Feihong can't draw!

182
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
In primary school,

183
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
you drew a spaceship.

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,240
Remember the teacher's comment?

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,670
It looked like a winter melon.

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,390
My first pair of basketball shoes,

187
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,630
you drew a whale on them.

188
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,080
What did everyone else think it was?

189
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,630
A tortoise.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,910
So,

191
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,960
this time,

192
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,750
we will draw "One Piece".

193
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,700
It's school anniversary,

194
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,720
yet you are drawing "One Piece"?

195
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,670
Not bad, Jiang Yi.

196
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,870
If Huang Feihong were here today,

197
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,270
I'd still bow to you.

198
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,270
You're amazing!

199
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,150
I'm blown away!

200
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,030
Even if Huang Feihong were here,

201
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,720
you still owe me a month worth
of Magnum ice cream.

202
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Wall's ice cream will do, right?

203
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,600
Alright! Magnum it is!

204
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,840
Why are you so impatient?

205
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,080
Don't you think those guys

206
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,030
look like us?

207
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Us?

208
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,240
If you had to choose

209
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
one among them,

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,550
who would you want to be the most?

211
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,320
Of course it's Luffy.

212
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
He's the most brilliant of all.

213
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,200
Luffy?

214
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Pretty good.

215
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,600
What about you?

216
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Who would you choose?

217
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,440
Me?

218
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,480
Chopper, I guess.

219
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
Good choice.

220
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,840
Among these six,

221
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,720
you chose the only one
who's not a human.

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
Chopper is cute.

223
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,870
It looks just like like me.

224
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,390
However, to be honest,

225
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,550
why did you pick Chopper?

226
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,550
Chopper was actually pretty pathetic
when he was a kid.

227
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,390
His parents didn't care about him,

228
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,390
nobody wanted to be his friends,

229
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,790
until he met Luffy.

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
Luffy was the one who got him
into the Straw Hat Pirates.

231
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,630
Since then,

232
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,670
he knew

233
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,120
how it feels to have friends.

234
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,120
Who would have thought

235
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,390
that Chopper and Luffy

236
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,440
ended up being together.

237
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,000
It's getting late,

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,630
is Zhuang Yuan still waiting for you?

239
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,360
Wait a minute.

240
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,150
On your list,

241
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,240
isn't there one last task?

242
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,720
There isn't.

243
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,440
The last task is
to put a puzzle together.

244
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,080
It can't be.

245
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,750
Look, I clearly remember...

246
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,240
There's still...

247
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,030
Enough.

248
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,390
Stop looking.

249
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,440
That's what it says right here.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,360
Kissing is the last task...

251
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,910
What's wrong?

252
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,510
Are you scared?

253
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
Scared?

254
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
Impossible!

255
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,400
Come on!

256
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,880
Unexpectedly,

257
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,830
who would thought

258
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,270
our Hangtian City's Yi
to be so handsome?

259
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,480
Small and slender eyes,
high nose bridge,

260
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,680
and fair skin.

261
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,830
What's wrong?

262
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Why are you blushing?

263
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,830
I'm not!

264
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,110
How could I possibly blush?

265
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,510
I'm a really good kisser.

266
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,480
You don't even know that.

267
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
A good kisser?

268
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,030
You're definitely someone who came back
from overseas!

269
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,720
Alright.

270
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,550
Come, show me

271
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,480
what you've got.

272
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,830
Sure.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,680
Let's begin!

274
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,590
I'm moving.

275
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,590
Okay.

276
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
No way!

277
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,750
It feels

278
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:44,679
like

279
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,030
something

280
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,110
is off.

281
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
Is it because

282
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,310
we know each other too well?

283
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,030
You're right.

284
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
I am sure it is because

285
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,110
we have been buddies for too many years.

286
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,880
From friends to lovers all of a sudden.

287
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
We are still getting used to it.

288
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,590
Yes...

289
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,640
You're right.

290
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,350
If we don't see each other clearly,

291
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,200
would it get any better?

292
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,160
I think so.

293
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,640
Maybe this will work.

294
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,880
Come on.

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,550
Come on.

296
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
Stop!

297
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,160
I feel like I'm kissing Wong Kar-wai!

298
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,350
It's really funny!

299
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,550
Forget it.

300
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,640
Whatever.

301
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,350
Forget it!

302
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,680
Just go with the flow.

303
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,590
I'm sleepy.

304
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
Sleep with me for a while.

305
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Anything for you.

306
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,070
You're not allowed to leave.

307
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm not leaving.

308
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,750
Jiang.

309
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,000
How's the preparation going?

310
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,790
Not so bad.

311
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,750
Do your best.

312
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,920
You too.

313
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,550
Wish us luck.

314
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,070
(Dear leaders and my fellow colleagues,)

315
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,880
good day, everyone.

316
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm Guo Kai, the purchasing manager.

317
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,110
Thanks to your trust in me,

318
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm able to stand here and campaign.

319
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,830
The company has accompanied me

320
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,110
from a newly graduated intern
to my current position

321
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,240
and witnessed my growth.

322
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,750
I want to build an ambitious

323
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,070
and self-driven team.

324
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,160
This is also a requirement
I have for myself.

325
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,790
Four years ago,

326
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,750
I switched from the business department
to the human resources department.

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,590
This change in roles

328
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,270
has allowed me to have
a more comprehensive

329
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,400
and in-depth understanding
of the company.

330
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,720
I got insight into the core decisions
to shape the future of the company

331
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,550
and our talents.

332
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,480
As long as it involves
the company's assets and benefits,

333
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,550
regardless of the size,

334
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,680
it will be my responsibility.

335
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,550
Talent is the core asset of a company.

336
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,480
Only employees with sufficient trust

337
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,790
and a sense of belonging

338
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,240
can unleash tremendous value

339
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,270
and energy for our company.

340
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,000
I am also confident and capable of

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,160
becoming a qualified
executive vice president

342
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,160
to continue fighting for the company.

343
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
I have one more question for you two.

344
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,680
Promotion will inevitably
involve team changes.

345
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,480
What plans do you have

346
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,110
for your new team members?

347
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,200
Of course I will prioritize
our company's interests

348
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,590
and build a new team.

349
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,830
I might have some different ideas.

350
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,590
I feel that it is easier
to adapt to the position

351
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,750
than to adapt to people.

352
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,070
If I have the power,

353
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,270
I prefer my previous team.

354
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
It seems Ms. Fang is a nostalgic woman.

355
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,270
That's all for today.

356
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
The final result

357
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,310
will be announced after discussion.

358
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,000
The meeting is dismissed.

359
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,160
Let's go eat together.

360
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,510
I have a date today.

361
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,030
A date?

362
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,200
Come clean,

363
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,510
have you gotten into a relationship?

364
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,030
It's a secret.

365
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
I'm off!

366
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,400
I brought you
some seaweed-wrapped rice rolls

367
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,640
and octopus takoyaki.

368
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you want anything else?

369
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,400
So much ketchup.

370
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,640
What about you?

371
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,480
You can't eat this.

372
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
The problem is when I bought this,

373
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,550
I said it's for my girlfriend.

374
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,550
So he squeezed more.

375
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,790
Then I'll have to eat a little more.

376
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,030
I'll have a taste.

377
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,350
It's quite delicious.

378
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,830
What are you laughing at?

379
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,790
Silly girl.

380
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,440
You have my lipstick stains
all over your face.

381
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,790
Really?

382
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,440
You look so dumb.

383
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,160
I got it.

384
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,030
Ming Yu, are you busy?

385
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,350
What's the matter?

386
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,880
Nothing.

387
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,590
I just miss you.

388
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,310
I'm here to see you.

389
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,350
No, I'm just curious

390
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,030
about the grading matter.

391
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,880
Did Mr. Feng tell you something?

392
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,240
No.

393
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,790
Aren't the results coming out soon?

394
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,790
You are the person he recommended.

395
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,480
If there is any news,

396
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,070
I wonder if you'll be the first to know.

397
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,030
Don't worry, just wait for the results.

398
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,350
These small rumors

399
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,350
are meaningless.

400
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
What do you want for dinner?

401
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,070
It's finally the end of
performance review.

402
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,920
We finally have time for a good meal.

403
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,550
I'll think about it later.

404
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, I'll leave you to it.

405
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,310
I'm off.

406
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,240
Will you join me later?

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
What do you want to eat?

408
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,880
Yesterday's mail.

409
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,750
Did you get it?

410
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,000
I got it.

411
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,750
The entire company got it.

412
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,510
It's impossible

413
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,830
to keep this matter a secret.

414
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,160
Is that so?

415
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,880
Why did she help with this matter?

416
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
I know, right?

417
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,880
Here she comes.

418
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,720
Ms. Fang,

419
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,590
Mr. Feng wants to see you in his office.

420
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,680
Did he say what it was about?

421
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,790
He didn't.

422
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,510
(Someone in the company knew)

423
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,480
(about your pregnancy.)

424
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,160
(That person has also found your report
at the gynecological hospital)

425
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
(before joining the company.)

426
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,640
(But I wasn't the one reporting all this
to the company.)

427
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,550
(It's not your fault to get pregnant.)

428
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,160
(From a legal perspective,)

429
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,750
the company doesn't have the right
to dismiss you

430
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,920
just because you are pregnant.

431
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,830
I find it really hard to understand you.

432
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,680
Who are you standing with?

433
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,310
(I wish I could help you.)

434
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,510
The email says

435
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,960
that you instructed Yue Tong
to conceal the truth

436
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,510
and told the company
she found herself pregnant

437
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,350
after the formal entry,

438
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,830
is this true?

439
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,680
Mr. Feng.

440
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
It was my negligence

441
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
for not conducting
a proper background check.

442
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,160
But I did indeed find out
about it afterward.

443
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,270
Ming Yu.

444
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,880
From a moral standpoint,

445
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,110
I don't see any issue

446
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,030
with your words.

447
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,510
When I was younger,

448
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,070
I might have handled it the same way

449
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,960
if I encountered the same situation.

450
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,440
As the HR manager,

451
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,310
you should

452
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,880
consider the company's interests

453
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,840
when you're handling issues,

454
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,510
not just based
on your personal emotions.

455
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,680
Mr. Feng, I'm sorry.

456
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,880
This time is pretty sensitive.

457
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,030
Certainly, the person who sent the email

458
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,480
must have harbored some bad motive.

459
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,640
But regarding this matter,

460
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,750
I might not be able to help you.

461
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,000
Mingyu.

462
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,110
(Who do you support?)

463
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,000
(Support who?)

464
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,000
Guo Kai and Ms. Fang.

465
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,070
Everyone is betting

466
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,240
who will get the position
of vice president.

467
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,550
You're worrying for nothing.

468
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,680
Just wait for the announcement.

469
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,960
Initially, Guo Kai seemed unstoppable,

470
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,480
but after the performance review,

471
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,110
Ms. Fang clearly did a better job.

472
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,110
But who knows,

473
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,200
now it's revealed

474
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,590
she helped a former colleague
to conceal a pregnancy.

475
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,640
Who got exposed? Was it Ms. Fang?

476
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,240
And then?

477
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,790
Hard to tell.

478
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,070
Maybe, in the end,

479
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,350
she worked so hard for nothing.

480
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,110
I'm leaving.

481
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,920
Your pizza looks a bit questionable.

482
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,480
Will I get poisoned after eating it?

483
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,510
Don't worry, it won't kill you.

484
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,270
Really?

485
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,480
You try it, then.

486
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Let me see what it tastes like.

487
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,790
It is burnt.

488
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,830
It's burnt.
Why did you let me eat it, then?

489
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,920
My bad.

490
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,270
I thought you said it won't poison me?

491
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,310
He's back.

492
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,240
Zhuang Yuan.

493
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,070
Jiang Yi baked us pizza.

494
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,240
But it's all burnt.

495
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,070
Impressive, huh?

496
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,270
Just relax,

497
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,590
I've ordered takeout.

498
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,310
Tonight,

499
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,510
I will make sure you all
get to eat some hot pizza.

500
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,000
No need.

501
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,550
I'm full of your pink bubbles.

502
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,350
What's the matter? You seem troubled.

503
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,880
Did something happen
at your workplace?

504
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm a bit worried about Mingyu.

505
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,920
Mingyu?

506
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,240
What's it with Mingyu?

507
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,270
She got set up by Guo Kai.

508
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Guo Kai?

509
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
Aren't they a couple?

510
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
The Smiths?

511
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,880
Guo Kai is way more shameless
than the Smiths.

512
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,590
Now the whole company is
gossiping about Mingyu.

513
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,510
When they got engaged,

514
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,070
Guo Kai spoke so sweetly.

515
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,960
Now, for a position,

516
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
he turned his back on her.

517
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,920
Don't worry for now.

518
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,190
Our childhood friend, Fang Mingyu,

519
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,110
won't be easily set up.

520
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,320
(This time is pretty sensitive.)

521
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,440
Certainly, the person who sent the email

522
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,110
must have harbored some bad motive.

523
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,760
(Mingyu, I'm sorry.)

524
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,880
(I know whatever I say now won't help.)

525
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,920
(When I resigned,)

526
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,840
I did suspect you,

527
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,320
so I was a bit cautious

528
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,150
and recorded our conversation.

529
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
But I really had no intention

530
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,920
of using that recording for anything.

531
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,590
Until Guo Kai found me.

532
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,630
(I've helped you to settle the matter)

533
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,840
(with the company.)

534
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,310
(I can give you money too.)

535
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,110
(I want only one thing from you.)

536
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,760
(It won't cause you any harm)

537
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,480
(by giving this to me.)

538
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
What thing?

539
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,800
Your chat records with Mingyu.

540
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,510
I can't give you that.

541
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,630
For you,

542
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
this is the most favorable choice.

543
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,110
You'd better do as I say.

544
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
Otherwise, I don't know
what might happen.

545
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,550
I came to tell you

546
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,920
Guo Kai is terrifying.

547
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,840
He can do literally anything.

548
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,550
Thank you for your trust, everyone.

549
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,070
It's an affirmation of what I've done

550
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,110
and an encouragement for my future work.

551
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,670
Maybe some of you here

552
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,070
still don't know me well,

553
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,190
so you might still have doubts about me.

554
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,070
But that's okay.

555
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,960
I will prove myself
in my future endevors.

556
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,400
Why are you here?

557
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,670
Sorry for interrupting.

558
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,190
I have something to say to the leaders.

559
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,840
I understand your emotions,

560
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,190
but we haven't finished the meeting yet.

561
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,280
Whatever you have to say,

562
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
wait until after the meeting.

563
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,440
Li, no matter what,

564
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,230
Ms. Fang is still

565
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,880
the HR manager of the company.

566
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,110
She has the rights to join this meeting.

567
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,440
Mr. Feng.

568
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,400
The reason why I'm here today

569
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,440
isn't to listen to Guo Kai's speech.

570
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,510
I'm here to hand in
my resignation letter.

571
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,880
Regarding Yue Tong's matter,

572
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,710
I have a few words to say to everyone.

573
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,510
As the company's HR manager,

574
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,030
my job responsibility

575
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,960
is to weave a dense web

576
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,880
of company's rules

577
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,550
and contract terms

578
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,510
so as to safeguard
the company's interests.

579
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,920
But in all these years of work,

580
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,670
I found

581
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,550
that this web

582
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,190
sometimes becomes
too rational and heartless.

583
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,800
There's never a law that says

584
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,280
a company can dismiss an employee
for being pregnant.

585
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,360
And personally speaking,

586
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,230
I don't think a woman

587
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,670
should hide her pregnancy

588
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,760
for a job.

589
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,360
When Yue Tong

590
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,630
had to hide her pregnancy for this job,

591
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,110
my first instinct

592
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
was to cut her some slack.

593
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,710
I may not be suitable
for a human resources role.

594
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Fang Mingyu,

595
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,960
I've also worked in human resources.

596
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,230
I completely understand

597
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,880
what you have said.

598
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,030
You didn't handle
Yue Tong's situation properly.

599
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,510
But it also exposed flaws
in the company's system.

600
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,670
The company will make
necessary adjustments.

601
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,880
Resigning over something like this?

602
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,110
Is it necessary?

603
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,190
Don't be so impulsive.

604
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm resigning

605
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
not just because of this.

606
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
I've been working in our company

607
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,510
for eight years and three months.

608
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,000
To pursuit my career success,

609
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,880
I lost some of myself.

610
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,550
I have also lost

611
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,230
the opportunity to love publicly.

612
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,760
If I fell in love with a colleague,

613
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,670
I'd have to hide it.

614
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,760
But today,

615
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,480
I don't want to hide it anymore.

616
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,710
Guo Kai,

617
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,400
I think we should all be brave

618
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,960
to make our relationship public.

619
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,150
How long has it been?

620
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,360
More than a year.

621
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,360
Mr. Feng, I'm sorry.

622
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,320
As the HR manager of the company,

623
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,630
I did what I shouldn't have done.

624
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,840
So I have to resign.

625
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm sorry.

626
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,360
Well, fellow leaders,

627
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,190
I think

628
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,320
I can explain our relationship.

629
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,920
Fang Mingyu.

630
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,550
What was that?

631
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,280
Did I not make myself clear?

632
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm tired of hiding it.

633
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,840
It's not that
you didn't want to hide it.

634
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,230
You just did that on purpose.

635
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,070
Yes, I did.

636
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,590
Why are you so short-sighted right now?

637
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,230
What am I doing all this for?

638
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,110
I'm doing this for us.

639
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:37,590
Guo Kai, we're done.

640
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,280
Mingyu.

641
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,480
Mingyu!

642
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,360
Mingyu!

643
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,320
Mingyu!

644
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,480
Are you okay?

645
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,190
I'm fine.

646
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Just now, you and Guo Kai...

647
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,550
I said,

648
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,150
I'm fine. Don't worry.

649
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,880
As you said.

650
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,230
If you need something,

651
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,110
call me anytime.

652
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,320
Zhuang Yuan, I quit.

653
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,710
Why did you quit your job?

654
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,150
It's not a big deal.

655
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,110
I just want to find a new job.

656
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
Don't tell Yingzi and Jiang Yi yet.

657
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,190
I don't want to make them worried.

658
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
Promise me.

659
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,510
Keep it a secret.

660
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm off.

661
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,920
What the...

662
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,630
Are you okay?

663
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,280
I'm fine.

664
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,960
I'll go... I'll go get the door.

665
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,110
Zhuang Yuan, here you are.

667
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,400
The dumplings are wrapped.

668
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,550
Which one

669
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,150
you want to eat?

670
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,440
Zhuang Yuan,

671
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,960
which dumplings you prefer?

672
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,030
Zhuang Yuan?

673
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,800
There's something wrong with you.

674
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm fine.

675
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,920
You look dispirited.

676
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,230
Did something happen to Mingyu?

677
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,030
What could happen to Mingyu?

678
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,030
Fine, if you don't tell me,

679
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,480
I'll call Mingyu and ask her.

680
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,510
Don't.

681
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,030
Tell me what's going on, then.

682
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,440
I found you're not yourself
the moment you came in. Tell me.

683
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,550
This really has nothing
to do with Mingyu.

684
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,230
I'm just tired from work.

685
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,190
Is that true?

686
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,880
Enough, you two stop being suspicious.

687
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,360
I'll cook dumplings by myself.

688
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,880
Why are you the only one here?

689
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,230
Yifei and Yingzi accompanied Grandma
for the acupuncture session.

690
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,320
I stayed to look after the store.

691
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,000
Do you want some?

692
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,230
Did you make it? Is it edible?

693
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,550
Why? You don't want it?

694
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,280
Nothing.

695
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,000
I'll have one.

696
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,190
Eat up.

697
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,960
Have you eaten?

698
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,550
Yeah.

699
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:09,840
One person?

700
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,280
Why don't you sit here?

701
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,030
Where is Lan Yifei?
