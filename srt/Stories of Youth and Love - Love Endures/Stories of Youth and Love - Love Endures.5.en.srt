[Episode 5]

3
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,150
(Yingzi.)

4
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,960
(Over here.)

5
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,400
(Come.)

6
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,509
What took you so long?

7
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,240
I told you something held me up.

8
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,960
What is this for?

9
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,990
Tell me honestly.

10
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,600
You left Beijing for Jiangzhou.

11
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,510
Is it because of Zhuang Yuan?

12
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,050
Don't deny it.

13
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,840
Stop pretending.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,790
I can

15
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,070
see through you.

16
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,350
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,320
What?

18
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,910
Xu Hong.

19
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,150
Hi, Mrs. Xu.

20
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,550
Zhuang Yuan.

21
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,070
Madam.

22
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,510
Yingzi is getting lovelier.

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,070
Yes, she is.

24
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,040
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,430
We happened to meet here.

26
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,400
Come.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,760
Careful.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,550
Slow down.

29
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,760
Well, I've ordered coffee.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,670
Can you drink coffee?

31
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,200
I...

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,630
My heart beats irregularly
when I have coffee.

33
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,280
I can't drink.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,390
That's right.

35
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,510
We can drink

36
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,160
soy milk.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,480
Right, soy milk.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,630
What soy...

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,909
Soy milk.

40
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:25,629
Let's go.

41
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,910
Both of them aren't acting
like themselves.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,830
What is going on?

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,230
This is a blind date.

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,390
Who are they going to date?

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,760
They set up this blind date for us.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
For us?

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Wait, this is nonsense.

48
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,880
My mom insisted

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,040
that you always came
to my place alone back then.

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I came to copy your answer

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,230
on everyone's behalf.

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,760
She once found
the two movie tickets we had

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,600
while doing the laundry.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,280
This is impossible.

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,880
It must be you and Fang Mingyu.

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,000
My mom is being ridiculous.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,950
Why is she doing this?

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,070
Forget it. Don't get yourself worked up.

59
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,200
Let's put on an act.

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,480
Anyway, I'm leaving in a few days.

61
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
Look at them.

62
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,760
They are watching us.

63
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,630
On my count to three,

64
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,790
we'll laugh.

65
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,200
One, two, three.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Turn your head.

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,350
Look, they are so happy.

68
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,600
We should get going

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,390
and let them talk.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,600
Let's go shopping.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,950
You're right.

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,910
They might be nervous

73
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,880
if we stand here.

74
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
Exactly.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,510
We should be mindful.

76
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:34,830
Yes, be mindful.

77
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,600
We can take a hint.

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's go.

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
Yingzi.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
You went to visit her last time.

81
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,950
Has she been faring well?

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Does she have a boyfriend now?

83
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,350
I'm not sure.

84
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,560
What do you mean?

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,830
I really don't know.

86
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,510
When I went to her place last time,

87
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,280
I did see a guy.

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
But I have no idea
about their relationship.

89
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,510
She didn't tell me anything.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Well, you're to blame.

91
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,630
You should've approached her
these years.

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,600
How do you know that I haven't?

93
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,790
Besides,

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
she's leading her own life now.

95
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't want to bother her.

96
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,390
All right, enough about me.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,830
Jiang is back now.

98
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,800
What's your plan?

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,590
What plan can I have?

100
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,760
It's just a brief visit.

101
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,120
He will go back soon.

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,510
Did Jiang contact you after that?

103
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,150
He promised my mom
that he would come for dinner.

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,030
He's a liar.

105
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,390
It would've been better
if he had said no,

106
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,590
like Mingyu did.

107
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,880
I noticed Jiang had changed a lot

108
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,070
after he returned this time.

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,070
He looks preoccupied.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Actually, I know

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,510
what he's been up to these years.

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
I've been keeping track

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,200
of the gaming industry in the UK.

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,510
I read an article before.

115
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,120
It's about

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
a Chinese game designer, Jiang Yi,

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
who designed

118
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,920
a game named "Sky City".

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,630
I was happy about it,

120
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
and I sent him a message on QQ.

121
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
But he didn't reply.

122
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,270
A while ago,

123
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,760
I came across another news

124
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,470
reporting that the game company

125
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,710
launched a new game a few months ago,

126
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,070
named "Sky Adventure".

127
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,360
The main storyline is very similar
to "Sky City".

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,470
Even the titles look alike.

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
However, Jiang Yi isn't included
in the creator list.

130
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,800
So you suspect

131
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,440
that Jiang Yi participated
in the game design

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,320
and got kicked out in the end?

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,590
I don't know.

134
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,470
This is just my guess.

135
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,590
After all, we haven't
been in touch for years.

136
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,440
I don't want to ask him abruptly.

137
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,200
Besides,

138
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,920
perhaps he doesn't know us to know.

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,070
Indeed.

140
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,760
We haven't met for twelve years.

141
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,360
People change.

142
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,880
Yeah.

143
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,950
I really miss

144
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,920
the Jiang Yi,

145
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
who used to be a crybaby.

146
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,440
Everyone will age

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
and outgrow their childish behavior.

148
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,000
Guan Chao and I are going
to play basketball.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,760
Do you want to join us?

150
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Sure.

151
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Chao.

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,830
You're here.

153
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's play a round.

154
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,030
Bring it on.

155
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,760
By the way, Yingzi,

156
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,440
who will you cheer for

157
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,630
between us?

158
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,030
You better do some stretching now.

159
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,830
You're in your thirties now,

160
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
Dr. Zhuang.

161
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,470
Fine.

162
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,470
Do you want to join us?

163
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,360
Me?

164
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,920
What?

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I just scored.

166
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,560
So?

167
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,470
Aren't you here to cheer for me?

168
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,470
Go! Come on! You got this!

169
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,070
Jiang Yi is the best.

170
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
Boys are really childish.

171
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,590
Where are Yifei and Mingyu?

172
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,510
Yifei went to the dance practice.

173
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,440
Mingyu was called to grade papers.

174
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,590
Did the Smiling Tiger say

175
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,800
that all papers
need parents' signatures?

176
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Your grades are good.

177
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,590
Don't worry.

178
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,200
I'm worried about him.

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,590
Me?

180
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,760
Why?

181
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
You failed four papers.

182
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,240
Your dad is going to beat you to a pulp.

183
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,270
We can't leave him alone.

184
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,680
His father will beat him badly

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,590
if he goes upstairs alone.

186
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,070
You're right.

187
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,470
Let's go.

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,120
What's wrong?

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,630
What happened?

190
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,390
I sprained my foot.

191
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, dear. Are you sure
you want to save him now?

192
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,830
What now? Should we help him?

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,270
Of course.

194
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,470
Friends matter the most.

195
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,630
Dad, these are my mid-term papers.

196
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,470
I didn't do well.

197
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,510
Please sign them.

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,560
You failed two papers last time,

199
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,070
and now four.

200
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,800
It seems you need more beating

201
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
to help you learn the lesson.

202
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,040
Hold up.

203
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,710
Wait, Mr. Guan.

204
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,350
Wait.

205
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,990
Put me down.

206
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,400
What happened to you?

207
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,280
I sprained my foot.

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,920
Mr. Guan.

209
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,230
We don't quite approve

210
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,070
of how you educate your child.

211
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,350
However, this is your way,

212
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,440
and we have no right to interfere.

213
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,160
Yes.

214
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,750
We know

215
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,160
that Guan Chao failed four papers,

216
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,750
go ahead if you want to beat him.

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
But Guan Chao is our best friend.

218
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,560
So we decided

219
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
to share the beating with him.

220
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,870
Language paper is on me.

221
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,750
Physics is on me.

222
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,070
English is on me.

223
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,990
As for biology,

224
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,830
Guan Chao will take that.

225
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,320
Mr. Guan, please.

226
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,590
Beat us now.

227
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,070
Don't beat my face. I'm a girl.

228
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Mr. Guan, I'll take the beating

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
for Huang Yingzi.

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Mr. Guan, please beat me.

231
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,320
No.

232
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,110
Mr. Guan, beat me.

233
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,070
Beat me.

234
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,320
- Beat me.
- Beat me.

235
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,800
Enough. Stop it!

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,750
Fine.

237
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,040
I will sign the papers.

238
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,800
You may go.

239
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Thank you for sparing us, Mr. Guan.

240
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,040
Guan Chao, go.

241
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
Mr. Guan, we'll be leaving, then.

242
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:53,989
See you, Mr. Guan.

243
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:54,919
Be careful.

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,750
The other way round.

245
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,560
See you, Mr. Guan.

246
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,710
Ouch.

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
You might not believe this.

248
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,470
But this is the most touching moment

249
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,470
in my life.

250
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,710
What has gotten into you?

251
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,280
Stop being sentimental.

252
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,230
(I'm so sorry, Guan Chao.)

253
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,160
(Xing is preparing
for the national college entrance exam.)

254
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
(His dad has to look after his grandma.)

255
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,870
(So I can't make it to your wedding.)

256
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,680
(Please accept this red packet.)

257
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,160
(It's for you and Yang Fan.)

258
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,350
(I wish you a happy marriage.)

259
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm fine.

260
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,110
I mean it.

261
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Let's play.

262
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,440
Dear.

263
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,710
Open the door, dear.

264
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,920
Don't even think about it.

265
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,680
Unless you give us red packets.

266
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
Open the door first.

267
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,350
Yang Fan said
you must give out red packets.

268
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,070
We will.

269
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,590
Push the door!

270
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,560
Ladies, red packets!

271
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Yingzi.

272
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Which side are you on?

273
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,320
You fooled us.

274
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
How about this?

275
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,470
I will ask you a question.

276
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,640
You can come in

277
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,590
if you got it right.

278
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,590
If not,

279
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,280
Guan Chao will sing us a song, okay?

280
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,830
Okay.

281
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,920
Not okay.

282
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
I can't carry a tune.

283
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,400
What is the greatest regret
Adam and Eve had

284
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,350
when they got married?

285
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,160
Yingzi, this question is silly.

286
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
Exactly.

287
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,230
Guan Chao, sing us a song.

288
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,750
The greatest regret Adam and Eve had
when they got married

289
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,830
was having no guests

290
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,800
at their wedding.

291
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,590
That's correct.

292
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,680
Open the door, Yingzi.

293
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,040
You said

294
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,830
you wouldn't come.

295
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,200
But I accepted your wishing card.

296
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,200
Also,

297
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,470
you should return me

298
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
"The Life of Jiang Yi".

299
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,440
Huh, you wish.

300
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,520
(Let's welcome)

301
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,350
the bride.

302
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,230
Guan Chao.

303
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,470
I will entrust my daughter to you.

304
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,830
Please take good care of her
on my behalf.

305
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,680
Coming next,

306
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,710
let's welcome the groom's parents
to the stage

307
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,440
to send their blessings.

308
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,470
Dear guests,

309
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,040
friends, and relatives.

310
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,990
All of you here today

311
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,560
are our neighbors

312
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,990
who have watched these kids
since childhood.

313
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,590
When I first met Guan Chao,

314
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,590
he was only this tall.

315
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,470
He used to be a chubby, silly boy.

316
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,440
And now,

317
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,590
he's all grown up.

318
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,950
He's becoming a husband.

319
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Soon, he will become a father.

320
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm truly happy for you.

321
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,280
Before coming to the wedding,

322
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,200
I asked my wife a question.

323
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,230
I wondered

324
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,110
what else I could do

325
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,400
besides

326
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,750
giving a red packet

327
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,070
for his wedding.

328
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,750
My wife told me

329
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,230
to drink less.

330
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,440
But today,

331
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,070
I want to prove to all of you

332
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,440
that the fathers of Hangtian City

333
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
not only know
how to drink, brag, play cards,

334
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,040
or do the square dancing,

335
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,830
but we also do this.

336
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,520
Guan Chao.

337
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,280
Yang Fan.

338
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,040
This is a wedding gift for you

339
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,520
from us fathers.

340
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,870
Come on! Go!

341
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,710
Today is the most important day

342
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,710
in my life.

343
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm really happy

344
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,320
to have all of you present
at my wedding.

345
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Also, I'm grateful to my wife, Yang Fan.

346
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
I thank her for marrying me.

347
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,870
I'm 30 years old.

348
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I don't have many friends.

349
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,350
My best friends

350
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,350
all stayed at the age of 18.

351
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,040
After we turned 18,

352
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,870
we went our separate ways.

353
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,710
We only get to reunite

354
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,320
twelve years later.

355
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,440
Yingzi.

356
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,270
Guan Chao, don't cry!

357
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,510
Zhuang.

358
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,510
Jiang.

359
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,230
And Mingyu.

360
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,270
Thank you.

361
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,920
I knew you would come.

362
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,510
Why thank me?

363
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,230
I'm here for Guan Chao.

364
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,160
You just won't admit it.

365
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,990
As if you didn't know me at all.

366
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,880
Thank you so much.

367
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,750
I know you have overcome many obstacles

368
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,680
and make a lot of effort

369
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,550
to give me a wedding

370
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,030
without regret.

371
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,840
For the past twelve years,

372
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,120
I have stayed here,

373
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,550
waiting for you to come back.

374
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,400
Today, my wish comes true.

375
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,400
We love you, Guan Chao.

376
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,640
You see, Guan Chao

377
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,270
becomes mature and composed
after getting married.

378
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,920
Indeed.

379
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,160
Children.

380
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,510
When are you going to invite us
to your wedding?

381
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,270
That's right.

382
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,880
Mingyu.

383
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
You can't just focus on your career

384
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
and overlook your marriage.

385
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,680
I have a boyfriend.

386
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,600
You do?

387
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,880
Mingyu is a sensible girl.

388
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,550
She never lets her parents worry.

389
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,230
Jiang Yi, do you have a girlfriend?

390
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,840
If you don't,

391
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
I can introduce someone to you.

392
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,160
Mrs. Zhuang.

393
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,160
I don't need that.

394
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,550
Why not?

395
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,120
You're not young anymore.

396
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,950
You know what?

397
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,550
Men should start a family

398
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,920
before focusing on their careers...

399
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Well, Mrs. Zhuang.

400
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,790
Actually, I have a girlfriend.

401
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,270
Coming next is the most awaited session.

402
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,840
May I have

403
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
all single ladies

404
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,310
stand before the stage, please?

405
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,080
We will see who is lucky enough

406
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,600
to catch the bouquet from the bride.

407
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,750
You showed my mom

408
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,950
your girlfriend's picture?

409
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,600
I did.

410
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,550
It's great news.

411
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,950
Why didn't you tell us about it?

412
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,990
You never asked.

413
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,790
My mom said

414
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,310
she was a foreigner.

415
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,950
She has darker skin.

416
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,680
Is she African?

417
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,680
So, what does she look like?

418
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
Show me the picture.

419
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,080
No.

420
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,790
But you've shown my mom.

421
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,200
Why can't I see that?

422
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,230
How about this?

423
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,440
If you can catch the bouquet,

424
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll show it to you.

425
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,270
I really hate that, though.

426
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,270
All right.

427
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,120
Are you ready?

428
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,990
Come.

429
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,310
On three.

430
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,640
Three,

431
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,990
two,

432
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,600
one.

433
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,510
Here you go.

434
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
Many kids ask me

435
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,470
why the six of us are so close.

436
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,510
But I don't bother
explaining it to them.

437
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,680
So I said

438
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,550
it was fate that brought us together.

439
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,120
Can you not talk nonsense to kids?

440
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,230
You don't believe me?

441
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,310
We will verify this.

442
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,400
There are seven balls in this pouch.

443
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Six red balls

444
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,750
and one blue ball.

445
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,160
Each of us will take one.

446
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,200
Then?

447
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,880
Then,

448
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,310
if all of us get the red balls,

449
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,400
it means

450
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,750
that fate smiles upon us.

451
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,710
Boring.

452
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,510
Probability plays a part here,

453
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,790
not fate.

454
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,510
Come on, let's play.

455
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,550
Since Yingzi said so,

456
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,360
let's take one.

457
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,790
Here.

458
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,230
I don't want to be the first one.

459
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,990
I'm afraid I might get the blue ball.

460
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,790
I'll go first.

461
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,360
Okay.

462
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,510
Yifei.

463
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,400
Mingyu.

464
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,750
Zhuang Yuan.

465
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Jiang Yi, it's your turn.

466
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,750
I'm not playing this.

467
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,160
Or are you scared

468
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,230
that you will get

469
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,600
the only blue ball?

470
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,230
It's my turn.

471
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,990
And now, the moment of truth.

472
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,310
On my count to three,

473
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
reveal the ball in your hand.

474
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,120
One,

475
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,080
two,

476
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,440
three!

477
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,310
Seriously?

478
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,880
Another red ball.

479
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,750
See?

480
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,750
This is a miraculous moment
when fate smiles on us.

481
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,270
That was close.

482
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,640
I almost caught the bouquet.

483
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,080
You have to accept it, anyway.

484
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,120
Let's play a game.

485
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,790
Truth or Dare, do you mean?

486
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,440
How did you know?

487
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,950
It's written all over your face.

488
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,400
You must be wanting to ask Jiang

489
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,470
about his girlfriend.

490
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,310
I'm not asking such boring things.

491
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,310
Come on, let's play.

492
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,440
Okay.

493
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,710
Guan Chao, today is your wedding.
You're the boss.

494
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,750
Let's start with you,

495
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,080
then go in this order.

496
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,160
Each of us will speak.

497
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,950
Zhuang Yuan.

498
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,950
Since we were little,

499
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,470
you're the smartest one
among us,

500
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,550
and you're now a PhD student.

501
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,710
Don't you find it boring

502
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,920
or feel tired?

503
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,790
Of course I feel tired.

504
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,840
I'm so fried
that I think I can't graduate.

505
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,200
If I really can't,

506
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
my eight years of effort
in my PhD studies would be in vain.

507
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,470
But when I think about it,

508
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,360
I kind of like it, though.

509
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,200
My turn.

510
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,880
I'll ask.

511
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,920
Fang Mingyu.

512
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,030
Since we were little,

513
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,440
you're the most serious,

514
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,160
never wrong,

515
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
and the most composed person

516
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,840
among us.

517
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,030
Have you made any decision

518
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,120
that you regretted it?

519
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,710
I did.

520
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,710
I shouldn't have chosen this job.

521
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
It's true that I'm a white-collar now,

522
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,640
but I can't sit comfortably

523
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,160
in an air-conditioned office room!

524
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,750
Well, that's enough.

525
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,600
Next, Huang Yingzi.

526
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
I have no questions for her.

527
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,950
Then I'll drink.

528
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,080
I'll follow suit.

529
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,790
I'm going to ask Jiang Yi.

530
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
Why didn't you reply to my messages
for twelve years?

531
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,790
I didn't do well in my life.

532
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,310
I felt ashamed to face you.

533
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,680
Because of the game?

534
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,510
It was my eight years of hard work.

535
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,080
Now everything is gone.

536
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,880
Jiang.

537
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,920
It's incredible of you

538
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,950
to have developed an amazing game.

539
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,920
To me,

540
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,470
all of you are brilliant.

541
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,470
Zhuang Yuan

542
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,400
is a PhD student at Hua University.

543
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,310
Mingyu

544
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,160
is the leading figure in the company,
apparently.

545
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:45,990
Yingzi

546
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,470
is a great journalist.

547
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,950
All of you have realized your dreams.

548
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,120
You are getting closer

549
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,990
to your ideal life.

550
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,990
However, as for me,

551
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,200
I've never left Hangtian City.

552
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,160
It's like

553
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm still a teenage boy.

554
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,550
Come on, cheer up a bit.

555
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,470
The world of grown-ups

556
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,600
is full of troubles.

557
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,270
Exactly.

558
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,950
We don't get to do this all the time.

559
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,030
Let's drink. Come on.

560
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,750
Let's booze it up.

561
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,950
From now on,

562
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,470
every one of us
must tell a juicy secret.

563
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,160
A juicy one.

564
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,440
Start with you, Huang Yingzi.

565
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,270
Tell me.

566
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Do you like someone?

567
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,990
Shut up.

568
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,600
Yes, I do.

569
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,550
Who is it?

570
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,880
Tell us.

571
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,710
Ding Ye.

572
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,030
You're no fun.

573
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,200
Can you say something

574
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,230
that none of us know?

575
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,920
I have a secret.

576
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,920
What?

577
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,030
I think I have lost interest
in my boyfriend.

578
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,120
But I can't bear

579
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,200
the cost of a breakup before age thirty.

580
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,270
I have a secret, too.

581
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,990
There's someone I can't forget.

582
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,470
But I'm not brave enough to tell her.

583
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,230
Why are you stuck in it?

584
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,160
Get up.

585
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,270
What?

586
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,600
I'll pull you out.

587
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,270
Don't pull me, Huang Yingzi.

588
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,510
What? What did you call me?

589
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,600
Why are you pulling me, Huang Yingzi?

590
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm going to ask you now.

591
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,920
You said

592
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,950
that drunk people wouldn't
remember anything they say

593
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,360
after waking up the next day.

594
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,230
What is it about?

595
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,880
My dad brought this rice wine
from his business trip.

596
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,360
The aftereffect is strong.

597
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,030
After drinking it,

598
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,640
you won't remember anything
the next day.

599
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
For real?

600
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,920
We will remember nothing

601
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
the next day?

602
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,200
That's what the owner's manual says.

603
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,120
Okay.

604
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,030
Since all of us are adults now,

605
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,750
let's play a game.

606
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,950
What game?

607
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,310
Truth or Dare.

608
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,160
Everyone will say
the name of the person they like.

609
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,790
No.

610
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm not playing this.

611
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,680
Why are you afraid?

612
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
We'll lose memory afterward.

613
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
Even if we say it,

614
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,550
no one will remember the next day.

615
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,400
Don't worry.

616
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,680
I can't play this.

617
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,440
It's too boring.

618
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,640
No.

619
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,750
Today is my birthday.

620
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,400
You all should listen to me.

621
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,200
Cheers.

622
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,790
It's burning.

623
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,360
Come, we'll draw lots.

624
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,120
Say the name of the person you like

625
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,710
according to the number you get.

626
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,880
Three, two, one. Start!

627
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,030
Who's the first one?

628
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm the first one.

629
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,790
Go on.

630
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,120
I like Yifei.

631
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
We knew that.

632
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,920
It's boring.

633
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,710
Who's the second one?

634
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,920
Who's next?

635
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,710
Fire away.

636
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,840
Zhuang Yuan, come on.

637
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,640
Tell us.

638
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,470
Hurry.

639
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,510
What?

640
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,470
What were you mumbling?

641
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,680
Who's it? I couldn't hear that.

642
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,160
Fang Mingyu.

643
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,990
Fang Mingyu?

644
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,640
It's my turn.

645
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,510
I like Jiang Yi.

646
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,750
Fang Mingyu, you're no fun.

647
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,750
We're playing Truth or Dare.

648
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,920
We're not saying the names of the people
who sit next to you.

649
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,680
What's with you? Drink.

650
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,120
I...

651
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,470
Come on.

652
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,550
Hey, man. It's a small deal.

653
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,550
Don't mind it.

654
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,030
I like you.

655
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,200
I like Zhuang Yuan, okay?

656
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,750
Jiang Yi, it's your turn.

657
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,270
I like...

658
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,840
I like...

659
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,120
I prefer it a secret.

660
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,510
Jiang Yi, you're the worst.

661
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,310
Drink.

662
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,030
Sure.

663
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,990
Jeez.

664
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,550
It's your turn, Yifei.

665
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,750
I...

666
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,470
I like...

667
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,640
I...

668
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,680
- Guan Chao!
- Guan Chao!

669
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,080
Enough.

670
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,160
She will speak for herself.

671
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,790
I...

672
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,680
I like

673
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
all of you.

674
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,200
Drink.

675
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,200
Come.

676
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,680
Yeah.

677
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,550
Fill the glass.

678
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,640
I regretted it.

679
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
I expected you

680
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,160
to return a few years
after studying abroad.

681
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,680
But it has been twelve years,

682
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,200
and I've had no news from you.

683
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,640
Had I known it would turn out like this,

684
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,950
I wouldn't have let you leave,
no matter what.

685
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,400
To be honest,

686
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,600
I'm furious.

687
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,080
Very furious.

688
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,910
I'm so furious

689
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,480
that I think I will never forgive you.

690
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,120
But the moment I saw you,

691
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,040
the anger disappeared.

692
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,960
Jiang Yi.

693
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,640
I forgive you.

694
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,310
Can you please forgive me?

695
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,390
Can you please forgive me?

696
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,560
Forgive me...

697
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,310
I forgive you, too.

698
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,520
Don't worry.

699
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,560
You can come back at any time.

700
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,910
There's no need to see us off.

701
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,310
Let's stop here.

702
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,640
Zhuang Yuan.

703
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,790
How long will you stay here?

704
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,680
A few more days.

705
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,830
I'll accompany my mom
for a checkup.

706
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,310
What's wrong with you all?

707
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,560
Since you've returned,

708
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,870
why don't you stay a few more days?

709
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,560
It's good to stay at home.

710
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,520
But I have to work.

711
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,120
What about you?

712
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,710
What's your plan after this?

713
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,710
Are you going back to the UK

714
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,830
or somewhere else?

715
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,390
I haven't decided yet.

716
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,200
Inform us

717
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,520
once you decide.

718
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,350
Well,

719
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,910
we're leaving, then.

720
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,790
We're leaving.

721
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,480
You need not send us off.

722
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Take care.

723
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,520
Be safe on your journey.

724
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,120
Please travel safely.

725
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,680
It was a rush trip back to Jiangzhou.

726
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,270
You haven't had the chance
to eat Grandma's wontons, right?

727
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,830
Are you busy with your work?

728
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,390
Yes, I'm quite busy.

729
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,270
But it's just about work,

730
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,560
nothing else.

731
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,710
Sometimes,

732
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,790
I feel like I'm a robot

733
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,080
who works non-stop.

734
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,160
You're luckier than me.

735
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,790
You know exactly what you like.

736
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,200
Not really.

737
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,270
At first, I quite like my job

738
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,480
as a journalist.

739
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,640
But then I realized

740
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,390
that it was different
from what I imagined.

741
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,910
Hangtian City has undergone
a big change.

742
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,480
I barely recognize this place.

743
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,350
Yes, it is.

744
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,310
Still, I feel familiar with it.

745
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,000
You've lived here for 18 years.

746
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,390
I thought
I would never come back here again.

747
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,350
You may have gone for years,

748
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,790
and you didn't keep in touch with us,

749
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,910
but I always got the feeling

750
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,910
that you would be back.

751
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,390
All of us would.

752
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,520
By the way,

753
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,350
how's your lawsuit going?

754
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,310
I gave that up.

755
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,560
I planned to drag on this case

756
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,000
for compensation in the first place.

757
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,790
Now, I want a clean break from the past

758
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,310
and start everything anew.

759
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,430
Did you know

760
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,310
what I found in my home?

761
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,520
Do I look ugly now?

762
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,390
Roll your eyes.

763
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,830
Like this?

764
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,310
Good enough.

765
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,640
Down.

766
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,080
Something must be wrong
with Liao Xing from Class 6.

767
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,480
He insisted to get my photo.

768
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
I bet he has got a crush on you.

769
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,560
In that case, I'll give him this photo.

770
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,120
He won't look at me afterward.

771
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,390
This might be a nightmare
of his teenage years.

772
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
You two should take a photo.

773
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,910
In case some boys harass you,

774
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,230
show them the photo.

775
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,560
I don't think so.

776
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,960
One, two, three.

777
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,310
Hold on.

778
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,390
What about the photo
for the boys we like?

779
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,640
Okay.

780
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
One, two, three.

781
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,270
Is the guy I saw in your place

782
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,750
your boyfriend?

783
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Pretty good.

784
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,600
We're grown-ups.

785
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,040
It's time to get a partner.

786
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,520
Well, how did you feel

787
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,870
seeing Jiang Yi again?

788
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,200
Well, nothing special.

789
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,480
It's the same as when I saw you guys.

790
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,640
Jeez,

791
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,750
you're stubborn.

792
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,790
It's been years.

793
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,160
Besides, he has a girlfriend.

794
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,000
What about your girlfriend?

795
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,230
Is she coming here with you

796
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,390
or staying in the UK?

797
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,350
Can I have a look at her photo?

798
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,350
She seems a bit familiar, though.

799
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,710
I think I saw her before.

800
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,430
But, Jiang,

801
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,430
your taste has changed so much.

802
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,960
Look closely.

803
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,120
Perhaps you know her.

804
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,200
She is

805
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,640
Spiderman.

806
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,200
That's her boyfriend.

807
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,200
Brat, it turns out

808
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,160
you made a fool of us.

809
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,230
If I didn't lie,

810
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,430
your mom would start finding me

811
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,910
a match in Hangtian City.

812
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,310
You're right, though.

813
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,960
Congratulations, you dodged a bullet.

814
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,910
Please keep this between us.

815
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,200
Don't worry.

816
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,350
(It's been years.)

817
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,480
Besides, he has a girlfriend.

818
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,710
Does he?

819
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,560
What if he doesn't?

820
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,390
Hello?

821
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,430
Yingzi, have you arrived home?

822
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,560
Yes. Why?

823
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,520
I have good news for you.

824
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,230
Jiang wants to stay in Jiangzhou.

825
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,000
He's staying.

826
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,000
He's going to look for a job
in Jiangzhou.

827
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Hello, are you still there?

828
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,310
Are you speechless with joy?

829
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,200
It's not that. I...

830
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,080
I was thinking

831
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,000
that Jiangzhou

832
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,910
is so charming

833
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,600
to make a great designer stay.

834
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,040
Who knows.

835
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,430
Maybe there's something special
that drew him there.

836
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,160
He's been abroad for years.

837
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,390
Probably, he's not familiar
with this city.

838
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,640
I will take this opportunity
to help him out.

839
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,200
It's a reparation

840
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,680
for what I owed him before.

841
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,560
You owed him?

842
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,910
He ghosted you these years.

843
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,790
I thought you would be furious
and take him into pieces

844
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,390
when you saw him this time.

845
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,270
You don't know what happened.

846
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm to blame.

847
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,960
I can understand

848
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,040
even if he has ignored me
all these years.

849
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,600
Wait.

850
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,080
I don't quite follow.

851
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,040
Well, that's all.

852
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,390
I have to unpack my luggage.

853
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,000
Bye.

854
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,430
You're finally back.
