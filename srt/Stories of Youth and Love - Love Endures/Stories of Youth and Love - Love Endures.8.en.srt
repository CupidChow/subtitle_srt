00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,480
This Horse is captured.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Move your Horse.

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,070
Move your Horse!

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,360
Block his Chariot.

7
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,120
Block his Chariot!

8
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,470
The Chariot.

9
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,000
I can move my Horse, right?

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
You can.

11
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,560
Checkmate.

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,430
Young man.

13
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,030
Don't bother coming again.

14
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,750
You're just a patzer.

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,630
Your skills

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,560
are far worse than

17
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,630
my two-and-a-half-year-old grandson.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,710
I admit defeat.

19
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,560
Mr. Guo is the top chess player
at the park.

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,520
Ever since his grandson was born,

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
he has never been defeated.

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
Why did you challenge him?

23
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,910
How does this concern you?

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
It doesn't.

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,430
I was watching you play.

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,190
You're worse than an amateur.

27
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,960
You've only learned

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,840
how to move Horses
and Elephants in two days.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360
You're just embarrassing yourself.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm fine with that. Why do you care?

31
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,710
I just think everyone has
something they're good at

32
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,910
and something they're not.

33
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Perhaps Marquez

34
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,000
doesn't know how to play Chinese chess.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,590
Marquez certainly
can't play Chinese chess.

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,470
Why do you waste precious time every day

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,960
doing something that you're not talented

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
nor interested in,

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,710
and is absolutely impossible
to accomplish?

40
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,150
Then why are you following me every day?

41
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,840
I wish to interview you.

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,630
I have clearly turned you down.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,240
So, why are you

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,800
wasting precious time every day

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
doing something
that's impossible to accomplish?

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,430
I don't think it's impossible

47
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,120
to make you accept my interview.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,710
I'm confident
that I can make you say yes.

49
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,400
Who gave you that confidence?

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,960
Fish Leong?

51
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,800
No.

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,360
She gives courage.
[Fish Leong's song is titled "Courage".]

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
The clarification of the indecency case.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,910
Have you read it?

55
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
I don't need you to clarify it.

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
I won't thank you either.

57
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,120
I didn't do it

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
just for you.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,430
It was also for me.

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,360
What's in it for you?

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,030
Your KPI?

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
Or curiosity?

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
Is there a conflict between the two?

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,030
Well,

65
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,560
between curiosity and KPI,
just pick one.

66
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to get to know you better.

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,590
I don't need anyone to know me.

68
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,310
Why are you

69
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,190
so eager

70
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,080
to refuse interaction with others?

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,910
Did you know

72
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,510
that many people
read your books growing up?

73
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,190
Because of you,

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,750
they are willing
to go against the world.

75
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,600
Because of you,

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,480
they did a lot of things

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
that were supposed to be impossible.

78
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,240
When I hit rock bottom,

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
your letter encouraged me.

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Huang Yingzi.

81
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,390
You told me
you were going to study hard.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,430
If you really meant it,

83
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,480
would it have turned out like this?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,070
Look how you did for
your Arts track exam.

85
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,630
If you keep this up,

86
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,120
you'll be done for!

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,360
Think over it carefully.

88
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,270
He's fuming.

89
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,190
Let's go.

90
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,070
Are you seriously upset
over Smiling Tiger's words?

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,630
I didn't do well back then

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,920
because I didn't study hard enough.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,920
I accept that.

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,310
But I really
put in the effort this time.

95
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,310
Why am I doing worse?

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,160
Why don't you just give up?

97
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,390
You still have me.

98
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,070
What for?

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
You won't do worse than me.

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Jiang Yi, do you want a cookie?

101
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,830
No thanks, Mingyu.

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040
What's going on
with Huang Yingzi lately?

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,630
Usually when I tease her,

104
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,390
she'll either kick me

105
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,430
or curse at me.

106
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,560
Why is she acting so weird lately?

107
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,160
How would I know?

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
I shouldn't have asked her.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,070
"I have experienced darkness before."

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Dear Ding Ye.

111
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,430
I am one of your biggest fans.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,070
"One of"?

113
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,480
I am a big fan of yours.

114
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,270
My name is...

115
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,950
I don't remember writing such a letter.

116
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,270
How can that be?

117
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,600
I have examined it carefully.

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
It's your handwriting.

119
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Listen.

120
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
I didn't write this letter.

121
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,560
I wrote those novels

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
not for the sake of encouraging anyone.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,560
It's simply because
I wanted to write them.

124
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,750
Yingzi.

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,390
Zhuang Yuan.

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,040
Come.

127
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,800
Pick what you want.

128
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,000
Why are you treating me to a meal today?

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,240
I have an important favor to ask of you.

130
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,310
Go ahead.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,830
Do you remember the present you gave me

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,190
for my 18th birthday?

133
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,120
"Glowworm" by Ding Ye.

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Excuse me, sir.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,630
It's "Sea Sparkle".

136
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,510
Oh, right.

137
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,000
At the time,

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
you were a huge fan of his
apart from Stefanie Sun.

139
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,430
I was.

140
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,600
Recently,

141
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,950
I've been wanting
to get an interview with him.

142
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,510
Ding Ye.

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
That means your prayers have finally

144
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,270
been answered.

145
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
You can say so.

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,630
But lately,

147
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,800
he has refused my interview.

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,360
I've tried everything.

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,270
He just wouldn't yield.

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,360
Why?

151
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,430
No idea.

152
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,000
Perhaps geniuses

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,510
tend to have peculiar personalities.

154
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
Did you know

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
that he's your fellow alumnus?

156
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,920
He's from Hua University?

157
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Chinese studies major.

158
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,510
Now that you mention it,

159
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,830
it does ring a bell.

160
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,480
I've seen his article

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,670
in the school magazine before.

162
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,270
That's why I want to visit
Hua University

163
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,910
to see if I can find anything about him.

164
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,720
I doubt you'll find anything.

165
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,000
It's been over a decade.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
That influential figure in the past

167
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
has now become a legend.

168
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,750
What else can I do?

169
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
I've run out of ideas.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
You're the only one I can ask now.

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,200
Won't you do me a solid?

172
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
I don't mind it.

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,080
But you're trying so hard.

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Is it because of

175
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,870
the bet you two made back then?

176
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,390
You know

177
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,630
about that bet?

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,480
Jiang Yi told you, didn't he?

179
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
That blabbermouth.

180
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
That bet

181
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,550
was indeed quite tempting.

182
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,030
Are you sure not a slight bit of this
is because of Jiang?

183
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
Since we made a bet,

184
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,080
I obviously want to win.

185
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
But I don't want him
to do a portrait of me.

186
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,030
If he really becomes
a major game designer,

187
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,120
his game portrait will be valuable.

188
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,510
Don't you want to be his muse?

189
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,270
Stop making that joke.

190
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,000
He has a girlfriend now.

191
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,790
Sour grape.

192
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,150
What does that mean?

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
Jealous.

194
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,960
What exactly are you trying to say?

195
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,550
Fine.

196
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll tell you a secret.

197
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
What kind of secret?

198
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:59,199
People like you are so annoying.

199
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,750
You say you know of a secret,

200
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,909
but you won't tell me.

201
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:02,959
Either you tell me

202
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,000
or don't tell me at all.

203
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,550
That girl. She has a boyfriend.

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
What?

205
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,320
Jiang Yi is her secret lover?

206
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Goodness gracious.

207
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,750
After all these years,

208
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,510
I didn't think Jiang Yi
would end up like this.

209
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,870
Why is he doing this?

210
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,150
On top of that, the guy

211
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,510
is more handsome than he is.

212
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
More handsome than he is?

213
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
More talented too.

214
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,030
Is Jiang Yi aware of all that?

215
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,670
He is.

216
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,790
Still, he's fine with that?

217
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,630
He's okay being a secret lover?

218
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,150
Just how attractive is this woman?

219
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,150
Mr. Gao.

220
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,440
I remember

221
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
the last time we spoke,

222
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,480
you offered to let me

223
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
lead the team

224
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,670
to develop "Sky City".

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,080
That was my condition for joining ATG.

226
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
But you're suddenly
calling a halt to the plan.

227
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,150
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,870
I can't accept that.

229
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,320
Jiang Yi.

230
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,200
I have never disapproved of

231
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
"Sky City".

232
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,750
But you've just returned from the UK,

233
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,200
so you're still unfamiliar with things.

234
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,270
You also need time
to get along with the team.

235
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,080
Zhao Yuan's project is more mature

236
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,870
and easier to break into the market.

237
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,790
It would be helpful to you too.

238
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,550
So you're saying

239
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,120
that this project has to go live

240
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,030
and gain a profit first

241
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,750
before I get the chance

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,510
to work on my own project.

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,750
Is that correct?

244
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
If that's how you interpret it,

245
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,150
you're not wrong.

246
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,510
Here's the thing, Mr. Gao.

247
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,120
Jiang Yi.

248
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,720
What Mr. Gao meant was,

249
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,960
every producer

250
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,200
needs time to get along
with team members

251
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
of their own.

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,440
Think of it as a warm-up

253
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,390
for your future projects

254
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
and find out if you like working

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,390
with those subordinates.

256
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,510
Can you do that?

257
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll show you who his girlfriend is.

258
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
This is his girlfriend.

259
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,150
Zendaya?

260
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,150
Isn't Spider-Man her boyfriend?

261
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
Not only does Jiang know,

262
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
but the whole world too.

263
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,720
Bravo.

264
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,390
He pulled a fast one on us.

265
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,960
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,910
At the wedding,

267
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,870
your mom and my mom had him cornered.

268
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,270
If he didn't lie about
having a girlfriend,

269
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,270
what would happen to him?

270
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,720
He would end up like us.

271
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,840
Forced to go on a blind date.

272
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,600
Exactly.

273
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,200
That's why I think

274
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,550
Jiang made a smart move.

275
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,150
Jiang Yi.

276
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,200
He's still the same
after all these years.

277
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,630
He still has a glib tongue.

278
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
If that's the case,

279
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm more eager to win the bet.

280
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Just tell me.

281
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,550
As Ding Ye's fellow alumnus,

282
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,670
what can I do for you?

283
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,240
I hope you can take me

284
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,000
to the library at Hua University

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,360
to go through his writings.

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,670
I might find something useful.

287
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,120
That's easy.

288
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,720
I just have to get you

289
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,550
a library card.

290
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,120
Thanks, buddy.

291
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,840
Once it's done,

292
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,720
I'll treat you to another meal.

293
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Let me be clear.

294
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,510
I'm not doing this for the food.

295
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm doing it to satisfy my curiosity.

296
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,080
What are you curious about?

297
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,720
Do you know how it feels when a drama
that you follow gets discontinued?

298
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,840
I don't.

299
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,840
Both of you are the drama
that I have been watching

300
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,200
for over 20 years.

301
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
But now, the story just stopped there.

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I want to know
which one of you will win.

303
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,910
Don't worry, buddy.

304
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,510
I won't let you down this time.

305
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,390
I'll try my best to win.

306
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,360
I hope so.

307
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,120
Jiang Yi.

308
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,390
Welcome to my team.

309
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,910
What would you like for lunch?

310
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,600
Join me.

311
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,200
It's okay. Go ahead without me.

312
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
I bought some food

313
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,750
to have later.

314
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,510
Next time, then.

315
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,440
We meet again.

316
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,910
Looks like we have similar tastes.

317
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,840
This is the only cafe at the company.

318
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,320
It probably has
nothing to do with tastes.

319
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,670
Have you tried their dark roast?

320
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,870
Not yet.

321
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
It tastes a bit bitter at first.

322
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,320
But as you drink it slowly,

323
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
you will discover the taste of red wine,

324
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,080
nuts,

325
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,440
and chocolate.

326
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,080
The person who ages the beans

327
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,670
must be patient enough

328
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,200
to get such a texture
through fermentation.

329
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm guessing
you're not referring to coffee.

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,910
I know.

331
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,120
You are talented. You have good ideas.

332
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,480
But you must also know this.

333
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,320
The sandbox game you want to make

334
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,720
requires a big team and a long time.

335
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,150
It's impossible
to accomplish at a stroke.

336
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
Besides, if you want Mr. Gao

337
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
to meet your conditions,

338
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,910
you must first prove your worth.

339
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,750
Therefore, be patient.

340
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,550
Why are you telling me this?

341
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm worried
you would get upset and leave

342
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,630
after finally joining us.

343
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,910
I wouldn't take it that far.

344
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,870
Don't work overtime tonight.

345
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,510
Join me for dinner.

346
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,120
You've barely spoken to everyone

347
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
during your first week here.

348
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,240
You can...

349
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,510
I have a prior appointment tonight.

350
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,390
Sorry.

351
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,480
What's wrong? Is it weird
that someone asked me out?

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,790
It's not weird
that someone asked you out.

353
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,120
But who in Jiangzhou
can make you keep an appointment?

354
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm quite curious about that.

355
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
I was the one asking.

356
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,510
That makes me even more curious.

357
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,440
Did I give you the impression
of an antisocial young man

358
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
when I was in the UK?

359
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,440
That's right.
You had an extremely long face

360
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,630
with "Leave Me Alone"
written all over it.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As if you were miffed

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,910
and sulking on your own.

363
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,080
I barely had friends in the UK,

364
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,720
but I do in Jiangzhou.

365
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,550
A new friend?

366
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,470
An old friend.

367
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,240
Excuse me.

368
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,750
What would you like to have?

369
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,830
The food here is quite nice.

370
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,270
I'll have what she's having.

371
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,750
We'll have two pork bone ramen for now.

372
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,790
Leave the menu.

373
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,590
We'll take a look again later.

374
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,200
Sure.

375
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,750
You have changed a lot.

376
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
Have I?

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
How so?

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,510
When we went to restaurants as kids,

379
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,510
you would keep on
flipping through the menu.

380
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,680
I don't quite remember.

381
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,750
It's because Yingzi was a picky eater,

382
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,480
and she was too lazy to order.

383
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
So you always had to order the food.

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,270
How's your new job?

385
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,160
Are you settling well?

386
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,750
Yes, it's all the same.

387
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,680
Just some technical work.

388
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,830
What about you?

389
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,610
Did you ask to meet me

390
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,750
to talk about work?

391
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,240
Of course not.

392
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,640
Well...

393
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,240
I just wanted to ask you.

394
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,310
When we had a gathering
at Huang Yingzi's house that day,

395
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,720
why didn't you come?

396
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,160
I was held up at work,
so I couldn't make it.

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,200
While I was away these past few years,

398
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,720
did something happen between you two?

399
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,480
Nothing happened.

400
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:40,309
We've always been like that

401
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,590
since we were kids.

402
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,070
Like cats and dogs.

403
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,200
Mingyu.

404
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,070
Between you girls,

405
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,640
there are many things

406
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,790
that I don't really know.

407
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
But I know you.

408
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,550
I know Huang Yingzi as well.

409
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
After all, you two shared a table

410
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,510
since you were six.

411
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,110
Let's order another dish.

412
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,510
Sashimi platter?

413
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,030
When you didn't show up that day,

414
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,440
she was really disappointed.

415
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,910
She even talked about

416
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,000
the power outage
that happened when you were kids.

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,720
Jiang Yi.

418
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,720
Are you here today because of Yingzi?

419
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

420
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,350
I get you, Mingyu.

421
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,790
When I just got back,
I didn't want to meet anyone either.

422
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,160
But everyone showed up

423
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
at Guan's wedding.

424
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,670
Yingzi thought

425
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,640
we could still be like
when we were kids.

426
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
But why must we

427
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,830
be like when we were kids?

428
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,440
There is no going back
from certain things

429
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,030
that have happened.

430
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,680
(Ever since that incident
involving Yifei,)

431
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,440
(I had no idea how to face everyone,)

432
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,310
(let alone facing Huang Yingzi.)

433
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,550
(Are you still mad?)

434
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,640
(I didn't mean to ignore you.)

435
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Since you got home,

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,720
you have been glued to your phone.

437
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,920
Are you dating someone?

438
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,640
It's nothing like that.

439
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,830
I've been there.

440
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,510
I can see

441
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,880
right through you.

442
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
Besides,

443
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,790
you're no longer in your senior year

444
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,000
where you couldn't date.

445
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,240
Dating is normal.

446
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,310
There's nothing to hide.

447
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,240
But I must make sure
you pick a good man.

448
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,960
Mingyu.

449
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,680
You will be graduating soon.

450
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,070
You will be making
the most crucial decision

451
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,590
in your life.

452
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,160
Whether or not you find
the right person,

453
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,070
that will affect your future.

454
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,790
If you find the right person,

455
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,480
you will become better.

456
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,480
On the contrary,

457
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,720
if you find the wrong person,

458
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,590
you will be dragged down in life.

459
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,440
That's why when it comes to this,

460
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,710
you must keep your eyes open. Okay?

461
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I will, Mom.

462
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,790
Go to bed early.

463
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,830
Remember what I told you.

464
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,440
(I've arrived at Hangtian City.)

465
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,030
(I'm going to bed. You should leave.)

466
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,000
(See you in school.)

467
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
(Have another piece of meat.)

468
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,200
Here you go.

469
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,200
No.

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,160
Stop giving me pork ribs.

471
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm on a diet.

472
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,680
Don't be silly.

473
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,310
Look at you.

474
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,750
I love this round little face

475
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,270
of yours. How pretty!

476
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,960
Forget about your diet.

477
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,880
She's right.

478
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,030
You don't often get to enjoy
your mom's cooking.

479
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,160
Since you're finally back,

480
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,000
you should have more.

481
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
Fine. I'll have more.

482
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,640
By the way, Yingzi,

483
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,200
you'll be graduating soon.

484
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,030
What are your plans?

485
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,960
I'll look for a job.

486
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,240
In Beijing?

487
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,440
Is it a media job?

488
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,310
Magazine, newspaper, new media.

489
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,920
I'll try everything.

490
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,790
Aren't you going to graduate school?

491
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,680
I'm not Zhuang Yuan.

492
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,720
I'm not cut out for a doctoral

493
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,790
or master's degree.

494
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,350
I'll work for two years first
and see how it goes.

495
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,750
I heard from Xu Hong

496
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,240
that Zhuang Yuan is back too.

497
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Right.

498
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,640
Mingyu is back as well.

499
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
She even came back with a boyfriend.

500
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,240
Since all of you are back,

501
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
aren't you all going to meet up?

502
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,070
Of course we will.

503
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,550
Nowadays,

504
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,240
we only get to meet a few times a year.

505
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,590
Tell me about it.

506
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,640
Whenever I talk about these kids,

507
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
I miss them so much.

508
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,920
How about this?

509
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,680
Invite them over.

510
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,200
I'll cook for them.

511
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,270
Okay. I'll ask them when they're free.

512
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,750
Don't forget to make stir-fried eggs
with chives for Mingyu.

513
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,920
That's for sure.

514
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,400
Just invite them over tomorrow.

515
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Okay, I'll ask them tomorrow.

516
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,960
Great.

517
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,110
(Jiang Yi.)

518
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,270
(How are you?)

519
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
(I haven't heard from you lately.)

520
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,070
Zhuang Yuan, what else do you want?

521
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,550
Just tell me.

522
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,240
I'll make it for you.

523
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,400
This is more than enough, madam.

524
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,440
Don't be shy.

525
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,240
Yingzi, are you having
Winter holiday now?

526
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,000
You brought a different guy this time

527
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
to do the heavy lifting.

528
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,400
This must be
the real future son-in-law, right?

529
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,550
Don't be nosy.

530
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,030
Madam Zhang.

531
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm seriously going to sue you
for slander this time.

532
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,110
I hope you get a husband soon.

533
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,110
How much is it?

534
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,880
25 yuan.

535
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,750
It's Mingyu.

536
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,790
Should we go and say hi?

537
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
I don't think I want to do so.

538
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,160
I'll go, then.

539
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,000
Mingyu.

540
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,200
Yingzi.

541
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,830
Who is this?

542
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,110
This is my boyfriend, Zhang Nan.

543
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,680
This is my childhood friend,
Huang Yingzi.

544
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,790
Zhang Nan!

545
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,720
What on earth are you doing?

546
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,030
How long were you planning
to deceive me?

547
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,830
Couldn't we talk on the phone?

548
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,750
Did you really have to come here?

549
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,960
You're one to talk.

550
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
You were following her around

551
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
to woo her.

552
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,790
Cut it out, will you?

553
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,000
No.

554
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,790
Listen.

555
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,790
Not only will I make a scene here,

556
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,350
but back there too.

557
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,920
Let's talk outside.

558
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,510
I want the whole of Jiangzhou University

559
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,070
to know the kind of person you are.

560
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,270
Let go of me, you jerk!

561
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,550
You jerk!

562
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,790
Crazy.

563
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,350
Nice to meet you.

564
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,110
Nice to meet you.

565
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,920
Mingyu.

566
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,640
I have something to tell you.

567
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,790
Can we step outside for a minute?

568
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Let's go, Mingyu.

569
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,030
Wait here for me.

570
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,680
Let's go.

571
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,400
What's the matter?

572
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,270
What's the matter?

573
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,640
How long have you been dating him?

574
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,270
Almost a year.

575
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,790
Almost a year.

576
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,510
Yet you have no idea

577
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,830
what kind of person he is, don't you?

578
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,590
What are you trying to say?

579
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,030
Yesterday at Hangtian City Bookstore,

580
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,750
I saw him

581
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,830
with another girl.

582
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,750
No way.

583
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,480
You may have mistaken him
for someone else.

584
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,920
Even if he was with someone else,

585
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,510
can't they just be friends?

586
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,790
For crying out loud, Fang Mingyu.

587
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,920
You're so smart sometimes.

588
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,000
But why are you such a fool
when it comes to this?

589
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,590
I was right there.

590
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,000
The girl was grabbing him

591
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,070
and calling him a liar.

592
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,350
She even called him a jerk.

593
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,440
It was obvious that they were dating.

594
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,880
Fang Mingyu.

595
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
The university is like a small society.

596
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,070
It's not like us.
You don't know them well.

597
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,720
Don't be fooled by him.

598
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,270
I got it.

599
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,350
Can I go now?

600
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,160
Wait. What do you mean you get it?

601
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,240
Did you hear what I said?

602
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,200
Huang Yingzi,
can you stay out of my business?

603
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,160
What do you mean?

604
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,880
What do you mean by
staying out of your business?

605
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,790
Am I supposed to keep quiet

606
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,350
knowing you're being fooled?

607
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,640
Since the day we left Hangtian City

608
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,200
and went to university,

609
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
I told myself this.

610
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,750
I'm bidding farewell to the past.

611
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,830
So no matter what kind of people I meet

612
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,110
or what kind of things I go through,

613
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
I should learn to face them on my own.

614
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,270
We haven't met in so long.

615
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,400
But you're telling me these things
once we met.

616
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I honestly feel like a failure.

617
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,550
No.

618
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,070
Mingyu, that's not what I meant.

619
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,030
If you're going through something,

620
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,750
you can tell us.

621
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,640
We're here for you.

622
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,000
We can face it together.

623
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,110
How can we face it together?

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,960
Jiang Yi has left.

625
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,790
You, me, and Zhuang Yuan.

626
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,000
We go to university in different cities.

627
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,030
We barely get to meet within a year.

628
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,830
Everyone is busy with their new lives.

629
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,000
Everyone is moving forward.

630
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,030
You are the only one living in the past!

631
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,350
There is no going back
from certain things

632
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,510
that have happened.

633
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,550
I know.

634
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,270
After we went to university,

635
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,750
you have been
distancing yourself from me.

636
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,960
You never quite kept in touch with me.

637
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,000
But all this time,
I couldn't figure out why.

638
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,720
How did our friendship

639
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,960
end up like this?

640
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,030
There were many times
when I wanted to ask you.

641
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,000
But I dared not do so.

642
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,960
I was afraid if I asked you,

643
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,510
we might not even be friends anymore.

644
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,270
Mingyu, we grew up together.

645
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,750
I don't think our friendship

646
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,030
would become so fragile
just because we have gone to university.

647
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,030
Is it because something happened?

648
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,110
You can tell me.

649
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,070
Or perhaps it was something I did?

650
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,160
If I did something wrong,

651
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,640
you can tell me.

652
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,750
You did nothing wrong.

653
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,480
But please,

654
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,680
stop worrying about me.

655
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,160
Let's just look ahead.

656
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,880
Mingyu!

657
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
Mingyu.

658
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
Where is your friend?

659
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,790
I've met her once.

660
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,440
But don't listen to whatever she said.

661
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,400
She must have seen something

662
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,880
and made things up.

663
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,110
She is my friend.

664
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,310
No matter what we said,

665
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,350
it is not your place to judge.

666
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,750
Mingyu, let me ex...

667
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,310
Let's not see each other again.

668
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,240
After that incident,

669
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,240
I broke up with that guy.

670
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,550
After that,

671
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,480
I never got in touch with Yingzi again.

672
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,960
She was just concerned about you.

673
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,480
I know that.

674
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,110
Actually, you don't have to persuade me.

675
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,680
We grew up together.

676
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,720
We are like family.

677
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,790
But once you grow up,

678
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,240
you will leave your home

679
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,440
and have a life of your own.

680
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,920
You need your own space.

681
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,960
You can no longer be like kids,

682
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,510
sticking together all the time.

683
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,590
(This huge market)

684
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,270
(has spawned)

685
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,400
a complex system
of marriage and dating agencies.

686
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,350
They provide all kinds of services.

687
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,720
As long as you have money,

688
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,310
you can meet all kinds of needs.

689
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,920
But according to statistics,

690
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,160
the only thing absent

691
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,530
among those needs

692
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,640
is love.

693
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,030
That's a good angle.

694
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,110
Yiran.

695
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,310
I would like you to handle this topic

696
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,510
on blind dating agencies.

697
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,470
I hope to see some results

698
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,680
early next month.

699
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,270
Early next month?

700
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,160
Yiran is

701
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,790
currently handling a few topics at once.

702
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,400
Would that be too much on your plate?

703
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,720
Perhaps someone else can work on it.

704
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,640
Chief Editor, how about this?

705
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
Yiran

706
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,030
can focus on Ding Ye for the time being.

707
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,920
I can work on the blind dating topic.

708
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,790
When I was working on
"Bridesmaids for Rent",

709
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,640
I found lots of information
about the marriage market.

710
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,510
I'm familiar with it.

711
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm planning

712
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,320
to make this topic a front-page feature.

713
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,070
Yiran has

714
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,590
is the most experienced in this section.

715
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,230
Yiran, are you okay with that?

716
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,670
I'm good.

717
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,390
Huang Yingzi.

718
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,960
It's been almost two weeks.

719
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,560
Your data contribution
for the past two weeks is zero.

720
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,440
Are you still planning

721
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,230
to work on Ding Ye's interview?

722
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,320
Director,
please give me a little more time.

723
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,710
How long exactly?

724
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,840
One week.

725
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,920
I will convince him

726
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,710
to do an interview within a week.

727
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,030
Fine. You have one week.

728
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,400
If you fail to do so

729
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,800
within a week...

730
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,230
I will give up on this topic.

731
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
You don't have much time left.

732
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,880
Don't forget.

733
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,360
Your contract renewal application

734
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,760
is still on my desk.

735
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,360
Understood.

736
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,880
Are you Zhuang Yuan's childhood friend?

737
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,670
Yes, I am.

738
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,320
And you are?

739
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
I am his roommate, Han Tianlin.

740
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,440
He asked me to pass you this.

741
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,670
Thank you.

742
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,920
Where is Zhuang Yuan?

743
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
He is having a seminar with his mentor.

744
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,110
He has some issues with the topic
for his graduation thesis.

745
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,110
Wasn't he having issues

746
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,480
with that topic previously?

747
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,800
It hasn't been resolved yet?

748
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,840
You know about that?

749
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,760
Are outsiders allowed
to sit in on the seminar?

750
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,760
Technically, it's allowed.

751
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,550
Can I sit in, then?

752
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,110
Sure. Come on.

753
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,760
Thanks.

754
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,000
Switching your research direction
as you're nearing your graduation.

755
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,710
Zhuang Yuan.

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,590
When you chose to do a Direct Entry PhD,

757
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,630
did you have any idea

758
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,440
what you wanted to study?

759
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,320
I admit I didn't have
a clear idea back then.

760
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
But now, I have found

761
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,550
a new research direction.

762
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,030
Past methods of
scientific research practices

763
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,550
were flawed.

764
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,510
But I'm confident in
my new research approach.

765
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,150
That's why I hope to get your support.

766
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,230
My consideration

767
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,590
is more than your research directions.

768
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,800
I must also consider
the pass rate of your theses

769
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,630
and your future career paths.

770
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,190
Do you know how competitive

771
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,760
society is now?

772
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,000
If I go easy on you now

773
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,110
and let you do whatever you want,

774
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,190
then I am being irresponsible.

775
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,190
I understand, sir.

776
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,230
Let's call it a day, then.

777
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,800
If anyone has questions,
you can find me anytime.

778
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,920
Goodbye, Professor Ma.

779
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,030
Goodbye.

780
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Dr. Zhuang.

781
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,880
(Zhuang Yuan)

782
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,920
looks a little nerdy sometimes.

783
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,840
But I know

784
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,760
he's been hiding someone in his heart.

785
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,190
I'm his roommate after all.

786
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,400
I know there is someone he has liked

787
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,840
for over a decade.

788
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,840
But he never had the courage to confess.

789
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,320
I think

790
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,150
that person is you.

791
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,760
You've got the wrong idea.

792
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,320
You're terribly wrong.

793
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,440
No, I haven't.

794
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,480
I know it isn't my place to say this.

795
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,920
But I worry for him.

796
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,280
If I don't tell you this today,

797
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,070
he will certainly take it to the grave.

798
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,880
I know he prepared a gift for you.

799
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
It's been in the drawer for a long time.

800
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,960
Do you know about that?

801
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
What gift is it?

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,150
It's a small box

803
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,550
with a bracelet inside.

804
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,440
That thing is very precious to him.

805
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,360
He looks at it at the dorm every day.

806
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,630
He even cleans it.

807
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,760
I also know

808
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,030
that he came to Jiangzhou to study
because of you.

809
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,150
Wasn't he recommended for admission
into the doctoral program?

810
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,840
With his score,
he can get recommended admission

811
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,320
for Tsinghua
and Peking University for sure.

812
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,280
If others got the chance to attend

813
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,110
Tsinghua or Peking,

814
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,280
who would choose to come here?

815
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,630
What are you talking about?

816
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,510
Nothing.

817
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,110
Gossiping about you.

818
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,960
As if.

819
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,630
There's nothing to gossip about me.

820
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,320
Have some coffee.

821
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,400
Thank you.

822
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,670
Well...

823
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,320
I have to go. Goodbye, then.

824
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,230
Thank you.

825
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,710
Zhuang Yuan.

826
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,230
I heard

827
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,000
what your professor said to you earlier.

828
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,110
I think he made some good points.

829
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,510
For example, he said

830
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,710
that actual employment
and social competition should be

831
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,840
taken into consideration
for your thesis.

832
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
I agree with that.

833
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,960
But as your good friend,

834
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,110
I think

835
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,400
you studied hard
and made it to your doctorate.

836
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
Isn't it for the sake of studying

837
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,280
the subject you are interested in?

838
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
Just like us
who were born in the nineties.

839
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,630
There are so many of us.

840
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,840
Entering the society

841
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,320
is like squeezing into
schools of sardines.

842
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,150
Even if we manage to squeeze in,

843
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,960
we are merely the most common fish.

844
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,800
Besides, in this day and age,

845
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,440
I think you are likelier to succeed

846
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
if you study a subject you like.

847
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,070
I get what you are saying.

848
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,400
But you know

849
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
my situation.

850
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,630
Let's set aside the fact

851
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,760
whether this is a subject I like or not.

852
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,840
Even this doctorate

853
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,280
was my mom's wish.

854
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,710
I don't know much

855
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,230
about artificial intelligence.

856
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
But I know you.

857
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,230
When we were kids,

858
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,960
you would skip meals and sleep

859
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,110
just to solve

860
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,550
a bonus question.

861
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,320
Everyone thought you were a nerd.

862
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,440
But when I looked at you,

863
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,840
I thought you were awesome.

864
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,630
That's why you should stand firm now.

865
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,150
On both your studies and relationship.

866
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,190
Hold up.

867
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,710
Aren't you here to look up on Ding Ye?

868
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,150
Why are you talking about relationships?

869
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,320
You have a bracelet

870
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,190
that's for Fang Mingyu, don't you?

871
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,400
How did you know about the bracelet?

872
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,590
Your roommate

873
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,040
mistook me for Fang Mingyu.

874
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,400
That blabbermouth.

875
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,230
I prepared that gift a long time ago.

876
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,480
It's out of fashion now.

877
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,510
I can't give it to her anymore.

878
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,960
It doesn't matter
if it's out of fashion.

879
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,280
What matters most

880
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,510
is whether or not

881
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,360
you still have feelings for her.

882
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,280
If you don't,

883
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,840
why do you still have that bracelet?

884
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,320
I didn't get a chance to toss it out.

885
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,880
Then why are you still single?

886
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,590
It's hard to date as a PhD student.

887
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,550
Fine.

888
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,150
You always have a comeback.

889
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Then tell me.

890
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,400
If Fang Mingyu tells you today

891
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,280
that she is getting married,

892
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,400
won't you have any regrets?

893
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
Fine, Yingzi.

894
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,990
I can't hide anything from you.

895
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,840
Aren't we always like this?

896
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,000
When we were kids,

897
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
you could always tell

898
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,070
what was on my mind.

899
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,630
Here's your 7 Up.

900
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,440
Thanks.

901
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,880
Yingzi, that's my soda.

902
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,590
Sorry.

903
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,480
I'll get you another bottle later.

904
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,510
That's not what I meant.

905
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,190
I...

906
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,000
Are you done?

907
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,480
If you are, we should go home.

908
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,630
I'm not quite done yet.

909
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,590
You guys go ahead.

910
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,360
I'll go with you.

911
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,670
Zhuang Yuan isn't done either.

912
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
We'll get going, then.

913
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,400
Bye-bye.

914
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,480
I'm stuffed.

915
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,400
You can finish it.

916
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,670
Why are you sitting over there?

917
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,840
Mencius once said,

918
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,590
"Men and women are to remain separated."

919
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,630
What are you...

920
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,960
It's also stated in the "Book of Rites".

921
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,360
"Men and women are different."

922
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,360
What are you trying to say?

923
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,110
Yingzi.

924
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,030
I have someone I like.

925
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,760
So?

926
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,590
You don't think I like you, do you?

927
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,110
Don't you?

928
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,480
When we played Truth or Dare
the other day,

929
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,320
you said it yourself.

930
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,760
Yuck!

931
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,800
Who gave you that confidence?

932
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,440
I wasn't being serious, okay?

933
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,360
Then why have you been

934
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,670
going home with me
after school these days?

935
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,070
Yuck!

936
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,150
Who wants to go home with you?

937
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,190
I just want to copy your homework.

938
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,360
And the day we were watching
"Chinese Paladin".

939
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,670
Why did you sit behind me on my bike?

940
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,150
Yuck! Who wants to sit behind you?

941
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,150
Everyone else was taken.

942
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,070
I had no choice.

943
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,760
Are you saying

944
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,880
that you wanted
to ride behind someone else?

945
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,760
Anyone but you.

946
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,630
Was it Guan Chao?

947
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,840
Yuck! There's no way I'd pick him!

948
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,670
Then who was it?

949
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,630
It was Jiang...
