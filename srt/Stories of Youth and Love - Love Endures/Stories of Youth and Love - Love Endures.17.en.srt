00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,790
Are you leaving like this?

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Will you come tomorrow?

5
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,480
The project is suspended.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,870
I'm not needed here.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Are you giving up already?

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
This is not the Jiang Yi I know.

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,120
There is something

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,310
I can't explain to you now.

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,870
I can wait until you're able to do so.

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,790
Let me show you something.

13
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,560
What do you think about
its visual effect?

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,120
The modeling traces are visible,

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,190
but the graphics are convincing enough.

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
I remember you told me

17
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,150
"The Maze" is aimed

18
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,710
to offer a realistic game experience

19
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
to players

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
and make them feel
like they are in the scene.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,310
So they will believe in

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,800
the existence of this world.

23
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,870
However, the current devices we have

24
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,800
can only afford to build scenes.

25
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,590
It is not enough for the details
of the characters.

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,750
To achieve realistic character images,

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,030
fine skin texture,

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,190
and smooth movements,

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,520
we need the best
motion capture equipment.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,630
I have applied for that for you.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,470
What do you mean?

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,150
I have applied
to Mr. Gao for a long time.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,430
He kept refusing.

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,150
But now,

35
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,430
he finally nodded

36
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,630
for the sake of "The Maze".

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,840
Even though he says nothing about this,

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
he values this project a lot.

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,590
Still, he can't overlook
the commercial return.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,310
I have to consider my game too.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
You think

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,630
having a female special forces soldier
as the main character

43
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,840
is against the prime idea
you had for this game,

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,430
right?

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,630
Well, believe me.

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,190
I will request for an extra week
from Mr. Gao.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
We can come up

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,470
with an character design
that's acceptable to all parties.

49
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,840
Is that okay?

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,080
Thank you, Chloe.

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,680
Don't stand on ceremony.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm doing this not only for you

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,870
but also for myself.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,680
Excuse me,
do you know where Jiang Yi is?

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,280
In the office, I suppose.

56
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,280
Where is his office?

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,080
Go straight down that way.

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,870
Thank you.

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,360
(I remember when I was in the UK,)

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,630
I was just a novice

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,310
who knew nothing at all.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,030
Only you guided me patiently.

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,750
As long as you were in the company,

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,870
I didn't want to leave either.

65
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,800
At that time, I pondered

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
if I truly liked games,

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,920
or working with you.

68
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,720
That only means one thing.

69
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,000
Both of us make good partners.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,310
I like you, Jiang Yi.

71
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,750
Yingzi.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,870
Yingzi.

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,430
Jerk.

74
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,190
Jerk.

75
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,510
You are an entitled jerk!

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,830
Jerk!

77
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,870
Yes?

78
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,430
(Ms. Huang.)

79
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,160
You wanted to interview me
this morning,

80
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
and then you disappeared until now.

81
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,600
Ding Ye.

82
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,360
I went to the amusement park

83
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,910
and the aquarium with you, right?

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,720
You did.

85
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,480
We are friends, are we?

86
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,750
Yes.

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,000
If so,

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,630
can you accompany me today?

♪You are not my blah blah blah♪

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,510
I must tell you this.

98
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,360
I never expected

99
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,630
to share a drink

100
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,310
with my childhood idol, Mr. Ding Ye,

101
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
tonight.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,160
I must thank you.

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,510
Thank you so much.

105
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,480
Let me raise another toast to you.

106
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,750
Look.

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,310
The decoration and color
of this karaoke room

108
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,800
makes me delighted.

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
For this delight,

110
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,830
I will drink to you again.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
Drink slowly.

112
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,870
Are you drunk?

113
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,040
No.

114
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,270
I'm not drunk.

115
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm just a bit tired.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,270
I can stay awake

117
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,630
if I sing.

118
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,070
Let's continue to drink afterward.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,320
(Why didn't you answer my calls?)

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,790
(What happened earlier today
is a misunderstanding.)

121
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,870
(Can you please hear me out?)

122
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,320
Since the day I met him,

123
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I haven't been happy.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,670
Well, no.

125
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,750
Being friends with him makes me happy.

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,480
Because I want

127
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,720
to be more than just a friend to him.

128
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Do you get it?

129
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Why can't you tell him directly?

130
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,390
Because I'm scared.

131
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,600
I have fear.

132
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,360
The mighty Huang Yingzi of Hangtian City

133
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
has fear?

134
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,720
There won't be anyone in this world

136
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,270
who is not afraid of anything.

137
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,480
I'm afraid that once I tell him,

138
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,510
we can't be friends anymore.

139
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm also afraid

140
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,390
that if he falls in love
with another girl.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,870
When he was overseas back then,

142
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,790
I wouldn't have so many concerns.

143
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,200
But since he returned,

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,390
he keeps showing up before me,

145
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,390
swinging here and there.

146
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,600
Every day, I worry about him.

147
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,120
Does he eat well? Does he dress warmly?

148
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,510
Does he encounter any problems
during work?

149
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,030
Does anyone bully him?

150
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,480
Will he catch a cold
from having his neck exposed?

151
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,870
He has a really long neck.

152
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,960
Why can't he

153
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
notice my heart?

154
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
Why can't he notice that?

155
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,240
He does have a long neck.

156
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,360
Right?

157
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,270
Don't you think
he looks like a big goose?

158
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,720
When winter comes,

159
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,150
under his down jacket,

160
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,510
he keeps bobbing his neck like this.

161
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,270
Half of his neck is exposed.

162
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,670
He looks exactly like a big goose.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
(You see,)

164
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,960
why would someone

165
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,550
use geese to make down jackets?

166
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,550
Geese are so adorable.

167
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,270
Using geese to make down jackets

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,720
is cruel.

169
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,320
Inhumane!

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,510
Well, I think that is enough.

171
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,390
We should go now.

172
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,390
Okay.

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm not the kind who takes off shoes

177
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,000
at someone else's house.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,030
This is your house.

179
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
Liar.

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,630
This is not my house.

181
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,630
I'm not taking my shoes off.

182
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,440
No, I don't want to.

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,870

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,720
Thank you for staying with me tonight.

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,630
I will accomplish the last thing
on the bucket list

186
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,600
with you.

187
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
You are back, Jiang.

188
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,240
I just mopped the floor.
Change your shoes.

189
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,510
What is wrong, Jiang?

190
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,870
Zhuang Yuan, help me call someone.

191
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Who?

192
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,030
Huang Yingzi.

193
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,320
Why don't you call her

194
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,030
yourself?

195
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,630
Just do it.

196
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,240
Hello?

197
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,030
Why did you screen my calls?

198
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,480
Why is it you?

199
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,390
Where is Zhuang Yuan?

200
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,030
You were drinking?

201
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,240
Yes.

202
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,320
Couldn't I drink?

203
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
With whom?

204
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,790
It doesn't concern you.

205
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,670
Where are you now?

206
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,000
None of your business.

207
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,480
Why couldn't I drink?

208
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Why must I tell you that?

209
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,320
Who are you to me?

210
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,270
We are just friends.

211
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Understood, Jiang Yi?

212
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,320
We are just friends.

213
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,600
Huang Yingzi, you are drunk.

214
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm drunk?

215
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,840
No alcohol can make me drunk.

216
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,550
I am

217
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,510
Huang Yingzi from Hangtian City...

218
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,440
Hello? Huang Yingzi?

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,550
Hello?

220
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,440
What's happened to her?

221
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
Be careful.

222
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,960
He is likely to give himself away

223
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,390
if he gets there in five minutes.

224
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,550
Huang Yingzi.

225
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,150
Are you all right, Huang Yingzi?

226
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,120
Where are you hurt?

227
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,270
Let me see.

228
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,510
Jiang Yi.

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Am I seeing things?

230
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Is this an illusion?

231
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,080
I can feel it.

232
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,720
Why are you here?

233
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,440
Your question is redundant.

234
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,670
You never changed

235
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,550
the password of your door lock.

236
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,750
Bad guys might intrude into your place.

237
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,030
How did you get here so quickly?

238
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,550
I... I was just around here.

239
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,320
Something is wrong.

240
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,080
Since you were little,

241
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
you blink your eyes

242
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,600
whenever you lie.

243
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,000
You are lying to me.

244
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,750
Be careful. Not so fast.

245
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,360
Who would have thought
that I'm teaching you in the end?

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,720
Who would have thought

247
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,270
you skate better

248
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,790
than the one who teaches you?

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,390
Because you can't skate at all.

250
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,150
Nonsense.

251
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,720
That is not true.

252
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,550
Take me for another round.

253
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,120
Grab my hand.

254
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,960
How come they can skate
with their bodies up straight

255
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,510
but I'm hunching?

256
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,200
I have no idea either.

257
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
So you are teaching me nothing.

258
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,440
Well, that is enough for today.

259
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,480
I got to go now.

260
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,350
Where are you going?

261
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,070
I told you already.

262
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,440
I have a competition training today.

263
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,350
You are more skilled

264
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,200
than the rest.

265
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,440
Skate with me one more round.

266
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,030
No, I'm going to be late.

267
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,070
Please skate with me one more round.

268
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,590
Jiang Yi.

269
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,240
What if I fall?

270
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,070
Then you should stop skating.

271
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,480
I want to skate.

272
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,640
Hello?

273
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,350
Help me!

274
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,110
What is it again?

275
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,960
I fell.

276
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,200
Don't fool me. I'm in the middle
of the competition.

277
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
I didn't.

278
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,680
I feel that my leg is broken.

279
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
I can't get up now.

280
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
I can't move at all.

281
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
Fine, put your broken leg back on.

282
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,440
Jiang Yi.

283
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,830
I will hang up now. Bye.

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,590
I'm not lying.

285
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,750
Don't worry.

286
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,270
Look.

287
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,200
I can still move this foot.

288
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,680
Stop shaking.

289
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,160
It is fine.

290
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,070
Act like you are weak.

291
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,920
Ow.

292
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,270
Slowly.

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,640
Coming.

294
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,270
Finally, you came.

295
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,960
Where is Huang Yingzi?

296
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,440
Over here.

297
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,160
Are you

298
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,000
all right?

299
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
What do you think?

300
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,070
You don't care about me at all.

301
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,750
What are you doing here?

302
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,310
No.

303
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,110
I thought you were lying.

304
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,880
Yes, I was lying.

305
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,110
I'm still lying now.

306
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,960
When you walk past this door,

307
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,030
my leg would recover,

308
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,400
I could jump around

309
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,000
and do breakdancing.

310
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,960
Jiang Yi, Yingzi called you first

311
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,830
once she fell.

312
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,550
Well,

313
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,240
I really thought

314
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,790
she was joking.

315
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,750
Stop explaining.

316
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,550
Apologize.

317
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,830
All right.

318
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,640
Fortunately, she tore a ligament

319
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,350
with no fractures.

320
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,070
But she has to rest at home
for some time.

321
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,030
Well, let's assign the task.

322
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,720
Madam Guo

323
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,030
will take care

324
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,920
of Yingzi's daily needs.

325
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
Mingyu, you and Zhuang Yuan
help her catch up on her studies.

326
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,270
I change her bandages.

327
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,720
Jiang Yi, you will visit her every day,

328
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,310
bring her snacks,

329
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,720
chat with her, and entertain her.

330
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,510
It must be boring for her

331
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,640
to stay here every day.

332
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Exactly.

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,550
He won't come.

334
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't say that.

335
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,310
I will.

336
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,920
Will you?

337
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,110
What will you do?

338
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,030
I swear

339
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,550
if Huang Yingzi gets injured again,

340
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,550
I will be the first to come.

341
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,440
Is it hurt here?

342
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,960
It hurts here.

343
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,510
And here.

344
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,790
And here. But I can't show you.

345
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,830
We grew up together.

346
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,640
Why can't you show me?

347
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,200
Let me see.

348
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,510
What is wrong with you?

349
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,070
Let me check.

350
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,070
Pervert!

351
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,080
You are a pervert!

352
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
Did you do this to other girls too?

353
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,550
I didn't.

354
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,790
Did you do this to other girls, huh?

355
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,750
I didn't.

356
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,070
Did you do this to Chloe?

357
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,310
Hey, wait.

358
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,590
Did you?

359
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,960
Are you trying to touch me?

360
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,400
Huh?

361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,790
No.

362
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,110
I don't mean to touch you.

363
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,480
Why would I do that?

364
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,000
I...

365
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Maybe you should stop drinking

366
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,400
if you can't handle alcohol that well.

367
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
Sorry.

368
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,070
I didn't know I used so much strength.

369
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,590
Well,

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm not feeling uncomfortable anymore.

371
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,270
There is nothing else,

372
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,200
you should go home now.

373
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,270
Also,

374
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,960
I think

375
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,830
we should keep some distance
from each other.

376
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,880
Why?

377
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,550
Don't you know the reason?

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,960
Chloe?

379
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
You like Chloe.

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,030
I can understand that.

381
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,400
She is pretty.

382
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,030
I don't think so.

383
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,200
Besides, she knows you well.

384
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
You both are in the same industry

385
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,920
and have something in common.

386
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,160
That doesn't mean anything.

387
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
Most importantly, she cares about you.

388
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,160
She knows the conflict you had
with the company.

389
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
So she called me immediately

390
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
to talk some sense into you...

391
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,400
Huang Yingzi.

392
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,590
I don't like her.

393
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
You don't like her?

394
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,440
But I saw

395
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,200
you two...

396
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,070
You two...

397
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,480
You two kissed.

398
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,160
I...

399
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,310
Wait...

400
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,510
When did we kiss?

401
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,550
She suddenly kissed me.

402
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,830
I was stunned.

403
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,110
She kissed my face,

404
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,440
what could I have done?

405
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,720
From your angle,

406
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,350
it might seem like we kissed.

407
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,790
But...

408
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,480
But my attention

409
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,590
was on you.

410
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,790
Just when I went out to explain to you,

411
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,790
you bolted.

412
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,030
I couldn't catch up.

413
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,790
Besides,

414
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,590
I rejected her.

415
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,110
I think

416
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,680
I must talk to you.

417
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,400
Sure.

418
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,440
We are good partners, are we?

419
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,310
Of course.

420
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,070
What I'm trying to say is

421
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,440
we are friends

422
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,400
and partners.

423
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,040
But that is all.

424
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,030
Jiang Yi.

425
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,440
What happened this afternoon
is not a big deal.

426
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,510
I chose to express my feelings

427
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,550
and you turned it down.

428
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,590
We didn't hurt each other.

429
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,310
Chloe.

430
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,270
I don't want things
to become complicated.

431
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,000
Also,

432
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,590
I have someone I like.

433
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,030
I know.

434
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,270
I respect your decision.

435
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,750
Anyway, that is how things are.

436
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,510
Do you have any questions?

437
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,160
I didn't mean to ask anything.

438
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,880
It is you who wants to explain yourself.

439
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,350
Fine.

440
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,550
If not, I have questions for you.

441
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
Why did you go to my office?

442
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,400
I was told that you had a conflict
with the company

443
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
because of the character design.

444
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,400
I know this game

445
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,070
means a lot to you.

446
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,640
You are stubborn.

447
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,590
Are you trying to talk me out?

448
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,310
I just want to know

449
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,480
why you insist
on keeping this character.

450
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,960
What is the name of this character?

451
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,070
Popping Candy.

452
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
Why is it Popping Candy

453
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,880
instead of Milk Candy or Cotton Candy?

454
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,160
Why does it have to be Popping Candy?

455
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,590
Because I created this character

456
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,750
before the game.

457
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
I have a bond with it.

458
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,950
On top of that,

459
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,550
this game wouldn't come into being

460
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,510
without this character.

461
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,790
So the main character in this game

462
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,480
can only be her.

463
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,160
Jiang Yi.

464
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,030
If you are doing this

465
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,510
because of our childhood bet,

466
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
you won.

467
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,550
Why?

468
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,240
Because to me,

469
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
you are

470
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,160
already an amazing game designer.

471
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,790
You have never played my game.

472
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,000
Are you sure I haven't played it?

473
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Wait.

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,680
Come in.

475
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,750
Why is it you again?

476
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,510
What are you doing here?

477
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,310
I promised you to come here every day.

478
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,240
You don't have to come here

479
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,750
if you don't mean to.

480
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,790
No one is forcing you.

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Well, your mission is completed.

482
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,310
You may leave.

483
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,070
Don't you feel bored

484
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
lying in bed every day?

485
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,310
What do you think?

486
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,070
I have been lying here the whole week,

487
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,110
doing nothing

488
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,030
but reading books and learning.

489
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,240
I suppose I'm on a steep learning curve.

490
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
What is it?

491
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,830
You want to study with me?

492
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm not like you.

493
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,480
I made you a game

494
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,550
to keep you entertained.

495
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,000
What game?

496
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,240
Your favorite game

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,030
was Tetris when you were little, right?

498
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,480
This is an upgraded version.

499
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,590
The game we used to play

500
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,480
had seven types of blocks.

501
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,830
I created another five shapes.

502
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,830
So twelve shapes in total.

503
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,920
I'm too old

504
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,350
for Tetris.

505
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,790
Anyway, there are six levels.

506
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,920
If you can pass the last level,

507
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,830
I will give you a prize.

508
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,030
What prize?

509
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,160
You will find out
once you've cleared all the levels.

510
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm off.

511
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
If there is nothing else,

512
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,590
I should get going.

513
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,550
Silly.

514
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
Not only had I played it,

515
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,440
but I also cleared all levels.

516
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,390
Besides, I saw the prize.

517
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,680
What has happened to Huang Yingzi?

518
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,400
Nothing.

519
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,160
She had a clumsy fall
like she did back then.

520
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,070
Is she all right?

521
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,110
Nothing serious.

522
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,240
A superficial bruise.

523
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
She has applied some ointment.

524
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,160
All right.

525
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,720
But

526
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,790
did she find out anything

527
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,480
when you got there so soon?

528
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,350
She was very drunk.

529
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
I just gave her some random excuse.

530
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,160
Okay.

531
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,550
I'm going to bed, then.

532
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,480
Sure.

533
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,070
Oh, right.

534
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,030
A weather forecast for you.

535
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,270
Tomorrow will be 15 degrees.

536
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:51,880
Rainy day.

537
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,400
(Is your foot better now?)

538
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,590
(Can you walk?)

539
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
(The swelling has gone down.)

540
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,790
(I can walk on my own.)

541
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,110
(If you have time tonight,)

542
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,480
(I'd like to buy you dinner.)

543
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,110
(I have already booked the restaurant.)

544
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,000
(I will send you the address.)

545
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,960
(What is the matter?)

546
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,880
(It seems to be so formal.)

547
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,590
(Nothing.)

548
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,590
(Just a simple dinner.)

549
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,400
(See you tonight.)

550
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,590
Sir, here is your wine.

551
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,880
Thank you.

552
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,240
(Sorry, I got off work late.)

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,510
(I will be right there soon. Wait up.)

554
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,400
(It is fine.)

555
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,350
(No rush.)

556
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,480
(Take your time.)

557
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,750
Ding Ye, what are you doing here?

558
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,790
Accompany me somewhere.

559
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,350
Wait.

560
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,240
I have a dinner date tonight.

561
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,680
Didn't you promise me

562
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,070
you want to accomplish my last wish?

563
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,720
Must it be today?

564
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,440
Yes, today.

565
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,200
Wait.

566
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,110
Dude.

567
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,000
At least you should tell me

568
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
where we are going
and what we will do.

569
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,790
You will see.

570
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,350
Uh?

571
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,750
What is going on?

572
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
(I have a dinner date
with someone tonight.)

573
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,880
Ding Ye, do you have any signal?

574
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,790
Of course not.

575
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,830
I came here to get off my phone.

576
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,590
It is going to rain.

577
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,270
All the more reason

578
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,240
to come here.

579
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,030
May I ask

580
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,830
what the last wish

581
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,960
on your bucket list is?

582
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,400
Hilltop barbecue

583
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,550
or camping in the rain?

584
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,640
It is fine. I can do it.

585
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,000
Sunrise.

586
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,510
I want to see the sunrise
over Mount Xi after the rain.

587
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,750
What?

588
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,160
Are you saying

589
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,400
that we will be staying here
until tomorrow morning?

590
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,070
That's right.

591
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,270
Any problem?

592
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,510
Ding Ye...

593
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,550
This is my last wish.

594
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,270
Don't you want to accompany me?

595
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,720
It is not that.

596
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,510
Give me a moment.

597
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,510
I'm sorry, sir.

598
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,000
But we have closed for the day.

599
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,550
Give me 20 more minutes.

600
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,720
Please.

601
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,510
Hello.

602
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,440
Jiang Yi.

603
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,830
Can you hear me?

604
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,030
The line is bad.

605
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,160
I'm in the mountains.

606
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,400
The signal is unstable.

607
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,550
Where are you?

608
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,830
Jiang Yi.

609
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,750
Jiang Yi, can you hear me?

610
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
I'm in the mountains

611
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,830
with Ding Ye.

612
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,510
This is unexpected.

613
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,400
So don't wait up.

614
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,110
I don't think

615
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,000
I can make it today.

616
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:41,920
Hello?

617
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,440
Jiang Yi.

618
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,270
Hello?

619
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,400
Sorry.

620
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,310
I need to make another call.

621
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,590
(Sorry.)

622
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,110
(The subscriber you have dialed
is currently unreachable.)

623
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,760
Sir. Well...

624
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,800
I will leave right now.

625
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,440
Sure.

626
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,510
The view is nice.

627
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,760
It is a shame for you

628
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,150
to keep staring at your phone.

629
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,190
Actually,

630
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,630
I have an important date tonight.

631
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,030
Very important?

632
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,960
Yes.

633
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,070
Then, he should wait longer.

634
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,800
What if the wait has been too long?

635
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,230
Things that mean for you will be yours

636
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,440
no matter how long the wait is.

637
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,110
Otherwise,

638
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,150
it will never be yours

639
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,590
even if you wait forever.

640
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,550
But you might not enjoy
this nice scenery again

641
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,880
once you've missed it.

642
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,800
It is pitch black here.

643
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,150
I can't see a thing.

644
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,840
There is no scenery.

645
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,440
During autumn,

646
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,000
there are red leaves all over here.

647
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,030
It is stunning.

648
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,440
Look at the mountain.

649
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,150
The sea is behind it.

650
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,000
There is a coastal highway there.

651
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,800
A lot of joyride takes place there.

652
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,320
When July and August come,

653
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,800
you can witness red tides.

654
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,590
Why are you so familiar with this place?

655
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
I used to come here
when I was in school.

656
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
There is a bus stop
outside the school gate.

657
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,070
The bus will take you to the terminal,

658
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,110
which is here.

659
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,920
Many years have passed.

660
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,800
It has been a long time
since I came here.

661
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,070
Why did you

662
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
choose this place

663
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,710
for your last wish?

664
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,360
Previously, someone told me

665
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,840
the sunrise over Mount Xi after the rain

666
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,760
was beautiful.

667
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,960
So I want to see it with my own eyes.

668
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,320
I wonder if I'm lucky today.

669
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,840
You are, for sure.

670
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,760
I hope so.

671
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,590
(Sorry.)

672
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,360
(The subscriber you have dialed
is currently unreachable.)

673
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,800
(Please try again later.)

674
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,320
(Sorry.)

675
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,280
(The subscriber you have dialed
is currently unreachable.)

676
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,710
(Please try again later.)

677
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,400
When you get home,

678
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,230
continue workingn on
the mock test papers.

679
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,710
I will check tomorrow.

680
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,150
Okay, class dismissed.

681
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,670
Yifei.

682
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,670
Have you decided on
which university you want to go to?

683
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,320
I want to apply for
the Central Dance Academy.

684
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,320
I have passed the first audition.

685
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,480
For real?

686
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,360
I envy you.

687
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,150
You have already decided

688
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,880
on your future.

689
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,320
Guan Chao.

690
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,760
Yifei is going to Beijing.

691
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I'm going to Beijing too.

692
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,630
I will apply for a sports academy.

693
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,360
This makes sense.

694
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Of course, you will want
to stay in the same city

695
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
with the person you like.

696
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,800
I told you not to play basketball
in the hallway.

697
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,150
Jiang Yi.

698
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,190
Where is your college application form?

699
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,190
I haven't filled it out yet.

700
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,440
Then why are you standing here?

701
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,840
I'm waiting here for you,

702
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,710
Class Rep.

703
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,280
I will turn these in for you.

704
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,800
Beijing?

705
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,590
Jiang Yi.

706
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,400
Is this something nice to read?

707
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,590
No.

708
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
You get terrible grades.

709
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,360
Have you no shame
looking at these forms?

710
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,670
Do you think you can
get into a good university?

711
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,110
You...

712
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,150
Why are you ignoring me?

713
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,480
What is wrong?

714
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,590
Your game is too challenging.

715
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,150
I passed two levels.

716
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,590
What does the prize mean?

717
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,400
I don't understand.

718
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Because you are stupid.

719
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,440
What is your problem?

720
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,030
Did you mess up in the mock test?

721
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,550
What is it?

722
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,630
Are you going to
the wonton place tonight?

723
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,400
No.

724
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,480
What did I do?

725
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,440
Zhuang Yuan, you know what?

726
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,840
I will definitely make it to
Beijing Sport University.

727
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:21,840
Mingyu.

728
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,400
Which university do you apply for?

729
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,110
Of course, I want to get into
Qingbei University.

730
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,030
But the quota
for independent recruitment

731
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,920
is full.

732
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,150
It is a bit risky

733
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,230
if I rely on my results.

734
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,630
I'm sure you will succeed
if you try harder.

735
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,800
Don't worry.

736
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,880
Zhuang Yuan.

737
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,110
Which university do you want to go?

738
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,000
Me?

739
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
I haven't decided yet.

740
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,590
You haven't decided yet?

741
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,840
If you don't apply
for Qingbei University,

742
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
your mom and Smiling Tiger

743
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,960
will definitely snap at you.

744
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,400
Let's not talk about me.

745
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,280
What about you, Yingzi?

746
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,070
What is your decision?

747
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,320
Huang Yingzi.

748
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Yingzi.

749
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,630
Yingzi.

750
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,400
I...

751
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,840
I need to be somewhere else.

752
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,550
I'm off.

753
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,150
What is it about?

754
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,920
Where are you going?

755
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,670
This is sudden.

756
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,800
She seems distracted.

757
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,000
She seems to have a secret every day.

758
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Ride safely.

759
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,510
Yi.

760
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,480
You are back from school?

761
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,030
Jiang Yi, you are home.

762
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,800
I have made you the Sweet and Sour Fish.

763
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,960
Jiang Yi.

764
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,000
Jiang...

765
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,280
Hello, Mr. Jiang and Mrs. Jiang.

766
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,710
I didn't know you were home.

767
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,360
Yingzi.

768
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,880
Are you looking for Jiang Yi?

769
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,960
He's inside his room.

770
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,030
I will go and see him.

771
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,320
Jiang Yi.

772
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,360
What is wrong with you, Jiang Yi?

773
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,550
What have I done to you today?

774
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,150
Why did you run away when you saw me?

775
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,440
Jiang Yi, answer me.

776
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,510
Jiang Yi.

777
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,550
What is wrong with him?

778
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,230
I don't know either.

779
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,760
Mr. Jiang and Mrs. Jiang.

780
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,400
I should get going.

781
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,590
Take care.
