[Love Endures]

2
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,400
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
What?

4
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
That night,

5
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,400
the rain was pouring heavily.

6
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,750
I didn't expect

7
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,030
that to be the last time

8
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,470
I would see Yifei.

9
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,750
(Yingzi,)

10
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
(I'm leaving Hangtian City.)

11
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,960
If I hadn’t left Hangtian City,

12
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Yifei would not
have been bullied either.

13
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,710
(Trying to be a seductress?)

14
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,030
I hurt her.

15
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,190
I wasn't there

16
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,750
by her side

17
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
during her most desperate moments.

18
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,360
Yifei.

19
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,870
Yifei!

20
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,000
Yifei.

21
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,190
Yifei.

22
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,590
Yifei.

23
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,120
I knew it was you.

24
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,750
When... When did you return?

25
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,920
Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,920
Yingzi.

27
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,240
I didn't return.

28
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,630
You just can't let me go.

29
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,040
What do you mean?

30
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,190
Be careful!

31
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,800
Yifei!

32
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,480
Yifei.

33
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
You are the only ones I have left.

34
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,720
What are you doing?

35
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,360
What a pity.

36
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
Seems like she's only 18 or 19.

37
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,950
(Yingzi.)

38
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Huang Yingzi!

39
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,630
Huang Yingzi, wake up.

40
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,560
Huang Yingzi!

41
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh, you're awake?

42
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,240
You're up?

43
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,830
How do you feel?

44
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,560
Why are all of you here?

45
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,480
You drank too much yesterday.

46
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you remember anything at all?

47
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,920
My head hurts.

48
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,800
I don't remember anything.

49
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
Did I drink too much?

50
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,390
That's not right.

51
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,510
Why is Ding Ye here?

52
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,390
It's me.

53
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,830
I asked him to come

54
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,870
and celebrate your birthday.

55
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
I'm really sorry.

56
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,120
I drank too much yesterday,

57
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,390
so I don't remember anything.

58
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,720
After turning 18, this is my first time

59
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,430
celebrating my birthday with you guys.

60
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,950
I was overjoyed.

61
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,040
I passed out from drinking too much.

62
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,800
I can't hold my liquor anymore.

63
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,390
You didn't just pass out.

64
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,680
We thought you were
getting alcohol poisoning.

65
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,600
You're exaggerating.

66
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,430
I am sure I just drank too much.

67
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,920
You really don't remember anything?

68
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
What did I do?

69
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,480
You were dancing on the sofa,

70
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
insisting on giving us a concert.

71
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,550
Really?

72
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,080
That's too embarrassing.

73
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,790
Do you remember coming to me?

74
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,870
I even took you to meet someone.

75
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,150
Who did you take me to see?

76
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,360
Guan Chao and Yang Fan.

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,910
Right?

78
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,630
How come it was he
who brought Guan Chao and Yang Fan here?

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,670
Didn't the two of them

80
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,720
go to the karaoke with us?

81
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,960
Where are they?

82
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,360
They went home.

83
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,170
Grandma needed them.

84
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,030
But why do I remember

85
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,910
walking on the main street

86
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,320
after leaving the karaoke?

87
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
Did I go out?

88
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,270
Yes.

89
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,550
When you left,

90
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,510
you insisted on singing on the road

91
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,000
and even had Jiang Yi dance for you.

92
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Was I that drunk?

93
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,150
That's too embarrassing.

94
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,270
Did Jiang Yi dance?

95
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
Of course not.

96
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,080
I can't remember anything.

97
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
My brain.

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't want to remember it.

99
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,200
Forget it.

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mingyu told me

101
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,750
about yesterday's situation
over the phone.

102
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
How's Yingzi doing now?

103
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,390
She's awake now,

104
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,270
but she's the same as before.

105
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,320
So you guys have been
stopping me all day

106
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,909
so that she won't recall

107
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:00,789
what happened to that girl.

108
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,480
You've seen what she's like.

109
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,600
You thought telling her the truth

110
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,510
was being kind to her.

111
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,870
But what's the result?

112
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,840
She forgot she met Mr. Lan

113
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,790
and that we celebrated her birthday.

114
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,910
You gave her the wrong gift.

115
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
You two fought.

116
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,030
All these years,

117
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,270
whenever Yifei is mentioned,

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,630
she'll turn this way.

119
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
No wonder she was so sad

120
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,320
by the seaside that day.

121
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,790
Because whatever you went through,

122
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,030
she went through it too.

123
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,510
But she forgot it.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,030
Not just once.

125
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Everyone feels bad

126
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,030
for Yifei.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,240
But it's not the same for her.

128
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,750
Yes.

129
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,790
Among us, she was the only one

130
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,320
who witnessed all this.

131
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,390
Moreover,

132
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,720
she has to recall this incident

133
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,670
time and again.

134
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,910
So, what exactly happened back then?

135
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,750
Jiang Yi.

136
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
Did he really leave like that?

137
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Do you remember

138
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
the first time we sat on this swing?

139
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,910
We were only eight years old then.

140
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,630
Everyone dared sit on it,

141
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,080
but Jiang Yi dared not.

142
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,550
In the end,

143
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,080
he sat on it.

144
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,030
Well, that's thanks to you forcing him.

145
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,080
He even cried in the end.

146
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,630
If I didn't force him,

147
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,480
he would've grown up to become a coward.

148
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,150
Moreover,

149
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,240
he had a great time on the swing,
didn't he?

150
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
He was glued to it.

151
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Thinking about it now,

152
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,270
it was nice being children.

153
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,550
We were so carefree.

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,960
Back then, we wanted to grow up.

155
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,870
Now that we're grown up, we realize

156
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
it's better to be a child.

157
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,270
What's wrong?

158
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,320
Do you miss Jiang Yi?

159
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,960
No.

160
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,790
I'm just thinking,

161
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,120
when he's in the UK,

162
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,390
won't he have to eat fries with ketchup?

163
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,510
Can he get used to that?

164
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,270
You're saying this

165
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,440
and denying that you miss him?

166
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,120
So what if I do?

167
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,120
I messaged him, but he didn't reply.

168
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,440
(Why aren't you
replying to my messages?)

169
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,600
(Fine, just ignore me.)

170
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,870
(At least I know you're alive.)

171
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,440
(I hope you get adjusted quickly
and have a happy life there.)

172
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,480
(Maybe)

173
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,030
(he just doesn't know)

174
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,480
how to face you.

175
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,870
After all,

176
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,600
leaving was his own choice.

177
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,670
Yifei,

178
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360
will he stop contacting me forever?

179
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,440
Will the both of us

180
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
never meet again?

181
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,670
Yingzi.

182
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,200
Actually,

183
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,600
sometimes even after a person leaves,

184
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,200
if you keep thinking

185
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,630
about them,

186
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,720
they'll always be here.

187
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,030
Thank you, Yifei.

188
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,510
Let's play a game.

189
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,030
What game?

190
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,200
Close your eyes first.

191
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,000
Then,

192
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,080
think about the person
you want to see the most.

193
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Slowly open your eyes.

194
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,390
Son.

195
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,270
Come quickly.

196
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,750
Your dad queued for a very long time

197
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,000
to buy these.

198
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,720
Yeah.

199
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,910
This shop

200
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,080
on Regent Street

201
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,910
is very popular.

202
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,510
Yes.

203
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,320
Try it.

204
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,870
Yes.

205
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,030
Here, have a taste.

206
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,790
Why did you buy this?

207
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,720
Our son doesn't eat this.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Why?

209
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,510
You don't like fish and chips?

210
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,080
It's okay.

211
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,960
Leave it, I'll eat it myself.

212
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,080
There's more.

213
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,510
There's this.

214
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,320
And this

215
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,200
spaghetti

216
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,390
This tastes good too.

217
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Try this.

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,910
Our son doesn't eat spaghetti.

219
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,630
It's not the fries,

220
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,120
he doesn't eat tomatoes.

221
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,030
I forgot.

222
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,120
Who said I don't eat tomatoes?

223
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,720
I'll eat them.

224
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,000
(Mom, I want tomatoes.)

225
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,790
No, I don't eat tomatoes.

226
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,910
You don't eat tomatoes?

227
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,240
But I do.

228
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,390
I know

229
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,360
you're probably still thinking
about your old friends.

230
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,600
But even if you guys are close,

231
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,150
everyone will have their new lives.

232
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,910
Yes.

233
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,720
Jiang Yi,

234
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
it's about time to apply for schools.

235
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,320
Your mom and I

236
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
checked out a few schools for you.

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,720
How about this?

238
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
Take some time to consider

239
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,070
which one you'd like to go.

240
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
Well,

241
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
the NCEE results

242
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,960
should be out by now, right?

243
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,070
Mom.

244
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,160
Mom.

245
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,510
What's this?

246
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,030
Admission notice.

247
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,550
Give it to me.

248
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,640
Slow down.

249
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,270
Alright.

250
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,030
Admission letter,
Communication University of China.

251
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,510
Dear Ms. Huang Yingzi.

252
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,200
My daughter.

253
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Come.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,920
Fantastic! My daughter.

255
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,110
You wanted to go to Beijing, didn't you?

256
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,640
Beijing is great.

257
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,200
Lots of food, lots of fun.

258
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,270
You can also meet new classmates
at the university.

259
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,350
New friends.

260
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,590
A new environment, how nice!

261
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,350
Exactly.

262
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,110
Yes.

263
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,310
Why do you seem a bit unhappy?

264
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,310
Why are you mentioning that?

265
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,310
It's Jiang Yi.

266
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,160
My daughter.

267
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,070
I know

268
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,640
you're still upset

269
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,720
about Jiang Yi going abroad.

270
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,640
But

271
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,240
we must understand.

272
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
As long as we keep each other
in our hearts,

273
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,680
distance is not a problem.

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,030
Maybe after graduation,

275
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,200
you'll be stuck together again.

276
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Dad.

277
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,110
What nonsense are you talking about?

278
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,829
Yeah, stop talking nonsense.

279
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:33,789
Alright.

280
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,069
Let's not talk about Jiang Yi.

281
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,309
Let's talk about someone else.

282
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,310
Did the others get
their admission notices?

283
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,830
Yes.

284
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,109
Yifei is going to
the Central Dance Academy.

285
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,070
Mingyu is going to
the Jiangzhou University.

286
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,589
Zhuang Yuan is amazing,

287
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,439
he got into Qingbei University.

288
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
Right now, he's at home,

289
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,270
learning how to handle interviews.

290
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,790
I'm so happy.

291
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,590
These kids are really brilliant.

292
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,720
They all got into the schools
they wanted.

293
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,070
Yingzi,

294
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,920
let's invite them here tomorrow.

295
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,960
I will throw them a celebration party!

296
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,510
Hold on.

297
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,640
My daughter,

298
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,030
did we miss a person?

299
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,960
Yes.

300
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,550
Guan Chao's admission notice.

301
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,750
There's no news of that yet.

302
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,310
I want a bowl of wonton.

303
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,790
Sorry.

304
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,720
We're closed.

305
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,030
Looks like I'm late.

306
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,790
It's you.

307
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,920
When did you come back?

308
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,680
A year ago.

309
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,160
I never got the chance to thank you

310
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,350
for that incident back then.

311
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,510
You don't need to thank me.

312
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,550
I wanted to help.

313
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,750
What about you?

314
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,030
How have you been these years?

315
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,350
I went to the hair salon a while ago,

316
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,240
but it's closed.

317
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,030
Half a year ago,

318
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,550
my mom went out of town.

319
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,960
Yifei.

320
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,920
Since your parents are not here,

321
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,590
you should follow me from now on.

322
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,590
I'll take care of you.

323
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,590
Take care of me? What for?

324
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
I've been admitted to university.

325
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,030
I can take care of myself.

326
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,030
I'm different from back then.

327
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,830
Now I'm fully capable of taking care...

328
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,550
Hello?

329
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,350
What happened to Guan Chao?

330
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,720
He didn't receive his admission letter,

331
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
and now we can't contact him either.

332
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,880
We're worried about his dad.

333
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Okay.

334
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,480
Stay calm.

335
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,510
I'll go look for him now.

336
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,960
Is everything okay?

337
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,160
Sorry.

338
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,070
I have something urgent.

339
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,790
I have to go first.

340
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,720
Go ahead.

341
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,030
We'll have plenty of time to meet.

342
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,590
I think

343
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
the third batch of admission letters

344
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,200
should be out now.

345
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,640
Didn't you receive it?

346
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,310
Dad.

347
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,000
Go ahead and hit me.

348
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,720
Get up.

349
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,750
Get up.

350
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,400
Sit down.

351
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,680
Dad.

352
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Aren't you mad at me?

353
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,350
Our family has never produced
a university student.

354
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,830
I'm just a worker,

355
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,750
just like your grandfather.

356
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,200
Thinking about it,

357
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,240
maybe I was asking for too much.

358
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,790
It's not your fault.

359
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,310
Shihua, right?

360
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,590
This is yours.

361
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,110
What's left?

362
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,830
Building 3, No. 301,

363
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,270
401 and 402.

364
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,030
Hello.

365
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,550
Is there a package
for 402 in Building 3?

366
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,790
Yes, No. 402, Building 3.

367
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,680
Guan Chao.

368
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Yes, Guan Chao.

369
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,200
The same 'Guan' as 'Guan Yu'.

370
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,960
'Chao' as in 'Ma Chao'.

371
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
Dad, don't say that.

372
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,030
I will spend another year
preparing for the test.

373
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
402, you have a package.

374
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,030
Guan Chao.

375
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,680
"Mr. Guan Chao,

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
congratulations on being admitted to

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,350
the Athletics College."

378
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,680
Quick!

379
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,030
Dad, I've been admitted!

380
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,880
I've been admitted!

381
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,510
"Mr. Guan Chao,

382
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,480
congratulations on being admitted to

383
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,790
the Athletics College."

384
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,160
Who said there aren't
any university students in our family?

385
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,960
You're a university student now!

386
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,110
I'm a university student!

387
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,640
Great!

388
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,030
You finally got in!

389
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,720
Alright!

390
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,720
It seems you're not useless.

391
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,270
Guan Chao's favorite.

392
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,440
This is Mingyu's favorite.

393
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,830
This is Yifei's favorite.

394
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,030
Yingzi, you shouldn't buy this much
even if they love it.

395
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,960
Wouldn't it be a waste
if we can't finish them?

396
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,400
They're going to college soon.

397
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,550
They might not get to taste these
once they leave town.

398
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,240
This time, you should cook
a little more.

399
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,920
Make sure that they're satisfied.

400
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,350
Here you go.

401
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay.

402
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,830
Buy as many as you want.

403
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,000
Mom will cook for you guys.

404
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,790
I will make some new dishes
for you to try.

405
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,440
What do you think?

406
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,680
I'll help you out, then.

407
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,880
What a good girl.

408
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,640
Since my daughter got into college,

409
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,310
you look good from any angle.

410
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,240
What a snob.

411
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,070
Daughter.

412
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,000
I think I saw some new fish
at that fish stall there.

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,030
Let's buy a few.

414
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,640
Let's buy some tomatoes first.

415
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,790
Why are you buying tomatoes?

416
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,110
I want to eat tomatoes today.

417
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
I want to eat
scrambled eggs with tomato.

418
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,480
Tomato beef brisket.

419
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,310
Tomato diced chicken stir-fry.

420
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,270
Tomato sour and spicy fish.

421
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,310
Tomato stir-fried tomatoes.

422
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,270
What's wrong with you?

423
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,110
Are you addicted?

424
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,920
The guy who hates tomatoes
is not here anymore anyway.

425
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,720
I want to eat it.

426
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,000
I just want to eat it.

427
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,640
Madam Zhang.

428
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,200
Okay.

429
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,880
Look.

430
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,070
Your school is here.

431
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,070
My school is here.

432
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,830
They're too far apart.

433
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,110
It's okay.

434
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,000
It's just over ten kilometers.

435
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,510
Just over ten kilometers?

436
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,790
That's enough to go
around Hangtian City.

437
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,590
Besides,

438
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,350
if you take the subway,

439
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,640
that's over an hour.

440
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,200
Take it easy.

441
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,310
No matter the distance,

442
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,750
I'll pick you up every day after class.

443
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,830
Forget it.

444
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,790
Your training is more important.

445
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,000
That should be your priority.

446
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,590
What are you saying?

447
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,310
I think seeing you

448
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,350
is my priority.

449
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,640
Yifei.

450
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,640
Look.

451
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
The Forbidden City is
between our schools.

452
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,790
Jingshan Park, Nanluogu Lane,

453
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,830
and this drum tower.

454
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,160
These are all in between our schools.

455
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,920
Let me think.

456
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,920
So, in the winter,

457
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,960
we can go ice skating at Shichahai.

458
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,550
What about autumn?

459
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,350
In autumn, we can go to Fragrant Hills
to see the maple leaves.

460
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,070
And in spring?

461
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,880
- Think about it.
- Spring?

462
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,030
Spring...

463
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,680
In spring, we'll go boating
in Beihai Park.

464
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,790
Sure.

465
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,830
Do you still remember?

466
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,240
When we were in elementary school,

467
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,110
you danced to a song.

468
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,510
"Let's Row the Double Oars".

469
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,720
Why?

470
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
That song is about Beihai Park.

471
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,720
I remember you got first place
in that competition.

472
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,830
That song.

473
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,270
I remember my mom taught me that dance.

474
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,510
Well,

475
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,200
if they knew

476
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,240
I got into the ballet academy,

477
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,270
would they be happy for me?

478
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,920
But

479
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,960
I don't even know
how to break the news to them.

480
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,510
Yifei.

481
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,270
In the future,

482
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,640
whether it's happy or sad,

483
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,720
you can share it with me.

484
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,110
I'll always be here.

485
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,400
I swear.

486
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,240
Got it.

487
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,110
What's this?

488
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
It's for me?

489
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,270
Do you like it?

490
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,110
Let me put it on for you.

491
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,240
Sure.

492
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,480
Yifei.

493
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,720
I like you.

494
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,270
Yifei.

495
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,510
Where are you going?

496
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,270
I'll send you there.

497
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,750
No need.

498
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,310
I'm going to a friend's house
for dinner.

499
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,240
Who?

500
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,310
That crazy girl who caused trouble
when she got drunk last time?

501
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
Or that tall and foolish guy?

502
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Don't talk about them like that.

503
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,310
Fine.

504
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,600
So you said you're going out.

505
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,590
Have you told your dad about

506
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,750
getting into university?

507
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,000
What do you want?

508
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,510
I want to show you something.

509
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,030
Don't you recognize

510
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,160
your dad's watch?

511
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,550
Why did you bring me here?

512
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,240
Where's my dad?

513
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,000
Did you really find him?

514
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
Yifei, I'm asking you.

515
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,750
He left so heartlessly back then,

516
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,030
do you still want to see him?

517
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
No matter what,

518
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,070
he's my dad.

519
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,590
Have you ever thought

520
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,510
that if he hadn't done that,

521
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,000
you wouldn't have suffered so much?

522
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
And you wouldn't have been bullied
by Ma Mingliang and the gang?

523
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
I don't think I was suffering.

524
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,550
And I have many good friends.

525
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,880
They've always been helping me

526
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,590
and taking care of me.

527
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,270
Helping you and taking care of you?

528
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,880
They're just playing house, Yifei.

529
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,350
Can they help you find your dad?

530
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Can they give you a better life?

531
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,160
But I can.

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
I will protect you,
and take care of you,

533
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,590
just like before.

534
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,350
Hello.

535
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,590
Are you here for a haircut?

536
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,240
What haircut?

537
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,270
What are you doing?

538
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,960
Hello.

539
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,240
Stop that!

540
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,270
Hello.

541
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,070
Stop rummaging!

542
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,880
Hello!

543
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,440
May I know

544
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,110
if Lan Bin is your husband?

545
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,240
Who are you people?

546
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Don't mind who we are.

547
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,070
Answer the question.

548
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,110
It's over between us a long time ago.

549
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,030
Then that's a yes.

550
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,550
We

551
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,550
were paid to do a service.

552
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,110
He owes someone money,

553
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,830
and now he's gone.

554
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,310
So we had to come to you.

555
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,160
I have no money.

556
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,720
If you have no money,

557
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,000
we'll find it ourselves.

558
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,240
I'm telling you, I have no money.
What are you doing?

559
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,880
What are you doing?

560
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,750
Stop rummaging, give it back to me!

561
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,440
Don't move!

562
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,830
You can't go there!

563
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,480
Get lost!

564
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,070
If you go, I'll fight you!

565
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,480
Fight? What's there to fight for?

566
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,230
Mom!

567
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,920
You can't take that money!

568
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,720
- Stay still!
- Mom!

569
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,720
You can't take that money!

570
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,110
Mom, let them take it.

571
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,960
This is the tuition
for your dance class.

572
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:49,790
It's okay, Mom.

573
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,720
I will stop dancing.

574
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,110
This money...

575
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,030
Just take it.

576
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,640
Don't come back again.

577
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,790
This money isn't enough.

578
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,030
Mom.

579
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,880
Let's go.

580
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,920
Mom.

581
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,830
Are we leaving now?

582
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,830
I said, let's go.

583
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,720
School's over?

584
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,880
Tell me.

585
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,960
Where did your dad go?

586
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,240
I don't know.

587
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,590
What do you want?

588
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,510
You won't tell, huh?

589
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,670
Okay.

590
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,030
Your dad

591
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,400
owes us money.

592
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,670
And he dared run away.

593
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,110
You'll have to

594
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,710
pay us back in his stead.

595
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,110
Run.

596
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,550
Let's see where you can run.

597
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,000
Pay up.

598
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
I don't have any money.

599
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,230
You don't have money?

600
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,190
Then you can't blame me.

601
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,150
I

602
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,320
will find you a place to earn money.

603
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,840
Come!

604
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,480
Let go of me!

605
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:46,760
Come!

606
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,550
Go away!

607
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,590
Darn it!

608
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,710
How dare you bite me?

609
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,840
I'll hit you!

610
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,960
Go!

611
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Hurry, run!

612
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,400
Go!

613
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,280
Are you trying to run away?

614
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,400
Your dad ran away,

615
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
you think I'll let you go?

616
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm going to...

617
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
Alright, we're at your place.

618
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,000
Hurry and go back.

619
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,840
What about you?

620
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,670
They won't let you off for sure.

621
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,590
If so, you'd better leave quickly.

622
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,630
I can go and explain to the police.

623
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,880
What's there to explain?

624
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,230
Remember,

625
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,110
if anyone asks you,

626
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,320
just say I pushed them.

627
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,710
You have nothing to do with it.

628
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,400
Got it?

629
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,110
But you were just helping me.

630
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,920
Stop yapping.

631
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,710
I've said it,
it has nothing to do with you.

632
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,630
Since they laid hands on me,

633
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,480
it's my business with them now.

634
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,670
Be good, go home.

635
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,550
What's your name?

636
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,000
Dai Wei.

637
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,030
Dai Wei.

638
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,110
Thank you.

639
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,320
(Now that I'm out,)

640
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,550
(I have money.)

641
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,670
(I can help you with whatever you need.)

642
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,400
If you can help me find my dad,

643
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,710
I will definitely thank you properly.

644
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,030
How will you thank me?

645
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,880
Just kidding.

646
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,510
Think about it.

647
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,480
What have we been through?

648
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
With our relationship,
you don't have to thank me.

649
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Come on, Yifei.

650
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
Let's celebrate.

651
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,760
Let's celebrate

652
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,320
our reunion.

653
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,880
I don't drink.

654
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,590
Then consider it a celebration

655
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,960
for you getting into the ballet school.

656
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,230
Okay?

657
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,060
No eating before everyone arrives.

658
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,110
Not everyone's here yet.

659
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,360
Got it.

660
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,030
Why hasn't Yifei arrived yet?

661
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,440
Could something have happened to Yifei?

662
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,110
Touch wood.

663
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,710
What could possibly happen?

664
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,230
Since Zhang Tao and his gang
targeted Yifei,

665
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,710
I've always been worried.

666
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
She'll be fine.

667
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,190
If you're worried,
why not give her a call?

668
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm hungry.

669
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,920
I'll make a call.

670
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
What are you doing?

671
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,590
They're your friends,

672
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,190
how about me?

673
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
She hung up.

674
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,760
(When is my dad coming?)

675
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,760
You haven't found him at all, have you?

676
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,880
Yifei, let me tell you the truth.

677
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,360
I didn't get this from your dad.

678
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,630
Your mom gave it to me

679
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,550
as a debt payment.

680
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,190
Get it?

681
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,110
Dai Wei.

682
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,630
If you have something to say,
say it properly.

683
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,150
Why did you deceive me
and bring me here?

684
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,880
I didn't deceive you, Yifei.

685
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,630
I just sincerely wanted
to spend some time with you

686
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,190
and catch up with you.
What's wrong with that?

687
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,000
Yifei, did you know?

688
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,510
All these years in prison,

689
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,400
the only reason I persisted
was because I thought I could

690
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,590
see you again when I get out.

691
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,280
The first thing I did when I got out

692
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,150
was to go to your school
to see you go to school and leave school

693
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,070
and watch you practice dancing.

694
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,110
I thought

695
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
we could be together now that I'm out.

696
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,620
Did you forget how I got in?

697
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,320
Or do you not need me anymore

698
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,550
now that you've grown up?

699
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,880
I have something to do.

700
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,760
I have to go.

701
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,670
Her phone's still off.

702
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,630
Stop pacing in front of me,

703
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,630
okay?

704
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,150
You're making me anxious.

705
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,440
I can't get through.

706
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,320
We can't keep waiting like this.

707
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,510
Let's call the police.

708
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,550
Yes.

709
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,320
Yes, call the police.

710
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,000
Yifei.

711
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,880
Yifei.

712
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,800
Where did you go?

713
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,230
We searched for you all night yesterday.

714
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,550
I didn't go anywhere.

715
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,920
I went out to hang out with my friends.

716
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,960
We searched everywhere last night.

717
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,070
Who did you go out with?

718
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Friends from the dance troupe.

719
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,070
You don't know them.

720
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,480
Friends from the dance troupe?

721
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,070
Which friends from the dance troupe?

722
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,070
I have to help my grandma at the shop.

723
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,880
Go home first, guys.

724
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,960
Yifei.

725
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,440
How about

726
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
you go upstairs and rest?

727
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
We'll take care of this.

728
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,440
Yeah, let me handle it.

729
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,030
Yes, take a break.

730
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,440
That's enough!

731
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,150
I told you, I'm really okay!

732
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,880
Can't you believe it?

733
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,360
Yifei, you...

734
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:16,840
Enough.

735
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,230
Yifei said she's fine.

736
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,800
Stop asking.

737
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,510
She's home safe and sound.
Isn't that good enough?

738
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,880
Are you going to
the graduation party tonight?

739
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,360
Of course,

740
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,760
I'll go.

741
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,550
(To our future full of freedom,)

742
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,550
cheers!

743
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,230
Cheers!

744
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,630
Tingting.

745
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,590
We're going to the same city.

746
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,550
Let's stay in touch more often.

747
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,280
Fatty,

748
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,480
if you don't confess now,

749
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,110
you won't have a chance later.

750
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,110
Tingting,

751
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,030
won't you be my girlfriend?

752
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,000
Tingting, be my girlfriend, please?

753
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,190
Alright.

754
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,480
Okay, sure.

755
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,440
I have a girlfriend now!

756
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,110
Yingzi.

757
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,030
If Yi didn't go abroad,

758
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,150
you might have gone to Beijing together.

759
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,710
Did you know?

760
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,440
Yi worked so hard

761
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,590
to go to Beijing with you.

762
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,630
It's good that he went abroad.

763
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,880
He has better opportunities there.

764
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,550
Yeah.

765
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,360
You grew up together.

766
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,360
You'll still keep in touch.

767
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,710
Mind your words, can you?

768
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,630
Shut up if you can't.

769
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,360
Go over there.

770
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:31,960
Go over there.

771
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:32,590
Shoo.

772
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,030
Get lectured, huh?

773
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,110
Today, I can't be the only one
who was confessed to.

774
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,230
Who's next?

775
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,760
Who?

776
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,360
I'll do it.

777
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,150
Okay, Guan Chao.

778
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,670
I'll do it.

779
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,320
Another confession.

780
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,590
I want to say something to Yifei.

781
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,070
Yifei,

782
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,800
we're going to Beijing together.

783
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,880
I promise.

784
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,280
Wherever you are,

785
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,550
as long as you need me,

786
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,630
I'll be there for you.

787
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,070
No matter what you are going through,

788
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,480
I want to face it with you.

789
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,190
Okay.

790
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,070
It's our leading lady's turn.

791
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,000
Take it. Go.

792
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,670
Take it.

793
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,000
Quiet, everyone.

794
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,630
Listen to the leading lady's speech.

795
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,590
What's wrong?

796
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,000
Are you feeling shy?

797
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,030
Are you shy, Yifei?

798
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,960
Is everything okay, Yifei?

799
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,480
Yifei.

800
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,510
Lan Yifei.

801
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,030
Why are you still acting innocent?

802
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,070
Hey, Guan Chao,

803
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,630
did you know

804
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,280
you were cuckolded?

805
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,920
Are you crazy?

806
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,760
What are you saying?

807
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I have a photo.

808
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,670
If you don't believe me, look.

809
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,000
Look at the photo.

810
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,190
Everyone, come and check it out.

811
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,360
Am I right?

812
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,030
It's Lan Yifei, right?
