[Episode 22]

2
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,799
Eat up.

3
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,599
Have you eaten?

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,159
Yes.

5
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,439
Table for one?

6
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,879
Why don't you sit here?

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
Where is Lan Yifei?

8
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
I don't know.

9
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,560
You're quite hot-tempered.

10
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,280
What do you want?

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm here for wontons. Is that okay?

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,319
The pot is empty!

13
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,239
No more.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,038
Aren't they right here?

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,319
What is this?

16
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,399
It tastes disgusting!

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,159
I can't believe you're selling this.

18
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,198
Let me tell you.

19
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,560
Don't cause trouble here.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,759
We can call the police!

21
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,879
Yes, we're going to call the police.

22
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,159
Go ahead.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm scared.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm so scared!

25
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,079
Who is he?

26
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,879
Thank you for finding the doctor.

27
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,399
You're most welcome, Grandma.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,520
Grandma, do you feel better now?

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,240
This is an old ailment.

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
No, the doctor said,

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,759
the older the ailment,
the more it needs to be treated.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,879
That's right.

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Who is it?

34
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:58,919
Let's go.

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Wait up.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Lan Yifei, right?

37
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,719
You know who I am, right?

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,199
Who are you?

39
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,240
What do you want with Yifei?

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
Where did you come from?

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
I suggest you leave.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
I don't know you.

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't know me,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but I know you.

45
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,519
You should know who my sister is, right?

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Who is your sister?

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,319
I wasn't talking to you!

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,639
Your despicable mom

49
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,840
took my sister's husband from her.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,879
My sister causes trouble
at home every day.

51
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,359
What are you doing?

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,199
What are you doing?

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,319
Her mom is my daughter.

54
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,319
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

55
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,839
Old lady,

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
turns out that vixen
inherited it from you.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,879
If you continue talking nonsense,

58
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,879
I'll call the police!

59
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
What exactly do you want?

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,159
What do you think I want?

61
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,918
Young man,

62
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,599
you keep hurling insults.

63
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,799
Who taught you that?

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,199
Old lady, stay away from me!

65
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,280
Do you think we're easy targets

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
as we're weak?

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Come any closer,
and I'll report you for fraud!

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,000
Go ahead.

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,159
Let's see if they

70
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,239
help me, an old lady,

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,680
or you, a thug.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,240
Come and see this bully!

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
Go now!

74
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,360
Anyway, I've made myself clear.

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,000
Think carefully about how
to compensate my sister.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,240
Otherwise, don't blame me
for taking action.

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Scram!

78
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,040
Grandma, are you okay?

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,759
Grandma.

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
Don't be scared.

81
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,759
Good girl. I'm here.

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,240
Tao, want a duck neck?

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

84
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,120
You're still playing?

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,079
Thank you, Tao.

86
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,680
Tao.

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,319
How did it go, Tao?

88
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,199
Did you find her?

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,279
I even went to their wonton shop.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Is her daughter still there?

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Yes.

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,759
She's clearly unrestrained,

94
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,600
just like her mom.

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,959
My brother-in-law is a scum.

96
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,839
When she seduced him,

97
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,920
he left his family.

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,079
I cannot ignore my sister's plight.

99
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,399
I need to avenge her.

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,439
Tao, tell us what we should do.

101
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,199
An old lady and a young girl.

102
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
If I lay a hand on them,
it makes me look bad.

103
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,600
Anyway, I found their wonton shop.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,839
I'll wreck their wonton shop

105
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,759
first.

106
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,439
Without the shop,

107
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,519
let's see how they'll survive.

108
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,319
What happened?

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,839
There's a worker
in the second factory, Zhang Xiuying.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,120
Her husband ran away with Yifei's mom.

111
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,199
She was the one
who caused trouble for Yifei previously.

112
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,560
Yes.

113
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,600
She has a brother, Zhang Tao.

114
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,240
He's a famous thug in Hangtian City.

115
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,199
No wonder.

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
A while ago, a thug
came to Yifei and me.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
He asked Yifei
if she knew who his sister was.

118
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,160
In the cybercafe, Guan Chao and I heard

119
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,160
they wanted to wreck the wonton shop.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,079
How dare he?

121
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,639
If they dare to wreck the wonton shop,

122
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll fight against them
with all my might.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,639
Actually, their purpose

124
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,560
is to cause trouble
for Yifei and Grandma.

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
That means they are
causing trouble for us.

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
None of us can back down.

127
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Yes.

128
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
I think

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,079
we should stay in the wonton shop

130
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,000
and wait for them to come.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
That won't work.

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Yifei is proud.

133
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,879
She definitely doesn't want us to know

134
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,920
and trouble us.

135
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,600
What if we call the police?

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,279
What can we tell the police?

137
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,480
Someone wants to wreck the wonton shop,

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
so the police should keep watch

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,079
on the wonton shop 24/7?

140
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,319
Will that work?

141
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,279
I have an idea.

142
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,519
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello, Madam.

143
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,920
Hey, why are you in a rush?

144
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,839
Extra lessons.

145
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,439
What? What are they up to?

146
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,839
Why do you need my binoculars?

147
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,720
I've tried.

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Using the binoculars,

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
we can see
the wonton shop from your house.

150
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,839
Are you saying

151
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,839
we can use
Jiang Yi's home as an outpost?

152
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes. We take turns

153
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,199
in keeping an eye on the wonton shop.

154
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,600
Once we see someone suspicious,

155
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
we can rush there immediately.

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,279
I've calculated.

157
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,480
I only need a minute
to run from Jiang Yi's house

158
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,319
to the wonton shop.

159
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,560
That's for you.

160
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,720
I... I will need at least 62 seconds.

161
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,439
In 62 seconds,

162
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,519
you can only move
from this chair to the door of my house.

163
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,600
Nonsense. Shut up.

164
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,480
Stop.

165
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
What should we tell our families?

166
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,160
We're on holiday recently, right?

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
We can tell our parents

168
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,120
we both are giving them extra lessons.

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
We won't be going home these few days.

170
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,319
Now, we only lack one thing.

171
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,079
What do we lack?

172
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,279
Weapons to use in the fight.

173
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,639
Actually, I have prepared some.

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,000
Look.

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,959
I took rolling pins
from our family's supermarket.

176
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,759
Besides, I wrapped gauze over them

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,439
to prevent us
from getting hurt in the fight.

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
Come on.

179
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,800
It's dumb to fight with rolling pins.

180
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,800
Then what?

181
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
Should I make chainsticks for you?

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Go ahead.

183
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
Nonsense!

184
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Go keep watch.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,639
You're the first.

186
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,800
Why am I the first?

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
According to the final exam scores,

188
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,879
from the lowest to the highest.

189
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,680
Any objections?

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,879
Why not from the highest to the lowest?

191
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,759
- Enough!
- I'll keep watch.

192
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,120
Then, Jiang Yi
will take the night shift.

193
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,959
There's a night shift?

194
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,079
At night, the thugs won't come out.

195
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,519
Any objections?

196
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,040
If there are no objections,

197
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,839
it's settled.

198
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,759
Fang Mingyu.

199
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,159
Fang Mingyu,

200
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,240
come out.

201
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Fang Mingyu.

202
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,759
Why?

203
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,519
After you resign,

204
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,480
you can't even talk?

205
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
Where should I start?

206
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,840
You going to Yue Tong,

207
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
or how you sent
the email to the whole company?

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,159
I was considering our future.

209
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,679
We're one.

210
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,840
Do you want us to become

211
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,519
enemies, with only one side surviving?

212
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,720
If we're really one,

213
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,519
then you should resign immediately.

214
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,840
What are you talking about?

215
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,240
Resign?

216
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,600
You're funny.

217
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,159
You've used your own way to punish me.

218
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,519
What else do you want?

219
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,279
Let me tell you.

220
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,039
If you hadn't been impulsive,

221
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,199
I wouldn't have needed
to waste my efforts!

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,960
I didn't think it was wasted.

223
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,919
At least I got to know

224
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,679
some trash

225
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,120
should've been cleared out earlier.

226
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,079
Trash?

227
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,080
If I were trash, what were you?

228
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,199
That position

229
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,960
should be mine.

230
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,600
If it weren't for your relationship
with Feng Guohui,

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,200
you'd be nothing.

232
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,600
Guo Kai,

233
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,519
you're just a sore loser.

234
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,080
As elite as you usually are,

235
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,679
you are now equally ridiculous.

236
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,199
You've always looked down on everyone,

237
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
including me,

238
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,480
but you're actually
the most despicable one.

239
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,919
That's enough.

240
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
You're not worthy of me.

241
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,559
Stop talking.

242
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,439
You're also not worthy of the role.

243
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,840
Stop talking.

244
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,319
Leave my house now.

245
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,120
I said, leave my house now!

246
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,799
No, I need to find a way
to salvage this.

247
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,399
I still have a chance.

248
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,279
Fang Mingyu.

249
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
Mingyu.

250
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
You know

251
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,600
how important this role is to me.

252
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,759
You know that well,

253
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,960
right?

254
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,600
We can still make this work.

255
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,559
Let me go.

256
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,279
Mingyu,

257
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,600
call Feng Guohui now.

258
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,159
Tell him

259
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,679
you were
babbling nonsense at the company.

260
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,079
You were under too much stress,

261
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,960
so you...

262
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
You were delusional.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,879
That was why

264
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,000
you put all the blame on me.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
It's fine.

266
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,279
I can take that.

267
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,399
I can provide you
with a medical certificate.

268
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,720
I said, let me go!

269
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,159
Mingyu, I can accept you.

270
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,559
Call him!

271
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,519
Let me go...

272
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm not making the call.

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,879
If you don't leave, I will.

274
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,759
I resigned

275
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,279
not only because of this.

276
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,519
Guo Kai,

277
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,399
I think we both should be brave

278
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,240
and make our relationship public.

279
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,439
Come back.

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,639
(Mingyu.)

281
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,720
(I prepared wontons for you.)

282
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,639
(When are you free to taste them?)

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
Call Feng Guohui now.

284
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,559
Tell him

285
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,240
you were talking nonsense.

286
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,120
(Hello.)

287
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,600
(The number you dialed
is busy right now.)

288
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,279
Really?

289
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,639
Just wait and see.

290
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,879
The results will be out soon.

291
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:08,959
Good morning.

292
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
You're early today.

293
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840
Have you heard about the latest twist?

294
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,519
What twist?

295
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,360
The vice president's position

296
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,639
will be vacant this year.

297
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,720
Vacant?

298
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,440
Why?

299
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,480
I heard that Ms. Fang
counterattacked Guo Kai.

300
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,679
Both of them
met their downfall together.

301
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,080
Mr. Guo, did you see Mingyu?

302
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,799
I called her,

303
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,360
but she didn't pick up.

304
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,159
Is she okay?

305
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,480
This is between Mingyu and me.

306
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,519
It has nothing to do with you.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,879
Stop probing.

308
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,879
Hello, Zhuang Yuan. What's up?

309
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,159
What?

310
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,759
Mingyu...

311
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,639
Mingyu, are you at home?

312
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,879
Mingyu!

313
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,039
Is she still not picking up?

314
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,600
Yes.

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,600
There's no way she'd switch off
her phone for so long.

316
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
Mingyu.

317
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Mingyu.

318
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,399
Mingyu, are you at home?

319
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
Mingyu.

320
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,360
Mingyu.

321
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,240
You must be tired.

322
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,960
My turn.

323
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
Where are they?

324
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,200
Guan Chao and Jiang Yi
wanted to play games,

325
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
and then Zhuang Yuan
pulled them into the room

326
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,879
to teach them math.

327
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,480
Will Yifei think

328
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,039
we are strange?

329
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,639
Why?

330
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,080
We disappeared suddenly.

331
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,919
She must be wondering what we're up to.

332
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,120
She must've guessed

333
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,679
that we're protecting her in secret.

334
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,480
If we're in trouble,

335
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
she'll do the same.

336
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
Of course.

337
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
This is the tacit understanding
among the six of us.

338
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,639
Where is Huang Yingzi?

339
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,399
Why didn't they come today?

340
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,559
They are busy studying.

341
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,200
You should go.

342
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,879
No. I'll stay here with you.

343
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,519
Silly girl.

344
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Yifei,

345
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,919
if someone comes to cause trouble,

346
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,960
you should hide in the kitchen.

347
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,360
Don't come out.

348
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,879
Grandma,

349
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm not scared.

350
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I want to protect you.

351
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,759
It's fine.

352
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,919
Okay, it's getting late.

353
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,120
We should rest.

354
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Okay. I'll go wash the dishes.

355
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,879
Mingyu...

356
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:40,480
Look.

357
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
Is it them?

358
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,359
Young lady,

359
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,919
I'm not here to cause you trouble.

360
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,799
It's your mom

361
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,879
who made my sister upset.

362
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,799
Shouldn't we ask for compensation?

363
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
What do you want?

364
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,480
Well,

365
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,319
either you let me give this shop

366
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,240
a makeover,

367
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,359
or

368
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,799
you come to my house
and make wontons for me for a year.

369
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,319
What do you think?

370
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,319
Tao,

371
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,119
are you okay?

372
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,559
Where did you come from?

373
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,519
Do you have a death wish?

374
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,920
You don't know Tao's title, right?

375
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,079
Tao's title?

376
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,319
Who is Tao?

377
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,319
I only know Steve Ma and Kenny Bee.

378
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,359
Who are you?

379
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,720
Tao is known as "Little Chicken Chiu."

380
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,039
Don't you know that?

381
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,400
How dare you interfere?

382
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,599
"Little Chicken Chiu?"

383
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,599
Don't you know that Chicken Chiu

384
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,799
died in the end?

385
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,279
Do you know who I am?

386
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,799
Tell them who I am.

387
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,679
Who are you?

388
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,799
Huang Yingzi of Hangtian City.

389
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,440
Haven't you heard of her?

390
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,160
Haven't you heard of her?

391
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Wong Feihung's descendant.

392
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:54,680
Yes.

393
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,119
Hit them!

394
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,640
Mingyu.

395
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,759
Fang Mingyu.

396
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,039
Fang Mingyu.

397
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,079
If you're at home,

398
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,919
at least come out and let us see you

399
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,319
so we won't worry, okay?

400
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
Mingyu?

401
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Mingyu!

402
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,119
Mingyu.

403
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,279
Bear with it.

404
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,960
It might hurt a bit.

405
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,879
Are we really going?

406
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,119
Of course.

407
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,400
You know what you should do, right?

408
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,039
Let's go.

409
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,559
Guo Kai.

410
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,079
Do you have an appointment?

411
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,639
Do you need an appointment
to hit someone?

412
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,759
Hit someone?

413
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,640
Who do you think you are?

414
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,839
How dare you bully Mingyu?

415
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,639
You scoundrel.

416
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,759
I'll beat you to a pulp!

417
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,079
Call the police now!

418
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,839
Go ahead!

419
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,079
I was going to do that

420
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,000
so the police would arrest you
for domestic violence.

421
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
Let me go!

422
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,319
Let me beat this scoundrel to a pulp.

423
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,559
Stop!

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,640
Let me join in!

425
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,799
Are you three okay?

426
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,559
We're fine.

427
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,240
I think they're faring worse than us.

428
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,599
We can fight better now.

429
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,079
This is our second time
taking the police car, right?

430
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,200
We're heading to the police station.

431
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,319
Why do you seem happy?

432
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,480
We won the fight, right?

433
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,119
Why don't we take a selfie?

434
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,519
We look quite cool right now.

435
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,079
Stay put.

436
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,879
Keep your phone.

437
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,160
Understood.

438
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,519
We were joking,

439
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,440
officers.

440
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
No photos.

441
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,039
We get it.

442
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:40,839
Sit tight.

443
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,079
Come out!

444
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,279
Your parents are here to pick you up.

445
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,599
Teach them a lesson back home.

446
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,720
Okay, thank you.

447
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,279
Look at you.

448
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:36,880
Those who know

449
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
think you guys went to fight,

450
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,680
while those who don't

451
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,920
might think
you fell into a pile of flour.

452
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,279
Mom.

453
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,599
Move...

454
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,720
Huang Yingzi.

455
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,400
Didn't you tell me
you went to get extra lessons?

456
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Why did you end up in a fight?

457
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,879
We got into a fight
after the extra lessons.

458
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,079
Right, Zhuang Yuan?

459
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,640
We finished learning
trigonometric functions

460
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,519
before we started the fight.

461
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,519
We even learned solid geometry.

462
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,480
I can testify to that.

463
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,359
Mingyu,

464
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,240
Zhuang Yuan.

465
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Both of you are usually

466
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
the most obedient ones.

467
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,359
Why didn't you stop them

468
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,399
when they fought?

469
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,240
Why should they stop us?

470
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,599
We didn't do anything wrong.

471
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,960
That's enough...

472
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,799
Well,

473
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,759
it was self-defense,

474
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,200
right?

475
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,119
Go handle the procedures

476
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,399
and apologize to the other party.

477
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,519
They caused this.

478
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,799
Why should I apologize?

479
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,240
Well,

480
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,599
you're obviously a reasonable

481
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,359
and trustworthy person.

482
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,799
You'll handle this better than I do.

483
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
You spoil them.

484
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,400
Going to great lengths for a friend.

485
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,079
Six of Hangtian City,

486
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,480
you didn't disappoint me.

487
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,599
Dad,

488
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,439
you didn't disappoint me either.

489
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
You're righteous

490
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,960
and just,

491
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,319
just like Bao Qingtian.

492
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:14,720
Okay.

493
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,400
That's enough.

494
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,399
It's wrong to fight.

495
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,960
Don't do that again.

496
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,960
Do you hear me?

497
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,160
Yes.

498
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,319
Zhuang Yuan, Jiang Yi.

499
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:46,559
Head downstairs to throw these away.

500
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,240
Okay.

501
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,640
Look after her.

502
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
Over these years,

503
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,319
my focus was to climb the ranks.

504
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,839
I spent all my time and energy on work.

505
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,039
Even my boyfriend

506
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,759
was chosen
after I weighed the pros and cons.

507
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,799
In the end,

508
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,640
it was all in vain.

509
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,519
That's good.

510
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,559
Losing everything means
you'll get to say goodbye to the past

511
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,720
and start anew.

512
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,400
You...

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,680
The last time you leaned on my shoulder

514
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,759
was during
our eleventh-grade final exams.

515
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,640
You didn't do well in the exams

516
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,559
and cried on my shoulder.

517
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,519
Back then,
getting ten points less in the exam

518
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,920
was enough to bring on a good cry.

519
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,440
Looking back now, that was nothing.

520
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,799
Growing up, I've come to realize

521
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,920
once some things are messed up,
they can't be fixed.

522
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,680
Nonsense.

523
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
You didn't mess things up.

524
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,000
If it's about messing things up,

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,559
I do that better than you.

526
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,640
I've messed up many things
since I was young,

527
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,519
but look at me now.

528
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,839
I'm doing fine, right?

529
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,000
Do you know?

530
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,839
This is why I hated you back then.

531
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
You were unpredictable

532
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,680
and loved causing trouble,

533
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,559
but you were cheerful

534
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,119
and carefree.

535
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,079
I hated you, too!

536
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,200
You had good grades and were smart.

537
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,480
You always did everything clearly.

538
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,399
My mom saw you as a role model.

539
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,839
She kept lecturing me.

540
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,920
You might mess things up a lot,

541
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,559
but everyone likes you.

542
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,039
You are always more popular than me.

543
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,679
Do you remember the one time

544
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,240
you surprisingly ranked
in the top ten of the whole class?

545
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
Everyone threw a big feast
to celebrate your success,

546
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,519
but no one remembered

547
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
I ranked first in class that time.

548
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,519
These few years,
we no longer kept in touch.

549
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,559
I became increasingly cowardly,

550
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,480
but I often think of you.

551
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,240
If I hadn't argued with you back then,

552
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,319
and if we hadn't fallen out,

553
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,799
would I be different now?

554
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,880
If someone wrongly accuses me,

555
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
and if you're around,

556
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
will I retaliate?

557
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,559
Later on, I slowly came to understand.

558
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
I really liked you back then.

559
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,960
Let me tell you a secret.

560
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,359
Those colleagues
who bullied you at the company,

561
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,240
I took revenge on them later.

562
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,399
Really?

563
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,559
Of course.

564
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,279
Who am I?

565
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,960
Huang Yingzi of Hangtian City,
a descendant of Wong Feihung.

566
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,799
Mingyu,

567
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,440
welcome back.

568
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,199
They should be done by now.

569
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,240
Wait a bit more.

570
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,599
They are still talking.

571
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,559
(Yifei.)

572
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,960
(Something big happened these few days.)

573
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,439
(I can't wait to tell you about it.)

574
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,319
(You would never have thought)

575
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,000
(that we would end up
at the police station again.)

576
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,440
(Can you imagine Zhuang Yuan and Mingyu)

577
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,599
(in a fight?)

578
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,720
(Jiang Yi and I
sustained injuries on our faces.)

579
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,319
(Mingyu)

580
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,440
(finally saw the true colors
of her hypocritical boyfriend.)

581
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,160
(He received
the deserved legal punishment.)

582
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,079
The interview you did with Ding Ye

583
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,039
was all over my social media today.

584
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,879
Have you read it?

585
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
It's not bad.

586
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,440
Why did you write a good article

587
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,159
for him,

588
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,320
while my "The Life of Jiang Yi"

589
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,800
turned out that way?

590
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,638
What way?

591
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,880
That way.

592
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,920
You wrote
about all my embarrassing stories.

593
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,639
Well, you kept causing trouble

594
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,920
when you were young.

595
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,800
What should I do?

596
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
I don't care.

597
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,559
Mine hasn't been updated for a while.

598
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,960
I want a new update.

599
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,039
Nonsense.

600
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,320
I don't have time to update for you.

601
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:34,920
Hey,

602
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,800
what kind of reporter

603
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,639
write stories halfway?

604
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,480
If you don't know how to write,

605
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,920
fine.

606
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,760
Let me teach you.

607
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,800
Add in the part about how we ended up

608
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,480
together.

609
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,719
I have something I want to add, too.

610
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,199
What is it?

611
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,480
For example, when you started
having feelings for me.

612
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,599
I don't remember that.

613
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,159
We used to be together every day.

614
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,280
That's really important.

615
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
How could you not remember it?

616
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,199
Stop dwelling on the past.

617
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,559
We're together now, right?

618
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,159
By the way,

619
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,960
I need to go to the bookstore later

620
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
to prepare for Ding Ye's reading.

621
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,519
Why would you need
to prepare for his reading?

622
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,400
Actually, it's me

623
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,840
who wants to hold this reading for him.

624
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,159
I want to thank him
for accepting my interview.

625
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,480
Besides,

626
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,880
it has been years since
he published his last book, right?

627
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,239
He isn't in a good condition.

628
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,159
His health...

629
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,000
His health is also suffering.

630
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,639
I want him to know

631
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,880
that his books

632
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,679
have moved a lot of people.

633
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That would bring him some comfort.

634
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,440
Go ahead.

635
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
After this,

636
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,400
should we go on a vacation?

637
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,719
(Hello.)

638
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,199
(What are you doing?)

639
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,480
(Are you busy?)

640
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
(Why are you not replying to my texts?)

641
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,400
Boss,

642
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,599
I've prepared the posters.

643
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,639
Please prepare more tables

644
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,920
and chairs for me during the event.

645
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,880
No problem.

646
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,280
But this guy likes to be alone.

647
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
Are you sure

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,480
he's willing to attend
this kind of event?

649
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Anyway, I've sent him the invitation.

650
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,559
I'm not sure

651
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,559
whether he'll come.

652
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,280
If the author

653
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,679
doesn't come to his own reading,

654
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,679
it's a bit lacking, isn't it?

655
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,679
No matter what,

656
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,840
I must hold

657
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,400
this reading.

658
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,280
Yi,

659
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,320
have some coffee.

660
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,559
Thanks.

661
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,280
You're welcome.

662
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,559
Yi,

663
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,880
I...

664
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,039
I want to apply for a team transfer.

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
What happened?

666
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,519
During this period,

667
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,678
I learned a lot

668
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:49,239
from you.

669
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,039
Thank you for that.

670
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,880
But

671
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,679
you know

672
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,599
the development period for this game

673
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,480
will take several years.

674
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,000
I really hope

675
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,639
the first game I'm involved in

676
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,599
can get released.

677
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,159
What do you mean?

678
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,880
Recently,

679
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,039
I've heard some rumors about you.

680
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:13,840
Well...

681
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,760
Get back to work.

682
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,199
Okay.

683
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:21,920
Goodbye.

684
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,599
What did you tell them?

685
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
You should ask yourself.

686
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,119
What are you hiding?

687
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,800
Joining a new company

688
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,920
doesn't automatically erase
your past stains.

689
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,119
I think

690
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,960
no one will want to develop a game

691
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,880
with someone who plagiarized.

692
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,159
I've never plagiarized.

693
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,199
The truth will come to light one day.

694
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,559
Everyone knows about

695
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,239
"Sky Adventure."

696
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,280
"Sky City" is a game
I developed independently,

697
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,480
and "Sky Adventure" was created

698
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,840
by drawing inspiration from my game.

699
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,679
Why would a big game company

700
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,440
plagiarize a small game

701
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,840
from an unknown developer

702
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,599
like you?

703
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:26,000
Is the credit cookie
you've been keeping secret

704
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,280
related to the part
you allegedly plagiarized?

705
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
Stop slandering me.

706
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,800
We both work for the same company.

707
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,119
Why are you keeping it a secret?

708
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,599
When the time comes,

709
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,519
I'll naturally show the company.

710
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Okay.

711
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,519
I can't wait for that.

712
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,280
Hello, everyone.

713
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm the organizer of Ding Ye's reading.

714
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,519
Ever since Ding Ye
published his first novel,

715
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,399
I've fallen in love with his carefree

716
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,039
and imaginative stories.

717
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,400
I believe everyone here

718
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,519
shares my sentiments.

719
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,880
Perhaps Ding Ye

720
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
won't show up here,

721
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,639
just like in the previous events.

722
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,239
But I believe everyone

723
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,039
has gotten used to it.

724
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,039
Regardless of whether he'll leave
the literary world in the future,

725
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,039
the strength he has given us

726
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,440
is undeniably real.

727
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,760
We'll always be with him.

728
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,440
We are gathered here today

729
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,559
not only to reminisce

730
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,960
on Ding Ye's literary work

731
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,159
but also to reminisce on our youth.

732
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,079
Let's not waste time.

733
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,719
We shall begin now.

734
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,639
I...

735
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,880
The first time I read Ding Ye's novel,

736
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,039
I was in primary school.

737
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,159
The book I read was

738
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,840
"The Man Who Dreams of Whales."

739
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,639
I was captivated by the mystical world

740
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,800
in his book.

741
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,280
He described

742
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,679
another kind of imaginative space,

743
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,119
something I've never seen before.

744
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,679
Back then, I just started
attending middle school.

745
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,119
I was really rebellious.

746
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,920
It wasn't until I read his novel

747
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,199
that I realized

748
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,198
many people
had the same experience as I did.

749
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,639
I wasn't alone.

750
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,039
(Hello.)

751
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,599
(The phone has been switched off.)

752
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
My dad had just passed away.

753
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,599
Back then,

754
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,320
I muddled along every day

755
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,719
until I read "The Maze."

756
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,400
It brought me a lot of comfort.

757
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,639
Especially its depiction of loss,

758
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,320
which resonated deeply with me.

759
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,559
Gradually,

760
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:32,119
I found the exit to the maze.

761
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,159
All this time,

762
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,199
I've been grateful to Ding Ye.

763
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,440
Thank you.

764
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,599
Thank you for sharing your stories.

765
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,920
Actually, during my high school days,

766
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,679
I had a slump, just like you.

767
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,800
I got through that time
by reading his books.

768
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,159
Ding Ye's books are like a link.

769
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
The strength we got from him

770
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,800
will surely be conveyed back to him.

771
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,719
Turn back

772
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,400
and see who's here.

773
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,599
You've disappeared for so long.

774
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,639
Where did you go?

775
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,158
Isn't it normal for authors
to disappear sometimes?

776
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,800
Did you read the interview?

777
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,880
No.

778
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:38,880
You...

779
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,960
How is your health?

780
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,119
Not bad.

781
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,439
I can eat and sleep.

782
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,280
Do you feel unwell

783
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,039
or uncomfortable anywhere?

784
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:51,079
Have you been thinking that I
am suffering from a terminal illness?

785
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,638
Isn't that the case?

786
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,719
Have you seen
a terminal illness patient like me?

787
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Wait.

788
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,360
Then what's the story
behind your bucket list?

789
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,239
I was joking.

790
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,239
I had no idea you'd take it seriously

791
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,639
and do many foolish things with me.

792
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,599
You...

793
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,440
You're so strange!

794
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:13,880
Then

795
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,400
why would you write a bucket list
for no reason?

796
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,559
Are you crazy?

797
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,599
Every person is destined

798
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,679
for an ending
from the moment they are born.

799
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:27,238
Death.

800
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,519
That's why everyone needs a list.

801
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,000
Have you ever thought
about where you might die?

802
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
Why would I think about that?

803
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,599
No.

804
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
Why did you ask that question?

805
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,480
Nothing.

806
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,440
I was just curious.
