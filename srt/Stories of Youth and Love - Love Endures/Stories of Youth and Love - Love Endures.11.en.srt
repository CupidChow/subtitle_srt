[Episode 11]

3
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,950
Hello.

4
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,790
Is this Huang?

5
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,710
Yes, it is me.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Something happened in the factory.

7
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,000
You guys should come here immediately.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Okay.

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
I'll be there right away.

10
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,870
What has happened?

11
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,480
Something happened at the factory.

12
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,640
They told us to head there now.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,230
Us?

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,150
What about the kids?

15
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,120
It is the safest for them to stay at home.

16
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,510
Children.

17
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,000
Come.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
Sit over here.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Yingzi.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,840
Sit like him.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,870
Listen to me.

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,920
We are going out now.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,680
You stay with them.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,180
Be good.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Yingzi.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,560
You are brave

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,640
and the host.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
You must take good care of them

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
until we get back.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,950
Can you do this?

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,070
Yes.

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,640
Excellent.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
- We are leaving now. - Hurry up .

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
There is a ghost in the room.

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,150
We saw it.

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
A ghost.

37
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,280
I want to go home.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,150
Don't be afraid.

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,560
My parents said

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,120
we wouldn't be scared if we stayed together.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Let's go.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,360
Is there a monster outside ?

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
There are more of us.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,590
No need to be afraid of it.

45
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,800
Will we starve to death

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,150
if the adults don't come back?

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,750
We won't.

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,520
Look.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,360
I have a cooker at home.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,120
We won't starve

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,240
with it .

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,190
Let's sing a song.

53
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,870
We won't be afraid if we sing.

54
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,470
♪Happy birthday to you♪

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:50,360
♪Happy birthday to you♪

56
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,280
Stop it, please.

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
I can't draw.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,750
Please continue.

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,920
Does this look like him?

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,630
No.

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,830
Perfect.

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
This should work.

63
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,190
I don't think so.

64
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,800
Come on.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,430
I'm not a magical painter.

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,750
You can't expect to see him in the flesh

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,310
through my drawing.

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,510
I understand.

69
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,560
But there is always hope.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,800
Please try again.

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you sure

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,390
Yifei still wants to see Lan Bin now?

73
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,270
Yes, I am.

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,000
She insisted

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
that she didn't want to,

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
but deep inside her,

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,310
she must want us to find Lan Bin.

78
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,510
I ran into him near the food street last time.

79
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,120
We will go there later.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,070
Come on, draw it again.

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,310
We are going there afterward.

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,070
Please.

83
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,160
Fine.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,190
I will draw.

85
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,680
If Yifei knows

86
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
that we find her dad,

87
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,830
she will be very happy.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
I think you should use my phone number instead.

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,190
I don't want you to get conned.

90
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm not a young girl

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,120
or daft.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,190
Why would I get conned?

93
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,269
You are busy with your work.

94
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,949
You won't have time to handle this.

95
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,000
It is better to use my number.

96
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,270
Let's go.

97
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,160
My mom called me.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,390
She mentioned you.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,430
She said you have been working hard.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
She asked you to take care of yourself.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
What else did she say?

102
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
She said you already have a girlfriend

103
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,870
and asked me to find one.

104
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,480
You're really something else.

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
You lied to my mom that Zendaya was your girlfriend.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,510
Zendaya is Spider-Man's girlfriend.

107
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,750
What has she got to do with you?

108
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
You cooked up scandals with her.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,560
She might sue you for defamation.

110
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,190
I see.

111
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,430
Zhuang Yuan couldn't keep secret.

112
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,630
He told you everything.

113
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Did you explain it to your mom?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,190
Explain what?

115
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,270
I know nothing about your love life.

116
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,000
All I know is Zendaya.

117
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,160
I have no idea

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,920
about the Fish-and-Chips thing.

119
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,870
You mean Chloe?

120
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,600
You are the one to talk.

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't know about your love life either.

122
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,270
What do you mean?

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Ding Ye.

124
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,160
You want to know about the result of the bet?

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
How did it go?

126
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,870
You are losing.

127
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,510
You become friends?

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Not yet.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
But we will.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
How do you feel

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,680
about Chloe?

132
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,920
We are friends,

133
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,360
but just friends.

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,120
Bye.

135
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,430
Young man.

136
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,830
Are you interested?

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
In what?

138
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,270
My daughter.

139
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
She graduated from an overseas university.

140
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,630
She is beautiful.

141
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Here are some photos.

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,740
Have a look.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
She is quite pretty.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
Of course.

145
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,720
Young man.

146
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,600
You look handsome too.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,830
Do you have a house?

148
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,190
No.

149
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,270
No?

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Forget it.

151
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,510
Forget it?

152
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,920
How can you date a girl

153
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,190
when you don't have a house?

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,070
Missus.

155
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,240
Do you have a son or...

156
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,870
Are you here to look for a date?

157
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,120
Am I not allowed to do so?

158
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,750
What kind of woman do you look into?

159
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
Pretty.

160
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,510
Sexy .

161
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,310
Rich.

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,830
Only these?

163
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,160
She must know about love.

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
The first three requirements are

165
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
easy to meet.

166
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
But

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
you won't find love in this place.

168
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
If there is no love here,

169
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,870
I will create one.

170
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,440
"I recollect

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
that wondrous meeting ,

172
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,270
that instant I encountered you,

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,550
when like an apparition fleeting,

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
like beauty's spirit, past you flew.

175
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,910
Long since, when hopeless grief

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,510
distressed me,

177
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,150
when noise

178
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,750
and turmoil vexed,

179
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,670
it seemed your voice

180
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,240
still tenderly caressed me,

181
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,790
your dear face sought me

182
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,390
as I dreamed."

183
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,600
Tell everyone

184
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,120
the title of this poem.

185
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,200
It is Pushkin's

186
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,670
"To Kern".

187
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,000
Pushkin.

188
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,630
"To Kern".

189
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,120
It is your turn.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,910
Finish the poem.

191
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, I don't think so.

192
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,840
Do it if you want to interview me.

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,030
Can I stand here and read?

194
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,670
No.

195
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,910
I'm sorry about this.

196
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
"Year passed;

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
their stormy gusts

198
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
confounded and swept away old dreams apace.

199
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,960
I had forgotten

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,630
how you sounded,

201
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,150
forgot the heaven of your face.

202
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,550
In exiled gloom

203
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,670
and isolation

204
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,480
my quiet days meandered on,

205
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,720
the thrill of awe

206
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,390
and inspiration

207
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,120
and tears,

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,960
and life,

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,320
and love, were gone."

210
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,670
"My soul awoke from inanition,

211
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,630
And I

212
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,000
encountered you

213
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,870
anew."

214
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,840
"And like a fleeting apparition ,

215
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,240
like beauty's spirit, past you flew.

216
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
My pulses

217
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,030
bound in exultation,

218
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
and in my heart once more unfold

219
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,270
the sense of awe

220
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,670
and inspiration,

221
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,000
the life,

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
the tears,

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,910
the love of old."

224
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,240
Was it fun?

225
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,440
Not really.

226
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
But it was crazy.

227
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,080
Did you read about this poem before?

228
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,120
I came across it

229
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
during my high school days.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,750
I remember I cooped myself up for some time

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
after reading it.

232
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
I was on the verge of crying, but tears wouldn't come.

233
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,840
Do you know what love is?

234
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,480
Pushkin wrote this to Kern.

235
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,750
To whom did you read it?

236
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,790
How much is this?

237
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,910
Ten yuan.

238
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,630
Okay.

239
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,670
There is no need for that.

240
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,670
I can pay for myself.

241
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,750
A reward for reading the poem aloud just now.

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Thank you for delivering love

243
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,750
to those who no longer believe in love.

244
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,440
Thanks.

245
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,200
I will name it Crimson Saber.

246
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,440
Crimson Saber?

247
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,750
(Yeah.)

248
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,120
(Back in my high school days,)

249
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,200
(I made a funny bet with my friends .)

250
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,960
Crimson Saber

251
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
is undoubtedly the winner.

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,630
Concede your defeat.

253
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,390
Come on. Give me the money.

254
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,480
Give it to me.

255
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,390
This is not fair.

256
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,150
Your cactus

257
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,960
can live the longest.

258
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Why is this unfair?

259
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,320
You don't want to accept your defeat.

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,550
Don't you have the great spirit of a hero?

261
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,320
You are cheating.

262
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,030
Don't put that blame on me.

263
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,510
I know the name of my plant

264
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,750
sounds more daunting than yours.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm using the money

266
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,030
to buy snacks for us.

267
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,270
Have you read Jin Yong's novels before?

268
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,080
Crimson Saber

269
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
doesn't exist

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,030
in his book.

271
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,910
I know.

272
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,080
Where is your money?

273
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,030
I don't have a small change.

274
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,240
Buy yourself a drink.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,910
I have a small change.

276
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,080
I will pay for him.

277
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,910
Keep the change.

278
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,840
No.

279
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,630
This is enough.

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,440
The monthly exam is on next Monday.

281
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,790
I hope students who can't memorize

282
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,150
a tad bit of "A Happy Excursion"

283
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,030
work harder this weekend.

284
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,790
At least you prepare for it.

285
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,120
Jiang Yi.

286
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,000
Jiang Yi.

287
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,550
Recite "A Happy Excursion".

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,670
Come on.

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Stand up.

290
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
There is a fish in the northern sea.

291
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,150
There is a fish in the northern sea

292
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,870
named Kun.

293
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Kun is gigantic.

294
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,440
What?

295
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
Kun is gigantic.

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,000
What was that?

297
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,120
Kun is gigantic.

298
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,270
Kun is really big.

299
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,870
Seriously?

300
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,910
The national college entrance exam is coming.

301
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
Get your grip, will you?

302
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,150
Sit down.

303
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,910
Thanks a bunch.

304
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,910
During the Shang and Zhou Dynasties,

305
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,270
bronze casting art

306
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,600
attained an exceptional level.

307
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,390
Until the Han Dynasty...

308
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,240
You aren't focusing.

309
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,910
Why are you staring at it?

310
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,390
Mingyu.

311
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,870
How long do you think

312
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,240
Crimson Saber can last?

313
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,550
This is just an ordinary ball cactus.

314
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,440
You can't expect it to live forever.

315
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,030
It isn't an ordinary ball cactus.

316
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,480
This is my lucky charm.

317
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,440
I used it to make money.

318
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,840
But you named it Crimson Saber,

319
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,240
which sounds rather ominous.

320
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,790
What are you going to do tonight?

321
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,910
What was that?

322
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,960
Huang Yingzi.

323
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,550
Yes!

324
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,270
Stand up!

325
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,670
Switch seats

326
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,200
with He Mengni.

327
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,600
Why?

328
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,510
In the last test,

329
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,240
Fang Mingyu's ranking

330
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,870
dropped by four places.

331
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
But why should I switch seats?

332
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,440
Because you

333
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
slowed her down.

334
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,960
Mr. Hu.

335
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,790
Actually, this time...

336
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,720
No excuse.

337
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,960
The exam matters more than friendship.

338
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,480
Maybe the three students in front of her

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,720
suddenly excelled this time.

340
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,790
Say another word

341
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,030
and I will kick you out

342
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,550
of this class!

343
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,670
What are you waiting for ?

344
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,600
Should I prepare a sedan chair to carry you there?

345
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,030
I wouldn't ask for that.

346
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,150
Right now!

347
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,360
Move!

348
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,200
Yes.

349
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,150
Bye.

350
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,510
Crimson Saber.

351
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,360
We are moving.

352
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,630
Yi.

353
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,670
Yi.

354
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,720
What is the matter?

355
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,270
They are DC's designs, aren't they?

356
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,510
Pretty good.

357
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
Do you like them?

358
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,600
What do you want?

359
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,960
We really admire

360
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,870
your Shadowmourne.

361
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,550
You want to trade these two for Shadowmourne?

362
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,030
In your dreams.

363
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,030
And the Pendulum of Doom.

364
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,630
Yes.

365
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,550
Pendulum of Doom.

366
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,320
All right.

367
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,200
But I have one condition.

368
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,510
I want to swap seats with you.

369
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,000
Yingzi.

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,350
Are you participating in the coming essay competition?

371
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,790
You might lose your chance

372
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,640
if I join it.

373
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,590
Are you not participating it?

374
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,070
Of course, I'm participating it.

375
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,750
Huang Yingzi.

376
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,030
Where did you put "Crimson Saber"?

377
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,880
In my drawer.

378
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll pass it to you later.

379
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,510
Sure thing.

380
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,480
Let's go for a movie this weekend.

381
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,750
We are in our senior year now.

382
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,070
Are you not preparing for the entrance exam?

383
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,720
I feel

384
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,830
that we haven't talked in a while

385
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,160
after changing seats.

386
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,030
It has been a long time

387
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,440
since we hung out together.

388
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm going to get the novel now.

389
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,740
Where is Huang Yingzi?

390
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,720
Why?

391
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,000
Nothing big.

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,880
My bike broke down.

393
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,440
I want to walk home with her after school.

394
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,550
I will tell her.

395
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,590
Are you going to keep avoiding Jiang Yi?

396
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,070
I'm not avoiding him.

397
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:32,269
Eat this.

398
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,350
You make me feel like you sympathize with me .

399
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,680
What makes you say so?

400
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,550
We have always shared food together

401
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,640
since we were little.

402
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,750
You know it is not about that.

403
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,160
It makes no difference, though.

404
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,310
I already knew the answer

405
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,920
after trying my luck.

406
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,830
Did you misunderstand something?

407
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,880
I'm not Jiang Yi's crush.

408
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,790
Not you?

409
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,750
Who does he like?

410
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
Anyway, I won't give up so easily.

411
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,270
Who does he like, then?

412
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,440
Crimson Saber.

413
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
You are back.

414
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,000
Catch this.

415
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,590
Jiang Yi.

416
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,270
Chloe.

417
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,240
Nice throw.

418
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,250
Really?

419
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,880
Yeah.

420
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,030
Chloe.

421
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,790
Was it really the first game for you both?

422
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,240
Yes.

423
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,110
Our first game together.

424
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,590
You two made a perfect team.

425
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,270
All right, I'm off.

426
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,920
Bye-bye.

427
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,480
Thank you.

428
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,160
Did Ting and Bunnie

429
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,510
invite you for a drink?

430
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,830
I turned it down.

431
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,590
Why?

432
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,350
I don't want to drink.

433
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,000
They are quite popular in the office.

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,720
Many guys want to hang out with them.

435
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,790
Is it?

436
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,480
I suppose they don't need me .

437
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,200
So you are free now.

438
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,720
Will you turn me down

439
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,320
if I invite you?

440
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,680
Why?

441
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,070
You want to invite me for a drink?

442
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
I would like to take a look at the game you designed before.

443
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,830
Maybe I might come up with some ideas .

444
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,680
Sure.

445
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,960
I will go home

446
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
and fetch the hard disk for you.

447
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,830
I can go to your place.

448
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,030
It is convenient.

449
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,680
Well...

450
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,270
My house is kind of messy.

451
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm not going there for a house tour.

452
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,070
Come on .

453
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,310
Hurry up.

454
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,880
Your house is pretty tidy.

455
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,510
Yeah, I guess.

456
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,480
This is the complete part

457
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,880
of "Floating City".

458
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,400
This is the ideal rendering.

459
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,510
Did you make these scenes yourself?

460
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,880
Ordinary devices wouldn't be able

461
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,550
to achieve the level of your ideal rendering.

462
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,350
That's why I chose ATG.

463
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,510
By the look of it,

464
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,440
joining Zhao Yuan's team

465
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,110
is a waste of your talent.

466
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,240
Have you thought about

467
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,440
leading your own team?

468
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,830
Zhao Yuan doesn't want me to stay, right?

469
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,000
The newcomer Jiang Yi is indeed skillful.

470
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,110
However, he seems to have a hard time fitting himself into the teamwork.

471
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't geniuses like to be alone?

472
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
But since he has joined the company,

473
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,350
he should have learned

474
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,350
what teamwork is by now.

475
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,680
All right.

476
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,070
I have reminded him.

477
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,200
Are you joining

478
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,350
the gathering next time?

479
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,350
I will also invite him.

480
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm not going.

481
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,310
I have to work on the test version

482
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,720
as soon as possible.

483
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,510
By the way, Chloe,

484
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,680
I have a request .

485
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,830
Go on.

486
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,510
After the test version is completed,

487
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,440
I hope you can transfer Jiang Yi to another team.

488
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,440
I thought they would want you

489
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,590
for your skill.

490
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,030
Unexpectedly,

491
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,960
Zhao Yuan feels threatened instead.

492
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,830
Do you think

493
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,270
I should stay low key?

494
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,310
You said this

495
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,350
in the previous company.

496
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,510
Did I?

497
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,310
Yeah.

498
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,480
You said it to the fierce director

499
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,750
who always chewed people out.

500
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
But I think

501
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,000
you don't have to do that.

502
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,880
Let your talent shine.

503
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,480
Let him be.

504
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,720
But the one who makes the decision

505
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,070
is me.

506
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,750
Thank you.

507
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,030
Do you have any idea?

508
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,160
I will be frank with you.

509
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,960
Your game is delicate.

510
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,310
But it is also like you,

511
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,830
too self-involved.

512
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,680
Have you thought of

513
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,960
giving it a commercial packaging?

514
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,960
If it can make profits,

515
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,440
the company has no reason to reject you.

516
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,790
Are you suggesting

517
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,510
that I put my game

518
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,510
into someone's packaging?

519
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,790
Maybe the packaging matches well with you.

520
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,960
Forget it.

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,830
The boss recommended a novel to me.

522
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,790
He said it was suitable for sandbox games.

523
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,680
I have been thinking about

524
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,240
how to operate this project.

525
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,350
Until I see your game,

526
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,240
I have an idea.

527
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,310
What novel is that?

528
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,830
"The Maze" by Ding Ye.

529
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
This one?

530
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,790
I just finished reading it.

531
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,830
It truly blows my mind.

532
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,640
It has been years

533
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,550
since I read a great story like this.

534
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,830
It is a shame

535
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,160
this author hasn't written anything

536
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,310
for over a decade.

537
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,680
I was surprised that you knew him

538
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,030
and had a collection of his books.

539
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,350
(Does it remind you of something?)

540
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,550
(A tenacious life?)

541
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,590
(Try again.)

542
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,750
Jiang Yi.

543
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,680
Has it occurred to you

544
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,270
that maybe Ding Ye's "The Maze"

545
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,480
could be the commercial packaging for your game?

546
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,510
Truth be told,

547
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,720
I don't get

548
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,960
what is so great about his books.

549
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,110
You bought a collection of them.

550
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,400
Well...

551
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,720
May I look around here?

552
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,110
My place is just this big.

553
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,350
Do as you like.

554
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,830
Why?

555
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,920
Nothing.

556
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm just wondering

557
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,240
what would have happened

558
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,510
if I had met you then.

559
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,400
It is getting late now.

560
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,310
We haven't rested by this hour.

561
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,750
Yeah.

562
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,400
How about this?

563
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,750
I will send you...

564
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm hungry.

565
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,070
Is there any food here?

566
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,590
Do you usually eat this?

567
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,310
This is my favorite dish back then.

568
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,790
But no one cooked it for me.

569
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,030
So I switch to its substitute.

570
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,000
This isn't a balanced diet, right?

571
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Fish is an excellent protein source.

572
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,240
It is quite nutritious.

573
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,720
(Are you asleep?)

574
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,030
(You really don't remember this?)

575
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
(Digimon?)

576
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
Sorry.

577
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,270
It is fine.

578
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,590
Try to think about it

579
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,640
harder.

580
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,720
Is it Huang Yingzi?

581
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,480
Hello.

582
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,270
I'm Chloe.

583
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,510
We met before.

584
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,440
Hello.

585
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,200
Uh... Sorry.

586
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,160
I... I didn't know you were still in a meeting.

587
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,680
Don't be.

588
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,720
We have finished the meeting.

589
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,750
We are having a supper.

590
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,750
Really?

591
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,510
Where are you?

592
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
At Jiang Yi's place.

593
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,110
I haven't been there yet.

594
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,720
His place is quite tidy.

595
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,350
It is better than

596
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,000
80 percent of guys' place.

597
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,070
Huang Yingzi.

598
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,640
Do you have a cold?

599
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
I'm fine.

600
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,160
I'll leave you guys to it.

601
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm hanging up.

602
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,960
Bye-bye.

603
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,640
Hey, don't.

604
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,640
Is Jiang Yi not in his right mind?

605
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,310
He traded Shadowmourne to Ren Kaiji

606
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,830
just for his seat?

607
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,110
You know nothing at all.

608
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,960
Do you know

609
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,240
who he sits closest to

610
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,680
after changing seats?

611
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,830
I wouldn't know that.

612
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,030
Well,

613
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,110
who is the prettiest girl in his class?

614
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,350
The prettiest girl in his class?

615
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,510
I didn't know

616
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,830
Jiang is a love-struck boy.

617
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
Of course.

618
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,790
Did you misunderstand something?

619
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,510
I'm not Jiang Yi's crush.

620
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,350
Not you?

621
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,160
Who does he like?

622
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
Who does he like?

623
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,240
Huang Yingzi!

624
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,750
Sorry, sir.

625
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,550
What is wrong with you?

626
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,750
Watch where you are going.

627
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,000
Why is she still running?

628
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,310
Hey.

629
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,480
Do you want to continue?

630
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,310
If you keep running,

631
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,590
your lungs will explode.

632
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,640
Let them explode.

633
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,920
Why don't you

634
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,590
use another way?

635
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,640
♪Losing you pains me more than losing my pride♪

636
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,240
♪I miss it when we talk about everything♪

637
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,510
♪I miss it when I can't hold myself back from loving you♪

638
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,550
♪After we fight♪

639
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,480
♪I remember that birthday♪

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,110
♪That song♪

641
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,200
♪ That starry sky♪

642
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,110
♪The right hand that held me tightly♪

643
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,960
♪The warm chest♪

644
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,790
♪But who still remembers them?♪

645
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,960
Can you stop already?

646
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,830
It is the twelfth time.

647
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,790
I asked you here to explode your lungs,

648
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,110
not my eardrums.

649
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,640
You know nothing!

650
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,240
♪I want to know why♪

651
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,590

This tastes quite good.

655
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,440
If possible,

656
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,830
I can learn and cook it for you.

657
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
The taste is different

658
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,160
when the people who cook it are different.

659
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,830
So what?

660
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,070
Back in my school days,

661
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,680
I loved the sandwiches from one particular shop.

662
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,350
But it closed down one day.

663
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,350
I was forced to look for a new breakfast place.

664
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,880
And I realized I had missed out on other delicious food.

665
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,880
Forget it.

666
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,790
My taste is simple.

667
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,590
If you worry about her,

668
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,160
give her a call.

669
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,790
I'm leaving.

670
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,510
Sorry for ruining your mood.

671
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,270
I will send you off.

672
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,400
No need.

673
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,880
Actually, I envy your childhood friend.

674
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,680
She has a good friend like you.

675
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,350
Consider the new team again.

676
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,270
Let me know

677
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,160
if you need help.

678
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,550
Thank you.

679
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
See you tomorrow.

680
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,360
70 percent of Darjeeling tea.

681
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,800
Good.

682
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,960
And 30 percent of Brandy.

683
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,400
She can't hold her liquor.

684
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,480
Five percent should be enough.

685
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,000
What brings you here?

686
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,670
Weren't you having supper with Chloe?

687
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,800
Why did you come here?

688
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,380
Sit.

689
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,710
What is this?

690
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,880
A secret remedy for cold.

691
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,190
Did you come all the way here

692
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,030
because of my cold?

693
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,630
Stop asking .

694
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,360
Drink it while it is hot.

695
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,030
Finished.

696
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,920
But

697
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,320
I don't have a cold.

698
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,840
It is rhinitis.

699
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,960
This is a remedy, you know?

700
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
Why did you drink it

701
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,360
when you know it isn't for your condition?

702
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,510
Does your rhinitis affect your brain?

703
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,870
But it is tasty.

704
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,190
Where did you learn this remedy?

705
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,030
My friend taught me

706
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,230
when I was in the UK.

707
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,510
Was it Chloe?

708
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,480
What has this got to do with her?

709
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,230
She is the only friend you have in the UK

710
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,590
that I know of.

711
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,150
Well,

712
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,030
you are sick now.

713
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,880
Don't ask about unrelated people.

714
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,110
Just now,

715
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,880
you were at home.

716
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,590
How did you arrive here so quickly?

717
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,190
I had something to attend to,

718
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,400
so I popped in here on the way.

719
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,710
You seem well, though.

720
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,190
I should get going.

721
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,510
You leave your bottle here.

722
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,150
This little whale is quite cute.

723
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,070
Do you like it?

724
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,110
Take it if you want.

725
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,440
I would feel bad

726
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,590
if I took both the remedy you prepared

727
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,630
and your bottle.

728
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,550
If so,

729
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,630
give me Crimson Saber

730
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,230
in return.

731
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,590
Well, well, Jiang Yi.

732
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,190
You remember everything.

733
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,510
Bye.

734
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,920
What has happened to Huang Yingzi?

735
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,360
She's feeling dejected.

736
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,280
Why?

737
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,440
Because of you

738
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,920
and Jiang Yi.

739
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,670
Jiang Yi and me ?

740
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,030
How could that be possible?

741
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,960
Don't you know

742
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,400
Jiang Yi traded an expensive gaming item

743
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,480
for Ren Kaiji's seat?

744
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,110
I know.

745
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,550
Isn't it because of you?

746
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,320
Hey.

747
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,110
Stop stretching your arms.

748
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,760
You are turning into a gibbon.

749
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,280
Come with me.

750
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm taking you to somewhere.

751
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,630
Come on.

752
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,630
Jiang Yi exchanged this seat

753
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,550
with Shadowmourne.

754
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,800
I know.

755
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
This is my seat.

756
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
I know.

757
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,920
Move forward.

758
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,230
Turn to the right.

759
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,760
Slightly to the left.

760
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
What can you see ?

761
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,360
Good day, Mr. Hu!

762
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,880
What happened?

763
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,480
Did you get first place in class?

764
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,000
It is way better than that.

765
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,010
She is insane.

766
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,760
She really is.

767
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,840
(What is the recipe for the remedy?)

768
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,550
(Can I casually drink it ?)

769
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,760
(70 percent of Darjeeling Tea)

770
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,800
(and 30 percent of hot brandy.)

771
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,960
(Do you want more?)

772
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,110
(I can make it for you.)

773
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,320
(Sure.)

774
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,480
57.

775
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,440
58.

776
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
59.

777
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,960
60.

778
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,280
How did you get here so fast?

779
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,670
Is it?

780
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,630
25 minutes. Just nice.

781
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,400
Did you even time it?

782
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,480
Cut it out.

783
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,840
I will boil the water.

784
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,070
Thank you for the trouble.

785
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,280
If you know so,

786
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,510
why did you call me here?

787
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,280
Thanks.

788
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,760
Did you not sleep well?

789
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,030
I just realized

790
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,590
you had dark circles under your eyes.

791
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,960
I stayed up all night

792
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,230
to work on my game.

793
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,510
You work so hard.

794
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,030
This is unlike you.

795
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,320
I have to work harder.

796
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,590
I'm going to lose my bet.

797
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,320
I can't let that happen.

798
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,400
I might not win, either.

799
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,550
That guy

800
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,710
is getting weirder.

801
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,230
How so?

802
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,190
Is he a freak?

803
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
I wouldn't go that far.

804
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,880
He's kind of insane.

805
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Typical.
