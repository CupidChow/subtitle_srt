00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,500
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,230
(Hi, Stefanie.)

4
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,640
(This is a story
of an old fan of yours.)

5
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,790
(My childhood friend)

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,480
(has been your fan since you debuted.)

7
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,120
(She would buy every album of yours.)

8
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,510
(She knows how to sing
every song of yours.)

9
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,590
(She even knows)

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
(every lyric by heart.)

11
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,280
(Thus,)

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
(my entire youth)

13
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,070
(is filled with memories
related to you.)

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,310
(In 2008,)

15
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,030
(I went to your concert with her,)

16
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,430
(but due to my mistake,)

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,680
(we couldn't get in.)

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,630
(I made a wish)

19
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,560
(at that moment.)

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,310
(I have to go to your concert with her.)

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,680
Hello.

22
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,430
Hello.

23
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm Sun Stefanie's manager.

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,870
It's about your article online.

25
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,470
Who are you?

26
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,560
Hi, Mr. Jiang.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,710
Stefanie and I

28
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,280
have read your Weibo post.

29
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,120
Stefanie asked me

30
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,520
to give you her best wishes.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,360
She hopes you will
have a perfect ending.

32
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,560
Thank you.

33
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,240
Yifei is gone.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,080
Grandma is also gone.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,750
We're also leaving Hangtian City.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,310
I've made up my mind.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm not going back to Jiangzhou.

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
Our lives are our own.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,310
I'm going to live life the way I want.

40
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,710
At thirty,

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,680
our lives are just beginning!

42
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,310
What about you guys?

43
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,000
Is there anything you want to do

44
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,430
but you haven't done yet?

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to be happy

46
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,240
and give myself a nice answer right now.

47
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,520
What about you, Jiang?

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Me?

49
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,190
It's a secret.

50
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,680
Why are you keeping it a secret?

51
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,150
We told you ours,

52
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,190
and you are keeping yours a secret.

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,960
That's his style.

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
He must be sure that he can wow everyone

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,680
when he's done what he wants to do.

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,630
Tell us about what you want to do.

57
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,560
Me?

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm the same as before.

59
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,560
My goal has always been the same.

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,040
I want to be a great journalist,

61
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,680
to find the truth,

62
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,630
and to put the bad guys in their place.

63
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,720
But I think something has changed.

64
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,830
Someone asked me

65
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,630
if I became a journalist for Yifei

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
or for myself,

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
and I couldn't answer.

68
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,720
It was more or less for Yifei,

69
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
but from now on,

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll continue

71
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
to work hard for myself.

72
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,920
Chief Editor.

73
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,600
How's your vacation going?

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,310
I can go back to work next week.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm afraid you can't come back.

76
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,720
What does that mean?

77
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,360
I did apply for annual leave.

78
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,390
It's not that the company
doesn't want you.

79
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,680
There's a new place.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know if you're interested.

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,000
BeijingTimes invited me back
to Beijing as chief editor.

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,390
I can take someone with me.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I was hoping it would be you.

84
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,920
Chief Editor, you're saying

85
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,720
that I can join BeijingTimes again?

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,750
Beijing is,

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
after all, the most developed place
in the media industry.

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,120
There will offer you more opportunities
than Jiangzhou in the future.

89
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,040
So you're the first person I thought of.

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,070
But Chief Editor,

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,630
I have friends and family

92
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,870
in Jiangzhou.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,190
And I'm kind of adapting
to my life here.

94
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,950
I'm a little...

95
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,070
Huang Yingzi,

96
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,630
you were kicked out of headquarters
in the first place

97
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,240
because you offended someone

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,630
by reporting the truth.

99
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,950
Haven't you been

100
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,040
wanting to go back?

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,830
Well, now's your chance.

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,310
If you hesitate, it's gone.

103
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,870
Wait for me.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,750
I can't do it anymore.

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,750
I have to stop.

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Don't sit down.

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,430
Stretch.

108
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,430
Give me a hand.

109
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,800
Look, my hand is getting sore.

110
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,240
Have you decided

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,630
when you are going to the farm?

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
I'm planning to go this weekend.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,750
You're welcome to come visit anytime

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
once I get settled.

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,390
You promised me that.

116
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,160
But haven't I

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,000
been talking about
going on trips before?

118
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,510
I couldn't go last time
because of Yingzi's birthday,

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
so I need to plan

120
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,480
and schedule something.

121
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,870
So, have you figured out
where you're going?

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Why should I tell you?

123
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,870
We know each other so well now.

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,190
Why can't you tell me?

125
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,390
Are you thinking of coming with me?

126
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,870
Yes.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
Actually, I'd love to go on a trip too.

128
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,160
It's always the six of us
hanging out together.

129
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
When can the two of us go out alone

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,920
and meet each other again
in a new place?

131
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,240
We will meet each other again.

132
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,320
We haven't gotten separated
for 12 years.

133
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,790
No matter where we go,

134
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,240
we'll always find each other again.

135
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,080
Yes.

136
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,270
This is a new beginning.

137
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,030
You know what, let's race.

138
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,480
To under the bridge.

139
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,960
If you win,

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,390
I'll tell you where I'm going.

141
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,030
You want me to run again?

142
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,320
Do I look like Guan Chao to you?

143
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,270
Do you want to know
where I'm going or not?

144
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,870
I do.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Get ready.

146
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,870
Three!

147
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,870
Why are you cheating?

148
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,870
Yingzi!

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,630
You guys went jogging again.

150
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,670
Yours.

151
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,960
Yours.

152
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,670
It's still warm.

153
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,360
Actually, I've called you here

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
to tell you something.

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
What if I tell you

156
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,550
I might be leaving Jiangzhou too?

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,910
Where are you going?

158
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm going to Beijing for work.

159
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
Does Jiang know about this?

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
I haven't told him yet.

161
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,550
Things are starting
to go well for us now.

162
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
If I have to go to Beijing now,

163
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,870
I really can't bear to leave him.

164
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,550
Yingzi, in my opinion,

165
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,720
don't overthink it.

166
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Just follow your heart.

167
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
Talk to him.

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,750
There's nothing you can't handle.

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,510
It's been a long time.

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes, long time no see.

171
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,440
Have a seat.

172
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,870
You're fine now?

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,870
Yes, I am.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,910
That's good.

175
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,510
I haven't gotten the chance
to thank you.

176
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,750
Thank you for finding Lan Bin for me,

177
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,550
and helping me face Yifei's death.

178
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Why are you thanking me?

179
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
The person you should really thank

180
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,630
is Jiang Yi.

181
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,750
Are you writing a novel?

182
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,200
How's it going? Are you almost done?

183
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,960
No, not quite.

184
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,840
How are you?

185
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,030
There's a good chance
I'll be transferred to Beijing.

186
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,360
Isn't that a good thing?

187
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,320
Go back to where you were
and start over.

188
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,390
I came here to say goodbye to you.

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,240
Although we must part ways,

190
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
it's been great knowing you.

191
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,080
All the best.

192
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,720
It's been great knowing you.

193
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,510
All the best.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
I also brought you a gift.

195
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,840
Here's a picture

196
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,720
of the sea sparkle I took.

197
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,080
I think it's perfect for you.

198
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,910
You can have it.

199
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,600
It's beautiful.

200
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,030
Thank you.

201
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm leaving now.

202
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,750
Good luck,

203
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,720
great writer.

204
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm looking forward to your new work.

205
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,390
Huang Yingzi.

206
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,320
I'll send it to you immediately
once I've finished writing it.

207
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,790
Sure, I'll be waiting.

208
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,440
Bye-bye!

209
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm off!

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,790
I've been looking for you.

211
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,720
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,790
Come on.

213
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,910
Check this out.

214
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
What is this?

215
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,320
Our home.

216
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,910
Our home?

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Look,

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,510
your house is 40 square feet

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,750
and so is mine.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,910
Let's merge them.

221
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,030
You mean

222
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,270
we're going to live together?

223
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,440
That's right.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,240
I've checked out

225
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,720
several nice neighborhoods
near your office.

226
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,750
This way,

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,270
it would be convenient
for your daily commute.

228
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,200
Just think about it,

229
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,120
I have a motorcycle.

230
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
A twist of the throttle,
and I'll be there.

231
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,630
Let's get a two-bedroom unit.

232
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,030
There will be enough space

233
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,480
for your desk and my computer.

234
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,320
We can even have a big kitchen

235
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,630
to match your profound culinary skills.

236
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,360
And the balcony.

237
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,870
You can decorate it however you want.

238
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,510
We can plant 30 pots of Crimson Saber.

239
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,000
Decorate it however you like.

240
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,960
Oh, and the bathrooms.

241
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,630
We need to have two.

242
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
It will spare us the hassle
of fighting over shower time.

243
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,750
As for the cinema,

244
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,150
we could turn it into a home theater.

245
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,270
Let's schedule a midnight screening
every weekend

246
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,750
and invite friends over.

247
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,390
What do you think?

248
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,480
Jiang Yi.

249
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,150
What's wrong?

250
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,240
I need to talk to you about something.

251
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,840
Go ahead.

252
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,510
If I tell you

253
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,120
I might be going to Beijing,

254
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,440
what do you think?

255
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,670
It's great.

256
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
Business trip or traveling?

257
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,870
What if it's for work?

258
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,750
Work?

259
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,510
That's good too.

260
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,240
Long term or short term?

261
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Long term.

262
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,870
I'll need to stay in Beijing
all the time.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,630
What does that mean?

264
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Jiang Feng, editor-in-chief
of New Perspective,

265
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,550
has been poached by BeijingTimes
to be their editor-in-chief.

266
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,320
He wants me to come with him.

267
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,680
So you said yes?

268
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,240
I haven't said yes.

269
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,030
That's why I thought

270
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,030
I'd come to discuss with you.

271
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,960
But don't you already

272
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,510
have an answer in mind?

273
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,960
Huang Yingzi, honestly,

274
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,960
if you really want to go to Beijing,

275
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,910
I can go with you.

276
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,030
I'll quit my job at ATG

277
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,910
and start all over again.

278
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,640
What's the big deal?

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,030
Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,440
No way.

281
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,960
You've

282
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
worked so hard to get where you are.

283
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,920
How can you give up

284
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,030
just because of me?

285
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,200
But is that what I want?

286
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,960
Don't you know

287
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,240
what I want?

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,680
At the end of the day,

289
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,880
you don't know me at all, Huang Yingzi.

290
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,510
Jiang Yi...

291
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,680
(Incognito mode has been activated.)

292
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,010
(Would you like to play?)

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,350
(Player Huang Yingzi,)

294
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,920
(welcome to play in incognito mode.)

295
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,640
Yingzi,

296
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,750
what's wrong?

297
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
Are you feeling down?

298
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,550
Is it because of Jiang Yi?

299
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,350
Actually, it's because of myself.

300
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,550
I went to see him today.

301
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,680
I wanted to talk to him about it.

302
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,000
Then, I saw him sketching something

303
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,240
on a piece of paper.

304
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,750
When I took a look at it,

305
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,960
he was sketching the house
we're going to live in.

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Listening to him talk about it,

307
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,270
I felt so sweet and touched.

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,960
I didn't know how to tell him.

309
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,000
When I finally mustered the courage
to tell him,

310
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,720
he was disappointed.

311
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,310
(If only you had seen his reaction.)

312
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,270
(When I saw it,)

313
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,440
(I thought I was being cruel.)

314
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,440
(If you really want to go to Beijing,)

315
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,880
(I'm sure Jiang Yi won't stop you.)

316
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,510
(He didn't stop me.)

317
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,070
He even wanted to quit his job

318
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,550
and go to Beijing with me.

319
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,160
But Yifei,

320
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,750
I can't be that selfish.

321
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
So this is a dilemma

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,350
for you.

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,880
Yes.

324
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,550
Yingzi, tell me,

325
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,960
why do you want
to go to Beijing so badly?

326
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,640
Are you thinking
that I want to go to Beijing

327
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,200
for better career opportunities?

328
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,830
Actually, that's not it.

329
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
It's for that topic on sexual assault.

330
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,640
The chief editor told me

331
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,830
that if I go to Beijing,

332
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,720
they would assign me
the topic on sexual assault.

333
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,720
(Every time I see news like that,)

334
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
(I think of)

335
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
(those vulnerable and helpless girls.)

336
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,310
(They want to protect themselves,)

337
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,440
(but they don't have
the power to do so.)

338
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,480
If no one

339
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,400
reaches out

340
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
to help them at times like this,

341
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,880
they may become
more and more disappointed

342
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,400
and fall into darkness.

343
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,880
I know that I alone may not be able

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,350
to solve the problem,

345
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,110
but I still want to contribute

346
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,030
my meager efforts

347
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,750
to help them.

348
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,240
I want to write this news report

349
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,480
to make more people

350
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,920
aware of this issue,

351
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,310
to draw attention to it.

352
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,310
Yingzi,

353
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,240
I think you should be honest

354
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,350
with Jiang Yi about this.

355
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,790
But he'll still quit his job

356
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,880
and go to Beijing with me.

357
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,310
That's his choice.

358
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,350
In a sense,

359
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,590
you have no right to interfere.

360
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,960
Yingzi, you and Jiang Yi are 30.

361
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,960
You should decide for yourselves
what you want to do with your lives

362
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,880
and take responsibility
for your decision.

363
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,110
(Congratulations on
passing the game trial.)

364
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,350
(Please check out the gift
from the developers.)

365
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,790
(Happy birthday to you!)

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,680
(Happy birthday to you!)

367
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,920
(Happy birthday to you!)

368
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,830
(Happy birthday to you!)

369
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,960
(Today is Huang Yingzi's 19th birthday.)

370
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,310
(This is the first time)

371
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,350
(she's celebrating her birthday
without the five of us.)

372
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,310
(Happy birthday, Yingzi.)

373
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,510
(Whether I'm in your wishes or not,)

374
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,550
(I'll be by your side.)

375
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,960
(Let's cut the cake.)

376
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,350
(After a twelve-hour flight,)

377
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,590
(I finally made it.)

378
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,200
(Yingzi is graduating
from college today.)

379
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,030
(Happy graduation, future journalist.)

380
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,070
(Let's take a photo)

381
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,350
(to commemorate this important day.)

382
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,750
(Huang Yingzi.)

383
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,750
(Look,)

384
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,350
(This is how Huang Yingzi is
when she's nervous.)

385
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,920
(Once this interview airs,)

386
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,400
(I'm definitely going to keep it.)

387
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,110
(Then, when she becomes
a great journalist in the future,)

388
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,160
(I'll show it to her)

389
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,550
(and have a good laugh at her expense.)

390
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,400
(Congratulations, Huang Yingzi,)

391
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,750
(you're getting closer to your dream.)

392
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,200
(Over the years, I've read
every one of your articles,)

393
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,160
(and I know all about your hard work.)

394
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,200
(Ms. Huang Yingzi,)

395
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
(this is your takeout.)

396
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,030
(I didn't order any takeout.)

397
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,960
(You're Huang Yingzi, right?)

398
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,110
(You're still the same as before.)

399
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,270
(You skip meals when you get busy.)

400
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,720
(Huang Yingzi, I'm sorry.)

401
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,350
(In many important moments
of your life,)

402
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,950
(moments when you need me,)

403
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,270
(I can only be there for you
in this way.)

404
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,720
(But I know)

405
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,590
(that when you're seeing this video,)

406
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,310
(it means we've succeeded.)

407
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,920
(I believe that by then,)

408
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,720
(even if with the heavy memories,)

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,640
(you can still bravely move forward.)

410
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
(Anyway,)

411
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,830
(I'll always be around you.)

412
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
(Hello, Chief Editor.)

413
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,550
(There's something I'd like
to talk to you about in person.)

414
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,350
(I'm going back to Jiangzhou now.)

415
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,030
(Mr. Jiang, sorry for this sudden call.)

416
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,400
I'd like to talk to you.

417
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,110
The Huang Yingzi I know

418
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,440
is an extremely talented journalist.

419
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,680
If her spot hadn't been taken,

420
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,720
she actually had a chance
to join BeijingTimes.

421
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
I know.

422
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,880
Joining BeijingTimes

423
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,030
has always been Huang Yingzi's dream.

424
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,070
Then why did she tell me she wanted

425
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,350
to pass up the opportunity?

426
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,830
What does that mean?

427
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,270
She passed up the opportunity?

428
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,510
She told me

429
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,160
there's

430
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,550
someone very important
waiting for her in Jiangzhou.

431
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,440
I hope you can change her mind.

432
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,110
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

433
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,640
I know what to do.

434
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,160
(At 30 years old,)

435
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,640
(you must have become)

436
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,110
(a very famous journalist.)

437
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,960
(There's no justice you can't uphold,)

438
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,640
(no truth you can't uncover.)

439
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,040
(The bad people will
have nowhere to hide.)

440
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,830
(My goal hasn't changed since I was 18.)

441
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,790
(I will become a journalist)

442
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
(and expose the truth.)

443
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,240
Hello, Yingzi.

444
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,680
Where are you?

445
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,550
I'm right behind you.

446
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,400
What are you doing here?

447
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,880
I need to talk to you.

448
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,000
Jiang Yi, let's get married.

449
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,480
Jiang Yi, I saw the Easter egg
in your game.

450
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,830
I only found out
that you've been with me

451
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,160
all these twelve years.

452
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
I knew nothing about this.

453
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,350
I used to call you stingy,

454
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,590
but now I realize

455
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,240
I've been

456
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,750
the ignorant fool.

457
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,480
I get it now.

458
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,830
Nothing is more important than you,

459
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,000
not Beijing or anything else.

460
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
From now on,

461
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,350
I'll be your shadow.

462
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,000
Where you go, I go.

463
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,880
If you want to stay in Jiangzhou,
I'll stay here with you.

464
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,510
If you want to return to Hangtian City,

465
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,680
I'll return with you.

466
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,160
If you want to go to the UK,

467
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,400
I'll go with you.

468
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,920
Jiang Yi,

469
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,680
you've always been there for me,

470
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,270
now it's my turn to be there for you.

471
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,270
Will you marry me?

472
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,920
About this,

473
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
maybe we should

474
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,830
think about it.

475
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,830
So...

476
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,790
So you're saying no?

477
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,590
I just hope you didn't make a decision

478
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,200
in a moment of impulse
without thinking it through.

479
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,110
It's not an impulsive decision.

480
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,920
I've thought it through.

481
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
But I haven't.

482
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,720
I know exactly

483
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
how much courage it takes for a girl

484
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,510
to say something like that.

485
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,750
And I know

486
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,070
how much

487
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,510
this means

488
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,440
to you and me.

489
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,590
So I think

490
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
we should both give each other
a little time

491
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,400
to think it over,

492
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,640
okay?

493
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,880
Ming Yu.

494
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,590
Hello, Yingzi.

495
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Are you feeling better?

496
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,350
You didn't forget everything, did you?

497
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,960
You were crying and saying

498
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,030
you wanted to break up with Jiang Yi.

499
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,070
Don't you remember?

500
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,070
Jiang Yi...

501
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,750
When will you know my heart?

502
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,720
What did you say?

503
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,920
You're saying you love me?

504
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,480
I love you too,

505
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
Yi!

506
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,550
Why am I kissing a globe?

507
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,310
Crimson Saber,

508
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,510
from now on,

509
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,440
you're an orphan.

510
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
Or do you want

511
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,400
to call your dad

512
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,440
and tell him to come back?

513
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,070
It's your dad.

514
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,310
Hello, Huang Yingzi.

515
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,880
Your dad is talking to you.

516
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Tell him.

517
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
You pricked me!

518
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,240
You bad son!

519
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,110
Is this Mingyu?

520
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,920
I proposed to Jiang Yi.

521
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,160
And he said no.

522
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,550
Yingzi, are you drunk?

523
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,240
He doesn't love me at all.

524
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,750
It's because Jiang Yi...

525
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,030
♪He doesn't love me♪

526
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:16,110
♪I know he doesn't love me♪

527
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,510
(What are you thinking?)

528
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,640
I, Huang Yingzi, have been single
for 30 years.

529
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,960
If you don't want to get married,
it's fine.

530
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,030
I can wait a little longer.

531
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,750
Why aren't you replying me?

532
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,440
I get it, I get it.

533
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,240
You want to break up with me, right?

534
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
No problem, no problem.

535
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,750
Let's break up, then.

536
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,030
It's no big deal!

537
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,310
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,000
Can we not break up?

539
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,590
I won't say I want to break up anymore.

540
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,440
Okay. Still not replying?

541
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Fine.

542
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,110
If you don't reply, then we're over.

543
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,550
Completely over. I'm blocking you.

544
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,030
Completely blocking you!

545
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,680
Yingzi?

546
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,030
Yingzi?

547
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,480
Are you okay?

548
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,270
Are you still there?

549
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
Mingyu.

550
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,160
Are you sober now?

551
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes.

552
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,790
What should I do?

553
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,640
What else can you do?

554
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,070
You've deleted
all his contact information,

555
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,750
even Taobao's Wangwang chat.

556
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,590
He couldn't reach you.

557
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,000
So he asked me to pass you a message.

558
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,200
What did he say?

559
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
He said

560
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,550
even if you want to break up,

561
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,680
do it amicably.

562
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,550
I don't want to break up.

563
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,510
I know.

564
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,000
So

565
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,720
he asked you to meet him
on the evening of the weekend.

566
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,550
Talk things out

567
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,720
with him.

568
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm out on a trip with my parents,

569
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,720
so I won't be able to go with you.

570
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,480
Update me on whatever happens.

571
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,160
Bye.

572
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,030
Huang Yingzi.

573
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,680
Chloe.

574
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,720
What are you doing here?

575
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,550
The press conference of "The Maze"
is being held here.

576
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Today is the first day of rehearsal.

577
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,830
Jiang Yi asked you to come?

578
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,350
Yes.

579
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,350
He said he wanted

580
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,310
to talk to me about something.

581
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
This guy is becoming
more and more unreliable.

582
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,070
Who would arrange a discussion
with his girlfriend

583
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,790
at a press conference venue?

584
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,400
Where is he?

585
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,720
This is the highest

586
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,670
holographic projection
exhibition hall in Jiangzhou.

587
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,710
He says even though the game

588
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,230
can't be called "Sky City,"

589
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,230
the press conference

590
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,110
must be held in Sky City.

591
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,590
Take a break here.

592
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,440
I've got things to attend to.

593
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,760
Go on.

594
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,510
Yingzi.

595
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,510
What are you guys doing here?

596
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
It's such an important occasion.

597
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,070
It's his debut press conference.

598
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,030
How could we miss it?

599
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,150
Isn't today a rehearsal?

600
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,440
You're going to Beijing, right?

601
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,510
He said, as your friend,

602
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,000
he asked us to come
and see you off.

603
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
As my friend?

604
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,040
Did he tell you that?

605
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,110
He told us he broke up with you.

606
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,710
Now you're just friends.

607
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,480
We broke up?

608
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,400
Did he tell you that too?

609
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,480
Yes.

610
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,110
Yingzi, you're in the wrong here.

611
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,440
You two just got together,

612
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,400
and you're leaving for Beijing.

613
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,320
He must be feeling terrible, right?

614
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,230
No...

615
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,000
And even if you're going to Beijing,

616
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,880
when he offered to go with you,

617
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,150
why didn't you agree?

618
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,190
I...

619
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,760
Even if it's
a long-distance relationship,

620
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
it's still a relationship.

621
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,550
What's the big deal?

622
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,110
It's not like that.

623
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,150
I was drunk that day.

624
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,960
That was my drunk talk.

625
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,710
Even if you were drunk,

626
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,320
it was still wrong of you
to ask to break up.

627
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,070
Are you a child?

628
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,710
Exactly.

629
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,280
I know I was wrong.

630
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,880
So after I sobered up,

631
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,230
I regretted it.

632
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,880
Where is he?

633
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,670
Where can I find him?

634
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,190
I haven't seen him.

635
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,230
Hello everyone.

636
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,510
I'm glad you could all make it today.

637
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,230
Without all of you,

638
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
there wouldn't be the game "The Maze".

639
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm not good

640
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,400
at expressing my gratitude,

641
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,630
but I still want to tell you all this,

642
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,630
thank you.

643
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
The initial inspiration

644
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,070
for creating this game came from a girl.

645
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,550
We grew up together.

646
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,440
However, when we were eighteen,

647
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
a friend of ours

648
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,400
left us permanently,

649
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,550
leaving her
in a state of perpetual pain.

650
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,840
So I wanted to
create a parallel world for her

651
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,000
through this game.

652
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,440
In that world,

653
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,320
there is no death,

654
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,760
no parting.

655
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,760
I also want to use it

656
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,160
to make up for the regrets
of our youth.

657
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,760
It is because of this girl

658
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
that this story exists.

659
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,190
And because of her,

660
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,550
I've been able to persist until now.

661
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,400
In reality, the story of "The Maze"

662
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,630
has not concluded.

663
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,110
Today, right here,

664
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,510
I want to write
the most perfect ending for her.

665
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,440
(Huang Yingzi,)

666
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,110
(saying goodbye to you face-to-face)

667
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,760
(is too hard for me,)

668
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,190
(so I'll do it this way instead.)

669
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,360
(Do you remember)

670
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,880
(when you asked me
when I started liking you?)

671
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,760
(It was March 5th, 1996,)

672
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,710
(the day we first met.)

673
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm Huang Yingzi.

674
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm in Senior Class 2.

675
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,800
(You always have many strange ideas)

676
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
(and plenty of bad ideas.)

677
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,760
(The truth is,)

678
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,070
(your taste is average,)

679
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,760
(but your narcissism is real.)

680
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,510
(You always claim to be
the dancing queen of Hangtian City,)

681
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,630
(the descendant of Huang Feihong.)

682
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,880
(You always want to protect everyone,)

683
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,630
(standing in front of everyone.)

684
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
(But to me,)

685
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,590
(you're the one)

686
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,920
(who needs protection the most.)

687
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,710
(When did this idea)

688
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,880
(first come about?)

689
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,230
(Maybe it was during that summer,)

690
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,400
(during that game of truth or dare.)

691
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,550
(I couldn't help
but look at you in secret,)

692
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,070
(and draw you in secret.)

693
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,070
(It could also be when I saw
the helpless look in your eyes)

694
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,030
(when I was leaving.)

695
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,280
(I don't know when it happened,)

696
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,510
(but suddenly I realized)

697
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,800
(that I'm more than just fond of you.)

698
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,440
(Huang Yingzi,)

699
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,070
(today marks)

700
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,440
(25 years and one month
and three days since we first met.)

701
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,440
(During this time,)

702
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,510
(we've spent half of it together)

703
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,800
(and half apart.)

704
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,670
(We're about to part ways again,)

705
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,550
(but there are still
so many things I promised you)

706
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,360
(that I haven't done yet.)

707
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,070
(Like...)

708
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,150
(Hello, Yingzi.)

709
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,230
(I'm Stefanie.)

710
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,670
(I think you must be
a really great girl.)

711
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,590
You're surrounded
by people who love you very much.

712
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
(Actually, over the years,)

713
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,110
(I've received a lot of letters)

714
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,110
from all places.

715
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,710
It's all sorts of letters.

716
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
(Over the past decade or so,)

717
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,150
(I've also received letters
from Jiang Yi.)

718
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,360
(He shared with me many stories)

719
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,510
(about the girl he liked.)

720
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,760
(And these letters and stories,)

721
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,360
(I've kept them all in mind.)

722
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,800
I'd like to convey my best wishes

723
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,030
to you.

724
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,480
I wish both of you happiness.

725
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,510
I'm sorry.

726
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,440
When you proposed to me that day,

727
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,760
I rejected you.

728
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,440
I just couldn't bear to let a girl

729
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,920
do such a thing.

730
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,070
Besides, I've prepared

731
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,230
for this day for far too long.

732
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,230
I couldn't just let you have it.

733
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,070
We've known each other for so long,

734
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,280
and you know

735
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,800
I'm not very good at doing cheesy stuff,

736
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,920
but as long as it's for you,

737
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,590
I'm willing to do anything.

738
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,360
Do you remember that wish card?

739
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,230
Actually, when I was 18,

740
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,000
I already had my wish in mind.

741
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,110
You said

742
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,520
that whales are
the gentlest creatures in the sea

743
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,150
because they only have
one partner in their lifetime.

744
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
No matter how far apart they are,

745
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
they can always find each other.

746
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
They will never leave each other.

747
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,150
Ms. Huang Yingzi,

748
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,800
will you marry me?

749
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,400
I will.

750
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,710
I will.

751
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,070
(When I grow up,)

752
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,030
I'll ask Stefanie Sun
to sing in front of you,

753
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,360
in front of your house.

754
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,710
(You're bluffing.)

755
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,710
Thank you.

756
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,960
Yingzi,

757
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,880
we are going to be fine.

758
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,000
Go.

759
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,230
Stefanie...

760
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,840
Stefanie, is this really you?

761
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,320
Oh, my God.

762
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,480
I can't believe it's really you.

763
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,190
You really are here.

764
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,440
I love you.

765
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,030
I've loved you since I was little.

766
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,280
I've been your fans for over ten years.

767
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh, my God.

768
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,760
I know how to sing
every one of your albums.

769
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,480
I even had a sing-off with others
when I was little, Stefanie!

770
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,630
I almost went to your concert one year.

771
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,320
Oh, God! My Stefanie!

772
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,440
Yingzi...

773
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,710
I can't believe this is happening.

774
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,030
Yingzi, you're being too much.

775
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,710
This is my boyfriend, Stefanie.

776
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,280
Yes.

777
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,510
I love you so much, Stefanie!

778
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,510
When are you going
to release your new album?

779
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,030
When are you going on tour?

780
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,710
Take a breath.

781
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,360
Will you come to Jiangzhou?

782
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,920
Yingzi...

783
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,880
Take a breath with me.

784
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,510
Yingzi...

785
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,880
(Dear you,)

786
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,110
(what songs)

787
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,440
(accompanied you)

788
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,360
(and saw you through
the most important time of your youth?)

789
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,400
(Perhaps, at some moments,)

790
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,800
(they even gave you
some encouragement and strength.)

791
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
(That's the most precious thing.)

792
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,960
(In those long stretches of time,)

793
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,550
(we've all left behind
various versions of ourselves.)

794
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,070
(Some happily laughing,)

795
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,710
(some tearfully crying,)

796
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,590
(some looking miserable,)

797
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,550
(and some shining brightly.)

798
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,840
(It's these different versions)

799
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,880
(that piece together who we are now.)

800
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,710
(Let's live on)

801
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,070
(with these precious memories.)

802
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,190
(Because of them,)

803
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,760
(you are unique.)

804
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,670
(And because we have each other,)

805
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,070
(even if life is full of ups and downs,)

806
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,960
(we will always
shine as brightly as ever,)

807
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,510
(forever young.)

808
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,150
Louder. I can't hear you.

809
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,800
Calm...

810
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,280
Stefanie...

811
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Where is my Stefanie?

812
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,480
You scared her off.

813
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,670
Stefanie got scared off.

814
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,360
Stefanie!
