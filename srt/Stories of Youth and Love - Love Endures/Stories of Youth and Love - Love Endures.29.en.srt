[Episode 29]

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,950
Here.

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,920
These are your favorite wontons

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,790
with three-flavored filling.

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,430
Thanks, Grandma.

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Grandma,

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,590
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,230
I didn't know so much would happen

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,640
while I was gone.

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,310
My dear,

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,430
it's good to have you back.

13
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,360
Are you used to

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,630
food abroad?

15
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
Actually, British food
is quite homogenous.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
I miss wontons the most.

17
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,240
No wonder you've lost weight.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Come on.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,960
You're finally back.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,750
Eat more.

21
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,840
Eat as much as you like.

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,190
From now on,

23
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,120
no matter where you are,

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,030
remember to take care of yourself

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
for yourself

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,840
and for Yingzi.

27
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,470
I always thought

28
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,310
I had three granddaughters.

29
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,080
I used to be happiest

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,150
when I watched
my three granddaughters

31
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,430
surround me with chatter.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,430
But now,

33
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,560
I've lost one.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,800
I can't lose another.

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,190
Grandma, don't worry.

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,910
I'll find a way

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
to help Yingzi.

38
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
When I was little,

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,590
I always thought
Hangtian City was so big

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,910
that I couldn't get out of it.

41
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,360
But now,

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,430
when it's time to leave,

43
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,310
I don't feel happy at all.

44
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,750
Because we were expecting
the world outside before

45
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,600
with all six of us together.

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,310
But now,

47
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,480
some of us have stayed
in Hangtian City forever.

48
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you afraid?

49
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm afraid

50
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,920
that I couldn't help Yifei

51
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,630
or Yingzi.

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,510
I'm sad to see Yingzi

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,510
in this state.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,950
But there's nothing I can do.

55
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
Growing up

56
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,630
is all about meeting

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,950
and parting.

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,480
Some people just
stay with you for a while

59
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
and then drift away

60
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,190
or die.

61
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,750
I realized

62
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,480
that I can't face all this,

63
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,720
and I don't know how to face you.

64
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,600
I read a quote from Lin Huiyin,

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,310
"Time is the perfect remedy.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,310
When you're feeling helpless,

67
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,870
just leave it all to time.

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,560
It'll make you forget
what you need to forget.

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
It'll take you from one story

70
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,480
to the next."

71
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,120
Mingyu,

72
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
there's a time to part

73
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,480
and a time to meet again.

74
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,600
Are you really leaving?

75
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,750
You think I'm joking with you?

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,480
Where are you going?

77
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,120
Africa.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,390
Why are you going to Africa?

79
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,360
What's it to you?

80
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,040
Anyway, I've

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,630
raised you until you're 18

82
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,070
and put you through university.

83
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,310
That's enough.

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,750
It's time for me to enjoy my life.

85
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,870
I've heard

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
that the Great Migration is amazing.

87
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm going to see it.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,390
Here's the school fees

89
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,270
and the living expenses.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,310
Don't splurge.

91
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,310
If it's not enough, you'll
have to figure it out yourself.

92
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,430
How long will you be gone?

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
It's none of your business.

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,430
You should be happy that I'm leaving.

95
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,070
No one will ever beat you up again.

96
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,920
Why are you leaving at this time?

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,830
Do you not want me anymore?

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,510
Yes.

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't want you anymore.

100
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,680
Fine.

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,240
Just leave.

102
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,160
And don't ever come back again.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,510
I don't want you either.

104
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,510
Yingzi forgets about
what happened to Yifei again.

105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,390
Not only has she forgotten Yifei,

106
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,070
she doesn't even
remember Jiang's return.

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,950
My dad told me

108
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,160
that Yingzi couldn't
accept Yifei's death,

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,430
so she rebuilt

110
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,000
a world in her heart
where Yifei's still alive.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,870
Whenever she's hit
by an external blow,

112
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,390
she'll choose to forget

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
and then cover it up

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
with her own

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
beautiful memories.

116
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,310
It seems Yingzi's condition

117
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,630
is more serious than we thought.

118
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,790
It's all my fault.

119
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,750
I shouldn't have told her that way.

120
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,390
Yingzi has forgotten about Yifei's death

121
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,270
twice in a row.

122
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,600
I think

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
we should stop pushing her
until we find a scientific way

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,630
to do this.

125
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,960
Save the pain

126
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,320
for those of us who are sober.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Jiang Yi,

128
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,840
aren't you going to see Yingzi again?

129
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm afraid she'll get all worked up

130
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
when she sees me.

131
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,750
What to do?

132
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,790
So you're just going to

133
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,960
keep avoiding her?

134
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,000
I've already thought about it.

135
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,790
Until I find the right way,

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,910
I'll be with her in a different way.

137
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,150
(I made a decision at that time.)

138
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,080
(I don't know if this is
the right or wrong decision.)

139
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,240
(I can't watch her suffer,)

140
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,670
(but it's the only thing I can do.)

141
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,960
(Yingzi,)

142
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,670
(I miss you so much.)

143
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,720
(Our troupe has
recently toured abroad.)

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,630
(I feel like I'm one step closer)

145
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,670
(to my dream.)

146
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,440
(I'm really happy.)

147
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,670
(My only regret)

148
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
(is that you're not with me.)

149
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,909
(Since I've joined the troupe,)

150
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,029
(there are so many new things
I want to tell you,)

151
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,870
(and I want to share my joy
with you.)

152
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
(But)

153
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,270
(the next show is coming up soon.)

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,320
(I have to go to rehearsal first.)

155
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,960
(We'll chat again)

156
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,790
(when we have time.)

157
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,200
(It's inconvenient
to use a phone abroad.)

158
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,790
(Let's get in touch by email
after this.)

159
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,390
(Love, Yifei.)

160
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,030
(Eat well)

161
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,080
(and take care of yourself.)

162
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
(I'll be waiting for you.)

163
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,510
(See you in Beijing.)

164
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,510
Grandma, remember,

165
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,910
this is the date of the fourth.

166
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,630
I've written it down for you.

167
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,080
You'll have acupuncture at 10 AM,

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,270
then medicine

169
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,120
on the fifth.

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,630
I've also written it down for you.

171
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,200
Grandma.

172
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,870
What are you looking at?

173
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,030
I made a calendar for Grandma.

174
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,320
I've written down at what time
she takes her medication

175
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
and when she goes for

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,480
acupuncture.

177
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,600
Grandma,

178
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
tear one a day,

179
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,360
and in time, we'll all be back.

180
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,840
We haven't even left yet.

181
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
How do you know when we'll be back?

182
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,720
The next time we come back,
it'll be Chinese New Year.

183
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,670
Grandma,

184
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
we'll all be back
for the Chinese New Year.

185
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay.

186
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,270
With this,

187
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,840
I can't forget anything.

188
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
Oh, right.

189
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,840
We don't want it, Grandma.

190
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,750
No.

191
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,120
You guys are going to university.

192
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,480
This is your rewards.

193
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm not worried

194
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,910
about you guys out there.

195
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm just worried
that you won't eat well.

196
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,200
With this money,

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,670
you can buy some good food.

198
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,240
No matter what,

199
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
you can't starve.

200
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,480
Grandma,

201
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,550
we have living expenses.

202
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,360
Put it away.

203
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,030
We have enough money.

204
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,670
It's enough, Grandma.

205
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,030
Yes.

206
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,390
Keep it for yourself.

207
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
You guys are worrying me.

208
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,510
Let's take it, then.

209
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,510
Thank you, Grandma.

210
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,360
Thank you, Grandma.

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,750
Thank you, Grandma.

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
Good.

213
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,270
Does Yifei have one?

214
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,840
Yes.

215
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,480
But

216
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,360
she was in a hurry

217
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,670
to get to the show this time.

218
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,600
She left

219
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,000
before I... I could give it to her.

220
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,790
Yes.

221
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,750
We all have it.

222
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,790
Can Yifei not have it?

223
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
It's okay.

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,790
Yifei is a meticulous girl.

225
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm sure she can
take good care of herself out there.

226
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,510
Give her the red packet

227
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,910
when she comes back.

228
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,320
She was meticulous

229
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,080
about others,

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,680
but she didn't care about herself.

231
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,270
She always let others

232
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,120
have everything nice first.

233
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,790
Yifei's understanding from a young age

234
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,240
made my heart ache.

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,120
Anyway,

236
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,320
I wonder if she's all right

237
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,670
over there by herself.

238
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
Grandma,

239
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,150
why are you crying?

240
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,390
Yifei is doing a tour.

241
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,030
She'll be back soon.

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,150
I just kind of miss her.

243
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,390
We miss her too.

244
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,960
But she'll be back in no time.

245
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,000
When she becomes a principal dancer,

246
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,630
we'll take you to visit her, okay?

247
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,030
Don't cry.

248
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,270
Grandma, don't cry.

249
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,790
Yingzi,

250
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,870
take this.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,150
The canteen food is not good.

252
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,360
You won't go hungry

253
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,150
with it.

254
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,750
Mom,

255
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,270
there's no shortage of pickles
in the capital, Beijing.

256
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,910
Just take it out.

257
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,440
That's different.

258
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,480
It's your mom's specialty.

259
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
Got it?

260
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
It can't be replaced.

261
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,840
Okay.

262
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,480
Put it in.

263
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,630
Bread, chips, shrimp sticks.

264
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,320
Dad,

265
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,840
why did you get these for me?

266
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,910
For you to eat on the way.

267
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,600
No.

268
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,870
Beijing has it all.

269
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,960
Yes, Beijing has it all.

270
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,030
But I bought these.

271
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,000
Give it to me.

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,870
Don't disturb me.

273
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,750
It won't fit in my bag.

274
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,910
Just carry it.

275
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,440
You'll be gone for half a year.

276
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,840
Who knows
what your life will be like?

277
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,120
Well...

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,670
Don't worry.

279
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,750
I'll pack it all in for you.

280
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,480
Okay.

281
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,150
Put it in.

282
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,240
Put it in first.

283
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,550
All right.

284
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,360
And this.

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,630
Jiang Yi,

286
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,750
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm going to Beijing tomorrow.

288
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,440
My parents have packed
so many things for me.

289
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,790
They wish they could pack
the whole Hangtian City for me.

290
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,390
But I know

291
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,120
that no matter what else I bring,

292
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,910
I won't be able

293
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,030
to keep you all with me.

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,150
I know you don't want
to talk to me right now.

295
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,000
We agreed

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,350
to go to Beijing together,

297
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
but it ends up

298
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,270
that I'm going alone.

299
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,480
I wanted to take the globe
you gave me,

300
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,680
but it's too big

301
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,720
to fit in my bag.

302
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,440
So I had to leave it in my room.

303
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,270
I know

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
you still don't want to talk to me.

305
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
But no matter what,

306
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,270
at least contact Guan Chao.

307
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,510
At least let me know
how you're doing.

308
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,000
Fine.

309
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,720
It's okay.

310
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
I won't blame you

311
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,720
if you don't want to talk to me.

312
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,240
Jiang Yi,

313
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,640
I just want you to know

314
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,960
that no matter where you are

315
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,270
or what you do,

316
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll still consider you a friend.

317
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,270
I'm going to Beijing soon.

318
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,400
Isn't Beijing your favorite city?

319
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,310
I'll take pictures for you

320
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,720
every day in Beijing
and send them to you.

321
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Maybe after a while,

322
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,350
you won't be angry,

323
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,790
you'll forgive me,

324
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,550
and we'll make up, right?

325
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,479
Jiang Yi,

326
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I miss you so much.

327
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,240
Luckily, you're not here.

328
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,310
If you were here,

329
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,240
you'd laugh at me if you saw me

330
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
crying like this.

331
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,720
All right.

332
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,310
I need to stop talking to you.

333
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,590
I really have to go now.

334
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,310
Jiang Yi,

335
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,590
goodbye.

336
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm leaving.

337
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,160
Go back now.

338
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,790
Okay.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,110
Bye.

340
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,550
Go back now.

341
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't forget to call me.

342
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,110
I got it.

343
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,640
You really don't regret
not saying goodbye

344
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,350
to her in person?

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,750
When I find a way to help her,

346
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,200
we'll meet.

347
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
You made the right decision.

348
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,590
And after all these years,

349
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,240
did you find a way to cure her?

350
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,110
(I wish there were
no secrets between me)

351
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,240
(and my loved ones.)

352
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,550
Stop following me!

353
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,280
(Mr. Lan.)

354
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,590
(Yingzi?)

355
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,110
Is it really you?

356
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,920
(It was raining so heavily)

357
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,720
(that night.)

358
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,030
(Yingzi.)

359
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,240
(Yifei.)

360
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,880
It's Yingzi.

361
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,000
Hello, Yingzi.

362
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,070
Mingyu,

363
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,350
I think I remember something.

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,110
What do you remember?

365
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,030
I think I've seen Yifei

366
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
and Mr. Lan.

367
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,510
I think I had a big fight

368
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,880
with Jiang Yi over something.

369
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
Isn't Yifei on tour in Europe?

370
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,550
How could you have seen her?

371
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,510
Yifei is back.

372
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,030
Yifei's troupe

373
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
is coming to Jiangzhou

374
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,960
for a show next Saturday.

375
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
Mingyu,

376
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,750
let's go and watch her show together.

377
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,000
I miss Yifei so much.

378
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,310
Okay.

379
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,590
There's only a week left.

380
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,240
I feel that Yingzi

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,480
is different this time.

382
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,790
There are a lot of things
she hasn't completely forgotten.

383
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
But if we just let her go,

384
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,030
it'll be another blow

385
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,440
for her

386
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,830
if she remembers everything.

387
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,920
Chloe,

388
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,960
I need a favor from you.

389
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,790
What's it?

390
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,030
I need some men

391
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,310
to start the game right away.

392
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,350
Is "The Maze" done?

393
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,400
Not yet.

394
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,310
But I really can't wait.

395
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
Is it because of Huang Yingzi?

396
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,240
I got it.

397
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,550
Is one group enough?

398
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,510
Not enough.

399
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,350
I want all of them.

400
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,880
Okay.

401
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,070
I promise you

402
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,790
that everyone you need

403
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,680
will be here in an hour.

404
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,030
Thank you.

405
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,000
The skin isn't detailed enough.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,960
Please redo it.

407
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,750
The rendering of this scene
is still a bit poor.

408
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,480
The movement is not smooth enough.

409
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,310
Please make it better.

410
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,070
Sure, I will.

411
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,750
No problem.

412
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,030
Come on, have a bite.

413
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,880
It's going to be a long day.

414
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,110
It's okay.

415
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,880
I'm not hungry.

416
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,920
Come on, have a bite.

417
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,790
Thank you, Chloe.

418
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,440
You're welcome.

419
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,160
You must be hungry.

420
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,880
Have a bite. Come on.

421
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,720
Take one for yourselves.

422
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
It's your breakfast.

423
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,110
Yi,

424
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
I'm done with the checking on my end.

425
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,880
Go home early and rest.

426
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,550
Thank you for your hard work.

427
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
All right. I'll go home now.

428
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,160
Sir,

429
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
will this work

430
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,480
for Yingzi's illness?

431
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
Use of virtual means

432
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,270
to recreate traumatizing scenarios
for patients.

433
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,270
So the patients relearn
how to deal with fear and pain.

434
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,830
It's really a method
of psychotherapy.

435
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,000
But it's also a risky approach.

436
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,000
She's only normal now

437
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,350
because she's not
externally stimulated.

438
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,590
If she can't accept

439
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,680
what happened back then,

440
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,510
it's going to

441
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,030
re-traumatize her

442
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,680
and increase her pain.

443
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,830
I'm impressed

444
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,270
that you looked up so much information
to find a way.

445
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,030
However,

446
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,830
this method has
a very low success rate.

447
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,160
I know.

448
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,240
So you're going to take the risk?

449
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,350
Whether

450
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
it's three years,

451
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,000
five years,

452
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,350
or even ten years,

453
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,350
as long as Yingzi can be cured,

454
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm willing to do anything.

455
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,550
Why did you ask me out

456
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,640
all of a sudden?

457
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,480
The game of "The Maze" is done.

458
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,790
I want you to be the first

459
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,160
to play the game.

460
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Me?

461
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,440
Can I?

462
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,310
"The Maze"

463
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,200
is a combination of
my work and that of Jiang Yi.

464
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,440
You know him

465
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,070
and me.

466
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,480
Your feelings are all that matter.

467
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,590
I feel like

468
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,200
you've been different

469
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,590
since you came back from the beach.

470
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,550
Different in what way?

471
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,720
You seem

472
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,110
to be getting closer to people.

473
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,070
Maybe it's because I've found

474
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,350
something in common in both of us.

475
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,960
What's it?

476
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,270
This game is finally wrapping up.

477
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Let's go.

478
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,030
Many people asked me

479
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,920
to sell the rights of "The Maze"
to them,

480
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,720
but I didn't want to.

481
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,200
Do you know why

482
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,030
I sold it to Jiang Yi this time?

483
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,240
It took me three years

484
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,750
to complete the worldview of "The Maze".

485
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,720
After it's published,

486
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,550
some people liked
the intricacies of the universe,

487
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,830
some liked the imagery,

488
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,550
but no one really
understood the story.

489
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,550
(A lot of people say
they can't understand "The Maze")

490
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,590
because the framework of the
universe in it is so jumbled,

491
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,270
and time and space flip constantly
back and forth.

492
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,030
In this rather neurotic

493
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,000
worldview,

494
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,480
it's actually

495
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,400
a story about finding a friend,

496
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,590
right?

497
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,510
I too would like to know

498
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,750
the real end of the story.

499
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,070
Why do I feel like
I'm more nervous than you?

500
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,960
The game has been
in development for so long

501
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,640
and now that
it's suddenly in front of me,

502
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,590
I'm a little afraid to look at it.

503
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,750
(Welcome to
the ATG Gaming Experience Room.)

504
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,440
(Next,)

505
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,550
(you'll be the first)

506
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,830
(to experience "The Maze".)

507
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,110
(Please wear the VR headset.)

508
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,400
This is

509
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,480
Hangtian City?

510
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,270
Yingzi,

511
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,720
you're finally here.

512
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,270
What...

513
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,750
What are you guys doing here?

514
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,270
Where is Yifei?

515
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,000
Let's go, Yingzi.

516
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,070
We're on our way to Yifei's show.

517
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,400
But we don't have tickets yet.

518
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,750
So we need to find five tickets

519
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,510
to watch Yifei's show.

520
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,550
Is this a game quest?

521
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,160
What kind of tickets are they?

522
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,920
Blue.

523
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,110
No other information?

524
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
You'll have to

525
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,830
find out the answer yourself.

526
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,270
Wait for me.

527
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,640
Grandma.

528
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,270
Yingzi.

529
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,510
Here. Come on.

530
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,240
Are you going to watch Yifei's show?

531
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,350
The show's about to start.

532
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,550
It's going to be too late.

533
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,240
Yifei left in a hurry.

534
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,270
She forgot the food
I prepared for her.

535
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,680
She'll be

536
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,200
hypoglycemic again

537
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,640
if she doesn't eat
before she goes on stage.

538
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,400
It's okay.

539
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,590
I'll take it to her.

540
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,480
Goodbye, Grandma.

541
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,070
Okay.

542
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,240
Oh, right, Grandma.

543
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,270
Have you seen a blue ticket?

544
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,270
A blue ticket?

545
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,310
No.

546
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,270
It's okay.

547
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,350
I'll find it myself.

548
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,200
Goodbye, Grandma.

549
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,590
Be careful.

550
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,480
Didn't this salon close down?

551
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,920
Yingzi.

552
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,360
Madam Wan Fang,

553
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,960
when did you come back?

554
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,400
I didn't go anywhere.

555
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,030
I've always been here.

556
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,550
Let me make you a new hairstyle.

557
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
It's all right, Madam Wan.

558
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,710
I've got to get to Yifei's show.

559
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,510
Right.

560
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
I forgot about it.

561
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,360
I've been too busy.

562
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Wait for me a minute.

563
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,710
Mr. Lan Bin.

564
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,400
Yingzi,

565
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
give these to Yifei.

566
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,320
She loves this

567
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
cheese and onion flavor.

568
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,800
Your gloves...

569
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,840
You and Yifei bought them for me.

570
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,800
They keep my hands warm.

571
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,670
I'm glad you like it.

572
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,510
Yifei chose this especially for you.

573
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,960
He likes them

574
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,230
so much.

575
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,190
He wears them every day

576
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,190
and can't take them off.

577
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,230
I asked someone
to buy this from Hong Kong, China.

578
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,440
Take it to her for me.

579
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,440
She's sure to look great

580
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,670
on stage in this.

581
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,190
Okay.

582
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,800
I'm paying off the money

583
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,360
I owe your dad today.

584
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,800
Some day,

585
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,840
ask your dad to come along,

586
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,710
I'll treat you all to dinner.

587
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,710
Sure.

588
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,590
I have to man the shop,

589
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,960
and my husband has to go to work.

590
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,760
The two of us

591
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,030
won't be able to
watch Yifei's show in person.

592
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,280
You have to watch it

593
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,230
for us.

594
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't worry,

595
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
Mr. Lan and Madam Wan.

596
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Yifei must be touched

597
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
to see you like this.

598
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Goodbye, Mr. Lan and Madam Wan.

599
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
What does the blue ticket

600
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,590
really look like?

601
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,630
Huang Yingzi, why are you so stupid?

602
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
Isn't the answer right here on you?

603
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,880
I don't have it.

604
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,920
Look for it again.

605
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,030
How come?

606
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,880
A collection of
everyone's love for Yifei

607
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,230
is a ticket to see her.

608
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,710
You're such a fool.

609
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,280
Let's go now.

610
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,030
If we're late, we won't
make it to her show.

611
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,230
We're coming.

612
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,280
We're here.

613
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,000
How are you non-player characters

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,760
faster than me as a player?

615
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,510
I told you,

616
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,280
you're obviously a game moron.

617
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
It's obvious that your game
is poorly designed.

618
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,360
It's also too unfriendly to me

619
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,590
as a player.

620
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,630
All right,

621
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,760
we all have our tickets.

622
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,110
Let's go in.

623
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,880
Let's go.

624
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,150
No.

625
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,190
Is there a bug in your game?

626
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,400
Aren't we here to watch Yifei's show?

627
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,400
Where is Yifei?

628
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,320
Do you really not know?

629
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,670
Do you remember this place?

630
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,150
I do.

631
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,280
Before the exam,

632
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,110
we sneaked here to have fun

633
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
and almost got into a fight.

634
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,480
What else?

635
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,070
What else?

636
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,190
Look over there.

637
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
Don't go in.

638
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,670
I'll talk to them alone.

639
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,760
Dad,

640
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
I'm not afraid.

641
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
But I am.

642
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,880
Just let me go in with you.

643
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,230
Mr. Huang, Yingzi.

644
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,110
What brings you here?

645
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,920
I thought you said
you couldn't make it.

646
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,800
Mr. Huang,

647
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,600
that's our friend.

648
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,800
We have to go.

649
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,480
Yes.

650
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,550
We'll help in any way

651
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,360
we can.

652
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,150
Dad,

653
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,000
the six of us are one.

654
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,840
Please, just let us go in.

655
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,280
Let's go.

656
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:00,710
Dad.

657
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,110
Wei,

658
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,190
I brought you the money
I promised you, without a penny less.

659
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,360
Mr. Huang,

660
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,070
you're a man of your word.

661
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,400
Mr. Huang,

662
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
don't give him the money!

663
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,000
This isn't over

664
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,110
until the photo is deleted!

665
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,190
Guan Chao,

666
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,840
listen here carefully.

667
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,920
You're nothing compared to

668
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,590
what I did for Yifei.

669
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,440
Guan Chao, stop talking.

670
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,550
Mr. Huang,

671
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,590
I'll let him go.

672
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,360
Anyway, Guan Chao,

673
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,440
you have to get down
on your knees and kowtow to me.

674
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,230
You wish!

675
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,030
Get on your knees.

676
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,070
Guan Chao!

677
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,880
What are you doing?

678
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,190
You're too much of a bully!

679
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,190
Yifei?

680
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,480
Yifei!

681
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,030
Yifei!

682
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,670
Yifei!

683
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,440
Let go of me!

684
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,880
Listen to me.

685
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,320
Let go of me!

686
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,230
Listen to me!

687
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,710
Help!

688
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,710
Yifei!

689
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,190
Let go of me!

690
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,480
Listen to me, Yifei.

691
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,800
Help!

692
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,280
Help!

693
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,360
Help...

694
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,960
That's impossible.

695
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,190
That's impossible.

696
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,360
Help!

697
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,110
Why are you showing me this?

698
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,960
Yifei is now abroad.

699
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,550
I'll be able to see her

700
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,880
when she comes back from abroad.

701
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,440
This isn't Yifei.

702
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,630
That's impossible.

703
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,880
Yifei!

704
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,320
Yifei!

705
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,670
Yifei!

706
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,590
Yifei!

707
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,920
Yifei!

708
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,840
Yifei.

709
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,150
Yingzi.

710
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,550
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,670
Yifei!

712
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,070
Yifei!

713
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,840
(I must see Lan Bin.)

714
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,110
(I want an answer.)

715
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,550
Even though that answer
would be a nightmare?

716
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,030
Someone passed away?

717
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,590
I heard she's only 18.

718
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,230
Did she have something
she couldn't get out of her head?

719
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,110
I wonder

720
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,070
if she's doing well on her own.

721
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,800
(She didn't tell you)

722
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
(because she didn't want you to be sad.)

723
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
(But Yifei...)

724
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,800
But I can't reach her.

725
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,320
(Yingzi,)

726
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,920
(did you really not know?)

727
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,400
There were six of us
together at that time,

728
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,510
and I dared imagine
the most outrageous things.

729
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,320
And now, the six of us are all apart.

730
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,800
(I'm leaving Hangtian City anyway.)

731
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,840
(Yingzi,)

732
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,550
(thank you.)

733
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,630
(Huang Yingzi,)

734
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,320
(Yifei is dead!)

735
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,150
(I'm a bit hungry.)

736
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,710
It's just the five of us now.

737
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,000
Can you get some for me?

738
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,030
(Yifei.)

739
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,440
(Yifei.)

740
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,630
(Yifei.)

741
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,510
(Where is Yifei?)

742
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,070
(Yingzi,)

743
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,760
(I never came back.)

744
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,000
(It's you who won't let me go.)

745
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,230
(Yingzi!)
