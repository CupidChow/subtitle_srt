[Episode 4]

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,640
Why are you in a hurry?

4
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,840
Jiang Yi.

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,920
Didn't you go to the cybercafe today?

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,790
I'm busy.

7
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,790
Yi.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,280
Why are you back suddenly?

9
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,200
I missed you

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
and came back to see you.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,430
I bought takeout

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,430
from Jinjiang Restaurant.

13
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,400
It's delicious.

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,680
It's still hot.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Why don't you rest?

16
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,350
I'm actually not hungry.

17
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,480
You're not hungry?

18
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,200
Let's eat it later.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,510
Sit down.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,230
Sit.

21
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,680
Take a look

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,840
at this.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,640
Didn't they run out of my size

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,360
at the shopping mall previously?

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,680
You said you wanted
to learn how to skate, right?

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
I have to

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,470
fulfill my son's wish.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,150
Thanks, Mom.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,310
When can we go skating?

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Yi,

31
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,870
I actually came back

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,520
to discuss something with you.

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,680
What is it?

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,400
Just say it.

35
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,470
I recently

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
took on a big project for the company.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,470
My superior wants

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,080
to send me abroad for a period of time.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,120
When I return, I'll get promoted to
the position of team leader.

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,960
This is a rare opportunity.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,080
I don't want to miss it.

42
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,430
Well,

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,870
no wonder you bought takeout and skates.

44
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,800
So this is what you want to tell me.

45
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,470
No.

46
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,150
I really missed you.

47
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,630
I came back to see you.

48
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,840
We won't be seeing each other

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,840
for a long time.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,360
How long will you be gone?

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,190
Tentatively,

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,870
six months.

53
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,840
When is your flight?

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,430
Tonight.

55
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,360
Sure.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,430
Go if you want.

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,750
Once I settle down over there,

58
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,710
I'll bring you there.

59
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,360
No need.

60
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,590
Yi,

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,910
I've reheated the food.

62
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,360
Come out and eat some.

63
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
If you don't come out soon,

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm leaving.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,750
Yi.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,270
I know

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
we can't

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,510
keep you company every day

69
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,830
like normal parents

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,750
and watch you grow up.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,630
But we're

72
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,600
doing this for our family.

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,800
You might not get it now,

74
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
but you'll understand in the future.

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,070
Won't you come out to see me?

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm fine.

77
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,190
You should leave!

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay.

79
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,040
Take good care of yourself.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,000
When we're not around,

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,310
your uncle will take care of you.

82
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,950
I'll fly back to see you when I'm free.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,560
Jiang Yi,

84
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,680
want to go skating?

85
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,920
Skating?

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,950
I don't know how to skate.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
We're going

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
precisely because
you don't know how to skate.

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,040
They insisted on going,

90
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,430
but I don't know how to skate.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,190
I want you to come
so I won't be the worst.

92
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,920
We rookies can keep each other company.

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
You can choose not to go.

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,430
No.

95
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,680
If I don't go,

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll have to stay at home
to do my homework.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,430
I don't have to do my homework.

98
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm not going.

99
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,680
Does this still count?

100
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,950
Hey,

101
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,240
are you sure
you want to use the wish card

102
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,510
on this?

103
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,630
Yes.

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,070
If you remain silent,
I'll take it as a yes.

105
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,070
See you at the basketball court
under the bridge tomorrow.

106
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't stand me up!

107
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,240
Hey!

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,800
I haven't said yes yet!

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,750
Feet inward...

110
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,870
Like this.

111
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,390
Feet inward.

112
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,240
Feet inward first.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
Skate forward.

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,190
Skate.

115
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,040
Forward.

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,070
Why aren't we moving?

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,190
No, no.

118
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,310
Feet outward.

119
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,750
Yes, yes.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,360
Feet outward.

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,750
Why aren't we moving?

122
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,600
I know.

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,510
Lean forward.

124
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,830
You'll move if you lean forward.

125
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,240
You're moving...

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,630
Wait a minute.

127
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey,

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,680
are you sure you can teach me?

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,000
Besides,

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,920
we haven't been moving at all.

131
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Of course I can teach you.

132
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,430
I learned it specifically.

133
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,480
Forget it.

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,430
I can try it by myself.

135
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,240
Remember the points

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
I told you.

137
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,630
Lean forward.

138
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,120
Feet inward.

139
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,040
Skate forward.

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,630
Go.

141
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,190
Good job, Jiang Yi.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,040
Did you train in secret?

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,950
You skate well.

144
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
He's talented in sports.

145
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,720
Not really.

146
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe I practiced
too many times in my head.

147
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,240
Slow down.

148
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,070
Good job.

149
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,070
You skate well.

150
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,720
Well,

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
I should teach you.

152
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,070
Come on.

153
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,120
Wait!

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,030
What's wrong?

155
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm not ready yet!

156
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Relax.

157
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,870
Your muscles are too tense.

158
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,080
Wait a minute.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,550
My feet.

160
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,270
My feet aren't inward yet!

161
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,870
It's fine.

162
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,030
Wait, wait.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
Feet inward.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,240
Feet inward.

165
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,910
I'm releasing you.

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,600
Feet inward.

167
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,510
Feet inward.

168
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
Feet inward.

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,600
Feet inward.

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,440
Look!

171
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,150
I told you I could skate.

172
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,030
I taught you well.

173
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,750
I was the one who taught you.

174
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,720
Slow down.

175
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
Let Jiang Yi join in.

176
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Come on, Jiang Yi.

177
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,960
Go have fun with them.

178
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
Ignore me.

179
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Okay. I'm joining them.

180
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,790
Go ahead.

181
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,240
Be careful.

182
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,670
Make way, make way.

183
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,120
Are you okay?

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,390
I'm okay.

185
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,320
Are you sure?

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes.

187
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
I'm perfectly fine.

188
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,360
Look.

189
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
I can skate this way.

190
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm fine.

191
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,150
Go on, have fun.

192
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,200
Slow down.

193
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,870
Go easy, Mom.

194
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,240
Bear with it.

195
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,240
It hurts.

196
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,870
Didn't you tell me this morning

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,440
that you were going
to attend Stefanie Sun's fan meeting?

198
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,480
Why did you go skating suddenly?

199
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,080
I suddenly didn't feel like going.

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,390
I thought you hated skating?

201
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,360
You're afraid of falling.

202
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,440
If I'm afraid of falling,
how would I learn?

203
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,550
Besides,

204
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,030
if I can skate,

205
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,000
I can have fun with my best friends.

206
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,870
It's you.

207
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,960
Why?

208
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,030
What do you want?

209
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
This is for you.

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
I had fun today.

211
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,270
I won't take it.

212
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,360
I'll use mine.

213
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,600
Of course.

214
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,080
If that's the case,

215
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,750
you owe me a wish.

216
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,910
I need to think carefully

217
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,320
about what I want you to do for me.

218
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,390
Sure.

219
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,270
I'll leave now.

220
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay.

221
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Mr. Jiang,

222
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,150
I've surveyed this case.

223
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,550
During tomorrow's hearing,

224
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,550
besides showcasing

225
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,630
the initial concept design
for this game,

226
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,510
you can also share

227
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
your thoughts and emotions

228
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,030
when designing this game.

229
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,870
This way, they will be more convinced

230
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,480
that the game is your creative work.

231
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,270
Do you think

232
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,600
there's a high chance
of winning the case?

233
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,000
To be honest,

234
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,840
getting evidence to prove plagiarism
is a challenging task.

235
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,200
I've come across many similar cases.

236
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,440
But that doesn't mean
we don't have a chance of winning.

237
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,360
Tomorrow's hearing

238
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,030
is the key to it.

239
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,440
What if

240
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,440
I don't show up?

241
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,910
You must be there.

242
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,360
You're the litigant.

243
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,120
If you don't show up

244
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,960
and we lose,

245
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,910
our efforts will all be in vain.

246
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,120
Yingzi,

247
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,670
why are you spacing out?

248
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,510
Dad, you...

249
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,720
Please enjoy
the saxophone solo performance.

250
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,790
How was it?

251
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,440
Not bad, right?

252
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,390
You're amazing!

253
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,480
You can join a band.

254
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm already in a band.

255
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,750
What is the name

256
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,120
of your band?

257
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,030
Well, Jonathan Lee and Wakin Chau

258
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,440
have a band of middle-aged men.

259
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,790
What was the name?

260
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,960
Superband.

261
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,630
Our band is Crossband.

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
Crossband?

263
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,670
When can I listen

264
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,480
to Crossband's performance?

265
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Soon.

266
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,270
Mom, you're back.

267
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,150
Yes.

268
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,080
Don't move.

269
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,600
It's rare for you to come home.

270
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
I can't let you work.

271
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,000
It's fine, Mom.

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,270
During the holidays,

273
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,030
I carried dozens of boxes every day.

274
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,720
Take a break.

275
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,630
What if you pull your back?

276
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm fine, Mom.

277
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Let me do this.

278
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,720
Give it to me.

279
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,550
I've carried water my whole life.

280
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,600
My biggest wish

281
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
is that in the future,

282
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,150
you'll never have
to carry a single box of it.

283
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,960
Give it to me.

284
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,480
Mom.

285
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,510
My biggest wish

286
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,750
is that

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,910
you don't have to carry any water, ever.

288
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,120
As long as you live well,

289
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,550
I can do anything.

290
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,750
Come, give it to me.

291
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,320
(Xu.)

292
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,600
You're here.

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
I see you have
new pomelos at the entrance.

294
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,030
Let me pick two.

295
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,120
They've just arrived.

296
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,790
Zhuang Yuan's back.

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
Hello, Madam Liu.

298
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Your mom talks about you every day.

299
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
I heard that you're a doctoral student.

300
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
What a promising young man.

301
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,630
There are only a few doctoral students

302
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,080
in the whole of Hangtian City.

303
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,870
You taught him well.

304
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,320
In the future,

305
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,750
you'll live comfortably.

306
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm a primary school graduate.
What can I teach him?

307
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,000
It was all his own efforts.

308
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,440
Well, you also have contributed
to this achievement.

309
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,240
In "The Legend of White Snake,"

310
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
even the mother of a top scholar

311
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,390
can get a title.

312
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,240
Zhuang Yuan

313
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,790
rhymes with

314
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,790
zhuangyuan, also the top scholar.

315
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,080
Goodbye.

316
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,390
Okay.

317
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,120
Xu, I'll leave you to it.

318
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,790
I'm leaving.

319
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,480
Come again.

320
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Okay.

321
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,390
Mom.

322
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Stop showing me off in front of others.

323
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,750
What if I fail

324
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,670
to graduate?

325
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,510
There are no "ifs."

326
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,870
I'm still looking forward to the day

327
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,200
when I can see you

328
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,750
in your graduation gown.

329
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
I'll be so proud!

330
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,030
(Sir,)

331
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,270
actually, I haven't decided

332
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,550
if pursuing an academic career
is the path I want to take.

333
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,790
It's not just about whether you can
pursue an academic career or not.

334
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,680
It's a matter of
whether or not your thesis can pass

335
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,270
and if you can graduate smoothly,

336
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,310
get it?

337
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm not like Guan Chao's dad,

338
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,070
who isn't even showing up

339
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,240
at his son's wedding,

340
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,550
which is such an important event.

341
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
Why isn't his dad coming?

342
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,750
I think Guan Chao
didn't even invite him.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Ms. Fang,

344
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,110
if there's nothing else,

345
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,160
we're

346
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,720
getting off work.

347
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
You're leaving together?

348
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,960
Yes.

349
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,590
We're having dinner together.

350
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,590
Have fun.

351
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,310
Okay, Ms. Fang.

352
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,030
See you on Monday.

353
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
Are we not going
to ask Ms. Fang to join us for dinner?

354
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you crazy?

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,070
You can ask her if you want.

356
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,000
I won't go.

357
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,720
Slow down.

358
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,640
There are plenty in the pot.

359
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,480
You've all lost weight.

360
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,480
Did you not eat well out there

361
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,790
or are you too tired?

362
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,550
Of course.

363
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,750
Not getting to eat your wontons

364
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,110
made us starve and lose weight.

365
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,440
Isn't Mingyu coming back?

366
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
Mingyu is busy with work.

367
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,109
She hasn't been back in a while.

368
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,309
During New Year,

369
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,829
she was busy with work

370
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:32,999
and didn't come back.

371
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,880
Grandma,

372
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,549
do you want to see her?

373
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,720
Mingyu.

374
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,960
Grandma?

375
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,440
Yingzi and the rest are back.

376
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
You're the only one missing.

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,160
Are you busy?

378
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,830
It's fine.

379
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,270
It's good to be busy.

380
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,960
Do take care of yourself

381
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,270
out there.

382
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
Don't get too tired.

383
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,070
If you want to come back,

384
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,680
you can come back anytime.

385
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,830
I'll cook wontons for you.

386
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,160
Got it, Grandma.

387
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,070
Mingyu,

388
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,440
you're disloyal.

389
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
Even Zhuang Yuan is back.

390
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Why are you not back?

391
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,110
It's fine, Mingyu.

392
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,720
I'll bring
the wedding candy to you later.

393
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,030
Got it.

394
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,880
Mingyu.

395
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,240
Look

396
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,000
at this.

397
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,110
It's late.

398
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,310
Are you still working overtime?

399
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,440
It's nothing.

400
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,310
Grandma missed you

401
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,310
and wanted to see you.

402
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,310
You should get back to work.

403
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,920
Bye.

404
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,240
It'd be great if Yifei were here.

405
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,160
Yes.

406
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,000
I wonder if she's doing well overseas.

407
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Grandma,

408
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,200
performing overseas is her dream.

409
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,160
Otherwise,

410
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,960
she'll definitely come back.

411
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,920
I just saw her.

412
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,790
She's in a great condition.
Neither fat nor skinny.

413
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,510
Don't worry.

414
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,510
She said

415
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,720
when she comes back,

416
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,240
she'll bring us
to watch her performance.

417
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,960
Okay, I won't worry.

418
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,480
You've all grown up.

419
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,830
You're no longer the kids back then.

420
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,880
Of course not.

421
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,070
To you,

422
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,880
we'll always be kids.

423
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,920
Here.

424
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,400
Enjoy your meal.

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,750
Okay.

426
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,480
Let me know if you need anything.

427
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Thank you, sir.

428
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,240
Say,

429
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,110
Yang Fan's family is doing well, right?

430
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,830
Why is she marrying Guan Chao?

431
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
Who knows?

432
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,790
She insists on marrying him,

433
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,270
but Guan Chao

434
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,350
can only provide a dorm on campus.

435
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,590
Wasn't the house renovated
from an old one?

436
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,270
Yes.

437
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,960
Using that as their marital home

438
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,510
is so sad.

439
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,270
Most importantly,

440
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,510
Guan Chao's dad

441
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,270
isn't giving any money.

442
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,960
Will they live a good life?

443
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,550
What does my son getting married
have anything to do with you?

444
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,030
Guan,

445
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,720
I didn't see you there.

447
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
I think you didn't see me on purpose.

448
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,200
Why are you scolding me?

449
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,830
I'm hitting you.

450
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,070
How dare you?

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,640
Guan.

452
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,960
Guan.

453
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,030
What are you doing?

454
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't stop me!

455
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,750
Yang Fan's call.

456
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,590
I need to answer this.

457
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
What are you talking about?

458
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,750
So what if I hit you?

459
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,110
I'm going to kick you!

460
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,440
Dad,

461
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,270
what are you doing?

462
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,350
Is your dad mentally ill?

463
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,590
We were chatting,

464
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,310
but he suddenly came over and hit me.

465
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,440
Chatting? Nonsense!

466
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,960
Dad.

467
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
Don't you know?

468
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,270
Dad!

469
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,880
Can you stop?

470
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,200
Dad,

471
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,270
let's go back.

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Yes, go back.

473
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,590
Did you know what he said?

474
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,480
Did you know?

475
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,680
Okay...

476
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,750
Are you hurt?

477
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,310
I'm really sorry.

478
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,590
He acts this way when he's drunk.

479
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,070
That doesn't mean
he can hit me for no reason!

480
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,270
Are you okay?

481
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,640
His head is bleeding.

482
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
How is he fine?

483
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm really sorry.

484
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,750
If you need us to compensate

485
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,590
any medical expenses,

486
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,480
please let us know.

487
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
Fine, then.

488
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
Are you Chen Chen's parents?

489
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,350
Mr. Guan.

490
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,510
Yes, it's me.

491
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,110
Since my son is in your class,

492
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
we won't make a police report.

493
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,440
No.

494
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,030
If this happens again,

495
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,030
call the police

496
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,440
and let them handle the matter.

497
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,590
What are you talking about?

498
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,510
Let's go.

499
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,310
Didn't you say
the monthly exam was canceled?

500
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes,

501
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,200
it was canceled.

502
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,510
But why did Han Dong's son

503
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,310
ask him to sign the exam papers?

504
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,400
I don't know.

505
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,510
You've grown up, huh?

506
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,550
Not only are you
failing in your studies,

507
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,550
but now you've also
learned to lie, right?

508
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,830
I work hard to provide you
with food and shelter,

509
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
and this is how you treat me?

510
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,680
Is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

511
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,030
No.

512
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll give you another chance.

513
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,350
Are you hiding anything else from me?

514
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,000
No. Really.

515
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,750
Let me ask you.

516
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,510
What are you doing
in Jiangzhou this weekend?

517
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,510
Were you looking for this?

518
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,110
Give it back to me!

519
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,110
Why are you going to Jiangzhou?

520
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,030
Give it back to me!

521
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,240
Why are you going to Jiangzhou?

522
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,430
You want to find your mom, right?

523
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,960
Your mom doesn't want you anymore.

524
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,000
She doesn't want our family anymore.

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
What are you doing?

526
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,680
Give it to me!

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
Move!

528
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,350
Stop dreaming!

529
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,960
If it weren't for you,

530
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
would my mom have left?

531
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,440
How dare you talk to me this way?

532
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,750
Was I wrong?

533
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,200
Mom left because you hit her.

534
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,640
If it weren't for me,

535
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,720
she would've left ages ago.

536
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,880
Hit me!

537
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,750
Your abuse destroyed our family!

538
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,270
How dare you talk to me this way?

539
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,400
Say that again!

540
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,510
No one can stand staying with you.

541
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,720
I regretted

542
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,920
not leaving with Mom back then.

543
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,830
Let go!

544
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,960
Stand right there!

545
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,790
Let go!

546
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Mom.

547
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,000
Chao,

548
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,030
what's wrong?

549
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,720
Did something happen?

550
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,920
Nothing.

551
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,000
I haven't called you in a while.

552
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,200
I want to talk to you.

553
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,000
Did your dad hit you again?

554
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,880
No.

555
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,550
I'm taller

556
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,310
and bulkier than him now.

557
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,550
Even if he wants to hit me, he can't.

558
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Good.

559
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,030
How are you doing recently?

560
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,070
I've been working hard.

561
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,030
My 100-meter record
has improved by 0.2 seconds.

562
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,640
Besides,

563
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,000
I...

564
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,830
Mom? Mom!

565
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,550
Be good, Xing.

566
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,350
Stop crying.

567
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,510
I'll be there soon.

568
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,510
Guan Chao,

569
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,680
I'll call you later.

570
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,480
I need to go now.

571
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,240
I know you're still awake.

572
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,240
Do you have any shame?

573
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,830
Others have to clean up your mess

574
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,400
every day.

575
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,350
That's enough,

576
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,400
Chao.

577
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,030
Stop talking.

578
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,640
Yang Fan,

579
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
someone who pretends
to be asleep will never wake up.

580
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,720
You deserve
to live in this rubbish dump.

581
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,590
That's enough.

582
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,440
After my mom left,

583
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,510
he never woke up.

584
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,550
Besides drinking and fighting,

585
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,640
what else can you do?

586
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Stop, Chao.

587
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,200
I must be crazy

588
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
to care for you.

589
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
I shouldn't have cared about you.

590
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Stop talking.

591
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,480
If you want to lie down,
don't get up, ever!

592
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,160
Look at you.

593
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,590
You drink and fight every day.

594
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,830
Do you even look like a father?

595
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,200
Guan Chao, stop it.

596
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,790
He knows he's wrong.

597
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay, I'll stop.

598
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
I'll just ignore you!

599
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
(Whether staying at home)

600
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,000
(or outside,)

601
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,030
(it turns out
that worries are the norm of life.)

602
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
(Time and distance)

603
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,680
(have finally taught us
to face such moments alone.)

604
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,070
(However, I often find myself missing)

605
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,030
(the times when we shared burdens)

606
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,030
(and accompanied each other,)

607
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,920
(as well as the little surprises)

608
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,310
(hidden in ordinary moments.)

609
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,480
Ding Ye's book is amazing.

610
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,790
I can't believe
it's an alternate reality.

611
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
I want to read his new book.

612
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,440
Mingyu,

613
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,590
let's go to the bookstore this weekend.

614
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,550
Jiaojiao,

615
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,920
where is Mingyu?

616
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,350
I didn't see her.

617
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,070
Zhu Baoming.

618
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,920
Where is Zhuang Yuan?

619
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,030
I don't know.

620
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,400
Grandma,

621
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,510
did you see Yifei and the rest?

622
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,350
You didn't come back with them?

623
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,110
No.

624
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,750
They disappeared.

625
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,110
That... That's strange.

626
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,120
I heard

627
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
they went to Jiang Yi's house.

628
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,070
Why would they go to Jiang Yi's house?

629
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,030
I don't know.

630
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Got it.

631
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,480
Grandma, I'm leaving.

632
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,440
Slow... Slow down!

633
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,030
Ugh, Jiang Yi.

634
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,160
I told you to change the light bulb
but you didn't.

635
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,920
How lazy of you.

636
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,070
Jiang Yi.

637
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,830
Jiang Yi?

638
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Jiang Yi.

639
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,960
Jiang Yi, don't scare me.

640
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,030
Jiang Yi!

641
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,510
Happy birthday!

642
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,350
You...

643
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,270
You all...

644
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,790
What is this?

645
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,960
Are you happy?

646
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes.

647
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

648
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,680
I thought you went to have fun

649
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,720
without letting me know.

650
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
If we had told you beforehand,
would that be a surprise?

651
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,350
Okay.

652
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,070
I thought

653
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,880
I wouldn't get
to celebrate my birthday this year.

654
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,960
My mom told me to focus on my studies.

655
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,750
I had no idea I'd be able
to celebrate my birthday.

656
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,110
You didn't see her.

657
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,350
She was about to cry

658
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,510
when she was told
she couldn't celebrate her birthday.

659
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,160
She said it was fine not to celebrate.

660
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,510
There are 42 people.

661
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,920
You ranked 35th in the exam.

662
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,000
You scored 92 in Math?

663
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,750
I passed.

664
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,590
You're good at comforting yourself, huh?

665
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,160
But I scored well in my language exam.

666
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,240
I scored 138.

667
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,590
That's the only subject you did well in.

668
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,350
Why didn't you learn from Zhuang Yuan?

669
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,680
He achieves first place
in exams every year.

670
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,200
How could you compare me to Zhuang Yuan?

671
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,310
Jiang Yi is here.

672
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,680
How could you compare to him?

673
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,160
Jiang Yi,

674
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,200
I didn't mean that.

675
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
I was too upset by her results.

676
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,110
Huang Yingzi,

677
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,590
let me tell you.

678
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,790
You won't get
to celebrate your birthday this year.

679
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,830
Focus on your studies.

680
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,030
Be steady.

681
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,270
This is my 18th birthday.

682
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,310
Why can't I celebrate it?

683
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,720
So what if you're 18?

684
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,880
You're in senior year.

685
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,270
You need to study hard
and prepare for college exams,

686
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:53,960
get it?

687
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,310
It's impossible
to hold a grand celebration

688
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,720
like the past years.

689
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,350
No.

690
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,240
No...

691
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,110
I just want to celebrate my birthday.

692
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,030
There's time.
I want to celebrate my birthday.

693
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,750
Talk properly.

694
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,350
What's wrong
with celebrating my birthday?

695
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,160
Do you hear me?

696
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,240
Talk properly.

697
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,070
Remember your promise
before school started?

698
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,960
You told me, "Don't worry, Mom.

699
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,680
I'll rank in the top ten
in the exams.

700
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,240
I'll do well!"

701
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,640
Did you forget?

702
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
I didn't forget.

703
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,920
I said that.

704
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,720
Fine.

705
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,590
I keep my word.

706
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,680
I won't celebrate my birthday, then.

707
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,240
Good.

708
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,510
Excellent.

709
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,160
Are you really not celebrating it?

710
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,030
Yes.

711
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,550
When I enter college,

712
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
I'll celebrate my birthday every day.

713
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,680
Good.

714
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,160
You don't need to waste money,

715
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,070
right?

716
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,640
(Ande look at her now.)

717
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,070
Does it seem like
she's okay with not celebrating it?

718
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,880
For girls,

719
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,440
when they say "it's okay,"
it usually means it's not okay,

720
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
right?

721
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,110
But Jiang,

722
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,310
I didn't know

723
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,550
you knew girls that well.

724
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,960
In the future, you won't have
to worry about finding a girlfriend.

725
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,440
Zhuang Yuan,

726
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,000
it's not that Jiang Yi knows girls well,

727
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,110
he just knows Huang Yingzi well.

728
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,440
What do you mean?

729
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you saying that I'm not a girl?

730
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
I know you well.

731
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,720
Since young,

732
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
you're a tomboy who doesn't wear skirts.

733
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,160
Guan Chao,

734
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,110
do you have a death wish?

735
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,310
I didn't mean it.

736
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,070
I swear.

737
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,880
That's tactful of you.

738
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,830
But

739
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,830
where did you get

740
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,440
so many cute words?

741
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,830
Jiang said

742
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,720
you like

743
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,270
shiny stuff.

744
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,960
The three of us

745
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,640
stayed up for the entire night
to prepare this.

746
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Unbelievable.

747
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
Thank you.

748
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,480
I'm touched.

749
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
I like it a lot.

750
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,480
I announce

751
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,270
that the surprise is a success!

752
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,920
Now,

753
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,070
is it time to open gifts?

754
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,830
Here.

755
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,350
This can be installed
on the front of your bicycle.

756
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,960
You won't have to worry about the lack
of streetlights when riding at night.

757
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,510
Thank you.

758
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,550
It's perfect for my Blue.

759
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,840
You can blast Stefanie Sun's songs

760
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,510
anytime you want.

761
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,880
I'll never have to fight with my dad

762
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,000
for the speaker anymore.

763
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,590
Don't play the music too loud

764
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,110
and disturb me when I play games.

765
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,960
Consider it an honor
that my precious speaker

766
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,320
is playing music for you.

767
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,400
Here, look at mine.

768
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you.

769
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,480
Ding Ye's "Noctiluca."

770
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,230
My favorite author!

771
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,150
I know you, right?

772
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,920
Isn't your favorite author

773
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,630
Kafka?

774
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,440
I mean the one who's alive.

775
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,760
Is there a difference?

776
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,920
Of course.

777
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,030
I admire Kafka

778
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,510
for his literary work.

779
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,510
Ding Ye is different.

780
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,110
He lives on earth,

781
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,920
so I always feel like one day
I will get to know him.

782
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,880
We'll get to chat.

783
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,280
Perhaps

784
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,190
we can be good friends.

785
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,110
Hey,

786
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,840
Ding Ye might not be willing

787
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,190
to be your friend.

788
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,150
What do you know?

789
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm speechless.

790
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,670
Thank you.

791
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,800
You're welcome.

792
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,550
This is big.

793
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,880
Thank you.

794
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,070
What is this for?

795
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
Let me tell you.

796
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,590
This is not an ordinary globe.

797
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,960
How is it special?

798
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,960
It...

799
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,920
You'll know in the future.

800
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,710
Thank you.

801
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,400
I will take good care

802
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,110
of this special globe.

803
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,920
Hey.

804
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
My gift.

805
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,400
Jiang Yi,

806
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,480
can I borrow your room?

807
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,400
What for?

808
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,190
You'll find out soon.

809
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,440
Hurry.

810
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,030
What is it?

811
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,550
What gift?

812
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,710
Wait here.

813
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,150
Come on.

814
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,630
Why is it so mysterious?

815
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,480
Go in.

816
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Well, what gift is it?

817
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,440
Come on out.

818
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,190
Hurry.

819
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,230
How is it?

820
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,360
Isn't she pretty?

821
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,070
I don't look good in dresses, right?

822
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,280
Of course not!

823
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
You're gorgeous!

824
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,030
Huang,

825
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,400
that was great.

826
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,590
Your lung capacity.

827
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,880
Have you been practicing lately?

828
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,070
Not really.

829
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,480
My children are working hard.

830
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
We have to

831
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,760
work hard too, right?

832
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,920
Here, have this.

833
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,400
Fang,

834
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
is Mingyu really not coming back

835
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,840
to attend Guan Chao's wedding?

836
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,320
She's not coming back.

837
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,110
She's busy with work

838
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,190
and needs to go on a business trip.

839
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,840
Our children have grown up.

840
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,510
Let them make their own decisions.

841
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,360
Yes.

842
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,030
They are adults now.

843
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,070
They are very busy.

844
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,360
But

845
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,030
I believe their relationship
won't be affected because of this,

846
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,920
right?

847
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,030
Of course.

848
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,400
They have us as their example.

849
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,840
We're their example.

850
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,280
Actually,
instead of worrying about the kids,

851
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
shouldn't we figure out a way

852
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,030
to bring Guan to the wedding?

853
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,320
It doesn't make sense for a father
to not attend his son's wedding.

854
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,000
If Guan is there,

855
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,360
count us lucky
if he doesn't cause a ruckus.

856
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,190
Well,

857
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
Guan is hot-tempered.

858
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,150
But

859
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,670
it isn't right that his closest relative
isn't at the wedding,

860
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,400
right?

861
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,280
Drink tea.

862
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
Six characters.

863
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,590
Look at our Yingzi.

864
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,760
She's almost thirty

865
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,880
but isn't dating

866
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
or finding a boyfriend.

867
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm anxious.

868
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,440
Whenever I urge her,

869
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,590
she says, "Mingyu is not in a hurry.

870
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,150
Why should I be in a hurry?"

871
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,190
You all

872
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,880
should help me out.

873
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,710
If there are any suitable men,

874
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,550
hurry up

875
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,590
and introduce them to me.

876
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,280
Sure.

877
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,030
There is one available.

878
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,030
Who?

879
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,510
The doctoral student.

880
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,510
Zhuang Yuan?

881
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,920
I remember something.

882
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,230
During the summer of the Olympics,

883
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,550
I saw Huang Yingzi

884
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,960
wearing a purple dress.

885
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,480
She was all dressed up.

886
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,800
I think she went on a date.

887
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,480
I turned back and took a look.

888
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,360
Guess what?

889
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,000
It was Zhuang Yuan
waiting for Huang Yingzi

890
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,150
by the side of the road.

891
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,320
Zhuang Yuan?

892
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,630
Hong.

893
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,670
Ling.

894
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,510
I'm exhausted.

895
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,880
Why? What's the rush?

896
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,920
Is Zhuang Yuan around?

897
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,710
No.

898
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,880
He should be with Yingzi and Guan Chao.

899
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,840
Do you need to talk to him?

900
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,480
No, not him.

901
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm here to talk to you.

902
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,400
How rare.

903
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,710
Yingzi,

904
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,400
you're up early.

905
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Every morning, I wake up early

906
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,150
to go to work, okay?

907
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,190
Good.

908
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,800
Eat this.

909
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
After breakfast, let's go to the cafe.

910
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,920
Why are we going to the cafe?

911
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,110
You don't even drink coffee.

912
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,150
Young people like coffee, right?

913
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,800
Don't ask questions.

914
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
You'll find out soon.

915
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,880
I can't today.

916
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,630
I have something else to do.

917
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
What is it?

918
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,190
You'll find out soon.

919
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,800
After you're done,

920
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,030
come to the cafe to look for me.

921
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,000
How mysterious.

922
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,440
Okay, then.

923
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,000
Yesterday, I told Yang Fan

924
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,480
I won't be there.

925
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,710
Who told you I came here today

926
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,480
to invite you to the wedding?

927
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,670
If you go,

928
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm afraid
that you'll get drunk and hit others.

929
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,070
Why are you here, then?

930
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm here to tell you

931
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,550
you started a fight
at the restaurant yesterday

932
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,230
and need to compensate the owner.

933
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,360
You know that, right?

934
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,320
Mr. Fan said,

935
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,630
as you're neighbors,

936
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,030
he'll only ask you
to compensate 1000 yuan.

937
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,070
Nonsense!

938
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,150
Are those old tables and chairs

939
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,510
worth that much?

940
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,480
I'll go talk to him.

941
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,710
Calm down.

942
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,710
I've already

943
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,800
paid him on behalf of you.

944
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,360
Think of it
as my wedding gift to Guan Chao.

945
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,000
Also,

946
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,880
the customer you hit yesterday

947
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
is the parent of Guan Chao's student.

948
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,360
You know that, right?

949
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,840
How would I know who he is?

950
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,190
Why is this so troublesome?

951
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,110
You broke his nose bridge.

952
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,000
If he informs the school about this,

953
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Guan Chao will lose his job.

954
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,400
It isn't that serious.

955
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,670
He only bled a little, right?

956
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,000
Besides, he also retaliated.

957
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,110
Tell him

958
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,880
to come to me if he wants anything.

959
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,960
Don't trouble my son.

960
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,190
Are you showing concern
for your son now?

961
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,400
Don't worry.

962
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,670
The problem is solved.

963
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,840
Why are you here, then?

964
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,280
I forgot.

965
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm here to deliver a suit to you.

966
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,070
I bought you a suit.

967
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,230
I thought

968
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,070
you'd be able to wear it at the wedding.

969
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,230
Yet, since you're not going,

970
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,800
it doesn't matter anymore.

971
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,320
I'll just leave it here.

972
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,510
Actually, it's fine if you don't go.

973
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,000
It's not a big deal if you're not there.

974
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,320
But at the wedding,

975
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,840
the bride's family members
will be at the main table,

976
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,710
including her parents.

977
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,670
On the groom's side,
there won't be anyone.

978
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,360
There might be

979
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,440
a few more gossiping people
like those from yesterday.

980
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,550
They will gossip

981
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,550
just like yesterday.

982
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,030
Who gave them the guts? I...

983
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,710
Why? Are you going to fight them?

984
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
I...

985
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,590
Mr. Guan,

986
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,710
I know

987
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,190
that deep down,

988
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,000
you actually care about Guan Chao.

989
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,360
You started a fight yesterday

990
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,440
because those two people

991
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,510
were gossiping about Guan Chao

992
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,000
and Yang Fan, right?

993
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,480
If you care about him,

994
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,070
why don't you tell him in person?

995
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,800
What for?

996
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,760
Well, I...

997
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,070
Both of you are funny.

998
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,320
You care about each other

999
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
but refuse to say anything.

1000
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,400
Yesterday, to take care of you,

1001
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,840
Guan Chao didn't even
attend the wedding rehearsal.

1002
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,670
He didn't say it out loud,

1003
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,710
but I know

1004
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,190
he wants you

1005
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,550
to attend his wedding.

1006
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,440
Okay.

1007
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,230
I've said everything.

1008
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,190
I'm taking my leave now.

1009
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,230
You can decide

1010
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,800
whether or not
you want to wear this suit.

1011
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,840
Goodbye, Mr. Guan.

1012
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,800
Goodbye, Yingzi.
