00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,600
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,310
(You came back empty-handed.)

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,280
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,400
It was just an umbrella.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
What is there to talk about?

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,150
Fine. Whatever you like.

8
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,280
Have you eaten yet?

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,350
If not, I'll treat you to supper.

10
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,070
Hold your horse.

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,680
This is so unlike you.

12
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,840
If you want to share,

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
I can lend my reluctant ear.

14
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,590
Fire away. What have you two done?

15
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,280
We watched a movie.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
That is good.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
What movie?

18
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,430
"Notting Hill".

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,760
Good choice.

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,680
Then?

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,030
Then, I sent her home.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Is that all?

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,310
No holding hands?

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,870
No confession?

25
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,710
Dude.

26
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,430
You haven't waited over ten years

27
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,710
just for a platonic relationship

28
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,870
with Huang Yingzi?

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,400
What is a platonic relationship?

30
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
You are a doctoral student.

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,750
How come you have a dirty mind?

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,030
I'm a doctoral student, not a monk.

33
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,680
However, Jiang,

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,280
I find it quite difficult
to imagine the scene

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,240
when Yingzi and you go that far.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
What scene?

37
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,310
Be frank with you.

38
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,310
Do you not know

39
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,120
how to date Huang Yingzi

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
because you are
too familiar with each other

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,870
after being friends
for more than twenty years?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,750
No.

43
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,590
Why are you avoiding her, then?

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
Fine. I admit.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,470
I have seen every side of hers

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,310
except when she was
still in short trousers.

47
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,150
But

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,310
I'm confused about

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,150
the sudden change
in our relationship.

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,150
Wait, no.

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,280
Hello.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,680
Mom, this is urgent.

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,240
What happened?

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Something big.

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
What has happened?

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,030
Don't scare me.

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,000
What happened? Tell me now.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,190
I need your recipe.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Mr. Feng, did you ask for me?

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,280
Come in.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,960
Have a seat.

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,470
The company reviewed your performance

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,360
of the past year.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
We all think

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
that you have done a great job.

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,630
However, some are concerned

67
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,390
that you are not familiar with
the company's business

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,630
because you have been taking charge

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,430
of the HR department.

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,070
Those with this concern

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,600
may not be aware of my resume.

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,720
I was in the Business Department
when I first joined the company

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
before my four years
in the HR department.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
I have basic knowledge of it.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
Excellent.

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,160
Business, HR, and management,

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,360
you have been involved in all these.

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,630
Like I said,

79
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,070
you are the best
deputy general manager candidate.

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Is there another candidate?

81
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,430
Yes.

82
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,680
It is Guo Kai
from the Procurement Department.

83
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,000
The other higher-ups reckon

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,830
that Guo Kai is more experienced
in business.

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,920
But I have faith in you.

86
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,160
So I persuaded them

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,510
to let both of you report on your work.

88
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,630
Understood.

89
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,070
So this is the final

90
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,000
between you and Guo Kai.

91
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,390
This is unexpected, right?

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Ms. Fang outperformed

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
the other candidates at last.

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
But the result isn't out yet.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Is your news accurate?

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,630
She should get it.

97
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,870
Ms. Fang may be cold,

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,390
but she is capable.

99
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,270
But I think

100
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,600
Mr. Guo won't be defeated

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
so easily.

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,630
Everyone here knows

103
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,630
that he has been aiming
for that position.

104
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,360
This is going to be interesting.

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Mingyu.

106
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,070
You promised to cook for me
a long time ago.

107
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,120
Why did you suddenly think of it today?

108
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,600
I have already proposed to you.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,560
I should treat you even better.

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,560
Is that so?

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,390
Or are you afraid
that I compete with you?

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,800
Of course not.

113
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,510
I just think

114
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,040
that we are family.

115
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Internal competition is unnecessary.

116
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,120
How can you call that
internal competition?

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,190
Guo Kai, I always hope the best for you.

118
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,240
I hope you can get the position
of deputy general manager.

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,190
This has been our goal.

120
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,480
But now,

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,070
I'm also given this opportunity.

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,950
Don't you hope the same for me?

123
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,920
Of course I do.

124
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,000
However,

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,950
between us,

126
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,630
we can find

127
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,360
the best solution.

128
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,430
We are the only candidates now.

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,950
No matter who would be chosen
by the company,

130
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,750
it is the best solution, no?

131
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,310
Here.

132
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,000
Has it occurred to you

133
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,950
that everyone in the office
is watching us?

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Are you not afraid

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,390
that they might find out something
about us?

136
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,560
We can tell everyone about us.

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,630
Let's give each other an opportunity

138
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,720
and report our performance.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
The winner gets the position,

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
while the loser resigns.

141
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
You said

142
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,720
we are comrades and partners.

143
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
The current situation

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,630
is a trial for our relationship, right?

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,630
Here.

146
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,720
Mingyu, I have thought about it.

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,870
I feel that you...

148
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
Hello, Yingzi.

149
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,000
All right, I will be right there.

150
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,550
Sorry.

151
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,240
Something came up.

152
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
I can't eat with you.

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,000
How about this?

154
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,870
Your outfit is rather simple.

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,550
This pair.

156
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,870
I will take these.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank you, Mingyu.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
Why thank me?

159
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,390
That time when I went to a movie
with Jiang Yi,

160
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,960
I borrowed your makeup.

161
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,750
This time, I asked you to dress me up.

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,840
Of course I have to thank you.

163
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,390
To be honest,

164
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,960
though I never said it,

165
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,670
over the years,

166
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,870
you are the most beautiful one

167
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,000
in my heart.

168
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,080
I know that.

169
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,630
I'm always a sweet girl.

170
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,910
Then, you are sweat pea.

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
You are always with a cold face.

172
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,150
I will call you cold girl.

173
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,270
You know what?

174
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,150
When I was recruiting,

175
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,390
those fresh male graduates

176
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,840
preferred cold girls like me.

177
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,790
I feel guilty after saying this.

178
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,440
But seriously,

179
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
I used to think

180
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,789
that you, me, and Yifei

181
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,119
are considered pretty

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,670
in Hangtian City.

183
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,480
But when I came to big cities, I realize

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,720
that there are too many pretty girls

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,960
here.

186
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
Nothing is special about me.

187
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,750
Yes, we should be realistic.

188
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,630
Anyway, I'm quite happy

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
that the romance I have been witnessing
over these years

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,000
is going to realize.

191
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,840
Have you prepared things

192
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,600
for your date?

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,670
Yes.

194
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,910
Pork rib, cured meat, and green beans.

195
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,150
But the fermented chili sauce...

196
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,960
No, not this.

197
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm not asking about the dish.

198
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
What are you asking about?

199
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,840
Luckily, I prepared something for you.

200
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,000
It should be a candlelight dinner,
right?

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,360
I brought you candlesticks.

202
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,360
And also for a tipsy moment.

203
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,080
There is one moment

204
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,360
I find that you look like my mom.

205
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,390
What is wrong with me?

206
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
Both of you have dragged this
for so long.

207
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,080
Can't you speed up a bit?

208
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
I think we are fine the way we are now.

209
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,870
Nowadays, young people

210
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,910
move quickly

211
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,630
in relationships.

212
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,440
They ask someone out one minute
and break up the next.

213
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,870
We two have been friends
for more than ten years.

214
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,390
If we really get together,

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,030
we probably won't break up.

216
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
One step at a time.

217
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,720
You are naughty.

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Enough about me.

219
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,870
Talk about you.

220
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,670
How is the wedding preparation going?

221
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,870
Everything is good.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,910
Are you ready to get married?

223
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,200
Why? You can't bear to leave me?

224
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,440
No, I can't.

225
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,390
Like I said, everything is fine.

226
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,670
Besides, what makes me happiest is

227
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
that all of you are here.

228
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,480
Good.

229
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,550
Whatever choice you make,

230
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,870
I will respect it.

231
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,080
If so, you will be my bridesmaid.

232
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,720
Bridesmaid? No problem.

233
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,720
You are here. Come on in.

234
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,320
Why is it so dark in here?

235
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,270
Power failure?

236
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
Sorry.

237
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
I will switch it off.

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,080
No need.

239
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,960
Just leave it.

240
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,480
Take a pew.

241
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,600
Do you need any help?

242
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,870
No, it's okay.

243
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,150
You won't be helpful.

244
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,630
Go sit over there.

245
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,120
Wait.

246
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,480
Why did you keep me away?

247
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
I didn't.

248
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
This is my secret recipe.

249
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
It is confidential.

250
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,390
What... What are those?

251
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,910
Did you

252
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,200
ask this secret recipe from your mom

253
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
last night?

254
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,080
How could that be?

255
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,750
Just sit and wait.

256
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,840
I will give you my best shot.

257
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,960
To be honest,

258
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,550
this is your best dish.

259
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,390
Maybe

260
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,270
you don't have
to cook fancy things.

261
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,510
I didn't expect them

262
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,510
to turn into coal balls.

263
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,000
I prepared this dinner

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
for a long time.

265
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,270
I asked Mingyu

266
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,030
to choose the earrings for me.

267
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,510
What has it got to with the dinner?

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,390
Oh, I have wine.

269
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,030
Oh, yeah.

270
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,910
Zhuang Yuan told me

271
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,840
we needed some wine

272
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,150
during the date...

273
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,120
So Zhuang Yuan is your wingman?

274
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,030
Since you are here,

275
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,270
do me a favor.

276
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,150
What is it about?

277
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,910
Fix my laptop.

278
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you remember this?

279
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,120
Wicked.

280
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,670
You still keep this with you.

281
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,960
This is an antique.

282
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
Of course I have to keep it.

283
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,030
But I can't switch it on.

284
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,320
Can you help me?

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,510
Well...

286
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
It is on.

287
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,510
(Huang Yingzi.)

288
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,480
(I like you.)

289
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,670
At first, I wondered

290
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,440
what the prize would be.

291
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,720
It turned out to be an animation clip.

292
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,840
What is wrong with animation clips?

293
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,390
It took me one month

294
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,320
to make this.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,670
Jiang Yi.

296
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,080
After the exam,

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,480
you were angry

298
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,080
that I sent you away like that, right?

299
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,910
I was a little angry.

300
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,600
But when I thought about it,

301
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,870
I could understand.

302
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,720
I was quite impressed by you.

303
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,510
Impressed?

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You must have thought of a lot of ways

305
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,080
but you had no choice to do that

306
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
in the end.

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,720
Probably, you must have thought

308
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
of persuading me to repeat the exam,

309
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,400
or asking me to apply
to universities in Beijing.

310
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,160
But I believe you must have done
some research.

311
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,720
The foreign game industry
started earlier

312
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,510
and was more mature.

313
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,310
That's why you chose to send me away.

314
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,720
Maybe you were more upset than me.

315
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,200
I had no reason to be angry with you.

316
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,240
No?

317
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,590
But you left without a word.

318
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,070
Because...

319
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,440
Guan Chao.

320
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,070
You can have this laptop.

321
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,830
This is the best equipped.

322
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,400
All games are installed.

323
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,310
You wanted this laptop so much,
didn't you?

324
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,350
It is all yours now.

325
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
Zhuang Yuan.

326
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,880
I have treasured these resin models.

327
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,790
I'm giving them to you now.

328
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,750
They can keep Zoro company.

329
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,240
Jiang Yi, you are leaving for the UK.

330
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
It's not like you are dying.

331
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,270
You are talking like
you are giving your last words.

332
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,310
Touch wood!

333
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,880
What are you saying?

334
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,440
Say touch wood.

335
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,240
Touch wood!

336
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm just telling you things
that you need to know.

337
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,720
I'm worried you might
be short of help

338
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,030
and could get beaten up

339
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,790
after I leave.

340
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,349
I'm worried

341
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,789
that you might be talked down
during arguments

342
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,160
because you are not fluent in English,

343
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,350
and we couldn't stand up for you.

344
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,160
Jiang, you have told us so many things.

345
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,310
Did you forget the most important thing?

346
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,270
He is right.

347
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,029
We will take care of this stuff.

348
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,550
But what about Yingzi?

349
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,240
(Congratulations, Huang Yingzi.)

350
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,960
(Are you ready for a surprise?)

351
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,440
(Coming up is your prize.)

352
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,200
(Huang Yingzi.)

353
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,350
(I like you.)

354
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,830
(Are you really not bidding her goodbye?)

355
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,310
(She will hate you)

356
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,400
(if you don't say goodbye to her.)

357
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,070
(I know.)

358
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,960
(But I'm afraid that I can't leave)

359
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,550
(after seeing her.)

360
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,070
Give it to me.

361
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,880
Yi.

362
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,480
Do you want to say goodbye to Yingzi?

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,720
It's okay.

364
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,350
Jiang Yi!

365
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,270
Jiang Yi!

366
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,680
Jiang Yi!

367
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Jiang Yi!

368
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,030
Jiang Yi!

369
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,030
Jiang Yi!

370
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,240
Jiang Yi!

371
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,510
Jiang Yi!

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
Jiang Yi!

373
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,720
Jiang Yi!

374
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,160
Jiang Yi!

375
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,440
Jiang Yi!

376
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,310
Jiang Yi!

377
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,070
Jiang Yi!

378
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,030
I cleared all the levels.

379
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,480
I like you too.

380
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,110
I like you too!

381
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,030
Study well.

382
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,270
I will wait for you.

383
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,830
I will wait for you.

384
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Did you know

385
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,200
I almost broke my legs
riding to catch up with you?

386
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,160
No matter how hard I shouted your name,
you didn't stop the car.

387
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,790
Yes.

388
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,160
If I had known that,

389
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
I would've definitely stopped the car.

390
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,750
But if that had happened,

391
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,510
I wouldn't have been able to leave.

392
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,030
So you left for twelve years.

393
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,680
As if you didn't care about anything.

394
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
Not at all.

395
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,960
I was afraid I would bring you shame

396
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,350
if I couldn't succeed.

397
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,680
Jiang Yi.

398
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,750
What do you consider success?

399
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
Like what you imagined.

400
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,270
I would become an amazing game designer

401
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,720
and create an astonishing game.

402
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,830
Look at me.

403
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,830
I have never encountered a game

404
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,440
I could play over a hundred times.

405
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,680
None of the games

406
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,240
has made me laugh and cry.

407
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
But your first game

408
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,200
managed that.

409
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,790
This is truly amazing.

410
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,590
Are you praising me or insulting me?

411
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,160
Half and half.

412
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,000
So now, it is time

413
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,640
to summarize this game.

414
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,480
Right.

415
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,640
If I'm to summarize

416
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,200
this game,

417
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,440
I think

418
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,350
the visual is not refined.

419
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,440
Look at the whale's eyes,

420
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,030
they should be thinner.

421
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,680
Jiang Yi.

422
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,790
Is this the point?

423
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
No?

424
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,240
Point taken.

425
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
You are meticulous about the details.

426
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,350
Something is wrong with the font,

427
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,920
right?

428
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
The word should roll...

429
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
I will give you one last chance.

430
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,960
What is the point?

431
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,070
If you don't tell me now,

432
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,920
I will leave.

433
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,310
Isn't this your home?

434
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,350
I know what it is.

435
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,680
I know.

436
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,310
Tell me.

437
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
The point is...

438
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,440
Huang Yingzi.

439
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,030
I...

440
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,880
I...

441
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Chloe.

442
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,310
It is fine. Answer the call.

443
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,110
Yes?

444
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,480
Where are you?

445
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,790
I'm having dinner.

446
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,440
What is wrong?

447
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,030
Come to the office right now.

448
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,790
This is urgent.

449
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
All right, got it.

450
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,640
What is that?

451
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,480
Is everything all right?

452
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,030
Yes.

453
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,240
It is an emergency meeting.

454
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,960
I need to go.

455
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,720
Is it about "The Maze"?

456
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,070
I will go with you.

457
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,790
It's alright.

458
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,920
I will go myself.

459
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,790
It is fine.

460
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,590
I can go with you.

461
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,590
I will wait at the entrance.

462
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,680
You don't have to.

463
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,880
Don't worry.

464
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,400
I will be back soon.

465
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,310
You don't have to come back anymore.

466
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,590
(Mr. Zhao.)

467
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,160
Why did you call me here so late?

468
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Here's the situation.

469
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,590
Recently,

470
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,510
I have noticed

471
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,550
the power consumption
of the company's devices

472
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,510
has increased substantially.

473
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,310
But the volume of
our design and rendering

474
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,830
hasn't changed much.

475
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,920
So I examined it

476
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,160
last night.

477
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,550
I discovered

478
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,030
that Jiang Yi's "The Maze"

479
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,310
was the main reason
for the energy consumption.

480
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,590
In the system folder of "The Maze",

481
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,240
there is an encrypted folder.

482
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,790
None of us

483
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,240
could access it.

484
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So I have reason to suspect

485
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,830
that someone is using
the company's computing power

486
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,070
for their own purposes.

487
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,070
We promised

488
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,590
to offer Jiang Yi autonomy,

489
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,200
but

490
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,920
he has to tell us
about everything he does.

491
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,000
If what Mr. Zhao said is true,

492
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,790
I may have to take back this offer.

493
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,000
Mr. Gao.

494
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm aware of this.

495
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,720
The core creativity of "The Maze"

496
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,030
involves a parallel universe.

497
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,510
Hence, Jiang Yi created many dimensions

498
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,440
of overlapping universes,

499
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,590
and this encrypted folder

500
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,110
is part of it.

501
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I have verified the plan

502
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,750
with him before.

503
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,920
However, before the design takes shape,

504
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
we don't want to make it public.

505
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,960
You don't want to make it public?

506
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,640
This reason is far-fetched.

507
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,960
"The Maze"

508
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,310
is under my charge.

509
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
If the company trusts me,

510
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,160
it must be proceeding with my flow.

511
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,830
As of now, the scenes,

512
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,480
lighting effects
haven't been completed yet.

513
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,350
And we're still having issues with
the character rendering.

514
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,070
Why should I waste Mr. Gao's time

515
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,480
showing him an unfinished product?

516
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,590
Mr. Zhao.

517
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,510
Technically speaking,

518
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,440
we are competitors.

519
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,200
There is no reason for me
to show you my project.

520
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,720
Chloe.

521
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,750
As long as you are aware of this.

522
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,920
You will take charge of this project.

523
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,200
I won't interfere.

524
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,040
Don't worry, Mr. Gao.

525
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,680
That is all for today.

526
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,440
I overheard the meeting.

527
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,240
Why did you help me?

528
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,750
During the interview,

529
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,880
I suggested to the company

530
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,920
to offer you autonomy
in developing the project.

531
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,350
I won't go back on my word.

532
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,790
I don't think you would do that.

533
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,510
Also, I believe

534
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,790
your project

535
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,350
is going to be extraordinary.

536
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,830
Thank you, Chloe.

537
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,640
Having a friend like you

538
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,240
is my luck.

539
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,200
I too think you are quite lucky.

540
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,640
Hello.

541
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,480
The meeting is over.

542
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,110
It was an emergency.

543
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,030
What does that have to do with me?

544
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,240
Are you angry?

545
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,880
Angry?

546
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,440
Why would I be angry?

547
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm overjoyed.

548
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,200
It was rude

549
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
to leave the dinner halfway, right?

550
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Dude.

551
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,640
This isn't the thing.

552
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,350
Forget it.

553
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,240
I have work to do.

554
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,160
I'm hanging up.

555
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,750
Bye.

556
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,440
Hold on.

557
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,200
What is it again?

558
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,960
You asked me about
the summary for my game earlier.

559
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
I will summarize it in six words.

560
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,550
Listen carefully.

561
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,070
I'm right in front of you.

562
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Dude.

563
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,510
I only see Africa in front of me.

564
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,960
Lift your head,

565
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
and you will see me.

566
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,350
(Jiang Yi exchanged this seat)

567
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,110
(with Shadowmourne.)

568
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,240
I know.

569
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,270
Slightly to the left.

570
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,590
What do you see?

571
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,480
Good day, Mr. Hu!

572
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,000
What happened?

573
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,590
Did you get first place in class?

574
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,110
(It is way better than that.)

575
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,070
Who are you looking for?

576
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,230
I'm sorry.

577
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,840
Huang Yingzi.

578
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,030
Actually, I'm never far from you.

579
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,960
Stay here.

580
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,630
Stop hitting me.

581
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,030
It hurts!

582
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,230
Stop it. It is me.

583
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
Zhuang Yuan?

584
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,320
Out with it.

585
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,000
Who goes first?

586
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
I just swung by here.

587
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
You swung by here?

588
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,110
If so,

589
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,920
whose books are those on the table?

590
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,590
Whose blanket and pillow are

591
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,440
on the sofa?

592
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,510
Don't look at him!

593
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,760
And you too.

594
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,190
What is with you?

595
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,630
Do you imagine yourself in a movie

596
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,190
like "Rear Window"?

597
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
What is "Rear Window"?

598
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,060
I haven't watched that.

599
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,880
"Rear Window" is about a reporter

600
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,760
who spies on his neighbors every day...

601
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,710
You asked for it.

602
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,000
You should've been beaten to a pulp.

603
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,280
Silence!

604
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,800
No talking.

605
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,030
You!

606
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,230
Is this your doing?

607
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,710
I'm staying here temporarily.

608
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,550
Temporarily?

609
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,510
How many days?

610
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,480
Come clean.

611
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,630
Three days.

612
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,360
A week.

613
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,550
Fine. I have been here
for more than a month.

614
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,190
Are you an answering machine?

615
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,070
More than a month?

616
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,920
You have lied to me for Jiang Yi
for more than a month.

617
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,550
I announce

618
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,710
that our friendship is over.

619
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,110
Don't blame him.

620
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,480
He wanted to tell you
in the first place

621
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,590
but I stopped him.

622
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,070
Blame me for that if you want.

623
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,000
Of course I blame you.

624
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
Do you think you can get away with this?

625
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,030
You seem to take the moral high ground

626
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,960
to defend him, huh?

627
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,280
Why didn't you tell me about this?

628
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,480
I did.

629
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,360
Otherwise, you would still be wandering
around Africa.

630
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,480
Africa? What is that?

631
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,030
Shut up.

632
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,710
No talking.

633
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,880
Anyway,

634
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,000
I have exposed

635
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,190
the crime you committed to.

636
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,190
Now tell me.

637
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,480
What are you going to do?

638
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,030
Maybe I should go?

639
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,320
You will have this place

640
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,510
to yourselves.

641
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,710
I'm going to beat you up.

642
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,670
Come here.

643
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,030
Where are you going?

644
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,760
Little spec.

645
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,230
You are agile, huh?

646
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,800
Calm down, please.

647
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Calm down?

648
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,360
Scratch that.

649
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,030
How dare you lie to me.

650
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,920
(Huang Yingzi.)

651
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,150
(Actually, I'm never far from you.)

652
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,400
(Are you asleep?)

653
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,230
(Not yet.)

654
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,150
(Come to the window.)

655
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,480
Did you burn the midnight oil?

656
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,190
Yeah.

657
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,550
All-nighter.

658
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
I thought you had finished
the manuscript of Ding Ye.

659
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,110
Not him.

660
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,880
It is about myself.

661
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,840
Yourself?

662
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,590
I have been planning for this
for more than ten years.

663
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,510
Finally, I can start writing.

664
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,000
More than ten years?

665
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,070
But New Perspective
only started three years ago.

666
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,440
What are you doing?

667
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,480
Back to your seat.
