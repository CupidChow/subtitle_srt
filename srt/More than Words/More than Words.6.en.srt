MARCH   2017

2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,210
What do you think?

3
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,610
Where are you even looking?

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,700
You have to do it all over again.

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,030
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,460
I'm kidding, you idiot.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,550
What?

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,710
Are you really resigning?

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,920
Yes.

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,820
What a boring guy.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,800
Just when I thought you didn't
have such bad taste at all.

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,190
The heck. This lighter ain't
getting lit at all.

14

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,930
Hey.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,920
The entrance ceremony.

17
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,760
Entrance ceremony?
When is it?

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,800
April 8.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,470
On the 8th?

20
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,490
What? I'm working that day.

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,820
Do parents still attend entrance
ceremonies these days?

22
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,880
I'll try and ask if anyone can
switch shifts with me.

23
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,290
It's fine.

24
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,320
What a complicated child you are.

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,740
Do such a mom even exist?

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,930
She's so unbothered.

27
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,150
Maybe she's just busy?

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,730
It's nothing new. She's
always been that way.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,640
Should I go instead?

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,780
Where's the entrance
ceremony going to be held?

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
At school.

32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,340
That's good then.

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,210
You should come too, Eiji.
- I sure am.

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,240
While we're at it, should we
stay the night at a hotel?

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,240
What? What?
- What's wrong?

36
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,670
Seems like fun!

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,130
Yeah...

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,020
Then, let's eat at a
buffet somewhere.

39
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,720
Buffet?

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,760
Right?
- What?

41
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,080
What? I'm being serious.
- No, no, no.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,640
Stop grinning like a fool.

43
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,690
No, I'm not.
- Honestly though!

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,430
What? I said no.
- Honestly.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,470
Congratulations to all our new students.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,660
We are pleased to welcome 206
new students to our department

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,900
on this fine day of spring in full bloom!

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,470
It is the great pleasure of the
entire faculty and staff...

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,710
I'm taking a photo now.

50
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,030
Sure.

51
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,860
Say "cheese"!

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,510
Peace sign this time.

53
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,470
Alright, here I go.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,960
Lemme see.

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,010
You both have finally grown
into ladies now, huh?

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,600
Ladies, my butt.

57
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,390
It means you've all
gotten really beautiful.

58
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,240
I guess, you have matured.

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,210
Don't give me a backhanded comment.

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm not!

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,910
You two look good.

62
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,030
Michiru!

63
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,910
Your dad's waiting downstairs.

64
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,230
He said to take a photo
with everyone.

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,610
Ichiji. You've gotten pretty close
to Sakaki's parents, huh?

66
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,670
I'm the only one who
can protect Michiru,

67
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,600
which his dad has acknowledged.

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,680
Really?

69
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's go, Michiru.

70
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,800
Think of me as your white horse.

71
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,550
What? A horse?

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,220
It's fine. Hop on!

73
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,300
I will!

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,680
See you!

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,970
Bye!
- See you.

76
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,020
A horse. Act like a horse. Come on!

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,100
A horse! Let's go!

78
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,760
Let's go! Wait up!
Let me catch up!

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,450
Your voice is too low!

80
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,910
It hurts!
- Don't say that!

81
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,240
Chopsticks?
- They said to use one.

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,740
You're going for that
right off the bat?

83
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,960
So good!
- Really?

84
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,670
It's pumpkin.
- Pumpkin?

85
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm sure it is.
- Pumpkin...

86
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,590
A girl from a distance.

87
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,620
There is?

88
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,640
What do you mean?

89
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,550
She seems nice.
- Second person from the back.

90
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,680
From behind?
- Second seat...

91
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,600
What?
- A pumpkin transferring schools.

92
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,560
What the heck are you saying?

93
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,560
That looks so good.

94
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,210
So soft.

95
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,960
Only meat?

96
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,820
Rice?

97
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,900
It was so good.
- Right?

98
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,280
The meat was delish.

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,750
Honestly.

100
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,620
What? What?

101
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,350
Eichan! What is this?

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,460
Gifts.

103
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,960
Honestly?
- For real?

104
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,570
Can I open it?
- Go ahead.

105
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,040
I wonder what this is?

106
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,490
What is it?

107
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,710
What?!

108
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,800
What's this?

109
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,970
What the...

110
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,620
What is this?!

111
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,550
What? It's huge!

112
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,110
This is so cool!

113
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,890
Hey, look!

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,420
Cherry blossoms!
- That's pretty.

115
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,270
This color is pretty too.

116
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,750
Right.
- What did you use to paint on it?

117
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,820
It's called cotton reactive dye.

118
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,180
Is that so?
- What's that?

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,740
I have one too.

120
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,860
See?

121
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,490
That's so beautiful!

122
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,020
That one's nice too.

123
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,450
Thank you.
- Really?

124
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,670
I'll take good care of it.
- Thank you.

125
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,990
Also, this might be a bit sudden but,

126
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,660
my dad said he wants to
see you two.

127
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,700
He wants to treat you to a feast to celebrate
your entrance into the school and your new job.

128
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,230
I'm sure you're feeling a little
sensitive about it, but...

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,480
Don't you think it's like
a meeting where he

130
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,710
finally acknowledges your
relationship?

131
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,630
Not sure.

132
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,590
He was saying how Makki
seems to be a good kid.

133
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,760
I think he maybe only wants
to get to know you better.

134
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm good. I've got no reason
to turn that down.

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,520
Right? Let's go.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,610
What?

137
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,980
What? The heck?

138
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,090
Congrats on your admission!

139
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,640
Eichan?
- Is this for real?

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,090
Thank you!
- Seriously! Thank you.

141
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,430
True.
- Congrats.

142
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,150
Did you write this?
- As if.

143
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:55,930
Right?

144
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,050
You can't write this well.

145
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,670
Let's take a photo before the
sparklers run out.

146
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,080
Alright.

147
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,350
Thank you.

148
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,640
Alright.

149
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,000
Congrats!

150
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,130
Thank you.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,330
That's a nice shot.

152
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,530
I'll take yours too.
- You too, Eichan.

153
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,900
No, I'm fine.
- Before it runs out.

154
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,400
Come on, hurry!
- What?

155
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,920
No need to include me.
- The sparklers are about to go out.

156
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,030
Come on.
- Here I go.

157
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,450
This button, right?

158
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,830
To commemorate.
- Alright, say "cheese"!

159
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Woah! That looks nice!

160
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,770
What kind of photo is this?

161
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,780
You drank too much.

162
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,200
You are so drunk.

163
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,200
That was so much fun!

164
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,490
What are you doing?

165
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,760
You're flying.
Eiji is flying!

166
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,420
Help me, help me out.
- Don't wanna.

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,630
Help me...

168
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,600
What is this?
- You're spinning around.

169
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,090
He's gonna puke.

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,220
That'll be bad.

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,570
Wear it properly.

172
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,120
Thanks.
- All good.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,830
Still, we want to hurry up and
be able to drink too, huh?

174
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,130
That's right.

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,830
I also thought of doing
that just now.

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,320
But, I didn't. I didn't.

177
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,770
What was that?

178
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,800
There you go at it.

179
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,080
You're running around.
- So free to do so.

180
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,590
It's so much fun!

181
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,470
What's up?

182
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,510
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,810
I want you to break up.

184
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,440
Hey, Papa.

185
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,440
I hold no grudge against you, Makio.

186
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,160
But,

187
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,610
Eiji is also a working adult now.

188
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,510
What you choose now will
certainly determine your future.

189
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,040
No.

190
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,130
Hey, hold on.

191
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,300
How did this turn into a topic
about us breaking up?

192
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
As I said...

193
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,050
I mean, our relationship isn't
attracting anyone's attention.

194
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,490
It doesn't mean that I'd start liking
girls just because you told me to---

195
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,440
That is, as for me,

196
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,230
something I cannot acknowledge.

197
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,200
I believe I raised a good kid.

198
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,160
But,

199
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,160
why?

200
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,670
Why?

201
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,670
Why are you in love with a man?

202
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,730
As for me,

203
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,270
I don't see what seems
to be the problem.

204
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,780
What difference does it make

205
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,780
who Eichan falls in love with?

206
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,210
Eichan has always been
the person he is.

207
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,880
Thank you.

208
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,570
We're leaving.

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,610
Thanks for the feast.

210
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,780
Makki.

211
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,140
What about your heirs?

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,490
Kids?

213
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,830
Listen.

214
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,600
When you and your sister were born,
your mom and I were so happy!

215
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,780
That's why, I also want you to know the
feeling of bliss when you become a parent.

216
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
What's so bad about
wanting that for you?!

217
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,680
Huh?! Huh?!

218
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,820
Hey! Now, you tell me!

219
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,450
Papa, stop it!
- Is that so bad?! Tell me!

220
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,900
Papa, stop.

221
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,100
Just stop it.

222
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,820
Did you call me up
just to say that?

223
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,610
Stop it!

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,050
Let's go.

225
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,800
Makki!

226
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,100
The food was great though, right?

227
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,830
You don't have to force it.

228
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,510
You're not breaking up, are you?

229
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,310
Of course. I told my parents that too.

230
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,390
But...

231
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,200
If us dating means bringing
so much grief to your dad,

232
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,940
is this still the right thing to do?

233
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,700
You don't have to worry
about that, Makki.

234
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,380
I mean, I do like your dad.

235
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,120
Even you don't want things
to go on this way, right?

236
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,990
That's...

237
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,230
I don't like it myself, but...

238
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,580
Still...

239
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,270
That's...

240
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,230
I'm scared to know what my dad

241
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,810
honestly feels.

242
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,100
Then, I'll give birth.

243
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,010
I'll give birth to your child.

244
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,450
Giving birth? You...

245
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,320
You actually came up
with something like that?

246
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,360
It would cross your mind.

247
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,660
If I become a surrogate mother
and give birth to your child,

248
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,930
we'll let him see his grandchild,

249
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,800
and maybe you guys don't
have to break up?

250
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,750
No, what his dad meant to say is
something that's more fundamental.

251
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,440
We can't change people's
minds just like that.

252
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,190
You said so yourself!

253
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,500
That maybe time will tell.

254
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm thinking about the two of you!

255
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,260
Makki, don't you dare give up!

256
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,030
You have to fight for it, Makki!

257
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,810
Hey, Eichan.

258
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
The reason he's against
your relationship,

259
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,960
is because he wishes for
you to be happy, right?

260
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,000
Then, why don't you just prove it?

261
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,440
That we are like any normal people,
and we can be this happy!

262
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
Do you really want to be
involved with us

263
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,990
in that kind of way?

264
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,130
I...

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,010
I don't really like men that much.

266
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,910
I'm not even thinking about
getting married in the future.

267
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,050
I thought, "how did I turn
into this kind of a woman?"

268
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,750
But, now I know.

269
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,590
I'm doing it for this reason.

270
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,090
For the first time in my life,
I knew what it means to be a woman.

271
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,190
Okay, let's do some basic 2D drafting.

272
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,570
Sure, I'm in your care.

273
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,820
Excuse me.

274
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,010
2D drafting can be used...

275
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,500
You need money for
childbirth and childcare.

276
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,460
"Let's first save up money," Eichan said.

277
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,030
And second will be
disinfecting the finger.

278
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,780
And number three is filing.

279
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,310
Nail length and then shape.

280
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,430
Which one?
- And then...

281
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,900
This side, and then you put
some remover on it.

282
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,810
Give it some time.

283
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,250
This one? Or this?

284
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,480
Start here.
- Here?

285
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,490
Alright, here I go.

286
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,530
I wanna come!

287
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,370
I'm leaving now.
- Bye-bye!

288
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,160
Got a part-time work?

289
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,500
Please excuse me.

290
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,480
And so the seasons moved
from spring to summer.

291
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,260
Miechan's really working hard, huh?

292
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,430
She is.

293
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,270
Are we...

294
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,360
Are we alright with this?

295
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,370
About the child?

296
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,970
I dunno.

297
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,440
But, Mieko said she's doing it for us.

298
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,950
That's right.

299
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,830
We...

300
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,640
We also need to think about
what we can do

301
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,460
for Mieko.

302
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,430
I don't get it.
- Wrong.

303
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,310
There might be something.

304
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,190
What?

305
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,600
What do you think?

306
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,910
So spacious!

307
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,950
It really is.

308
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,090
Look at the sea! Insane!
- It's so fluffy!

309
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,770
So fluffy.
- Is it?

310
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,350
Look! Look at it!

311
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,600
What?
- Have a look.

312
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,090
So wide!

313
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,380
It is.

314
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,840
So pretty!

315
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,960
Sounds like someone singing.

316
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,600
I heard it's a New Moon today.

317
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,810
What about it?

318
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,780
It's said that your wishes will
be granted easily.

319
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,440
"Starting from Empty."

320
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,100
"I'm motivated to do everything
and absorb everything easily,"

321
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,180
as stated.

322
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,460
Is there such a thing like that
in the phases of the moon?

323
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,310
It's perfect.

324
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,820
Listen, I'm going to put
this out there first,

325
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,970
but don't you feel awkward
after doing the deed, 'kay?

326
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,830
Don't call it "doing the deed."

327
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,970
I'm getting nervous.

328
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,080
Can I really make a child?

329
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,860
I mean, it's not 100% possible.

330
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,920
If I don't get pregnant,
then it was for nothing.

331
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,240
It won't be for nothing.

332
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,210
If we can tell you what our
objectives exactly are,

333
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,720
and if you're wondering whether
you were useful or not,

334
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,230
you don't need to mess with
your mind by thinking about it.

335
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,630
We have our own ways of being happy.

336
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,280
If you think that way, I'm sure
something's out there for you.

337
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,790
Eichan's face that showed
he was hurting.

338
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,060
Makki's face that showed
he was completely speechless.

339
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,760
I don't want to see those anymore.

340
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,660
It doesn't matter if
this is wrong,

341
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,300
or even if it's unthinkable.

342
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,970
But the truth is,

343
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,480
I just don't know

344
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,230
what needs to be done.

345
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,230
Turn off the lights.

346
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,480
Eichan?

347
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,660
You don't have to
push yourself too hard.

348
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,830
Let's not go through with this.

349
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,250
No turning back.

350
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:26,020
