2
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,350
Excuse me for a while.

3
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,210
Check this for me.

4
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm pregnant.

5
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:16,840
For real?

6
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,380
Your body alright?

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,770
Where are you?

8
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,900
An elephant?

9
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,110
An elephant.

10
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,320
Zoo?

11
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,030
Zoo.

12
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,370
Why are you at the zoo?

13
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,720
I just wanted to come here.

14
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,870
For now, I guess we have to
go to the hospital first.

15
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,170
I still feel a bit uneasy.

16
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,660
You'll come with me?

17
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,800
Of course.

18
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,220
Right?

19
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,390
Thank you.

20
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,020
Even if I take a nap, I can't
help but catch a cold.

21
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,030
Mom.

22
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm pregnant.

23
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,460
What?

24
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,460
Congratulations.

25
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,050
What?

26
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
What?

27
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,720
What? What?
Hold up.

28
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,740
Wait, who's the guy?

29
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,540
Rather, you've never told me
anything all this time!

30
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,910
What? You actually want to know?

31
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,520
What are you saying?

32
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,380
I mean, I thought you do
have a boyfriend.

33
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,030
I don't have a boyfriend.

34
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm pregnant, but I'm just
going to give birth.

35
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,790
I just wanted to let you know.

36
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,180
That's not just a simple
matter of, "Sure, alright."

37
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,600
You need to tell me
exactly what went on and---

38
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,290
Mom! I won't cause you
any troubles at all!

39
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,270
What for? When you've never
cared for me at all.

40
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,760
What are you saying?

41
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,760
Hold up.

42
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,310
I'll do it. Just stop the fire.

43
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,850
You're kinda commendable.

44
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,250
You're acting calm.

45
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,560
Nah, I panic way too much.

46
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,410
Something about it just surprised me
so much that I lost my appetite.

47
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,740
It's fine. I'm not hungry anyway.

48
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,710
Mieko.

49
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,670
Should we go to the beach?

50
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,630
What?

51
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,670
Mama, you're working hard.
- Hey! Come in!

52
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,490
Kaoru! Take a seat!

53
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,590
What? Kaoru?
You're off work today?

54
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,030
That's right. I brought my
daughter with me.

55
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,410
What? What?

56
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,290
I brought my daughter with me!

57
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,100
Your daughter? She's so damn adorable!

58
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,220
Sit here.

59
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,640
He said you're cute.

60
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,100
Right?
- You're sitting over there?

61
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,770
Have a drink with me!

62
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,770
Sorry. I'll be there later so
go and sing for now.

63
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,770
For real? That's a promise!

64
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,090
Yay! I'll wait!

65
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,560
So this is how snack bars are?

66
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,170
What did you expect?

67
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,230
Nothing much.

68
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,120
But, it's been a while
since I've done this.

69
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,620
You're always acting upset
when I'm with you.

70
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,210
No, I'm not.

71
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,290
Welcome, Kaoru.
- Mama!

72
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,650
Nice to meet you.

73
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,030
My daughter.
- She's so cute.

74
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,470
Thank you for always
taking care of my mom.

75
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,500
Sorry.

76
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,400
Here you go, Kaoru.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,320
No need for an ashtray.
- Right, I'll take it off.

78
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,100
Alright.

79
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,440
Yay!

80
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Kaoru!
- What?

81
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,230
Come on, now. Can't you
atleast sing one song?

82
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,110
What?
- Just one! One song!

83
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,280
Can I borrow your mom for a sec?

84
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,490
Just one song, okay?
- Yeah! Alright!

85
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,070
She will sing!
- I'll be back.

86
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,140
Alright, alright.

87
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,140
You've got a great voice!

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,670
I don't wanna get in your way.

89
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,460
What? You mean, you don't
know which of them is the dad?

90
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,220
But why?

91
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,900
"Why?" I just explained it to you.
- No, no. I just don't get it.

92
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,220
I just don't understand.

93
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,230
Is there such an insane
thing like that?

94
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,440
I know you can decide for yourself,
but what were those two actually thinking---

95
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,650
Stop it.

96
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,980
You don't even know
anything about those two.

97
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,410
They attended my entrance ceremony,
took me back and forth from work.

98
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,410
They're thinking about me
more than you could ever do.

99
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,960
Is that so?

100
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,250
But, if you genuinely think that this
is a matter between you and them,

101
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,920
then I think you and the guys
are way too naive.

102
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,060
Give birth if you want to.

103
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,270
You'll need to talk about it
with the guy's parents.

104
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,570
When are you going
to the hospital?

105
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,570
Tomorrow.

106
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,330
The three of us will.

107
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,740
Right.

108
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,250
You're alright with me
giving birth?

109
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,440
Nothing wrong about it, of course.

110
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,220
Kids are adorable.

111
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,410
Well...

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,880
I guess, I've gotten old already
to be drinking with my daughter.

113
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,150
I didn't even drink anything.

114
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,080
It's fine!

115
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,500
When was the last time we
talked like this?

116
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,220
Be careful.

117
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,760
Sure.

118
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,040
Thank you.

119
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,680
What?

120
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,030
Let's go out again sometime.

121
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,380
The heck?

122
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,930
Your last period was on August 19.

123
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,300
And you haven't bled since then, right?

124
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,560
Yes.

125
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,310
Have you tried checking
with a pregnancy test?

126
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,150
Yes.

127
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,150
I just want to make certain,

128
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,230
are you sure you want to have the baby?

129
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,450
I want to.

130
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,210
Well then, let's first check for
pregnancy in the uterus.

131
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,380
Alright.

132
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,060
Are you Ms. Takagi's husband?

133
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,820
No. Wait, husband?

134
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,050
Just go.

135
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,580
What?

136
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,340
I'll stay here.

137
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,220
It's me.
- Right this way.

138
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,280
Right.

139
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,430
Okay, I'll put in the ultrasound device now.

140
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,510
It might feel a bit unsettling.

141
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,600
Okay.

142
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,610
Please have look at the
screen on the right.

143
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,660
You can see the baby in a black bag.

144
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,600
See?

145
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,480
If you look closely, you can
see his heart beating.

146
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,840
It's moving!

147
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,300
Alright, looking healthy.

148
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,690
Are you alright?

149
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,400
Doctor, how far along am I...?

150
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,490
You're 8 weeks in.

151
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,120
Want to come back
inside with Papa?

152
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Come on.

153
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,920
No, mama!

154
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,900
Alright, come here.

155
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,380
Fine, come here.
Want to sit down?

156
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,150
The four layers of the
epidermis, from top to bottom.

157
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,130
Stratum corneum, stratum granulosum,
stratum spinosum, stratum basale.

158
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,620
How can you even remember all
these stuff that don't make sense?

159
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,140
I mean, the exams are near.

160
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,580
So, what're you going
to do about school?

161
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm going to take a break from
school at the last minute.

162
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,200
Eiji said this himself but,

163
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,850
he'd like to register you
under his family name.

164
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,630
What? Why?

165
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,730
He kinda looked up a
few things online,

166
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,040
so if ever some kind of
emergency happens,

167
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,900
he's be responsible for supporting you.

168
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,740
What do you think about that?

169
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,450
Well...

170
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,800
In my perspective, I don't really
need that sort of responsibility.

171
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,410
I do have my mom.

172
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,570
The fact that he's willing to do that much
must mean you're really important to him.

173
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,720
But, if ever it really is Eiji's child,

174
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,640
I know it's just for formalities,

175
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,800
but it won't have anything
to do with me anymore, right?

176
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,570
No, that's not---

177
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,990
That's all I can think
about these days.

178
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,940
Am I going crazy?

179
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,440
Having kids, or working,

180
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,160
and what I want to do.

181
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,110
I don't have anything like those.

182
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
At the hospital, they said
I'm already 13 weeks in.

183
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,430
What?

184
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,680
My pregnancy.

185
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,480
That's why, this child is
probably yours.

186
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,550
You worked hard today.

187
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,180
Thank you.

188
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,510
How are your studies going?

189
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah, all perfect.

190
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,120
Perfect? You really said that?

191
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,660
Miechan, here's some orange juice.

192
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,260
You bought a lot
of that again.

193
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,190
Thank you.
- How are you feeling? All good?

194
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm fine.

195
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,620
Geez.

196
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,620
I don't know what's going
on, and I'm worried.

197
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,530
You're worrying way too much.

198
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,780
Right?
- If so, then I'm glad.

199
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,960
Hey.

200
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,000
It states here in the book that morning
sickness comes in at 8 to 11 weeks.

201
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,210
Isn't yours a bit off?

202
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,630
What?

203
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,750
There's a pretty big gap between
the time period shown on this page.

204
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,340
But, doesn't it depend
from person to person?

205
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,640
Well, I'm sure you're
right to some extent.

206
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,830
Are you alright, Miechan?

207
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,870
I'm fine.

208
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,280
All good.

209
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,010
Hey, why don't you lie down?

210
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,520
No, I'm fine. As long as
I get to lean on something.

211
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,340
It'll be bad if you
push yourself.

212
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,860
Why don't you head to bed?

213
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,230
Okay?

214
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,150
I'll take you to bed.

215
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,140
Wait a bit.

216
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,490
Here.

217
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
You alright?

218
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,170
Thank you.

219
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,290
Hey, Mieko.

220
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,250
You said you're in your 13th week,

221
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,620
but the truth is that you're actually
still 7-8 weeks pregnant, right?

222
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,630
What?

223
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,110
If it is, then we're on track.

224
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,260
You're wrong.

225
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,120
I told you, it's your child.

226
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,250
But, it looks like you're having a bad
case of morning sickness so we should---

227
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,270
We don't have to. I'm fine.

228
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,500
If that's the case,

229
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,360
we'll know about it in time.

230
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,970
Is one or the other that
much of an issue?

231
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,680
The problem here is why you lied.

232
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,590
I'm not lying!

233
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,480
What did you need to hide it for?

234
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,610
I don't get it.

235
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,870
That's obvious.

236
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,210
Because she loves you.

237
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,500
No, that's not it.

238
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,540
But, isn't that so?

239
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,760
If not, then---

240
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,370
Then, if that's the case,

241
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,860
what do you expect me to do?

242
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,230
You're asking me to reciprocate that?

243
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,850
No, that's not how it has to be.

244
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,710
Even if the child is yours,

245
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,810
are the three of us supposed to
come together and play family?

246
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,190
No...
- Even if Mieko likes me?

247
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,690
No, I'm saying why are things
going this way--

248
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,090
Rather, on the other hand,
how about you?

249
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,300
If it were my child.

250
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,810
You know how Mieko truly feels,

251
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,780
yet you'll still register
her under your name?

252
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,080
No, I said that's not--

253
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,020
Of course, that's so unreasonable!

254
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,270
Be realistic!

255
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't put off thinking about it!

256
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,470
You don't have to raise
your voice like that.

257
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,870
I'm not saying we should
put off thinking about it for later.

258
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,580
Are you even trying to
understand how Miechan feels?

259
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,390
You're too impatient to reach to a
conclusion and I can't keep up.

260
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,090
I'm the one who can't keep up!

261
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,300
Why would you say that
to me, anyway?

262
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,600
How can you ever know how I feel

263
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,230
when all you can think about is Mieko?

264
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,240
What are you saying?

265
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,450
It's because of us that things
have turned out this way.

266
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,010
It's only natural to
think about Miechan first.

267
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,840
Why would you say all those?

268
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,560
I see.

269
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,350
I guess I am crazy?

270
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,770
No...

271
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,570
That's not true.

272
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,740
But, even if Mieko had
something to give to you,

273
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,990
I have nothing.

274
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,960
Having to keep seeing you always
looking at Mieko like this...

275
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,250
It's heart-breaking.

276
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,500
I'm leaving.

277
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,770
I need to cool down.

278
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,190
Eichan, are you still up?

279
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,540
The way things are now,

280
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,130
what's going to happen if
Makki's no longer with us?

281
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,640
If ever that really do happens...

282
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,400
You know,

283
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,360
I've always been thinking about it.

284
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,120
How did things turn out this way?

285
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,190
What else should I have done?

286
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,840
But, if we're looking at
what caused this...

287
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't think there was
anything like that.

288
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,600
I mean,

289
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,730
I lied to Makki about the
baby being his.

290
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,900
That's not the direct problem.

291
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,860
But still, I think it is.

292
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,000
Treating life like an object.

293
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,920
Using it as a means to an end.

294
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,720
That's why, we got punished.

295
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,890
Every bad thing we did.

296
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,060
We brought all these on ourselves.

297
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,690
That's the only thing that I

298
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,150
and I'm sure Makki as well
don't think so.

299
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,830
Even on harrowing days,

300
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,540
or when frustrating
things happened to us,

301
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,750
do you think it was wrong for us
to try to look forward?

302
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,220
I don't know anymore.

303
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,310
You know?

304
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,900
I think we're only being tested

305
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,110
to see how we would live our lives.

306
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,650
Where are you now?

307
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,900
On my way to work.

308
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,660
You're lying.

309
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,960
You're at the zoo again, right?

310
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,380
These elephants are always so noisy.

311
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,020
You see,

312
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,520
the child I'm carrying,

313
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,610
is Eichan's kid.

314
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,660
I see.

315
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,290
I'm sorry.

316
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,080
I lied.

317
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,170
Nah, it's fine.

318
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,680
Hurry and come home.

319
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,050
We're having sukiyaki today.

320
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,160
Makki?

321
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,460
Hey, Makki.

322
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,090
Don't hang up on me.

323
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,470
Don't hang up.

324
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,350
Hey.

325
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,020
Makki?

326
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,240
Makki?

327
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,080
I brought oranges and
yogurt. You want some?

328
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,970
