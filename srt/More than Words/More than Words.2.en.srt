1
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,670
One Cassis and Orange.

2
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,490
500 yen.

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,910
Here, come closer.

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,610
Yay!

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,620
Sorry.

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,570
Cheers!

7
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,260
That's crazy!

8
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,620
You on your own?

9
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,770
Yes.
- Really?

10
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,350
Is it your first time
to places like this?

11
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,400
That's good.

12
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,270
You come here often?

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,760
Well, from time to time.

14
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,830
I drop by.

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,510
Your name is...?

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,580
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, we're already closed.

18
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,610
We're closed!

19
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,930
Just one more.

20
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,120
Come on, the last one's long over.

21
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,950
You drank way too much.

22
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,090
Mister, did something bad happen?

23
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,550
Not really.

24
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,480
You got work or something, right?

25
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,650
Go home already.

26
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,150
Just my a part-time, anyway.

27
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,580
Like, saving up money for
something you want to do?

28
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,040
I just want to be normal.

29
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,260
Putting up a facade?

30
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,560
What about you?
Got something you want to do?

31
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,110
I want to become an actress.

32
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,400
Really?

33
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,820
It's nice how you have
something like that.

34
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm so hopeless!

35
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,230
“Life's but a walking shadow,"
[ From "Macbeth" - Shakespeare ]

36
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,730
"a poor player that struts and frets,"

37
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,900
"his hour upon the stage,"

38
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,280
"putting off an angry facade."

39
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,370
"Once his part is over,
he then is heard no more."

40
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

41
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,090
It's a Shakespeare work!

42
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,340
The point is, we're all
going to disappear someday.

43
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,720
I have no idea what happened,

44
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,170
but there's no need to think
so much about it, right?

45
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,900
Well, that's just based on my
own interpretation, though.

46
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,880
Hey, did you drive on the way here?

47
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,430
Want a lift?

48
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,860
It's gonna take me a
little while to finish.

49
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,250
I can wait.

50
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,200
If I do get done here.

51
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,620
Well, I'm off.

52
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,560
What? On your own?
Isn't it dangerous?

53
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,330
It's not. I go home alone
on my own some days.

54
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,490
Really?

55
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,740
Would your parents worry if
you get back late?

56
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,160
Not at all.

57
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,090
My mother comes home from
work so late at night.

58
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm alone anyway.

59
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,870
Is that so?

60
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,120
Why don't you just wait?

61
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,250
It's safer to get a ride
home, even if it's late.

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,590
He's right. Got it, Miechan?

63
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,910
We really need to hurry and
finish cleaning up here.

64
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,070
Right.
- Want a hand?

65
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,830
No, just take a rest.

66
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,700
Thanks.

67
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,330
Come on, get going!

68
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,790
Hey, wait.
- Let's go!

69
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,670
Wait, where's my key again?

70
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,090
You don't have it?

71
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,880
On the count of 1, 2...
- Wait, don't rush me!

72
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,630
The Pacific saury tail's...
- There! Found it!

73
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,390
Here it is!

74
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,930
Okay, fine.
- Get in, let's go.

75
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,390
I'm first!
- Hey!

76
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,410
I lost.
- You guys are hyped up!

77
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,840
This is so cool.
I want a car of my own too.

78
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,900
Eichan! We should take a drive
then head straight home.

79
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,020
That sounds good!
- Right?

80
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,390
Fine with me. But are you sure
about getting back late?

81
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,430
We're quite chill at my end.

82
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,390
I told you, it's all good on my end.

83
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,140
Really?

84
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,790
Hey, seat-belt.

85
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,740
Alright.

86
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,320
Then, why don't we take a
leisurely stroll around here?

87
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
Is this a child's play?

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,660
By drive, we should be
taking the freeway, right?

89
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,160
What?

90
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,340
Don't give me that.

91
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,830
Honestly.

92
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,720
To hell with a stroll!
Let's go far away!

93
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,270
Let's get going.
- Let's!

94
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,710
Come on, come on!

95
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,090
It feels like we're going
to be swallowed up.

96
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,660
You can say that again.

97
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,680
It's the beach!
- You startled me!

98
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,220
More like a lake.
- The sea! That was close!

99
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,020
Still, we can't see clearly
since it's so dark.

100
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,250
You think it looks beautiful
during the day time?

101
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,010
If so, should the three of us
come next time during the day?

102
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,180
You're so kind, Eichan.

103
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,330
You both.

104
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,310
Well, you two are so kind.

105
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,730
Get over here!
The waves look insane!

106
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Come on!

107
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,040
Eiji!
- Go.

108
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,120
Have a look!
- At what?

109
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,530
The waves!

110
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,550
Look!
- It's not a beach. Hey, careful!

111
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,990
You gotta watch out!

112
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,250
It's like the beach.
Come, Mieko!

113
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,630
Seat-belt on.

114
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
Right.

115
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,220
Don't forget it when we have to go.

116
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,880
Was it supposed to be done
this way back in the past?

117
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,480
How long ago are we talking about?

118
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,740
I mean, 10 years ago, the policemen
were still kinda complacent, though.

119
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,370
Takagi!

120
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes?

121
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,710
Is it true that you're
not dating Senoo?

122
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,190
You got it right but...
Moreover...

123
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm Sakaki from Class B!

124
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,010
So, I have a favor I want
to ask from you.

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,780
Can I call you Mieko-chan?

126
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,970
Hey!

127
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,750
Hey, could you mediate
for me and Senoo?

128
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,520
No, I'm going to pass on that.

129
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,580
Hey, please wait!

130
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,650
What?!
- Can you hear me out?

131
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,490
Alright, fine.

132
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,490
So?

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,790
I haven't talked to Senoo before.

134
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,790
We're not in the same class.

135
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,180
But, before I realized it,
I got my eyes on him.

136
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,250
And so?

137
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,410
So, I wanted to deal with
the other problems first,

138
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,480
and so I've decided with you---

139
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,320
I think Makki wouldn't like that.
Why don't you ask him directly?

140
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,950
If I could, I wouldn't have asked you!

141
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,910
As if it's my concern.
I've got work.

142
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,840
Hey! Just one last thing!

143
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
What is it?

144
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,150
How do you feel about Senoo?

145
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,640
I feel nothing for him at all.

146
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,870
Are you for real?

147
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,720
Are you being serious?!

148
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,040
I am.

149
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm so glad! I feel so relieved now!

150
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,420
That's all!

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,350
How I feel about him?
To be honest...

152
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,740
If there's one, it's probably how

153
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,260
I have a sense of superiority
over other girls or something.

154
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,260
But, let's say he found
a girl he likes...

155
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,620
Would I like the idea?

156
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,320
The smallest one!
- So cool!

157
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,430
It's not. It's the smallest!

158
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,780
That's nice!

159
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,070
Seriously.
- Look, there's Eichan.

160
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,230
It was raining yesterday but
it's all cleared up today, huh?

161
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,510
Right, Eiji?

162
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,820
Right.

163
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,530
So cool!

164
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,260
This is so nice!
- Insane!

165
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,430
I wanna do that too!
- Amazing!

166
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,930
You're too big, Mieko.

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,030
What?

168
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,790
I got wet!

169
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,070
Woah, this looks so good.

170
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,600
Makki! The meat's grilled!

171
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,320
Meat!

172
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,940
Have a look at this.

173
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,500
That's pretty!

174
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,700
Right?

175
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,790
What is it?
- Look.

176
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,960
Pretty, right?

177
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,130
Here!
- Thanks.

178
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,340
Alright, this big one...
- Meat, meat, meat.

179
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
Do you eat pumpkins?
- I do.

180
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,380
Here you go.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,870
Miechan, hand me a plate.
- Meat, meat, meat.

182
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,560
Alright.
- Looks good!

183
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,500
Here you go.
- Thanks. This too.

184
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,350
We need chopsticks.

185
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,900
Chopsticks? Sorry, I forgot about it.

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,520
Here.
- Yeah, thanks.

187
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,590
Alright.

188
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,560
Thank you for this feast!

189
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,910
So good!

190
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,830
Tastes good, huh?
- So good!

191
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,950
Delicious!

192
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Can't get enough.

193
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,000
If I worked at a kitchen, I think
I'll be better at grilling meat, huh?

194
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
You don't have to,
you can do it anyway.

195
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,400
For real?

196
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,150
Freaking good.

197
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
Drinks?
- Sure.

198
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,990
We got none.

199
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,560
Thanks!

200
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,610
Say, Makki.

201
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,630
Do you know a Michiru
Sakaki from Class B?

202
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,720
Sakaki?

203
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Who's she?

204
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,380
Well, she was saying she wanted
to become friends with you.

205
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,760
Even if you say so,
I don't know her.

206
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,940
Yeah.

207
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,060
Sakaki, huh?

208
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,610
Sakaki and Takagi.

209
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,660
Rhymes well.

210
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,880
I'll pass on that.

211
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,830
Takagi.

212
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,430
What drinks do you want?

213
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,130
I'll have this.

214
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,510
Cola and orange juice.

215
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,340
Maybe calpis?

216
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,680
Cola for me!
- Cola?

217
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,010
This one is so good!

218
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,100
Wait up.

219
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,300
So, so good!

220
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,140
Hand it.
- I can do it.

221
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,310
A lot came out!

222
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,420
Be careful.

223
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,890
Hey, try this.
- I can't.

224
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,650
You can't, right?
- Eiji, try it!

225
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,030
Nah, I'm fine.

226
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,990
I'm good.
- Eat it!

227
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,280
It'll fall off!

228
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,660
What are you doing?

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,780
Try it! Try it!
- Hey!

230
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,870
I'm good.
- Try it.

231
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,950
Just eat it! It'll fall off! Eat!

232
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,540
It'll stab you!

233
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,270
Be careful!

234
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,260
Watch out, Makki!

235
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,360
See? It's good, right?

236
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,080
It is.

237
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,960
Here, eat!

238
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,270
Here, Eichan.

239
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,120
This part too.

240
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,510
A container?

241
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,540
I'm good.

242
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,200
Here's your orange juice.
- Thank you.

243
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,210
Give me a piggyback ride!
- There we go!

244
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,070
Be careful!

245
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,490
Hey! Come on!

246
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,670
What? You'll take it high up?

247
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,720
Is it lit?
- It's lit now.

248
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,510
Let's go! Here it is!

249
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,590
Here we go!

250
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,310
Here's fine.

251
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,140
Alright. Here we are.

252
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,590
See you.

253
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,780
See you.

254
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,980
Thank you!

255
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,030
Take care.

256
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,260
Sure.

257
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,160
Hey, listen to this.

258
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,290
Go ahead.

259
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,900
I wonder if there's anyone at home.

260
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,950
She said her mom always comes home
late but are her parents both working?

261
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,090
Well, I don't think she has a dad.

262
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,160
Oh, really?

263
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,370
I don't really know,
but seems like it.

264
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,850
Remember that time

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,920
when I told her to
fasten her seat-belt?

266
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,670
Maybe that was a memory
she had of her father?

267
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,050
You're very sharp, Makki.

268
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,400
Just a feeling, though.

269
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,350
What's that about?

270
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,050
Well, let's get going.

271
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,440
Right.

272
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,710
I guess, I really have grown, haven't I?

273
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,700
People change once 10 years go by.

274
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,040
We gradually forget as time pass by.

275
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,780
Here we are.

276
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,700
Okay.

277
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,010
Makki, we're here.

278
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,120
Did I fall asleep?

279
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,830
Sorry.

280
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,000
It's fine.

281
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,420
I had a weird dream.

282
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
Dream?

283
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,320
Oh, we're here.

284
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,990
Well, see you around.

285
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,400
Thanks for today.

286
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,210
Goodnight.

287
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,060
Goodnight!

288
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,110
Woah, that looks good!

289
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,610
Hey!
- Let me have a taste?

290
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,560
What?

291
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,450
Really? Okay, gimme a sec.

292
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,350
Come on.

293
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,420
It's hot so be careful.

294
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,600
So good!

295
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,800
The smaller one.

296
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,880
White one.
- Got it.

297
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,220
That's hot.
- I'll leave it here.

298
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,120
Oh, right.

299
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,460
About that weird dream
I told you that I had last night.

300
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,550
I often have that dream.

301
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,550
I'm all alone in an unknown,
old, white apartment.

302
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,040
Then, I'm not sure why,
but I'm smoking.

303
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,400
I keep smoking.

304
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,570
What are you doing there?

305
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,320
I must be waiting for someone.

306
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,090
Then, I hear knocks on the door,

307
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,430
so I open it.

308
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,500
And yet, no one's out there.

309
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,880
Nobody.

310
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,510
I wonder what that dream is about?

311
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,920
I wonder.

312
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,380
I mean, it's a dream.
They don't have an explanation.

313
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,610
Good work, you guys!

314
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,960
Hey. Good work!

315
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,410
Makki! You have an
early shift today?

316
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,140
I'll go home after I'm done eating.

317
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,330
You're shrewd.

318
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,910
Because Eiji's cooking is so good!

319
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,790
I mean, yes, but still...

320
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,830
It's fried rice today.
- Fried rice?

321
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,670
Fried rice.
- Really?

322
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,130
Behold!

323
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,670
So good!
- Want some?

324
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,750
I want!
- You do?

325
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,920
This is Eiji's.
Here, eat it.

326
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,950
Is it alright with him?
- Just eat.

327
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,300
I mean, I used to be so
lost when I was young.

328
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,170
Really?

329
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,400
Excuse me for a bit.
- Sure, sure.

330
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,820
Miechan.

331
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,210
What is it?

332
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,330
Once we're done today, I'll take you
home so can you wait for me?

333
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,260
Fine with me.

334
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Thanks.

335
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,900
Excuse me.

336
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,910
You're working really hard.

337
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,020
Thank you so much.

338
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,820
Good work.

339
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,520
Thanks for your hardwork.

340
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,830
Which do you prefer?

341
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,370
What?
- Low sugar or black?

342
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,730
Then, low sugar. Thanks.

343
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,800
What happened?

344
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,690
Are you always with Makki
even at school?

345
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,010
Not really. We're in different classes.

346
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,470
I see.

347
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,340
So, what you wanted to ask
about is Makki?

348
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,850
What's this about?

349
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,490
Is Makki...

350
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,780
...dating a girl?

351
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,810
Rather, I'm sorry for telling
you about this.

352
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,350
But if ever you like Makki---

353
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,090
Wait! No, no, no.

354
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,280
Well, it's...

355
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,590
There are a lot of girls at school
who like him, though.

356
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,010
I thought so.

357
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,900
Do you like Makki?

358
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,240
Well...

359
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,940
That guy...

360
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,410
He's not dating anyone right now.

361
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,290
Why not ask him out again
to go for a drive?

362
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,730
Will you be coming with us?

363
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,380
It has to be just you two.

364
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,010
Right.

365
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,260
Mieko-chan!

366
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,500
What's up with you?

367
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,000
I was waiting for you!

368
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,590
Did you ask Senoo about a lot
of things for me so we can get along?

369
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,470
No way. Ask him that yourself.

370
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,830
I mean, I don't have the courage to!

371
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,280
Makki might still be in
his classroom right now.

372
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,700
Get going! Go on!

373
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,760
What? Going home now?

374
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,550
This is Sakaki.
Walk home with her.

375
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,060
Sakaki?

376
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,190
The one that rhymes with your name!

377
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,300
Bye.

378
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,490
No way, I can't!
I can't be alone with him!

379
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,810
What? It's fine! Just go.

380
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,290
Sakaki and Takagi.

381
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,980
There you go again.

382
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,500
Let's go then.

383
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,280
Come on. Go!

384
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
The heck?

385
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,100
It's pizza! I'm getting hungry now.

386
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,270
Right, so hungry!

387
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,310
Yeah. Should we get something to eat?

388
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,060
Sure. What do you want?

389
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,570
Let's see. Anything good?

390
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,810
Oh, it's Eiji!

391
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,280
Hey! What?

392
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,530
What are you doing here?

393
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,330
Well, killing time before work.

394
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,550
Is that so?

395
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,230
Really.

396
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,060
Hi there.

397
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,480
Hello.

398
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,780
This is Eichan. Our friend at the
place we work part-time.

399
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,460
I'm Fukunaga.

400
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,900
I'm Sakaki.

401
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,910
Sakaki and Takagi.

402
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,260
The girl you were talking about?

403
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,880
You are so annoying.

404
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,320
Rhyming names.

405
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,970
Earl Gray

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,510
and a cheesecake.
- Got it.

407
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,770
Cafe au lait.
- Sure.

408
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,180
Coffee and pizza toast.

409
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,520
Chocolate cake too.
- Sure.

410
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,370
I'll have coffee too.
- Got it.

411
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,880
I'll bring some water while you
wait and I'll serve them soon.

412
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,480
Thank you so much.

413
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,280
My treat today.

414
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,470
No, no, no.
- Are you sure?

415
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,820
No, no, no.
- Come on, Eichan.

416
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,650
It's good to do it sometimes.

417
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,660
Yeah, it's nice.
- Coming from you?

418
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,780
It's fine.

419
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,370
Just when I was thinking of
seeing some cute students,

420
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,910
you guys showed up which
took me aback!

421
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,040
It startled me too.

422
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,120
By cute, you mean Sakaki, right?

423
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,920
What? I'm not cute at all!

424
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,640
You are cute and small.

425
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,740
By the way, what's your type, Makki?

426
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,180
A type?

427
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,210
Right...

428
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,180
An adult female, maybe?

429
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,480
What the heck, right?
- No matter.

430
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,410
What?
- Excuse me.

431
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,140
Thank you so much.

432
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,240
It's like, I'm sorry. You're suddenly
spending time with a stranger.

433
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,740
Not at all! I'm having a blast!

434
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,620
It's nice to spend time like this
with someone from work. I dig it.

435
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,310
Why don't you work too?

436
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,090
I can't. I'm prohibited
from working part-time.

437
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,380
What and by who?

438
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,490
My dad.

439
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,340
He's kinda overprotective,

440
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,380
but since I'm in high-school, I should
enjoy it while I can, he said.

441
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,390
No kidding.
- I see.

442
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,350
I guess, it's different for everyone.

443
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,140
Right.

444
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,370
But, I do want to.
- Right?

445
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,520
I drank coffee.

446
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,770
You did.

447
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,130
It was black coffee!

448
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,150
You're an adult now.
- Right.

449
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,030
Black coffee is for adults!

450
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,590
Hey.
- What is it?

451
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,820
What made you like Makki?

452
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,890
What?

453
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,350
I mean, he's cool and looks sporty.

454
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,090
You'd fall in love with people
just because of that?

455
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,420
That easily?

456
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,600
Why? Of course, we would.

457
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,320
Do you find it weird?

458
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,370
Wait up!

459
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,580
Eichan and Sakaki.

460
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,390
These guys who like Makki

461
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,650
are both cute.

462
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,560
And Makki might someday
fall for one of these two.

463
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,050
You think a day like that might come?

464
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,450
But, someday, we'll all be
separated from each other.

465
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,480
Makki won't be here anymore.

466
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,930
If that day ever comes, I...

467
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,100
Mieko?

468
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,810
Sorry!

469
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,510
I want to play water guns too.

470
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,690
So hot.

471
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,190
How do you get the
water out of this?

472
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,200
If I go home dripping wet,
I'll get reprimanded.

473
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,530
If I come home wet,
I'll get yelled at.

474
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,700
By who?

475
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,160
I'll shoot if you move!

476
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,160
I'll shoot! I'll shoot you!

477
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,800
No, you can't. I'm serious.
No, you can't!

478
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,070
Wait up!

479
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,180
Stop it!

480
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,990
Wait, I'm tired.

481
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,990
Wait, I'm serious. Fine!

482
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,040
Cover up.
- You can't!

483
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,750
Cover.

484
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,510
This guy. Shoot him.
- No, I...

485
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,520
Shoot this guy.
- Hey!

486
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,010
You're going for Makki, huh?
- I got hit! I'm down.

487
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,450
I lost.

488
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,720
It's my loss.

489
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,220
So cute!

490
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Cute!

491
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,070
You'll give it to me?

492
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,620
Thank you.

493
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:11,340
