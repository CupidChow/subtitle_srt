1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,960
Something that I want.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:17,830
No!

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,410
Keep your hands off!

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:31,150

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:40,500
April    2014

6
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,700
What happened to your cheek?

7
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,050
If I remember well,
you are Tana...

8
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,710
No! It's Takagi.

9
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,090
It's none of your business.

10
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,070
What?

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,930
Do you always call out to
people you know?

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,980
How about you?

13
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,200
Why'd you return my
question to me?

14
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,060
I mean, I'd get curious if I saw
someone walking while crying.

15
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm not crying.

16
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,670
What? Then, why are you
holding your cheeks?

17
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,890
Does it hurt?

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,250
Don't touch me!

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
What's wrong with you?

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,080
Well...

21
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,180
Alright! I won't lay my hands on you.

22
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,780
Let me see it then.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,380
It's puff red!

24
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,310
A bit swollen!

25
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,920
I'll cool it down when I get home.

26
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,380
Really?

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,730
Want me to walk you home?

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,740
No need. I don't want to
get involved with a guy.

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,100
So, you'd be fine if it
was with a girl?

30
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,280
What if I were gay?

31
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,120
No!

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,750
You don't need to send me home.

33
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,460
Hey.

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Who hit you on the cheek?

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,840
Your dad?

36
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,720
Why do you ask?

37
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,430
You're not from around here.

38
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,490
What? Why do you know where I live?

39
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,560
I mean, I don't where your house is,

40
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,340
but around this area is the grade
school where we used to go.

41
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,960
What if I actually moved
into a new house?

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,650
Is that so?

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,530
Just an example.

44
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,450
Then, where are you headed?

45
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,460
A senior's place.

46
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,050
Hey, this senior of yours,
does he live alone?

47
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,950
I guess.

48
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,440
I want to go with you too!

49
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,430
What? Are you an idiot?

50
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,840
But why?

51
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,300
Living alone is so cool though!

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,070
If you want to smoke, go ahead.

53
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,200
No, I don't have a stick.

54
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,910
I don't even smoke.

55
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,450
A lot of rumors go around about
you, but you're actually nice.

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,710
I don't wanna be told that by a
kid whose family name is "Senoo."

57
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,750
We're not in the same class
but you actually knew?

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,020
You're "Makio Senoo", right?
I know you.

59
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,970
You kinda stand out at school.

60
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,680
Not really though.

61
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,810
This...

62
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,540
My boyfriend did this to me.

63
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,960
It's like...

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,880
He was about to do
something weird to me,

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,170
he beat me up when I refused.

66
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,260
Men...

67
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,720
Maybe all men are like that?

68
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,290
Or am I just crazy?

69
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,810
Of course not!

70
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,570
He's not a good man at all!

71
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,290
What?

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,430
What?

73
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,630
What to do...

74
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,000
You must have been so scared.

75
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,690
I want to break up with him.

76
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,900
Go, end it with him!

77
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,720
Well, if you really like him,
it would be so hard but...

78
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,410
In the first place, it's not
like I really liked him though.

79
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,830
What?

80
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,990
It's like...

81
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,670
My senior introduced him to me,
and then I got carried away.

82
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,460
Here.

83
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,200
You don't like it?

84
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,750
No.

85
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,790
I just got shocked because you
took out my most favorite food.

86
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,500
Kakipi?
[ Mixture of (mildly) spicy rice crackers and peanuts ]

87
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,090
You're an odd one.

88
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,470
I'll have one too.

89
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,610
Hey!

90
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,020
Is your cheek alright now?

91
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,040
I guess so.

92
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,160
That's nice.

93
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,820
Moreover...

94
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,050
Don't tell anyone about
what happened that day, okay?

95
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,850
That you cried that other day?

96
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,660
I wasn't!

97
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
Hey, Makki! Morning!

98
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,620
Hey, good morning!

99
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,500
Right, did you see Sanga's
game yesterday?
[ SANGA: Kyoto Sanga F.C. professional football club ]

100
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,790
I didn't. Nope.

101
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,190
Sanga was insane!

102
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,460
When it was their turn to---
- Are you serious?

103
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,560
It was so amazing!

104
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,940
I didn't see it!
- Everyone saw!

105
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,670
That was crazy.
- But, you know...

106
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,320
Already broke up with your boyfriend?

107
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,780
That's over with.

108
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,950
Did you guys argue?

109
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Yeah.

110
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm happy for you.

111
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, you think you can get
a new boyfriend soon?

112
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,780
No.

113
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm not getting one for
the rest of my life.

114
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,040
Rest of your life?

115
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,510
I'm not really good at
stuff like that.

116
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,180
Being touched,
getting all mushy.

117
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,120
Still, saying "for the rest of
your life" is too much.

118
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,460
I guess, you're that kind.

119
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,870
Hating men because of your boyfriend?

120
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,450
That's not all.

121
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,680
Did I wake you up?

122
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,140
Water.

123
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,190
Wait.

124
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,190
There.

125
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,660
What? That's how it ends?

126
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,340
What a bummer! Give me
the next volume.

127
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,670
I only have the one that
ends right there.

128
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,610
Well, hurry up and swap with me.

129
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,130
Buy your own copy.

130
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,510
That'll make me run out
of money in no time.

131
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,300
Why not work part time?

132
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,430
Part time? That sounds good.

133
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,100
Want to come join me?

134
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,770
Me?

135
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,810
Senoo?

136
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,040
We need to move rooms.

137
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,750
I brought your books.
Let's go.

138
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,940
Thanks.

139
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm going.
- Yeah, see you.

140
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,040
Other people's books?

141
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,760
There's something I wanted to ask you.

142
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,310
What is it?

143
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,850
You going out with Senoo?

144
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
We're not.

145
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,720
Really?

146
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,610
If so, don't get too close to him.

147
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,750
A lot of girls like him.

148
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,990
That's right.

149
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,410
That's up to me to decide though.

150
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,990
What?!

151
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,660
Wait... Hold up.

152
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,450
What are you saying?

153
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,670
Wait up.

154
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,340
You know,

155
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,140
I was told not to get close with you.

156
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,360
By who?

157
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,590
3rd Years.

158
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,130
3rd Years?

159
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,640
You know, that girl who
brought your books.

160
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,680
She was ticking me off.

161
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,810
Someone in class asked me today.

162
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,150
Asking if I'm dating you.

163
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,380
Hopeless bunch.

164
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,400
I think he has a thing for you.

165
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,530
Though I told him that
you hate men.

166
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,830
People really like that kind of talks.

167
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,160
They're too desperate for love.

168
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,290
As always, you're giving
me the cold shoulders.

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,540
Still, I actually like that
side to you, Mieko.

170
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,210
I think the people at school
are way too young.

171
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,510
But, they're all good people.

172
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,510
You aren't as childlike as you look.

173
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,560
I like adults, though.

174
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,480
But, that means I'm still a kid.

175
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,110
I want to hurry up and
become an adult.

176
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,150
If I were with Makki,

177
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,410
we'd be able to stay together without
being bothered about being a man or woman.

178
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,570
If this form of relationship continues,

179
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,670
I wonder if the day this will
end would ever come?

180
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,340
1st year.

181
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,340
I wanted to ask for clarification,

182
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,250
but you guys are not dating, right?

183
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,440
No, we're not.
Not even planning to.

184
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Well, you guys are fine if I
put you in the same shift?

185
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,650
Yes, all good.

186
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,700
Well then, first, we need you both
to learn about the job.

187
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,660
Can you come tomorrow?

188
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,250
Yes.

189
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,490
Are you good at
remembering people's faces?

190
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,370
Yes.

191
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,210
This work suits you.

192
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,560
Really? Thank you so much!

193
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,320
Really?

194
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,140
You're my juniors.

195
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,940
What? Is that so?

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,490
I went to Hyakumanben too.

197
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
What?!

198
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,390
Thanks for waiting.

199
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,690
How can you tie it so properly?

200
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,820
And why is yours so weirdly tied?

201
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,000
Is it right, right?
- No.

202
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,710
Spin it?

203
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,300
No, spinning it will
get it undone.

204
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
What? Right?

205
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,630
No, that's wrong.
- Other way?

206
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,890
No, that looks weird.

207
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,200
If you do that,
it'll get undone.

208
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,560
No, it won't. It looks weird.

209
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,020
It's not.
- It is.

210
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,210
There... or not.
- Take it off.

211
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,980
No, no. Do it from the start.

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,050
Alright.

213
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,400
What are we going to do today?

214
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,510
Right.

215
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,720
Hey.

216
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm thrilled.

217
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,220
Right part seems loose.

218
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,300
Loose?

219
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,120
Really?
- Looks good.

220
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,240
Is it?

221
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,510
Mine looks good too.

222
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,710
Nice to meet you.

223
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm Fukunaga.

224
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,150
Hi there.

225
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,710
It's not only the manager
who works here?

226
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,140
Of course!

227
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,330
Are you both 1st years?

228
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,610
You look so young!

229
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,530
Let's get along.

230
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,790
Please take care of us.

231
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,390
Senoo and Takagi, right?

232
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,690
You got nicknames?

233
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,720
Nicknames?

234
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,860
Take a seat.

235
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm Makki.

236
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,710
Makki?

237
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,980
She's Mieko "Booh" Takagi.

238
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,470
Excluding the "Booh."

239
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,810
Makki and Miechan.

240
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,050
I'm Eiji.

241
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,730
"Ei" from "Forever"
and "Affection"...

242
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,620
But it seems embarrassing to
say that about yourself.

243
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,530
Eichan or Ei...

244
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,290
What a hassle. I'll just
call you "Eiji."

245
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,500
Hey, he's older than us.
- It's fine, call me Eiji.

246
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,170
She's a former delinquent so I don't
know why she's being caring.

247
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,300
I'm not!
- Ouch.

248
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,680
Why would you say that?
- That really hurt bad.

249
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,790
You guys get along so well.

250
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,170
You dating each other?

251
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,390
I could drop dead with how
people always ask that but no.

252
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh, I see.

253
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,140
Right? Ex-delinquent?

254
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,170
I said, I'm not!

255
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,310
You gotta be careful with her.

256
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,050
A former delinquent?

257
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,230
Don't give him a weird impression of me!

258
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,200
You guys slacking off?

259
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,230
We're sorry!

260
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,890
Alright.

261
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,350
Thank you for waiting.

262
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,720
Coming.

263
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,960
Please take care of this, Eichan.
- Sure.

264
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,500
Can you bring the food to them?

265
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,830
There are 2 plates.
- Sure.

266
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,200
Be careful.
- Sure.

267
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,190
Excuse me!
- I'll be with you in a while.

268
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,770
Oh, sorry.

269
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,760
Thanks.

270
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,600
Do come again.

271
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,350
Next time.

272
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,110
See you.

273
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,830
Thank you so much.

274
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,190
Good work!

275
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,090
So exhausted.

276
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,740
He was an odd guy, huh?

277
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,490
What a weird customer.

278
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
Him, you mean?

279
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,490
That went down fast.

280
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,740
Liked a boiled octopus.

281
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,190
I mean, he's got a cute side too...

282
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,230
I guess so.

283
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,030
Isn't it this one?

284
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,890
What?

285
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,520
Eiji's car.

286
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,300
You sure?

287
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,870
This is his, right?

288
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,680
It's his!
- Seriously?!

289
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,850
So huge!

290
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,060
It's this huge!

291
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,560
I swear, this is expensive!

292
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,020
No way!

293
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,650
I want to get a ride!

294
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,940
The seats look cool too.

295
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,480
Some kind of... leather?
- What? Really?

296
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,280
Fake leather? Really?
- For real?

297
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,820
Might be the real deal.

298
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,900
Is it open? Pry it open?

299
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,420
No, no. Stop it.

300
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,080
Don't touch this until it's dry.

301
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,310
Alright.

302
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,220
Right, I have to go shopping.

303
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,660
Okay.

304
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,990
Oh, right.

305
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,960
Seems like Eiji's car is
a Cruiser Rankle.

306
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,450
He's got it good.

307
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,230
There you go again.

308
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,720
Should I say goodbye to
scooters and buy a car instead?

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,720
If so, then you'll only be able to
get a license later on.

310
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,560
Oh, right! What should I do, Mieko?

311
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,730
A Rankle?

312
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,270
Seems nice how you have
something you want.

313
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,770
I'm sure you have something
you like, don't you?

314
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,540
What?

315
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,630
Like a year's supply of kakipi?

316
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,360
I do like it but I don't need it.

317
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,620
Really?

318
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,120
Give it a thought.

319
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,790
Not one.

320
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,000
Still nothing?

321
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,340
Alright.

322
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,290
Still, it was the right thing
for us to choose to work.

323
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,610
Right.

324
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,300
The food is great, and we're just
carrying things which is easy.

325
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,530
Also, Eichan's a nice guy.

326
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,960
Wait, you opened up so
quickly to Eiji, though.

327
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,600
Even when you had your
guard up with that young guy.

328
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,790
That's right!

329
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,040
You got excited.

330
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,900
The first time we shook hands,
I didn't feel like I hated it.

331
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,330
Even when I wouldn't
shake hands with guys.

332
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,490
There must be something decisively
different about him from the guys at school.

333
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,600
Maybe he's married?

334
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,940
What? At 22?

335
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,810
Too early.

336
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,640
Nope, I don't know.

337
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,500
But doesn't he seem
kinda androgynous, though?

338
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,260
Maybe... gay?

339
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,470
That might be it.

340
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,810
What you said just now...

341
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,350
Were you talking about me?

342
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,440
How'd you know?

343
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,030
Were we right?
- What? How'd you know?

344
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,460
Where? My mannerism?

345
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,540
You're asking "where"?

346
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,050
How quickly you admitted it.

347
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,480
I wasn't sure if I should say that
to youngsters these days.

348
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,300
We're somewhat sorry.

349
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't apologize.

350
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,140
I just realized it recently.

351
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,460
Recently?

352
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
Like...

353
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,130
How the manager seems cool.

354
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,240
You'll have to cut it right there.

355
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,230
I know!

356
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm not going for him or anything.

357
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,270
You're interesting, Eiji.

358
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,640
Honestly.

359
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,500
You guys are the first ones
I've told about this.

360
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,610
We'll gladly take your first.

361
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,030
What's that about?

362
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,490
Want some kakipi?

363
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,030
Why do you always have
some kakipi with you?

364
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,820
Because I like it.

365
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,510
I don't have much left.

366
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,160
Alright, give me your palm.

367
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,500
What?

368
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,330
Here you go.

369
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,140
Your hand too, Eiji.

370
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,190
Can I?

371
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,590
Something that

372
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,010
I want.

373
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,020
Yeah, kakipi really tastes so good.

374
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,360
Good, right?
- Yeah, it is.

375
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,610
Tastes sour.
- Right?

376
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,680
Delicious! Tastes good, right?

377
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,760
Right?

378
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,550
You gotta catch this.
- What?

379
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,980
Can you catch it?

380
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,420
Hey! What was that about?

381
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,750
What's that?

382
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,300
There. Right over there.

383
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,810
Feel free.

384
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,680
Hey! Hey!

385
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,590
True.

386
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,740
Tastes good.

387
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,080
I got some too.

388
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,980
What do you have in there?

389
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,770
Some imokenpi I bought at the market.
[ Imokenpi - sweet potatoes in shape of fries and sugar coated ]

390
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,060
What? Really?
- Imokenpi?

391
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,570
I like it!
- Really?

392
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,710
They were selling these.

393
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,880
Really?
- For real?

394
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,420
Seriously?!

395
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,610
Getting some without
holding back?

396
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,340
Why?
- Aren't you giving this to us?

397
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,620
No, I'm not.
- Didn't you take it out because you want to?

398
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,790
Doesn't matter now.
- So good.

399
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,080
So good.
- This tastes good too.

400
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,370
Kakipi.

401
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,920
So good!

402
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,800
I don't like kakipi that much.

403
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,380
What? It is though?
- It's the one you dropped.

404
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,470
Nope.

405
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,510
So? What should we do?
We're so bored.

406
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,680
That's right.

407
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,410
What are you doing, Eiji?
- What?

408
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,140
What you up to?

409
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,100
Usual things?
- What you usually do?

410
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,940
Usual stuff?

411
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,210
Still, I...
- Do you gamble?

412
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,640
Gambling?
- Is gambling profitable?

413
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,360
I've never gambled.
- Gamble?

414
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,290
Should we go to a coffee shop?

415
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,380
You're really an adult.

416
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,670
An adult.

417
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
Good for you.
- Adult, huh? Yeah.

418
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,760
What do you guys do?
Like after school?

419
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,500
After school? Go to McDonald's.

420
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,700
McDonald's?
- Yeah, McDonald's.

421
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,600
What do you guys do there?

422
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,680
Well, just this.

423
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,770
I see.
- Just eating.

424
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,520
This could turn into a potato.

425
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,850
Right, an imokenpi.

426
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,650
Imokenpi.
- Potato, huh?

427
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,880
My hands feel so dry.

428
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,840
Oh, right. What should we do?

429
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,490
What about?
- Next thing to do.

430
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,930
We're doing something right now.

431
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,310
I see.

432
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,560
What to do? But you guys
are surprisingly doing well.

433
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,580
Really? You're kidding?
- What?

434
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,920
This here...
- Are you working well?

435
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,460
I am.

436
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,650
How many years have
you been doing this?

437
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,970
You guys.

438
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,700
Sorry, sorry.

439
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,160
You are definitely slacking off.
- So sorry.

440
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,300
No, we're sorry.

441
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,800
No, we're not skipping work.

442
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,290
You both are.
You hid something just now.

443
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
What did you buy?

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,420
Come on, you...

445
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,550
You guys are really skipping
work. About your pay...

446
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,820
No, no!
- Please, stop it!

447
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,550
Please, don't say that.
We're pleading.

448
00:26:37,880 --> 00:27:39,070
