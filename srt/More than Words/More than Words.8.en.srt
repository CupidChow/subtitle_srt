00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,370
MAY     2018

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,290
7 months in already.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,090
Hurry and come over.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,650
I surely will.
I want to see Eiji too.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,490
You haven't went to see
dad yet, right?

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,410
That's right.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,460
Sorry.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,170
No, I'm sorry. I asked
you something weird.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,650
What brought this all
of a sudden?

11
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,860
I mean, I've been wanting to see
you again after such a long time.

12
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,110
What's this about? You're
finally resigning from your company?

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,340
No, I'm not resigning.

14
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,760
What the heck.

15
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,620
Alright, thanks for waiting. Here's
your assorted yakitori. Dig in!

16
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,150
I want a refill too.
- Coming right up.

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,940
Thanks.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,860
Also, some chilled potatoes.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,940
Tomato? Thank you.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,780
1 tomato, and 2 cold ones.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Coming!

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm having a child.

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,400
Seriously?! You've done so well!

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,200
I got it. You're scared out
of your wits, aren't you?

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,040
No.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,370
I'm happy. Really happy.

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,550
And then?

28
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,090
Because of that, I lost contact
with someone I care deeply about.

29
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,340
I don't know what's going on.

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,510
I can't see that person anymore.

31
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,810
But now, I have a wife by my
side and a child soon to be born.

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,090
I ask myself,
"What should I have done?"

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,360
Here you go.
Thank you for waiting.

34
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,950
Thank you.

35
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,160
I mean, even if I think about it,
I still haven't found the answers.

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,330
But, of course. You're the
one who has to carry it.

37
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,170
Eat.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,890
Sure!

39
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,510
Hi!

40
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,480
For now, that's all you need
for a swaddling blanket.

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,730
It's fine. Don't pack so much in.

42
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,070
If it's not enough, I think Eichan will
bring back home a few again.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,070
I'll leave some snacks too.

44
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,950
Hospital food alone
will make you hungry.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,910
You like it, don't you?

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,670
Your dad used to like it too.

47
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,710
What?

48
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,750
You don't remember?

49
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,940
When you were still a kid, you used
to sit next to your father drinking

50
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,640
and kept saying, "I like this a
lot" and ate it quite a lot.

51
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,160
Mieko?

52
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,790
What happened?

53
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,290
Hey, Mieko?

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,510
What happened to you?

55
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,970
Hey, Mieko?

56
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,970
Really, you...

57
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,340
Oh, Mieko...

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,570
Are you experiencing
pain waves now?

59
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,680
Alright, let's push a bit harder.

60
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,880
Take two deep breaths and while
exhaling, put some force into it.

61
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,280
You're doing great.
Okay, here we go.

62
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,560
Alright, push!

63
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,230
Please take a good look
at your belly button.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,150
Alright!
- You're doing well!

65
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,990
Doing great! Let's push a bit more.

66
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,030
Yes, that's it. Going great!

67
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,110
You're doing very great!
- Keep pushing!

68
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,140
That's it! You're doing so well.
You really did it!

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,980
You're doing great!
You're alright!

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,610
Yes.

71
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,120
Excuse me.

72
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,090
Congratulations.

73
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,660
Thank you so much/
- Congratulations.

74
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,760
So adorable.

75
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Congratulations.

76
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,180
If anything happens, please
press the nurse call button, okay?

77
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,600
Excuse me.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,410
Alright, you'll need to support
the head properly.

79
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,730
Hi there!

80
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,800
So adorable!

81
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,210
Miechan.

82
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,460
Thank you.

83
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,260
Thank you!

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,290
Let me hold the baby.

85
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,250
Let me hold her.
- Alright.

86
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,690
Be careful.

87
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,470
Come here.

88
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,030
Here you are.

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,510
Eichan.
- Here's your dad.

90
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,830
To Papa.
- Yes, Papa.

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,980
The baby smiled!

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,690
She's smiling!

93
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,570
So cute.

94
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,460
Mieko.

95
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,710
Anna.

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,250
Anna, you came.

97
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,200
Hey.

98
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,130
Oh, so adorable!

99
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,270
So small!

100
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,910
You really did so well.

101
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,410
Thank you.

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,290
The baby's smiling.
- You got it right.

103
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,100
You know?

104
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,810
I didn't come alone.

105
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,560
Mama and

106
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,940
Papa were here the whole time.

107
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,870
If you're still feeling that way,
I can ask them to come back again.

108
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,590
It's fine. Let them in.

109
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,650
Papa, Mama.

110
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,670
Thank you.

111
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,200
We are so sorry.

113
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,920
Mieko-chan, congratulations.

114
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,390
Please have a closer look at her.

115
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,580
Listen, Eichan...

116
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,250
You know what?

117
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,040
You're like my friend, my big brother,
my younger brother, my son,

118
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,840
all of that rolled into one
which I really love.

119
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,800
So feel free to do as you please.

120
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,980
Don't think too much about
what's best for me or for Shiho.

121
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,020
Miechan...

122
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,400
I like you, Miechan.

123
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,700
Thank you.

124
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,160
You're not taking me seriously.

125
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,870
I'm telling the truth.

126
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,500
Take that for me.

127
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,560
How do you feel about Shiho?

128
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,900
Well, I think she's cute
beyond any logic.

129
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,270
I feel the same way about you too.

130
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,010
I want to see Makki too.

131
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,510
You know?

132
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,350
About Makki...

133
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
I may have overlapped
him with my father.

134
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,840
My father who left me.

135
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,990
Makki, he...

136
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,950
He's unlike a lover or a friend.

137
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,040
But...

138
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,090
It made me think about how I
didn't want to separate from him.

139
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,840
And then,

140
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,560
I finally realized.

141
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,100
I...

142
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,030
I didn't want Makki to
to leave me no matter what.

143
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,330
It didn't work this time, either.

144
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,070
"Things with Makki aren't over yet."

145
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,050
Is that what you always thought?

146
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Miechan, you are loved by
all kinds of people.

147
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,740
That's why, you're allowed
to love yourself more.

148
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,220
Are you cold? Cold?
- Right.

149
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,130
Good morning.

150
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,700
Good morning.

151
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,010
Excuse me for a bit,
but that trash...

152
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,170
Senoo?

153
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,460
Makio Senoo?

154
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,800
Who're you?

155
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,130
Remember? We were in the
same class in 6th grade.

156
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm Sugimoto. Asato Sugimoto.

157
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,060
You're so tall now.

158
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,440
You haven't changed.

159
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,060
Wait, what are you
doing with those trash?

160
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,210
Disposing.

161
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,870
You can't. Burnable garbage is tomorrow.

162
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,980
I know that but,

163
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,800
do you have to be that tight?

164
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,430
Of course. That's what
has been decided.

165
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,620
How troublesome.

166
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,290
It's a pain in the ass, but it's a shared
place. You've got to follow the rules.

167
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,300
Burnable trash is tomorrow, alright?

168
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,590
Annoying.

169
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,560
This seat please.

170
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,400
Please excuse me.

171
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,660
Excuse me.
- Sure.

172
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,650
Is this force just enough for you?

173
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,640
Yes, it feels good.

174
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,150
What's up? Coming home from work?

175
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,600
That. Your burnable trash.
Did you throw it out?

176
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,450
A bit early.

177
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,760
You're way ahead of schedule.

178
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,390
Do it tomorrow!

179
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,520
Collection is at 8 o'clock
in the morning.

180
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,370
You're a pain in the ass.
What are you, my mom?

181
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,440
What?

182
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,900
Rather, why are you so
bothered about it?

183
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,360
I mean, those will come over.

184
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,470
Cats, crows, and that thing.

185
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,120
That?

186
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,850
Cockroaches?
- You don't have to mention it.

187
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,750
What are you laughing for?

188
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,810
If that's the case, tell me when you're
gonna take out the trash, Sugimon.

189
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,800
I can't get up in the morning.

190
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,180
What? You don't want to
wake up in the morning?

191
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,390
I worked the night shift today.

192
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,880
Alright.

193
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,770
If that means we get to
follow garbage disposal rules.

194
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,600
Just how much hate do
you have for cockroaches?

195
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,440
You can't hold it against me.

196
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm sure you've got a thing
or two when it comes to weaknesses.

197
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,160
That's right. I do.

198
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,980
What? So early in the morning?

199
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,650
Garbage disposal.

200
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,450
You're right.

201
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,600
What? You're too spoiled.

202
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,020
It's just right over there.

203
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,020
Nah, I'd whip that line
right back at you.

204
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,560
You're lucky I even woke up.

205
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,970
Come, just take it. It's light.
- Geez, hand it over!

206
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,580
Hey, do you only ever
eat cup noodles?

207
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,020
All I have is a kettle.

208
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,200
Breakfast, lunch, dinner?

209
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,900
No, I don't eat in the mornings.

210
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,400
It's the simplest one to
prepare, and it's good too.

211
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,700
Are you even alright?

212
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,540
Here.

213
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,500
Woah! It looks so delicious!

214
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,170
Can I eat now?
- Be my guest.

215
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,380
Thank you for the food.

216
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,270
Woah! So good!

217
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,660
You came up with this yourself?

218
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,240
It's just curry udon.

219
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,910
No way!

220
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,470
It's a little bit different.

221
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,160
It's got rice cakes
and stuff in it.

222
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,330
Well, I just made it up
as I went along.

223
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,700
Well, I can only ever cook by
adding blends of seven spices.

224
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,950
That's not even called cooking.

225
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,630
It's still cooking.

226
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,010
Rice cake.

227
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,060
I'll wash the dishes.

228
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,710
Geez, what a waste!

229
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,150
It's fine!

230
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,220
The more soap, the more fun.

231
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,160
You really are an odd one.

232
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,370
What?

233
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,380
It's just that when I saw
you yesterday morning,

234
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,620
I thought that something
about you kinda changed.

235
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,140
It's been 10 years.
People change.

236
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,020
No.

237
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,210
I was kinda shy, and
I didn't have many friends.

238
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,200
You always talked to everybody.

239
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,040
You're having a good time.

240
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,050
You really remember, huh?

241
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,440
What are you doing for work?

242
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,400
Part-time at a convenience store.

243
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,110
Sugimon, what's it like
being a hairdresser?

244
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,910
I'm still an assistant, though.

245
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,540
All I can do is apply shampoo
and most of the other chores.

246
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,050
Come on, stop that!

247
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,780
No!
- Stop it!

248
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,680
Stop it!
- Here I come.

249
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,820
Just stop that!
- I'm going for your face!

250
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,350
No, don't... Don't say
you're going for it!

251
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,340
Hello?

252
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,710
Hey, you doing well?

253
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,810
How's work?

254
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,850
Well, not bad.

255
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,600
How about you, big bro?

256
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,980
Same here. So-so.

257
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,690
You should drop by and
visit grandpa sometimes.

258
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,280
I mean, I'm going to the care facility
to volunteer next time so...

259
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,700
You did say so.

260
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,450
Well, let's go out for
some food next time.

261
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,750
See you.

262
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,340
Bye.

263
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,070
That's it.

264
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,000
You couldn't reach the target time.

265
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,620
It's the same hairstyle as yesterday.

266
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,030
Yes. I'm sorry.

267
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,230
Sugimon.

268
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,070
On your way back?

269
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,490
I was just about to make
dinner. Want to eat with me?

270
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,830
I want to.

271
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,520
It smells so damn good.
What are you cooking?

272
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,270
Oyakodon.

273
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,950
What? That was close!

274
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,000
I mentioned I wanted to
eat it during lunch.

275
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,280
You almost had it coming.

276
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,310
I mean, I'm the type who eats the same
thing all over again so no problem.

277
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,840
Senoo, you're...

278
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,460
You're like a cat.

279
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,800
By cat,

280
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,050
it eats that, you know?

281
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,760
That?

282
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,800
Cockroa...
- Geez! Come on!

283
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,960
Right when I'm cooking too!

284
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,640
Houses that have cats will
be able to get rid of that.

285
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,900
Aren't you glad I came?

286
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,770
Great for you that you're not
bringing out its name,

287
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,890
but enough talking about that.

288
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
You really must not like it at all.

289
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,990
How about you?

290
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,960
You said you've got weaknesses.

291
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,750
What is it?

292
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,220
A woman and a child.

293
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,830
