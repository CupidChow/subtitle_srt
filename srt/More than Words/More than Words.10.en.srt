1
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,560
You a stalker?

2
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm not.

3
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,510
Don't pretend to be out
of your house.

4
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,730
You really are a stalker, then.

5
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,700
Something happened between
you and Takagi?

6
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,630
I told you before that my weakness
is a woman and a child, right?

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,470
By 'woman', I meant her, and by
'child', I meant our child.

8
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,520
What?

9
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,770
"Our child"?
Takagi is married.

10
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,650
Well, her husband is
my ex-boyfriend.

11
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,950
What?!

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,160
I mean, roughly speaking,

13
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,540
Mieko and I worked part-time
together during 1st year in highschool,

14
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,260
and that's where we met Eiji who
was 6 years older than us,

15
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
and the three of us got along well.

16
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,060
And then, Eiji and I started
going out with each other.

17
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,600
But, about 3 years later,

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,350
his dad was against our relationship.

19
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,570
And that's when Mieko said,

20
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,860
"I'll give birth to your child,"

21
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,620
"so you guys don't have
to break-up" or something.

22
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,830
The three of us did it.

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,250
How bizarre.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Bizarre, isn't it?

25
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,010
Now that I'm thinking about it,
it really was weird,

26
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,180
but we were all desperate back then,

27
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,750
and we assumed that
that was the only way.

28
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,850
So, Mieko got pregnant.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,650
Your child?

30
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,530
No, it was Eiji's.

31
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,860
As I look at Eiji's heart change and
is filled with affection for Mieko,

32
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,800
I just couldn't take it anymore.

33
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,340
Well, Mieko is Mieko,
but the way it looked to me,

34
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,910
she was lying when she
said the child was mine.

35
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,020
So you---

36
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,310
I feel so betrayed by the
two of them and it ate me.

37
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,030
And then, before she gave birth,
I went and started living here.

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,950
You haven't seen them
since then?

39
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,170
If they're married and doing well,
that's all that matters.

40
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,310
Sorry for telling you all these nonsense.

41
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
Thanks for waiting.

42
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,530
Thanks.

43
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,500
Welcome.

44
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm meeting someone here.

45
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,290
Happy New Year.

46
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,560
I've started drinking already.

47
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,700
You fine with beer?

48
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,810
Thanks.

49
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,240
You've worked hard.

50
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,590
Your appetizer.

51
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,390
Thanks.

52
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,370
How did your volunteer at the
home facility go?

53
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,710
You saw grandpa?

54
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,120
Well, yeah.

55
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,400
But, he was kinda restless
so he couldn't talk much.

56
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,030
I see. Well, can't do anything about it.

57
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,880
Big bro...

58
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,850
How could you take such
good care of Grandpa?

59
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,390
He's family, after all.

60
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
What makes you think that way?

61
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,240
I don't feel the same way.

62
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,320
To be honest, when I was at
home with him, it was hard for me.

63
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,490
He was very strict.

64
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,140
I was sick of listening to mom
and dad badmouth each other.

65
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,180
Wasn't it that way
with you too?

66
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,780
But still,

67
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,590
I left home as soon as I could
and stayed away from them.

68
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,900
I feel bad for having pushed
grandpa on to you.

69
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
And then you said I'm
taking good care of him?

70
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I only visit him sometimes,
and it doesn't amount to much.

71
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,060
I know it in my head.

72
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,810
But, even though I owe him
one for raising me,

73
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,190
I just don't see him the way you do.

74
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,800
When grandpa collapsed, I thought,

75
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,250
"Everything has to come to an end."

76
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,540
I can't say that he was
a good grandpa,

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,840
but it doesn't change the fact
that he raised us.

78
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,970
That's why, if we accept
the way grandpa is now,

79
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,310
maybe as a result, we'd also
be saving ourselves.

80
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,480
You may think you've done nothing,

81
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,780
but it's not just about
repaying a favor.

82
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,410
Isn't it enough that you
feel grateful?

83
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,790
Did grandpa seem to know you?

84
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,620
Not sure.

85
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,580
Does he recognize you?

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
He sometimes does or not.

87
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,300
It's that bad, huh?

88
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,590
Well, he's got dementia.

89
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,010
I guess we'll just keep moving forward.

90
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,940
One more beer, please.

91
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,930
Asato, the model's here.

92
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,990
Sure.

93
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,850
I've brought a girl
from my workplace.

94
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,180
I am in your care.

95
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,160
Thank you.

96
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,780
Well then, right this way.

97
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,070
I'm leaving now.

98
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,940
I'm sorry, can you take
care of her for me?

99
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,590
Takagi, wait!

100
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,920
Uhh... do you know "Senoo"?

101
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,900
What?

102
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, he was my classmate
back in grade school,

103
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,660
and I coincidentally met
him this other day,

104
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,840
and when I asked him where he
went to junior high and highschool,

105
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,170
I remember that it was the
same school you went to.

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
You know where Makki
currently lives?

107
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,660
No, no...

108
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,850
His contact details?!

109
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,430
His email, through direct message, or
anything at all! Please tell me!

110
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,510
It was just a small chat
we had that day.

111
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,210
I see.

112
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,760
You're looking for Senoo?

113
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,970
If you get his contact details,
please let me know immediately.

114
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't forget, okay?

115
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,190
You know what?

116
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,690
I saw Takagi today.

117
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,740
And then, I know it was bad but,

118
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,460
I mentioned your name.

119
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,710
And then, she...

120
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,030
Her expression changed, and
she was asking me your contact---

121
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,510
You didn't tell her, did you?!

122
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,060
I didn't.

123
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,950
I've been thinking about it.

124
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,510
Why don't you atleast go see her
one time and have a proper talk?

125
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,330
With who?

126
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,500
Takagi, and your ex-boyfriend.

127
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,880
Are you a demon or something?

128
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,930
Takagi has been wanting to see you.

129
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,190
I think she believes that things
between you two aren't over yet.

130
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,410
Isn't it about time to draw the line?

131
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,670
I don't want closure.

132
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,510
I'm scared.

133
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,610
I'm much more scared of seeing
them as much as I do now.

134
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,520
I'm the one who should apologize.

135
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,580
I'm the only one who abandoned the
problem that the three of us caused.

136
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,950
Part of me can't forgive them.

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,660
But it wasn't just one person's fault.

138
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,800
And yet, I'm the only one
who ran away from it.

139
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,770
Get a grip of yourself, Senoo.

140
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,730
It's none of your concern.

141
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,770
I'm sure they regret it as much as you do.

142
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,100
I don't think they want to see
you just to blame you for it all.

143
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,640
Hang on.

144
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,940
I'll also be doing my best.

145
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,740
Make sure you stay right there.

146
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,090
Yes.

147
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,880
If you leave, I'll throw
you around the room.

148
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,460
Rather, I'll excavate you.

149
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,700
Excavate?

150
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,730
Rather, if I get found,
it'd be bad.

151
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,470
This has nothing to do with me,
and I don't know the circumstances.

152
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,100
If you didn't poke your nose
where it doesn't belong,

153
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,190
I wouldn't be here either.

154
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,020
Fine.

155
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,830
Well then, I'm off.

156
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,170
It has been so long.

157
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,800
Right?

158
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,740
Take a seat.

159
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,110
I'm really...

160
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,290
... sorry.

161
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,880
Don't apologize.

162
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,390
There's nothing to apologize for.

163
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,890
You haven't changed at all, Eiji.

164
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,870
Sorry for running away.

165
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,050
Makki...

166
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,770
But the truth is, it's always been

167
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,850
the three of us.

168
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,640
Me too.

169
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
What?

170
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,530
I don't have the keys with me.

171
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,310
Why? You're the one who put it away.

172
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,540
It's not here. You...

173
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,920
What? I don't have it.

174
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,130
There it is.

175
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,970
Geez, you can't even try
to make sure.

176
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,760
You guys really look like
a married couple now.

177
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,640
Something just felt right.

178
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm glad.

179
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,350
We finally saw each other.

180
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,270
Right?

181
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,560
Well then, I got to pick up Shiho.

182
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,100
Take care.

183
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,970
I'll also be going grocery shopping later.

184
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,640
Anything you want to eat?

185
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,770
Sukiyaki?

186
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,170
Okay.

187
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,100
Thanks.

188
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,760
Eichan or Ei...

189
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,860
What a hassle.
I'll just call you "Eiji."

190
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,950
Right, Eiji?

191
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,990
Eiji, try it!

192
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,070
Because you said you're good with it.

193
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,330
You liking me. Do you mean it...

194
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,500
Because Eiji's cooking is so good!

195
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,000
Why would you say that
to me, anyway?

196
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,790
Eiji.

197
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,320
No, don't say that, Eiji.

198
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,950
Thanks.

199
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,890
Senoo...

200
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,360
How are you?

201
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,710
It's just...

202
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,070
You did great.

203
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,160
You really did well.

204
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,190
Over here.

205
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,690
Mr. Sugimoto.

206
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,490
Your other grandchild has come
to visit you today.

207
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,040
Well then, please stop by the
reception desk again once you leave.

208
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,360
Thank you so much.

209
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,860
Have you been buying that stuff again?

210
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,090
I put it out in the living
room a while ago.

211
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,900
Should we get ready?

212
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,300
Grandpa, can I give you a massage?

213
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,110
You used to be so loud before.

214
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,570
And now you're so shriveled up.

215
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,290
You're gotten old.

216
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,050
You...

217
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,220
You're so good at massaging shoulders.

218
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,900
It feels good.

219
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,070
Thank you.

220
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,180
Next up...

221
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,890
I'll get your hair done.

222
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,260
What are you doing here?

223
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,760
Waiting for you.

224
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,060
I'm home.

225
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,900
What are you doing?

226
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,040
When are you going to cut it off?

227
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,960
My hair?

228
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,220
You want it short?

229
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,380
I mean, I'm not really
particular about it.

230
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,430
I can get a shampoo at the store.

231
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,930
You really like that, huh?

232
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,730
After all...

233
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,610
What is it?

234
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,990
Well, the first time you
applied shampoo on my head,

235
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,290
somehow,

236
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,630
I wonder why, but it brought
tears to my eyes.

237
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,760
It really did hurt, then?

238
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,760
No, that's not it.

239
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,590
Then what?

240
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,230
Maybe it has the power
to make me feel relaxed.

241
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,490
Do you still love your
ex-boyfriend to this day?

242
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,960
I thought, I don't ever want
to see his face again,

243
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,510
but now my feelings changed
to wanting to see their child.

244
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,260
That's it for now.

245
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,280
You jealous?

246
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,410
You care too much about me.

247
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,330
Somehow...

248
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,690
More than liking you...

249
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,680
You're very dear to me.

250
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,430
Sorry, it's nothing heavy.

251
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,240
Thank you.

252
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,290
It's Teacher Washimi.

253
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,510
My teacher.

254
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,040
Oh, really?

255
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,010
I see.

256
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,680
So, what did you do with that teacher?

257
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,800
Let's see, that teacher,

258
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,560
taught me a lot of things.

259
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,930
A young man is on his way to us.

260
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,080
Say, "it's nice to meet you."

261
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,210
Nice to meet you.

262
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,300
Pleased to see you.

263
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:35,060
You know, this looks like a big leaf.

264
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,400
A big leaf.

265
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,740
You're right. It is big.

266
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,760
That's right. Just a bit farther.
You know, right?

267
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,500
My kindergarten friends... you see...

268
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,960
Well...

269
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,680
We play all the time at the
picture book club.

270
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,550
In that place, I just..

271
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,530
You know? I play there and have fun.

272
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,720
So much fun, huh?
- And then they...

273
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,270
At the park where they fell...

274
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:18,400
And then they play, and I saw it.

275
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,290
I had the smaller one.

276
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,090
Really?
- Is that so?

277
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,610
You did...
- And big brother...

278
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,660
he got poked a lot of times, once.

279
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,600
He got poked.

280
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,560
By who?

281
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,480
A big brother I don't know.

282
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,730
Is that so?

283
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,110
Shiho, Shiho.
Look, it's a bird. Bird!

284
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,680
Where?
- Over there. Can you see it?

285
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,850
So high, up high.

286
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,730
But, I can see a bit.

287
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,750
Just a bit.
- Right?

288
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,380
You're the same as usual, Makki.

289
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,070
We've changed in our own ways.

290
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,630
Then, have you bought a car?
- Not yet.

291
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,090
Then, a scooter?
- Not yet.

292
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,780
You're ticking me off.

293
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,870
Right?

294
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,190
It's like those are bird
droppings, the white ones.

295
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,330
Right?

296
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,730
Does Shiho like kakipi too?

297
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,680
I think she likes it quite a lot.

298
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
I wouldn't mind her liking
it a little more.

299
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,700
You think so?

300
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,190
That's fine. I can just buy
as many kakipi's you want.

301
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,970
That's very encouraging.

302
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,110
You know, white stones
look so hard.

303
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,250
Right?

304
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,160
Stones are hard.

305
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,590
Well, I'm headed this way.

306
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,400
We'll head straight home now.

307
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,260
See you.

308
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,230
Alright.

309
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,730
Bye.

310
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,440
See you.
- Bye-bye.

311
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,650
Let's go.

312
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:25,780
Okay.

313
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:57,050
