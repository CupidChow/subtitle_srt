1
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,980
So good!

2
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,560
You eat everything as if
it's all so good!

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,480
I gotta give you my
souvenir.

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,150
Souvenir?

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,910
Sweet Potato wine.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,450
Is it so bad?

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,790
What about you?

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,400
On the rocks, without doubt.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,000
Without doubt?

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,100
Make sure you remember.

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,260
Sugimon, you...

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,860
Do you cook your own food everyday?

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,150
I don't cook all the time either.

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,990
I think it's for health or something

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,490
but it's such a hassle.

16
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,750
And if you only have enough food for one
person, you end up with a lot of leftovers.

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,930
Listen...

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,480
From now on,

19
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,970
will you join me for dinner everyday?

20
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,150
What?

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,740
Nah, it sounded like you
were proposing to me.

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,360
I'm not!

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,120
Give me the receipts from yesterday
and today's purchases, then.

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,750
We'll split the food expenses,

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,520
I'll clean up after everything,
and we'll call it even.

26
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,460
What? You feeling shy?

27
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,510
No...

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,570
I knew two was better than one.

29
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
You're right.

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,810
It's so much fun, huh?

31
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,870
Can I turn on the TV?

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
The remote's over there.

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,650
I always watch this.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,780
You good with this?

35
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,860
Hey, hey, hey.

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,850
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,900
Ouch!

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,680
That hurt!

39
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,380
It hurts.

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,090
No... No, no.

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,720
I think I'm the one who
got hurt the most.

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,160
Does it really hurt?

43
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,520
Want me to lick it?

44
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,500
What?!

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,440
I'm just kidding!

46
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,610
I'm keeping this bottle, 'kay?

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,110
Which bar is it?

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,540
All yours.

49
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,780
Looking good mostly,

50
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,740
but the amount of hair on this side is different from
the other, so you'll have to adjust it a little bit.

51
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,860
Alright.

52
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,120
Excuse me. I'm going to
snip a bit more, alright?

53
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,060
You did great.
- Good work today!

54
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,980
Asato, you got a moment?

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,650
Yes.

56
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,950
You know, I'm saying this to you
as your direct supervisor,

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,960
but do you genuinely want to
become a stylist?

58
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,550
I think you do everything flawlessly,
and I think you take it seriously.

59
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,260
But while most hairdressers do this
work because they love it,

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,930
I don't really feel that same kind
of spirit from you, Asato.

61
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,900
You yourself, what do you think?

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,700
I do have a desire to
become a stylist.

63
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,420
I love to style and I love my work.

64
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,880
But, to be honest,

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,510
aiming for something
bigger than that,

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,800
is something I do not
have such strong desires for.

67
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,060
That's what you think too?

68
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,020
Yes.

69
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,190
Understood.

70
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,490
I guess I'll have you sit out
the exam this time.

71
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,990
I can't help but accept
the current state.

72
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,330
It'll only be hard for you.

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,330
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm here.

75
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,780
What are we having tonight?

76
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,620
Stew.

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
What are you spacing off for?

78
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,370
It's quite cold outside.

79
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,080
See! It'll warm you up.

80
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,380
Right.

81
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,370
Woah, you seem kinda down.

82
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,720
Something happened?

83
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,900
If you're alright with me,
I'll hear what you have to say.

84
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,690
I'll acknowledge everything
so go ahead and try me.

85
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,700
Just wanted to say
something along those lines.

86
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,450
The heck?

87
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,830
The manager...

88
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,250
He asked me if I was serious
about becoming a stylist.

89
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,720
I couldn't answer him.

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,560
Anyway, I just wanted to leave
home and become independent.

91
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,190
That's why I chose the job I did.

92
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,650
I really don't know if I'm
cut out for this job

93
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,710
or not.

94
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,580
If so, why don't you wash
my hair later too?

95
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
What?

96
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,230
Do to me what you do at the salon.

97
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,880
Out of the blue?

98
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,560
It's not sudden.

99
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,450
I've thought about it before.

100
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,020
Am I applying enough force?

101
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,650
Just perfect.

102
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,700
You're a pro.

103
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,530
Pardon?

104
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,830
It feels so good.

105
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,370
That makes me glad.

106
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,410
I'm sorry. Did it get in your eye?

107
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,370
No, just a bit itchy, that's all.

108
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,200
So sorry.

109
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,550
Is it alright if I take
a bath just like this?

110
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,510
Fine with me.

111
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,570
Lemme borrow your dryer.

112
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,670
I knew you were gonna say that.

113
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,420
Here.

114
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,890
It's done.

115
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,030
Hey...

116
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,610
Going to sleep.

117
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,860
What? Right here?

118
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,400
Just until after you've
taken a bath.

119
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,070
What? Alright...

120
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,530
Make sure you go back
to your own room later.

121
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,270
Senoo?

122
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,450
Senoo?

123
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,660
Hey, are you alright?

124
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,600
It's a bit packed so...

125
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,690
Go ahead.

126
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,210
Go back to your room.

127
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,300
I can't. I'm so sleepy.

128
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm going to use the dryer.

129
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,080
Hey.

130
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
What is it?

131
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,970
Can I move a bit closer?

132
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,660
You're so warm.

133
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,790
Senoo?

134
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,050
Listen...

135
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,980
Have you ever liked a guy before?

136
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,610
Why did we head that way?

137
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,480
Right.

138
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,030
Well, I did went out with
a guy before.

139
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
What?

140
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,580
You just said something
so astounding and so quickly.

141
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,580
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

142
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,960
Men and women are
pretty much the same.

143
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,800
No, there's a big difference.

144
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,220
There aren't.

145
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,600
Even women hate who they don't like.

146
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,640
Even men fall for people
they like and that's it.

147
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,860
Maybe if you get to the
bottom of it, I guess.

148
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,130
It's no different with this kind of thing.

149
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,870
You either want to or you don't.

150
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,620
That's all.

151
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,620
Good morning.

152
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,320
We are in your care today.

153
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,250
Please take care of us.
- Thank you so much.

154
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,990
Please be careful on the slope.

155
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,730
Good morning, everyone!

156
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,180
Good morning.

157
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,050
The hairdressers came to see us today.

158
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,970
We will be taking care of you today.

159
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,100
Well then, right this way.

160
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,490
Please excuse me.

161
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,750
You're looking very good.

162
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,170
I really like it.

163
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,400
Is your neck hurting?

164
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,150
Please do so.

165
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,340
Asato.
- Yes?

166
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,420
Can you hand me a mirror?

167
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,910
Sure.

168
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
Here you are.

169
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
Thank you.

170
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,920
What do you think?

171
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,060
Feels great and refreshing.

172
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,930
I like it. Thank you.
- Looking so fresh.

173
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,800
Thank you so much!

174
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,550
I'll take that.
- Thank you.

175
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,940
Furuya, good for you.

176
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,360
Come on, let's get back to your room.

177
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,260
Yes. I like it.

178
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,140
Thank you.

179
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,350
Thank you so much.

180
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,890
I like it.
- Thank you.

181
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,700
Can we call for the next one?

182
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,110
Please do so.

183
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,110
Mr. Sugimoto.
Please come in.

184
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,340
We're going to turn.

185
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,080
Asato, bring me a mirror.

186
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,230
Yes!

187
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,540
I'm home. What?

188
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,250
Going out somewhere?

189
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,540
No.

190
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,960
I just got back home.

191
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,010
You're not cooking today?

192
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,200
I already ate. I'm sorry.

193
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,560
Sorry for intruding.

194
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,860
What happened?

195
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,320
Nah, it's nothing.

196
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,530
What's up?

197
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,840
Sorry.

198
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,430
Hey, what are you doing?

199
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,940
Service.

200
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
What?

201
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,840
Options are also available.

202
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
I don't need it.

203
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,650
Moreover,

204
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,450
I'm really sorry.

205
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,380
It's fine.

206
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,160
I understand.

207
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,750
I don't think it means anything.

208
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,020
Should I... quit work?

209
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,230
You should.

210
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,480
But, I'm not going to.

211
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,810
Then, don't.

212
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,440
Which is it really?

213
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,700
None of those two.

214
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,670
This is about you.

215
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,910
Only you can decide for yourself.

216
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,330
My grandpa...

217
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,930
My grandfather was in a facility.

218
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,100
And he's becoming
more aware of it.

219
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,070
You see, my parents are divorced.

220
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,750
My mom and my older brother
was asked to take care of grandpa.

221
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,350
So, it's almost like grandpa
raised me too, you know?

222
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,920
I see.

223
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,910
But, he was a very strict man.

224
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,000
All I remember is being
held down from above.

225
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,140
He was against me
becoming a hairdresser too.

226
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,190
Looking at my grandpa
who seems so weak and frail,

227
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,950
I'm not ready to forgive him.

228
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,580
Is that so?

229
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,470
I don't like myself being that way.

230
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,150
The heck?

231
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,110
I thought your girlfriend
dumped you or something!

232
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,090
So it was about work and
your grandpa, huh?

233
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,470
I don't have anyone to dump me.

234
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,970
What? You look like you
fare well in life.

235
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,190
What about you? Got nobody?

236
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't have anyone.
I don't need one.

237
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,650
But, you went out with a
man before, right?

238
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,820
Don't you have a photo?

239
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Nope, everything's gone.

240
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,590
What?

241
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,620
You absolutely got hurt then!

242
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,330
No, it was so long ago already.

243
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,880
But, I do think
you're so cool, Sugimon.

244
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,760
After all, I...

245
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,900
When you were applying
shampoo on my head...

246
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,910
Hey, you...

247
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,300
Hey, wait.

248
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,850
You're half-erect.

249
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,860
No, no.

250
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,860
It's too much for me. I can't.

251
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,350
So, what're you going to
do if I did this?

252
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,410
Rather, what's up with you?

253
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,710
Say...

254
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
I guess, you want to be relieved.

255
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,190
I'll put it in you.

256
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,870
Hey, that's not the issue here.

257
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,500
Don't half-ass it, you brat.

258
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,940
Don't underestimate me.

259
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,960
Sugimon.

260
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,920
Look my way.

261
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,770
Don't get bothered about it.

262
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,830
We just got caught by the momentum.

263
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,070
If it distracted you,
it's a good thing.

264
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,540
Even if you say so...

265
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,660
I mean, I'm the one at fault.

266
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,670
It's alright.

267
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm not bothered at all.

268
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,970
Let me use your bathroom.

269
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,560
Things like this

270
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,680
became our daily lives.

271
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,260
DECEMBER 2022

272
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,820
Senoo always seems to get
closer and farther away.

273
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,660
It's like he seems to want it, and not.

274
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,210
Nevertheless, it is true that
eating together with him

275
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,910
made food taste much better
than eating all alone.

276
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,060
I may have found peace with such a

277
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,810
no-strings-attached relationship
before I noticed it.

278
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,860
So cold...

279
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,570
We shouldn't leave a gap on a cold days.

280
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,390
Senoo, you...

281
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,040
Are you just cold or lonely?

282
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,630
You want to hear me say I'm just cold?

283
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,290
What's that?

284
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,010
Hey, if we do it, it'll warm us up.

285
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,100
You are so willful.

286
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,810
Why are you that way?

287
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,650
Nah, just being sudden.

288
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,860
What does it matter?
Getting involved with people.

289
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,080
That's right.

290
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,290
I'm fed up with it.

291
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,540
I might have overindulged.

292
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,750
Sorry.

293
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,950
What are you looking at?

294
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,750
Store sale, huh?

295
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,710
Store sale?

296
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,130
Materials for products
sold in the store.

297
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,220
I'll have to keep that in mind.
I look at it from time to time.

298
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,230
You have to memorize
all these? You have it rough.

299
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,840
Well, that's what you get
for not having the technology.

300
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,820
Sugimon, you got any
photos of the salon?

301
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,400
I do.

302
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,060
It's all women in these photos.

303
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,900
Sample photo hairstyles?

304
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,980
They let me cut their hair for
practice but I don't get paid for it.

305
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,990
Really?  What kind of people do this?

306
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,320
Well, mostly people I know.

307
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,620
I've scouted some people
in front of the train station too.

308
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,540
There are junior high students too.

309
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,170
Well, yeah.

310
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,690
My classmate at the school
I went to, Takagi.

311
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,900
Is that so?

312
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,370
Alright, about time I head home.

313
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,580
Wait, what's wrong?

314
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,940
It's almost morning.

315
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,290
No...

316
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,090
Hey, wait up.

317
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,490
Your mood suddenly changed.

318
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,130
What's wrong?

319
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,010
It's nothing.

320
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,120
"Nothing," my ass.

321
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,550
I can't leave you on your own.

322
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,350
It's nothing.

323
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:54,310
