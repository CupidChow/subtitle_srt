00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,980
JULY      2014

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,870
All good.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,060
That part next.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,880
Sure!

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,080
Hey, hey.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,330
It's almost summer.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,030
Wanna go somewhere?

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,510
Maybe at my villa?

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,470
What?! You own a villa?

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,680
Well, it's nothing incredible though.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,010
But, the mansion looks great.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,350
What? You're rich then!

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,790
So, you got a whirlpool bath?

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,480
I wouldn't have something like that.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,560
You don't?
- Well...

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,040
You should!

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,440
Hey, listen.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,030
Going to a villa and
inviting me as well?

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,060
Make a plan for just the two of you.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
It's much more fun if it's us three.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,350
While we're at it, you
should invite Sakaki too.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,110
You're fine with that?

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm not really thinking about going
anywhere with Makki this quickly.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,660
No, but still...

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,580
What are your plans
going forward?

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,510
Well...

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,870
I think things are fine
the way they are now.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,090
What? That's just...

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,710
Like a maiden in love?
- No, no.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,270
What's that?
Seems good.

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,810
It's really good!

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,270
But, it's not a summer menu.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,510
And by summer, it should be...

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,270
Gotta be conger eel.
Any pike congers.

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,490
Speaking of eel, food...

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,360
I wonder if I can go.

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,970
You can't?

38
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,540
They're kinda strict, and overnight
stay can be such a hassle.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,330
But, Makki's going too.

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,980
I hope you have a fulfilling
summer vacation.

41
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,570
If there's something you want
to do, then go for it!

42
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,950
I hope that you will actively engage

43
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,060
in things that you like
and are interested in.

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,110
However, be careful not to get too crazy,

45
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,860
do something dangerous, or get hurt!

46
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,320
Got it!

47
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,710
Okay. As stated in the print,
part-time jobs and travel...

48
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,840
Want to try and ask?
- Yeah, let's.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,490
You go, Chisa.
- What? No.

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,050
Me? Go.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Now? Really?

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,210
Hey...

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,920
Yes?

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,590
Is Eiji in here?

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,050
Yes.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,970
We got a lot of
customers today, huh?

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,700
A full house.
- Right?

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
Manager?

59
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,250
Customers at table F are
calling for Eiji.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,070
What?

61
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,210
It's fine, go.

62
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,730
Really? Excuse me.

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,170
Can't hide him in a corner, huh?

64
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,220
You're right.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,230
Here.

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,950
Alright, got it.

67
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,180
Hey, at the private room...

68
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,380
I wonder who?

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,940
Eiji's ex-girlfriend?

70
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,310
No, I don't think so!

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,970
I mean, it's possible.

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,890
Rather, the one in glasses
seems familiar.

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,350
What? Who?

74
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,350
I wonder who?

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,950
Makki and Miechan, huh?

76
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,050
I heard from Eiji.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,410
My sister Anna and her friend Chisa.

78
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,020
Hey, Makki. Why is your name "Makki"?

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
My name's Makio.

80
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,090
What? That's so cute!

81
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,570
Uhh, so the younger sister
doesn't speak Kansai?

82
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,740
Yeah, we're originally from Tokyo.

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,180
Our parents are from Tokyo too.

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,120
I came over here when I
was in grade school,

85
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,140
and then, it was only Eiji
who got captivated by Kansai.

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,540
Really?
- He practiced a lot.

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
You don't have to tell them.
- So, you did, huh?

88
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,890
Hey!

89
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,340
Chisa's staying at our place too,
so take us home, okay?

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,380
Fine with me, but you'll have
to wait til' I clean up.

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,800
You good with that?
- Yeah.

92
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,840
Then, in 20 minutes.

93
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,840
Alright, good luck!

94
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,710
You two drink?

95
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,390
We're all good.
- You can't? Not yet?

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,930
We don't.

97
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,800
Come on!
- They're right.

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,120
So, Eichan's a fake?
- He is.

99
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,880
We didn't know.

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,950
Who's that?

101
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,700
It's Chisa, however you view it.

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
Why are you drawing Chisa?

103
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
It's fine.

104
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,620
It is, but...

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,740
Looks good, right?

106
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,600
A little strange.

107
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,690
For real?

108
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,480
You guys can go now.

109
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,650
For real?
- I'm kidding.

110
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,920
Just saying.
- Really now?

111
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, I leave the closing to you guys.

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,920
Right, we'll do so.
- Good work today.

113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,550
Thanks for working hard!

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,720
What are you drawing?
- It's Chisa.

115
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,680
Your younger sister
is so pretty!

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,730
Those two do some kind
of modeling works.

117
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,390
Really?
- A model?

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,730
You shoulder told us you
had an amazing sister like her!

119
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,900
I mean, I guess so, but why would
I when I look like this?

120
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,590
No, don't say that, Eiji.

121
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,720
Thanks.

122
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,770
Got it.

123
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,790
You're the one who
poured the beer?

124
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,710
That's right.
- It was so good!

125
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,210
A genius!
- For real?

126
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,130
But, the mackerel sushi
was also delicious.

127
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,290
Woah, thank you.

128
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,880
You got so good at cooking yet
can't get yourself a girlfriend.

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Shut up.

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,760
But Chisa, you're Chisa Izumi
who does gravure photos, right?

131
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,050
What?! You knew?

132
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,640
That makes me happy!

133
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,350
It's going great between you two.

134
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,560
Right, Eichan?
- Yeah, right.

135
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,600
Still, you guys got
some pretty nails though.

136
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,000
Really? That makes me happy!

137
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,900
You've got beautiful hands too, Makki.

138
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,670
For real?
- It's true!

139
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,880
Like a girl's hand!

140
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,660
You think so?

141
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,690
Oh, right. Where is your family
residence located, Eichan?

142
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,780
Somewhere north.

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,910
What? That's a nice place!
- Oh, really?

144
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,720
I wanna go there.

145
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,950
Hey, wait. Where did my keys go?

146
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
What?

147
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,050
Eichan, there you go again!
- Not again?

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,210
Oh, found it, found it!
- It should be there!

149
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,360
Found it.
- You gotta be focused.

150
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,000
Alright, it's open.
- Open, open!

151
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,420
There is it!
- Go, go, go!

152
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,130
Hey, Eichan. It's not open!

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,670
It is now.
- It's open!

154
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,050
So hot!
- There!

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,220
Eiji, it's so hot!

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,790
Wait, I'll get the engine started.
- Thank you.

157
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,080
Makki, help me out.
- So hot!

158
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,650
It's so hot!

159
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,990
So hot.
- It's on now.

160
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,940
So hot.

161
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,670
Thanks.

162
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,230
Hey, why don't you stay the night?

163
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,740
What?

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,660
Our parents are away at camp,
so perfect timing.

165
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,870
Is it alright?
- It's okay! Right, Eiji?

166
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,270
Fine with me.
What about you, Miechan?

167
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,720
You should come!

168
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,650
It's summer, after all!

169
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,110
That's right. You should join us, Miechan.

170
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,590
Alright, I'm going.

171
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,740
Yay!

172
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,080
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

173
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Sleepover!

174
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,330
Alright, alright!

175
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,710
Seat-belt fastened?
- Done!

176
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,890
Okay, let's go.

177
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,510
Let's go!

178
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,880
Yay!

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,880
Let's drop by a convenience store!
- Go, go, go!

180
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,340
This way.

181
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,080
So huge.

182
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
They're really rich.

183
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,500
Rich.

184
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,510
Amazing!

185
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,060
So wide!

186
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,680
Wait, is this Anna?

187
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,720
It is her.
- Right? So cute!

188
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,910
For real.

189
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,580
Woah, what's this?

190
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Hey, don't touch it!

191
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,290
Insane! That's expensive.

192
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,370
This is probably something luxurious.

193
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,900
The got security cameras!

194
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,900
Amazing.

195
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,860
They've got some big vases.

196
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,670
I said, don't touch it!

197
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,680
It might be luxury items so
get your hands off it.

198
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
Should I get in?

199
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,790
Hey, hey.

200
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,510
Can the girls use the
bathroom first?

201
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Go ahead.

202
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,630
That's our Makki!
Such a gentleman.

203
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,450
So cute!

204
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,300
Hey, I'm sure you're
popular at school, huh?

205
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,940
Nah, I'm not sure.
- Must be popular among the seniors.

206
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,030
I mean, you are this cute!
- Eichan!

207
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,360
Show me around the house.

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,990
Sure.
- You're cute too, Chisa.

209
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,700
That's not true.
- Downstairs maybe?

210
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,700
Downstairs?

211
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,790
Hey, want some tea?

212
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,870
I want some.
- Right.

213
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,940
Hey, hey, hey.

214
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,090
Might be too big for you.

215
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,190
Right.

216
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,860
Right, you're going to the
bath with me, okay?

217
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,130
I'm fine though.

218
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,530
Wait, how about this?

219
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,360
Dream!

220
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,930
It's cute! Wear that.
- Dream?

221
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,540
Hey, look. The back is also patterned.

222
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,680
Looks strange.

223
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,140
You're right.
- I'm done.

224
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,230
You're back.
- Welcome back.

225
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,190
I'm back.
- For your bottoms...

226
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,630
This? I'll let you borrow
this border shorts.

227
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,840
Here you go.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,700
Also, this is a bit fluffy.

229
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,810
Really?

230
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,240
But, I'm using this one.

231
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,680
What? Then what was it for?

232
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,480
And, this is for men.

233
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,040
I see.
- Men's clothing.

234
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,420
Daring to wear it.

235
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,380
That's why it's huge.
- Mieko-chan.

236
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,820
Let me see your hand.

237
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,420
This way.

238
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,740
I knew it. Zero sense of care, this one.

239
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,790
You're right.

240
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,130
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,420
Hand it over.

242
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,260
Cuticle care, and painting the base.

243
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,050
Chisa is good at nail care.

244
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,100
Anna is super good at painting nails.

245
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,690
Hand it over.

246
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,160
This one.

247
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,190
Here.

248
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,860
Hand it over.

249
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,440
We went to a nail school together.

250
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,740
When I was working as a model,
beauty-related stuff became fun.

251
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,000
It's kind of fun to see people
getting prettier, right?

252
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,160
I understand the feeling.

253
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,150
Also, if you work behind the scenes,

254
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,550
you can make a living for the rest of your life.

255
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,560
Isn't it surreal?
- Right?

256
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,780
The shape of your nail is cute.
- Right?

257
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Really?

258
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,640
It's a shame that there aren't
many people this beautiful, huh?

259
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,610
It is!

260
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
There should be a lot!

261
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,920
Looks good now?

262
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,360
It's done!

263
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,820
Nails can become so pretty with
just this much done.

264
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,490
Thank you.

265
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,300
I would have wanted a younger
sister protegee like you, Mieko-chan.

266
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,820
What? Younger sister protegee?

267
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,260
I mean, I only have an older brother.

268
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,370
I see.

269
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,680
Look.
- So pretty, huh?

270
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,140
Look!
- Look!

271
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,810
Both of your nails look pretty.
- I'll do yours later too.

272
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,090
Really?
- We will.

273
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,400
This is bad, bad!

274
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,710
No, this is bad!

275
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,770
This is bad, bad! Looking bad!

276
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,670
Yay! I won!

277
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,850
Like, you suck at this.

278
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,190
I can't. I just can't.

279
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,590
Well, I'm getting sleepy now,
so just keep playing.

280
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,610
What?!

281
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,760
Don't run away.
- I can't do no more.

282
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,400
You're really running away from me?

283
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,050
Hey!
- I can't do it!

284
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,180
Eat all of these.

285
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,010
Nah, go ahead.
- Should I?

286
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,470
Can I?
- Yeah!

287
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,380
I'll have some.

288
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,590
Like the smell?

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,890
Yeah, I do.

290
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,250
Then, face backwards.

291
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,410
I'll give you a massage.

292
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,060
Thank you.

293
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,770
How is it?

294
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,150
Feels good.

295
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,070
Anna-chan.

296
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,780
Anna is good.

297
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,290
Anna.

298
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,480
I already know Eichan but,

299
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,580
why would you do this much?

300
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,990
Because it's fun?

301
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,130
Really?

302
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,430
Also, you are Eiji's friend, right?

303
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,730
It's just... He is...

304
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
Aside from being too gentle,

305
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,230
he's kinda feminine, right?

306
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,690
It's not that he doesn't have friends,

307
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,820
but in the past, there were quite
a lot of people who made fun of him.

308
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,660
Because he's such a nice guy.

309
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,540
I'm kinda happy that you and
Makki get along with him.

310
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,460
We are happy too.

311
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,090
Are you also interested in
cosmetology?

312
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,340
Interest?

313
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,960
Not at all.

314
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,640
Really?

315
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,060
I mean...

316
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,040
If I were someone like you or
Chisa, then maybe I would be.

317
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,120
What do you mean?

318
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,920
I wonder? As a girl?

319
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,090
What are you saying?
You're cute, Mieko!

320
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,260
Not at all.
- No, you are!

321
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,770
No, I'm not!

322
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,580
Sorry.

323
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,090
I've never been told that before.

324
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,260
Stop it.

325
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,220
Do you actually

326
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,100
think of yourself that way?

327
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,570
Are you alright?

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,690
If I were cute,

329
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,750
then why did dad left us?

330
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,540
What?

331
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,130
Sorry, I'll get out first.

332
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,700
Eiji...

333
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,200
I made Mieko cry.

334
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,130
What?

335
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,850
What? What?

336
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,610
What happened?

337
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,460
You made her cry?

338
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,070
We were taking a bath...

339
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,360
What hap---

340
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,160
We were both getting along
well and we got into the bath...

341
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,980
What... what happened?

342
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,610
Calm down, let's calm down, okay?

343
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,630
You made her cry?

344
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,940
What should I do?

345
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,860
It's alright, let's talk.

346
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,030
What should I do?

347
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,410
I don't... Well...

348
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,100
You think she hates me now?

349
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,370
She'll understand if you
explain to her.

350
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
Really?
- It's alright.

351
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,970
What are you doing here?

352
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,220
Nothing much.

353
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,640
Really?

354
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,740
Makki, listen.

355
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,950
What do you think of Chisa?

356
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,500
What I think?
She's pretty, right?

357
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,990
Then, what about Eichan?

358
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,320
What suddenly brought this?

359
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,760
No, it's not sudden.

360
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,170
Listen up.

361
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,150
Even if you're being ambiguous about
it, you're all over the place.

362
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,150
You like Eichan, don't you?

363
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,650
What?

364
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,530
Lately, I've noticed that you two
have been getting along very well.

365
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,180
No need to blush about it.

366
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,890
No, I'm not. You're getting the
wrong idea, you baldie.

367
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,970
I'm not even bald.

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,920
Didn't I tell you that I don't plan
on falling for someone?

369
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,130
"Don't plan"? I don't think
that's the case.

370
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,860
Anyway, you got it wrong.

371
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,190
Still, you make a cute expression
when talking to Eiji though?

372
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,500
What?

373
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,990
I mean, I think Eiji's a great guy.

374
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,990
Nah, that's not it.
Eichan's gay.

375
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,140
Well...

376
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,790
But still...
- Eiji?

377
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,320
What are you saying?

378
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,610
No, I...

379
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,580
I'll talk to you about it later.

380
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,640
No, Makki.
It's a misunderstanding.

381
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,350
I was only talking to
Miechan for her advice

382
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,300
and the one I like is you, Makki.

383
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,840
No, it's...

384
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,140
You don't have to give me an answer.

385
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,120
Sorry for making you
get the wrong of idea

386
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,350
about Miechan liking me.

387
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,940
So, you know?

388
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,460
For now,

389
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,450
you two need a proper talk.

390
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's go.

391
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,380
I didn't know.

392
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,870
So he told you and Makki, huh?

393
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,380
Well,

394
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,070
he did say he only realized it recently.

395
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,110
Besides, isn't it much easier to
tell other people than your family?

396
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
There's that too, Anna.

397
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,820
And so?

398
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,020
You were always cooperating
with him, weren't you?

399
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,720
Thank you.

400
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,560
No, rather than cooperating...

401
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,980
It wasn't "cooperating."

402
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,190
I only just

403
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,280
somewhat didn't want to see
Eichan get hurt.

404
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,930
You asleep?

405
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,770
I'm not.

406
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,890
A lot of thoughts in my head.

407
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,750
Because you and Mieko have been
secretly talking to each other.

408
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,870
I thought you guys had
something nice going on.

409
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,090
No, but...

410
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
You're really looking closely
at Miechan, huh?

411
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,930
Just to put it out there,

412
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,650
Mieko and I don't have that
kind of relationship between us.

413
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,400
That kind of relationship?

414
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,660
You liking me. Do you mean
it in that kind of way?

415
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,220
In that sense.

416
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,360
Dating someone...

417
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,230
I'm not really interested about
the girls over at school but,

418
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,450
if it's with you, I'm having fun.

419
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,580
If I went out with you,

420
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,410
maybe I am interested?

421
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,140
Good morning.

422
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,100
Morning.

423
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,110
What were you doing?

424
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,820
I went for a run.

425
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,490
Aren't you full of spirit?

426
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,170
You know?

427
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
