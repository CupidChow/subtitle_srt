1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,520
What were you doing?

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,300
I went for a run.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,810
Aren't you full of spirit?

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,690
You know?

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,790
I've decide to go out with Eiji.

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,380
Is that so?

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,800

8
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,140
Morning.
- Morning.

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,190
Good morning.

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,270
You guys are up early.

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,190
I heard.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,230
Last night was so intense, huh?

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,300
What?!

14
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,700
No, we didn't!

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,660
We didn't do anything though!

16
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,740
Doesn't really matter.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,290
Miechan.

18
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,580
Thank you for all that you've done.

19
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,940
Let's all still get along
from now on, okay?

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,120
What the heck?

21
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,100
They're back.

22
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,650
Who?

23
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
Our parents.

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,110
Welcome home.

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,300
We had to come back hom from
Shirahama due to heavy rain.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,990
We were supposed to go fishing.

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,640
They are Mieko and Makki,
my workmates.

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,180
Nice to meet you!

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,390
Pleased to meet you.

30
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,890
Hi there! I'm Eiji's dad, Yosuke!

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,520
Hey, you're so embarassing.
- Come on.

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,810
What a funny old man.
- Right?

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,980
We brought souvenirs so
gather around!

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,070
What? We get some too?
- Yay!

35
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,400
Alright, now these are delicious
Arida tangerine jam.

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,530
Is it alright?
- Sure, and from Nanshu...

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,700
Also, plums for bonito flakes.

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,740
See? We went to a hot spring too.

39
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,000
Hot springs?

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,290
You know? Shirahama's hot
springs at Wakayama.

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,790
Wakayama?
- You are so old-fashioned.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,130
We should eat this, you guys.

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,630
Let's eat.
- It's on the news.

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,010
Is that so?
- Open it.

45
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,300
It's too early in the morning!
- What?

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,050
Yeah, alright, alright.

47
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,390
Let's dig in.
- I want a meal.

48
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,850
What? You should try this out.

49
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,500
It's really good!
- Try this first, okay?

50
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,770
Eichan, hurry up.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,020
Hold on.
- It's done.

52
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,610
It's so hard.

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,190
Yeah, alright. It's done. All good.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,990
We got some beers!

55
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,700
Not yet, okay?

56
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,250
Still, your hat looks super cool, Uncle.

57
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,500
Really? You got a good eye, Makio.

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,920
Isn't that a cowboy hat?

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,960
Really? That's right.

60
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,840
It's the first time I've seen someone
wear this here in Japan.

61
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,600
I received that from a good friend
when I went to America.

62
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,390
Really? That's cool!

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,020
Well, that was back when I
was still in college.

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,940
We used to have barbecues back then.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,340
Is that so?

66
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,360
Eiji's also good at it.

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,770
What? With barbecue?

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,130
At the lake.

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,250
We went out there with
him and Mieko.

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,390
We had a lot of fun.

71
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,970
Really?

72
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,870
I don't think so.
- The string.

73
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,860
This one?

74
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,950
Let's see. This one?

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,100
That's it. Right.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,630
And then...

77
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,550
Alright, it's done!

78
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,310
Nah, is it even grilled well?

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,050
Will it be alright?

80
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,630
So adorable.

81
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,600
Looking kinda smug.

82
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,910
So cute.

83
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,180
I should help out too.

84
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,770
What? Really?
You'll do it for me?

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,770
This is looking good.
- They are so close.

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,970
Hey, what do you think
will Eichan do?

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,220
Coming out to them, maybe?

88
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,290
I told him to do it
when he's ready,

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,490
although I think our parents
are definitely alright with it.

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,710
Right.

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
I really got the wrong idea.

92
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,030
I thought you liked Eiji.

93
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,610
Isn't that why the balance between
the three of them is good?

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,030
But, won't you feel lonely?

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,080
I mean, maybe I won't?

96
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,700
We really had so much fun, huh?

97
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,450
The meat was delicious too, right?

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,560
Right.

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,720
Right?

100
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,540
His old man was wearing an
interesting hat.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
Like a cowboy.
- Honestly.

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
That was a cowboy hat?
- Yeah.

103
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,280
Really?

104
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,010
What an odd man.
- But still,

105
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,220
don't you think that Eichan and his
dad have similar vibes?

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,470
You're right.

107
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,890
I wanted to see Eiji
wear that hat too.

108
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,270
Cowboy hat?

109
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,020
I'm sure he'll look good in it.

110
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,960
Well, I wonder?

111
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,880
Seems like you get along
so well with Mieko and Makki.

112
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,890
I mean, the three of us
are usually together.

113
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,410
Don't you have a hunch about how I
think you have a good thing going on?

114
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,830
What are you talking about,
Papa? That's annoying.

115
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,960
Hurry and go to sleep now?
- I'm all good.

116
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,110
So?

117
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,630
By the way, don't you tell me
you have a boyfriend, Anna.

118
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,300
I don't want to hear about it.
- You're being creepy.

119
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,220
Really.

120
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,600
So, how are things going?

121
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,680
I mean, you know.

122
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,560
See! I knew something was
going on! You gotta tell us!

123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,310
Papa! Eiji is dating someone, okay?

124
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,970
What? You are?!
I'm all ears for this.

125
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,470
Well...

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,380
Just wait.

127
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,670
We just got together.

128
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,030
I see!

129
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,610
I see it now.

130
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Then, why don't you invite
them here next time?

131
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,380
I'll welcome them with open arms!

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,460
Right, Mama?

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,570
I see! Yeah, alright!

134
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,050
Not yet for now.

135
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,180
They'll always be welcome
here anytime!

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,050
I wouldn't want to introduce
them to you, though.

137
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,930
What?

138
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,610
It's embarrassing!
I wouldn't want to, for sure.

139
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,390
I mean, you're all good.

140
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,910
No need to tell me.
- Why?

141
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,190
Thanks for waiting.

142
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,650
2X spicy ramen and 4X spicy ramen.

143
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,550
Thank you.
- Mix well and enjoy.

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,690
Sure!

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,820
We need to mix it quick.

146
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,830
Yes, right.

147
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,220
Thank you for the food.

148
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,830
Thank you so much!

149
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,560
How many times again? 20?

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,710
We're digging in.

151
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,000
So hot.

152
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,850
So good.

153
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,050
It is!

154
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,900
Hey, Sakaki.

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,420
Do you still like Makki?

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,740
I think I'm all good now.

157
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
What?

158
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,550
I mean,

159
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,890
seems like Senoo doesn't feel
anything for me at all.

160
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,860
If we're thinking about what
would make me the happiest,

161
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
as a girl,

162
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,500
I think it's the right thing to be
with someone who feels the same way, right?

163
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,710
Is that so?

164
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,890
Thank you for waiting.

165
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,410
Here's your rice.

166
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,150
Did you know?

167
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,150
Ichiji from Class C confessed
to me this other day.

168
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,770
It seems like he's liked
me for a long time now.

169
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,970
So, what're you gonna do?

170
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,140
I'll date him and see where it goes.

171
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,630
Really?

172
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,440
Crap!

173
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,880
Yay!

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,370
Let's take a break.

175
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,170
Yay!

176
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,460
Wait up!

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,170
You're weak at this.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,210
That was good!

179
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,970
We're in bad shape.
- Crap.

180
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,140
Want it?

181
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,640
Thanks.

182
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,360
It's so hot! Geez.

183
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,180
You suck.
- At what?

184
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,700
You suck at basketball.

185
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,180
Weak? I don't really
feel good today.

186
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,500
Not feeling well?
You're kidding.

187
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,200
Not in good shape.

188
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,250
So damn hot!

189
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,990
Hot! Freaking hot!

190
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,970
Ouch!
- Sorry.

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,980
Can I take a bath first?

192
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,430
Go ahead.

193
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,670
Thanks.

194
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,850
A shirt?

195
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,200
Makki?

196
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,780
Makki?

197
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah?

198
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,310
It might be too big on you,

199
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,270
but I'll leave a shirt
for you over here.

200
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,830
Thanks!

201
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,680
Feels so much better now.

202
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,290
What? You didn't spot a hair
blower over there?

203
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,280
You have one?
- I do.

204
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,170
What?
- Come on.

205
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,470
I'll dry your hair so sit here.

206
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,080
Thanks.

207
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
Not too hot?

208
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,670
Hey?

209
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,140
I'm fine now.

210
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,130
Makki, can you toast the
bread for me for a sec?

211
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,500
Yeah, sure.

212
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,470
Here we are.

213
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,270
Thank you.

214
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,820
Here.
- Thanks.

215
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,370
Want some?
- Nope.

216
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,210
Don't need it. I've never had jam before.
- It's good, though?

217
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,130
I put too much.

218
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,850
I already ate first.

219
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,090
No problem.

220
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,620
Slimy.

221
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,700
Still adding more?

222
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,140
Digging in.

223
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,770
So good.
- It is.

224
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,450
Want more?

225
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,240
Want more.

226
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,770
This is bad, Eiji! Crap!

227
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,250
Coffee is served.

228
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,930
This isn't a match at all.

229
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,180
Who won?

230
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,270
Good luck, Eichan!

231
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,030
What about that?
- No, don't.

232
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,870
My win?

233
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,180
You still have that one.

234
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,660
Can I take this off now?

235
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,250
So heavy!

236
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,460
That was loud.

237
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,740
Wait up!

238
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,440
Hold it properly.

239
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Heavy.

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,530
So damn heavy!

241
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,170
Stop it.

242
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:10,290
DECEMBER    2014

243
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,390
So heavy.

244
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm glad we came here with a car.

245
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,190
Honestly, they use a Rankle
around here.

246
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,310
A Rankle, huh?

247
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,670
I'm barging in.

248
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,960
Hey, Mieko! You came at
the right time.

249
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,220
Sit there, Miechan.

250
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm so hungry.

251
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,900
Right?

252
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,350
It'll be done in a few.

253
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,710
Alright.

254
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,940
Here it is.

255
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,830
Looks so good!

256
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,530
It's been a while since I
last had sukiyaki.

257
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,670
How about eggs?

258
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,420
It's in the fridge.
Can you get it?

259
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,090
Would you want some rice, Miechan?

260
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,200
I do.

261
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,060
A huge helping.
- Sure.

262
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,310
Mieko, I'll leave it here.

263
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,790
Thanks.

264
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,110
I'll put this here.

265
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,530
Crap.

266
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,770
You ruined yours?

267
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,190
Came out good.

268
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,140
Here.

269
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,790
Thank you.

270
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,390
Is this mine?

271
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Alright.

272
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,840
Can we dig in now?
- Go ahead.

273
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,880
Thank you for this food!

274
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,970
It's fine.
- Sorry, my bad.

275
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,000
See?

276
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,950
Meat, meat.

277
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,430
Let's go for the meat.

278
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,180
Woah, it's huge!
- So big.

279
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,850
Is it good? Is it?
- It's delicious!

280
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,770
So good.
- So damn good!

281
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,970
Give me a sec.

282
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,720
I'm taking a photo.

283
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,690
Alright, strike a pose.

284
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,540
Do a better pose.

285
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,070
What?
- Go on.

286
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,900
Pose!

287
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,420
All good.
- What was that for?

288
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,720
I'll send it to Anna.

289
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,570
You guys are hitting it off.

290
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,850
She's been teaching me about
cosmetology lately.

291
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,210
Really?

292
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,210
You got yourself some fringes now.

293
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,420
Which one was better?

294
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,530
Your previous hairstyle, maybe?

295
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,550
It suit you better.

296
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,260
You still look cute right now.

297
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,000
Right?

298
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,890
He's right.

299
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,730
I wonder what this is about?

300
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,300
I suddenly feel like crying.

301
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,620
We still have a lot of vegetables.

302
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,890
They both have their own world
for just the two of them.

303
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,000
A place I can't get into.

304
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,200
If this is what you call "lonely"...

305
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,600
I am not.

306
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,790
But, that's not all there is to it.

307
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't know why I feel like

308
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,470
I found what I wanted?

309
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,770
Any plans for Christmas?

310
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,170
Spend it with the three of us, maybe?

311
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,000
With Makki and Eichan?

312
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,610
You three are really close
to each other, huh?

313
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,890
For Christmas, I'm going over
to my boyfriend's place.

314
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,690
Seems like nobody will
be at home?

315
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,120
What?

316
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,120
That means, I'll be staying the night?

317
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,890
So, I'll stay the night?!
- Sakaki, Sakaki!

318
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,940
Well, anyway.

319
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,380
You're so uninterested.

320
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,340
Sorry, that's not what I meant.

321
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,930
So cute!

322
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,660
I don't really understand the feeling of wanting
to do something like that with someone.

323
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,550
Even with someone you like?

324
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,650
I wonder what's going on?

325
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,260
I don't really get it.

326
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
Really?

327
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,370
Thanks.
- Sure.

328
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,020
What time is Eichan coming over?

329
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,170
Around 6 o'clock, he said.

330
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,810
Let's surprise him by getting
everything decorated before he comes?

331
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,710
Right?

332
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,280
The cake!

333
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,510
Cake.
- Thank you.

334
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,680
It's all tangled up.

335
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,600
Where should I...?

336
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,960
Is this spot okay?

337
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,190
I guess so.

338
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,210
Looks good.

339
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,920
Come on, decorate it a little
more tidy, okay?

340
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,490
Looking good.

341
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,870
The heck?
- Makes you wanna do it.

342
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,160
Hey, look.

343
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,060
So cute!

344
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,750
It's adorable.

345
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,610
What's that about?

346
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,630
Not sure.

347
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,200
Kinda wanted to do it.

348
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,530
We gotta hang this up, right?

349
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,840
What?
- This one.

350
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,610
These decoration thingy.
- Yeah, gotta put them up.

351
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,850
This is just a tree.

352
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,020
Eiji, do you want to eat dinner?

353
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,710
Well, I'm going to gather at my place
with some friends so I'm fine.

354
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,880
With who?

355
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,240
It's Mieko and Makki, for sure.

356
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,740
Hey.

357
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,320
What did you buy?

358
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,800
Lemme see!

359
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,550
Hey, don't ruin the wrappings.

360
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,560
What is this? It's so cute!

361
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,710
It has initials on it too!

362
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,890
Is that "M" for "Mieko"?

363
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,480
No, that's not it.

364
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,730
The three of them are so close that
they get together most times, right?

365
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,150
Right, right. That's nice.

366
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,300
Right, Mama?

367
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,610
Why don't you bring them over next time?

368
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,470
Right.

369
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,430
How about on New Years Day?
Let's all go to a shrine together!

370
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,140
Papa, you're really...
- Right?

371
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,580
Only 2 young people are supposed
to go together for that kind of thing.

372
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
Right, Eiji?

373
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,280
You're wrong.

374
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,870
What?

375
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,490
Well.

376
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,000
That's not it.

377
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,190
The one I'm dating...

378
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,300
It's not Mieko.

379
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
It's Makki.

380
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,160
Pew! Pew!

381
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,670
What are you doing?

382
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,730
It's done!
- There it is.

383
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,870
All good!

384
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,860
Should we switch on the lights?
- Go ahead.

385
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,160
Looks nice.

386
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Looks good. It'll look prettier
during the evening.

387
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,650
The Christmas feeling, huh?

388
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,590
True. Red, blue, green.

389
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,540
Green
- That's nice.

390
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,220
Should I put this on?

391
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,210
Does it go here?

392
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,070
I guess.

393
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,480
It won't hold on.

394
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,190
It's fine! It's hanging now.

395
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,270
It really is.

396
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,440
This.

397
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,390
This is fine. Let's use it.

398
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,280
What for?

399
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,990
Let's write to Santa Claus
about what we want.

400
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,140
Santa Claus?

401
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,940
That's right.
- Write down what we want?

402
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,200
On here.
- What?

403
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,310
Grab me a pen.

404
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,380
Where is it?

405
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,170
Hurry up. Santa Claus is
getting away.

406
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,170
Here.

407
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,900
Here we go.

408
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,280
So? What are you going to write?

409
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,590
I haven't made up my mind.

410
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,010
Don't look! Don't look!
- What is it?

411
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,740
The heck?
- I'm serious.

412
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,120
What?
- So quick to peek!

413
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,140
What should I ask for?
It's Santa Claus, right?

414
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,270
To Santa Claus.

415
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,320
Things?
- Yeah, things.

416
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,300
What?

417
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,320
What is that?!
- Don't look!

418
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,140
What is that supposed to be?
- I'm not finished yet.

419
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,160
Crap, how do I write it down?

420
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,150
Well...

421
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,900
Crap, crap.

422
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,110
I don't know yet.

423
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,430
No, this is fine.
- What is this?

424
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,320
What the heck is this?

425
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,550
What is this?
What's this about?

426
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,350
This is bad.
- Should I write, "This is what I want"?

427
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,040
"This is what I want."
- Be polite or Santa won't come.

428
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,590
Alright, I have one.

429
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,700
Wait, I'm not yet done.
- I'm all set now.

430
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,550
You're not yet finished?

431
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,010
What are you doing?

432
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,610
This is bad.

433
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,320
I can't even hide the shock I feel
with the way I'm writing this.

434
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,200
What's that?
- A Rankle.

435
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,660
A Rankle?
- A Rankle.

436
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,060
You can't ask for a Rankle
over something like this.

437
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,870
It's shocking! So shocking!

438
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,630
What? "Beams coming out from my eyes."

439
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,960
Not an eye. A light.

440
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,620
Oh, you mean, "lights"?

441
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,320
Also, what else?

442
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,240
There's more?
- Still more.

443
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,700
This is bad, and shocking.

444
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,180
It's surrounded.

445
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,290
I could write a better one.

446
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
What?

447
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,710
A license.

448
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Get that yourself!

449
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,320
It's Santa Claus!
- It's too much for him.

450
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,840
You ask for it, you get it.

451
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,430
I'm getting parched.

452
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,120
I'll put down that you
want my autograph.

453
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,820
Your autograph?
- You want it, right?

454
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,560
I have no use for that.
- Want my autograph?

455
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,650
Want something to drink?

456
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,110
Want something to drink?

457
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,240
I wrote it. My autograph.

458
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,610
I don't need that.

459
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,860
Something?

460
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,240
Something that's
good to drink?

461
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Here.

462
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,540
Thank you.

463
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,880
Why'd you pour it in a mug?

464
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,980
What? You always drink using that.

465
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,940
A glass for hot drinks.

466
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,070
I don't see some here.
- You're an odd one. Honestly.

467
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,510
You don't have that here.

468
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,990
Want some kakipi?

469
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,100
Kakipi.

470
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,290
How humble.

471
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:07,460
