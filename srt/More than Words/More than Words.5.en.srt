1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,260
The one I'm dating...

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,180
It's not Mieko.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,890
It's Makki.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,590
By Makki,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,970
you mean that young boy who
came over that one summer?

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,780
I see! So that's it?

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,000
Right?

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,040
I knew you guys would understand.

9
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,190
It's just for now, right?

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,510
What?

11
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,060
What?

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,330
What do you mean?
- Shut up, Anna.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,950
But, this is ridiculous. Why would...

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,750
Just for now.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,740
If it's only going to last for
a while, I won't say anything else.

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,150
In return, no one else must
ever know about this.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:54,150

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,260
Eichan's taking long.

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm back.

20
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,900
Merry Christmas!

21
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,770
Anna?
- What?

22
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,220
Woah!

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
Sorry for suddenly dropping by.

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,070
No, don't be.

25
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,180
Surprise!

26
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,460
I mean, you're very
much welcome here.

27
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,870
You guys took long.
Was the street packed?

28
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,540
No, we had a rough time.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,510
Papa, about Makki...
- No need to tell them.

30
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,760
No, you have to.

31
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,780
Did your dad say something?

32
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,280
Is it about you and me?

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,940
I'm already

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,280
an adult, after all.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,450
I don't need them nitpicking each
and everything I do.

36
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,820
Ugh, seriously.

37
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,360
I am so disappointed
about my own parents.

38
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,700
He didn't have to be so
over the top about it, did he?

39
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,940
Mom's fine with anything but
dad has always been approving.

40
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,350
Enough now.

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,660
But, are you okay?

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
You came back here though.

43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,600
I came back here because
it's all good.

44
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,110
What is this? You waited for
me before you ate?

45
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,860
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,120
Let's all eat this together, okay?

47
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,830
Let's dig in!

48
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,370
Right.
- Take a seat too, Anna.

49
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,350
So you guys decorated the
place on your own?

50
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,810
That's right.

51
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,210
I'm kind of hungry now.

52
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,610
Make some ramen, Eiji.

53
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,490
Want something to drink, Anna?
- Add more for me, 'kay?

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
What do you want?
- Sure.

55
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,530
We haven't eaten the chicken yet.

56
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,150
Which do you prefer?
- This one.

57
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
This?

58
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,450
Thanks.
- Pizza.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Here.

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,340
What?

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,780
My gifts.

62
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,040
Nah, the other way around.
- We each have one?

63
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,330
Thank you.
- Is this real?

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,750
Yeah.
- What's in it?

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,710
Can I open it? Can I see?

66
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,610
What? What is this?

67
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,890
Knitted sweater!

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,080
It has "M" on it.

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,390
"M"!

70
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,560
This here.
- Wait, it's "M" for "Makki", right?

71
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,600
Yes.
- So cute!

72
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,710
Good for you. I wonder
what I got?

73
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,520
You're wearing it now?
- Can I?

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,010
For real?
- What?

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,270
A scarf?
- A scarf.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,900
Really? It's so cute! Thank you!

77
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,070
Looks nice.
- It really suits you.

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Right?

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,290
I'm so happy.

80
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,420
You're eating the chicken too?

81
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,770
Chicken meat for ramen?

82
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,040
Here.

83
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,350
Thanks.
- It's good once cold.

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,560
This is hard to get.

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,280
FEBRUARY 2017

86
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,120
Spread it out a little more.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Looks a bit blurred.

88
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,510
Got it.

89
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,420
That's it.
- Got it.

90
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,530
Mieko-chan!

91
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,400
You startled me!

92
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,430
Let's go home.

93
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,000
Sure, let's go?

94
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,330
See you!

95
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,660
Bye!
- See you.

96
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,840
Seems like Makki's got time.

97
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,950
Let's go?
- Yeah, let's!

98
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,890
Hey, I was told that if
I take one more day off,

99
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,770
I wouldn't be able to graduate.

100
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,130
Of course! You're over-extending your breaks.

101
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,360
Eiji's technical school is
slightly far away.

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,480
If so, then you shouldn't
drop by there on weekdays.

103
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,350
Hey.

104
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,650
When spring break comes, let's go shopping
together for entrance ceremony clothes?

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,030
Sure, I'm looking forward.

106
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,380
Mieko going to cosmetology school?

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,230
I never would've imagined
that to happen.

108
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,780
Must be the influence of Anna.

109
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,240
You kinda changed.

110
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,030
You've gotten more girlish.

111
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,680
But in all honesty,
nothing changed, right?

112
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,220
What are you saying?
Making fun of me?

113
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,180
I mean, to be honest,
I hate changes.

114
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,810
I'm still going to work part
time for my employment.

115
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,440
That's fine.
- Nah, I think it's a good thing.

116
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,800
To change.

117
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,460
Right?

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,030
Were you listening to me at all?
- Yeah, I was.

119
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,050
Seriously?

120
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,680
I like it.

121
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,560
Hey, do you think they have a
cafeteria at the department?

122
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,620
I don't think so?

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,520
What?

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,610
What's wrong?

125
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
Rain?

126
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,780
The laundry?

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,700
Sure, I'll take care of it.

128
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,660
See you. Yeah.

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,090
Sorry, I'm going to drop
by Eiji's place for a bit.

130
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,460
Go ahead.

131
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,770
See you.
- Bye.

132
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,680
I think the worker
arrangements are a little lax.

133
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,200
I have no problem with the estimate.

134
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,180
Makio!

135
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,720
I'll call you back.
- Uncle.

136
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,270
It's been a while.

137
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,800
I think Eiji will be home anytime now.

138
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,560
I wanted to head back home,
but I gotta bring in the laundry.

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,260
Makio...

140
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,730
Has he always been...

141
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,040
I mean, he's doing pretty well.

142
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,110
How about you?

143
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,730
I don't know if I can still act
the way I did before.

144
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,340
Anna hasn't been coming
home lately.

145
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,280
If she does, we don't really...

146
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,250
How often does Eiji let you do this?

147
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,880
It's a give-and-take situation.

148
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,760
I see.

149
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,810
I found out that we fold the
shirts differently.

150
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,110
This is how you fold it
at your place, right?

151
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,940
So...

152
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,790
Mine is...

153
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,130
This is how I do it.

154
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,250
I see.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,630
Help me out too, Uncle.

156
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,680
Thank you.

157
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,870
I heard you're against our
relationship, right?

158
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,260
I enjoy talking to you just like this.

159
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,430
Yes, I am against it but,

160
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,640
it doesn't mean that I hate the
relationship I have with you.

161
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,110
I did tell you about that cowboy hat
that a good friend gave me, right?

162
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,090
He was gay too.

163
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,610
At that time, a lot of people were
against gays in America.

164
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,570
Especially in the town where I lived.

165
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,170
That friend only confided to
me and 2-3 other people.

166
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,250
And yet,

167
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,840
some extremists found out
about it and lynched him.

168
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,180
As of now,

169
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,090
his right hand is paralyzed and immobile.

170
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,650
This is a story from way back though.

171
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,110
But, when I think of my own
son going through that too...

172
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,490
It frightens me.

173
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,620
That's why...

174
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,040
As a parent, I can't agree with that.

175
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,050
Why don't you tell Eiji that?

176
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,230
I think he'd want to know
what you're thinking about.

177
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,240
Well, laundry is all done. See you.

178
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,930
Makki!

179
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,620
Hey.

180
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,700
You're unusually on time.

181
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,850
Right.

182
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,680
What happened?

183
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,160
Nothing.

184
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,900
You seem quiet.

185
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,980
Well, I met Eichan's dad a while ago.

186
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,780
What? Where?

187
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,240
At Eiji's place.

188
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,780
And what did you talk about?

189
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,040
It's this place.

190
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,800
It's been a while!

191
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,820
Makki! Been a while!

192
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,360
Hey!

193
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,740
Still cute as always.

194
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,910
Anna!
- Hey, Mieko!

195
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,450
Long time, no see!
- Been a while!

196
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,290
You two arrived early.

197
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,580
It's already this big, huh?

198
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,120
I've just started my eighth month.

199
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,630
Amazing! Can I touch it?

200
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,690
Of course.

201
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,930
It's a girl.

202
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,330
Is that so?

203
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,520
Isn't it so delicious?

204
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,600
So good, huh?

205
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,560
Hey, I want to eat that too.
- No, you can't.

206
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,400
This sashimi is no good.
- Eat, eat.

207
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,930
You can eat this, right?

208
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,950
Looks good!

209
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,200
Hand it.
- Gimme some.

210
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,850
Yay!
- Take it, Makki.

211
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,990
What? Leave it behind?

212
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,870
Chisa, how long are you staying?

213
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,790
I plan to stay at my parent's
house until I give birth.

214
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,650
I see.

215
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,830
Your body? All good?

216
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,790
Well, from now on, my stomach
is still going to be bloated.

217
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,030
That's right.

218
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,670
But, she's been moving
quite a lot lately.

219
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,370
She's so adorable!

220
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,930
I see. It feels that way, huh?

221
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,550
Anna, are you coming
over to our place?

222
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,040
Nope, in a hotel.

223
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Even Uncle too.

224
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,210
I think he's trying to understand
it little by little?

225
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,930
Well...

226
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,160
I see.

227
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,910
Eiji!
- You're all here.

228
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,830
Eichan!
- Come over!

229
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,700
Wait, you changed your hairstyle?

230
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,940
I did.

231
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,620
What do you think of his hair?

232
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,920
Well, I think the previous
one was better.

233
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,460
She told you.
- As she said, Eiji.

234
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,140
You hurt me.

235
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,010
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,340
The owner of the place where
I work now took me out for a drink.

237
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,350
I heard it's a dye shop.

238
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,920
So, is that the path you're
taking for the future?

239
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,590
Well, I know it's a bit sudden
to say it right here but...

240
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,720
Well, I've been thinking of
joining dad's company this year.

241
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,890
What?

242
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,560
Is that so?

243
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,600
Dad has been telling me
about it since for so long.

244
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,790
I mean, he's been letting me do
everything as I please until now.

245
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,320
About time, right?

246
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,280
I see.

247
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,880
Seems like everyone has
slowly changed, huh?

248
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,230
And you're okay with that?

249
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,380
What?

250
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,130
I mean, I thought you were in the
pursuit of something you want to do.

251
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,020
Well, you know?

252
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm blessed with the people around me.

253
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,930
So, if I ask for more than this,

254
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm afraid I'm going
to lose my balance.

255
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,820
I see.

256
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,640
I mean, it's something I've
thought about and decided.

257
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,620
Restroom break.

258
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,060
Sorry.

259
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,390
Eiji, you haven't ordered
anything yet, right?

260
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,060
Yeah.
- What do you want?

261
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,310
Well, maybe beer for now?

262
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,170
Beer?

263
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,730
Where do I order?
- Over there.

264
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,180
This one?

265
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,770
It's like...

266
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,400
Your toilet break is
taking so long.

267
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,710
It would be cool if I could
smoke at times like this.

268
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,250
We got cut midway in
the conversation earlier.

269
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,830
About his dad?

270
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,330
I's not like he said something
cruel to me or what.

271
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,580
Just that, he was thinking like
how any other dad would.

272
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,540
Some of the things I
heard made sense to me.

273
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,330
And what kind of things?

274
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,600
I can't say.

275
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,500
I can't share the things that only
he told me about, right?

276
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,270
Well, I've been thinking that
maybe time will tell.

277
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,890
That's not what it was about
in the first place, after all.

278
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,560
Alright, heading home now.

279
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,270
Take care.
- Eiji!

280
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,360
Bye, Anna!

281
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,480
Bye-bye!

282
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,260
Hey, hey. Wait.
- What is it?

283
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,680
Mieko!

284
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,780
Hug tight.
- What's this?

285
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,730
See you around.

286
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,100
I'll come again next time.

287
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,420
See you!

288
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,590
See you.

289
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,000
Bye!

290
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,500
Bye!
- Take care.

291
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,300
Bye-bye, Makki!

292
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,670
See you!

293
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,170
Bye!

294
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,790
See you!
- Bye-bye!

295
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,720
Have a nice dream!
- Take care!

296
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,790
Sweet dreams, you guys!

297
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,180
Bye-bye!
- Take care, you guys.

298
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,940
See you!
- Good luck, young ones! Yay!

299
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,050
The heck?

300
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,580
Ugh, I feel awful.

301
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,650
Acting like an old man.

302
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,590
That's crazy.
- No, no, no.

303
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,280
It's rare for me to see
Anna be that way.

304
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,380
Really? Is that so?

305
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,540
She doesn't get drunk in public.

306
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,660
You mean, she let her
guard down in front of us?

307
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,540
Honestly, that's what I think.

308
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,750
You're kinda drunk too.

309
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,690
No, no.
- I'm going to the convenience store.

310
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,570
Welcome.

311
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,920
145 yen.

312
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,110
I received 500 yen.

313
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,850
Your change is 355 yen and
here's your receipt.

314
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,070
Makki's taking long.

315
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,570
Maybe he went straight home?

316
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,130
Nah, I don't think so?

317
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,890
I'll try and call him.

318
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,240
Listen, Eichan.

319
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,900
I heard your dad came
to see Makki today.

320
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,000
What?

321
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,880
Really? What? Where?

322
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,460
Right here.

323
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,010
What did they talk about?

324
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,830
Well, he didn't clearly
tell me what they talked about.

325
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,350
Maybe my dad said something to him?

326
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm back.

327
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,910
What? Makki?

328
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,720
Hey, I called you but you
weren't picking up.

329
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,470
My bad.

330
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,850
I was reading at the convenience
store and got kinda hooked.

331
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,330
What? What the heck are you doing?

332
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,040
We were worried about you!

333
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,630
What's up with you?

334
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,230
What are you guys looking at?

335
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,570
Chisa's photobook.

336
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,480
I haven't seen this yet.

337
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,480
Looks good.

338
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,650
Chisa.

339
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,700
This is nice, right?

340
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,710
Right.

341
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,420
Eiji.

342
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,150
Have you ever liked a girl before?

343
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,300
No...

344
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,630
I, uhh...

345
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,720
The first person I really fell in love with

346
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,750
is you, Makki.

347
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,250
Wait, so the manager doesn't count?

348
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,540
No, I only thought that the
manager seemed cool!

349
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,280
Like, looking up to him, you know?

350
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,370
Are you feeling flustered?

351
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,770
Is that bad?

352
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,970
What? So even you get flustered too?!

353
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,660
Shut up!

354
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,010
He's acting shy!

355
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,810
I'm sure you feel cold.

356
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,020
It's hot.
- Thank you.

357
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,150
It's good.

358
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,830
I hope that I'll always

359
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,440
be together with these two.

360
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,190
So good.

361
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,120
I see. I'm glad.

362
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,440
What you laughing about?

363
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,990
What?

364
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,130
You've got red ears.
- It's good.

365
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,700
What?
- Your ears are red.

366
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,260
What?
- You're right. It's red.

367
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,390
Right?

368
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,930
So hot!

369
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,180
Come on, what are you doing?

370
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,300
That was close.
- Did it get on Chisa?

371
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,280
What?
- Did it get poured on Chisa?

372
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,530
It didn't.

373
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,680
Really?

374
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Don't take my photos.

375
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,360
To commemorate it!
- Don't take photos of me.

376
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,480
You'll send it later.

377
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm taking a photo.
- What are you doing?

378
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,200
Move closer.
- Not again?

379
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,180
Alright.

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,660
I'll send it to Chisa.

381
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,990
You guys are so close.
- To Chisa?

382
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,960
Send to Chisa.

383
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,310
Alright.

384
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,020
What now?
- Pose!

385
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,300
How much more are you
going to take?

386
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,040
What?

387
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,590
Nah.
- Your face is puff red.

388
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,010
Wanna play a game?

389
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
A game?

390
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,180
I'm fine.

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,390
The heck?

392
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,180
I'm fine though.

393
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,850
Let's play! Come on.
- Be careful!

394
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,130
Let's play!

395
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,510
What game?

396
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,430
I don't get it at all.

397
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,200
The heck?

398
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,000
What a weird music.

399
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,920
Here it is.

400
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,180
What to do?

401
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,190
I leave it to you.
- A balloon?

402
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,030
Balloon?

403
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,280
It's not though.

404
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,610
Choose now.
- What should I pick?

405
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,910
What do I do with this?

406
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,450
Round and round... A.
- A, right?

407
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,970
Wait, which one again?

408
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,240
This one?
- Where?

409
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,910
Mine's pink.
- It should be blue.

410
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,730
This is mine.
- Blue, go for blue.

411
00:28:18,420 --> 00:30:08,520
