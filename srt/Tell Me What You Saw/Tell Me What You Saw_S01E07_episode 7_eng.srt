1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,320

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,670

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,230

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,050

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,470

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,260

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,010

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,510

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,990

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,500

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,730
 The bastard, who died five years ago, has come back to life and is committing murder.

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,210
 Look into Team Leader Hwang.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,700
 It’s too strange for it to be a coincidence.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,510
 And monitor that person and report back, too.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,400
 Someone is behind Team Leader Hwang. Find out.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,560
 You have to be careful because that bastard saw you.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,810
 But you know that female officer?

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,750
 You said it was a little odd.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,250
 Detective Lee, it's me.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,900
 Among the reporters who have access to the police station, there is a Reporter Lee Bo Gwang.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,600
 Could I get an identity check on him?

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,030
 If he didn't take anything,

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,720
 then he must've gotten some information.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,420

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,740
 Team Leader, it's me.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,920
 The next target is Detective Oh.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,030
 I finally meet you, Oh Hyeon Jae.

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,090
 There will be more and more things I'll want to ask you.

29
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,280
 But it doesn't matter.

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,320
 I'm going to kill you here anyway.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,400
 Look here, I was bored waiting around.

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,070
 Did you plan all this on purpose to catch that bastard?

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,420
 I need to know who told him to kill Isu.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,390
 The person who told me to kill Isu is...

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,050

How much do you know about me?

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,410
 Only as much as I need.

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,000
 So you used me... to lure that bastard out.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,810
 You also needed me to join the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,530
 Thank you for your help all this time.

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,140
 If anything happens, call this number.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,690
 I am a police officer.

42
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,980
 Why are you there?

43
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,690
 Are you okay?

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,250
 Where did you put your eyes?!

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,540
 Why are you here?

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,210
 I want to make an offer.

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,640
 I am not interested.

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,470
 A boy from the upper neighborhood didn't come home last night.

49
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,530
 It's an emergency. Everything's an emergency.

50
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,370
 Hyeon Soo...

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,860

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,220

53
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,690
It looks like the kid's shoe. There is blood as well.

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,000
So this asshole ultimately...

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,670
- Hey, how about the search and rescue team? 
 - They are on standby.

56
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,210
Tell them to come here quickly.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,900
Excuse me. By any chance, did you find a note here?

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,440
A note? No, I haven't seen one.

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,870
- May I take a look? 
 - Pardon?

60
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,530
What is this?

61
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,970
Hey, stop. Hey, stop!

62
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,910
- Hello. 
 - What's going on? What are you doing here?

63
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,100
Section Chief, the missing child is someone I know.

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,900
Hey, don't be annoying and just stay over there!

65
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,270
- Is this Hyeon Soo? 
  - Hello, customer. Your phone has been —

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,950
Search every inch of this place!

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,570
You can't just poke around half-way like that!

68
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,140
Hey, what are you doing here?

69
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,930
Sunbae, I know the kid who went missing.

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,000
- I met him a few days ago and 
 - What?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,170
I wrote my phone number on a piece of paper and gave it to him.

72
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,640
The sun is setting. Work faster!

73
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,450
Go up the hill! Go up, damn it!

74
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,050
Let's talk later.

75
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,270
No matter how I think about it, I don't think we'll find him alive.

76
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,910
We have to change the direction of the search.

77
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,080
Into searching for a body?

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,670
Obviously. How could a kid survive in this cold in the mountains?

79
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,130
The suspect already abandoned his car and ran away.

80
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,880
Section Chief, could you please wait?

81
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,350
He might still be alive.

82
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,900
Hey, there was blood on that kid's sneaker that we found in the car.

83
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,580
That's why we should continue searching for him.

84
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,880
He might be wandering around, hurt somewhere.

85
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,050
To be blunt, we need to at least find his corpse as soon as possible.

86
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,480
Do you have proof that he's alive?

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,910
I gave him a piece of paper with my number on it a few nights ago.

88
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,850
That's the only thing missing from his bag. That means there's still hope.

89
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,810
I've already got enough to deal with, and I'm talking to a crazy person.

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,860
Hey, the bastard even cut off his electronic anklet and ran off!

91
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,980
That means he went all the way!

92
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,430
- He might call me! 
 - Hey!

93
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,900
Someone, someone remove her from the scene, damn it.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,320
Let's go. I'll escort her out.

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,150
 News flash. The suspect's vehicle was just found in a vacant lot halfway up Daeheung Mountain.

96
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,650
 The police determined it was a critical situation

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,550
 and quickly decided to make it an open criminal investigation.

98
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,620
 The prime suspect of the kidnapping, Mr. No, has a history of child sex offense.

99
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,340
 He cut off his electronic anklet and is on the run right now.

100
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,240
Hurry up the hill already!

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,980
- Let go of me.
- What are you still doing down here?!

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,220
You know what Section Chief Bang is like.

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,480
That rude bastard.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,840
You'll only be cursed out if you stay here,

105
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,260
so just go home for now.

106
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,200
Okay. Bye.

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
Bye!

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Hurry up the damn hill!

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,970

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,530
It's me.

111
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm listening.

112
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,850
Detective Oh, I'll accept your offer.

113
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,260
 But I have a request.

114
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,110
His name is Gil Hyeon Soo. He's 12 years old.

115
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,190
It has been about 27 hours since he was abducted.

116
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,780
Please help me find him.

117
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,070
Detective Oh?

118
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,540
 Do you know him?

119
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,320
Yes.

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,930
There's almost no chance of survival if it's been more than eight hours.

121
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,630
 If he's lucky and has been locked up somewhere, 36 hours is max.

122
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,920
And if he's outside in this weather, even 30 hours is difficult.

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm bracing for it.

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,990
 You said he was kidnapped at school?

125
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,410
Meet me there.

126
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,480

127
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,450

128
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,230
What do you mean you are taking on a kidnapping case?

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,150
The whole nation is focused on this case.

130
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,690
With kidnapping cases, there's nothing to be gained even if you do well.

131
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,280
You said it's been two days already.

132
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,990
Even if the body is found, you'll be criticized,

133
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,800
and if you don't, you'll be hung out to dry.

134
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,230
I assigned it to Team Leader Hwang.

135
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,500
You want to cover up the Lee Bo Gwang case with this kidnapping case,

136
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,360
and make up an excuse to get rid of her?

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,150
What about Oh Hyeon Jae?

138
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,340
Well, it'll be better if he's involved.

139
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,470
Oh Hyeon Jae? It's me.

140
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,730
I've been ordered to quickly resolve the Hongwoon-myeon missing child case.

141
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm officially asking for your cooperation in the investigation as a civilian adviser.

142
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,190
What did she just say?

143
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,520
Um, that... Profiler Oh Hyeon Jae.

144
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,260
- Oh Hyeon Jae? 
 - Yes.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,240
Let's go to the crime scene.

146
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,740
Detective Lee, you're back up.

147
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,300
- Yes. 
 - Yes, okay.

148
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,220

149
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,530
Which direction is the child's house?

150
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,630
Looking at the address,

151
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,030
Hyeon Soo's house is in that direction.

152
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,430
If No Sang Cheol is acquainted with the victim,

153
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,390
the child would have thought that the road he usually takes was dangerous.

154
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,250
He would've gone that way, in the opposite direction.

155
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Ah, yes, Detective Lee.

156
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,750
Send me the file when you get it.

157
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,320
Okay.

158
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,900
It's obvious they're trying to screw over the Team Leader and our team.

159
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,150
Hey, a detective can't be choosy when it comes to investigations.

160
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,570
Call the Hongwoon Police Station and ask them to transfer it over to us.

161
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,640
Okay, I will.

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,540
By the way, isn't Hongwoon-myeon Cha Soo Yeong's neighborhood?

163
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh, should we tell her to join?

164
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Hey, would you like it if you were told to work during your vacation?

165
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,830
Are you nuts?

166
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,990
She's already working.

167
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,960
If he went that way, the villagers would have seen them.

168
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,770
It's this way.

169
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,550
Look around the vicinity.

170
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,940
Detective Oh.

171
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,960
This top belongs to Hyeon Soo.

172
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,380
He must have been here.

173
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,800
He was acquainted with the victim as expected.

174
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,610
He predicted where the child would go.

175
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,690
No Sang Cheol pulled out the child who was hiding here.

176
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,620
First, let's go to No Sang Cheol's house.

177
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,160
His house?

178
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,020
Hurry. A kidnapping case is a race against time.

179
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,900

180
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,980
Lieutenant Kim Gyeong Wook?

181
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,940
Oh, you're Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong who called?

182
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes.

183
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,030
Here you go.

184
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,830
I guess everyone went out to the scene?

185
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,200
They're searching the whole Daeheung Mountain area right now.

186
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,090
I thought we had a specific suspect.

187
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,590
There was a report that No Sang Cheol followed the child victim in front of the school.

188
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,400
After further investigation, we learned that the child victim used to go visit No Sang Cheol's house to play.

189
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,420
No Sang Cheol, 36 years old.

190
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,640
He served time in prison for child molestation.

191
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,360
Has he ever been investigated for something other than this?

192
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,190
He was also questioned three years ago during a missing child case.

193
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,980
He had an alibi at that time, so he was excluded from the list of suspects.

194
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,820
The Metropolitan Investigation Unit will take over this case.

195
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes, I understand.

196
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,270
Work hard.

197
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,740
Team Leader, should we start by questioning those around the suspect?

198
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,420
What about his family?

199
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,800
His parents are both alive, and he has no siblings.

200
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,870
What about people he met after he was released from prison?

201
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,250
The villagers had no particular statements.

202
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,210
By chance... do we have the contact info of prior victims' families?

203
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,440
We have Min Joo Hyeok's parents contact info.

204
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,210
Contact the victim's parents.

205
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,030
Okay, I will.

206
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,310
We're from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

207
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,480
We were told. Please go in.

208
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,270
Open it for them.

209
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,130

210
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,060
He's not interested in adult females.

211
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,690
Interest in children. Pedophilia.

212
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,960

213
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,950
This packaging hasn't been opened.

214
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,780
He's not interested in games.

215
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,090
It's just bait to lure children.

216
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,890
On the outside, he would have been friendly.

217
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,700
Meticulous and careful, too.

218
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,130

219
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,410
Chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine.

220
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,930
It's for arthritis.

221
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,180
He probably wouldn't have gone to the mountain.

222
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,490
He suffers from degenerative arthritis.

223
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,530
This. I think there's a camera.

224
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,170
Let's watch it.

225
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,870
The child found out what No Sang Cheol truly was.

226
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,100
I'm sure No Sang Cheol wanted to meet him to clear a misunderstanding

227
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,080
but he got mad because things went awry.

228
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,910
 Hyeon Soo!

229
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,220
I should have realized it at the terminal.

230
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,320
Is it a guilty conscience?

231
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
What?

232
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,160
Guilty conscience over the fact that you could have saved the child.

233
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Have you always been able to empathize so easily,

234
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,130
or if not,

235
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,970
is it because the child can't speak just like your father?

236
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,580
Have you always been so rude?

237
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:17,610
Or if not,  is it because you're unable to empathize with others?

238
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,360
Hurry up.

239
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,820
If the child has been taken captive, we have to find him within 36 hours.

240
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,250

241
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,250
What brings you here?

242
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,930
I am Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong of the Mucheon Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

243
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,890
I came because of the missing child, Gil Hyeon Soo.

244
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,230
Detective, I don't ever want to remember that incident anymore.

245
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,190
I heard No Sang Cheol took Joo Hyeok to the reservoir and the museum.

246
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,290
By chance, did he ever take him anywhere else?

247
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,320
Detective, that asshole is completely crazy.

248
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,640
The kid can't remember.

249
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,830
He seems to have beat him up continuously to the point of death.

250
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,560
When we first found Joo Hyeok, I thought he was dead.

251
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,810
He went to prison for only two years. How does that make sense?

252
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,580
That's why this kind of incident happened again.

253
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,570
This time, when you catch that asshole,

254
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,930
please make him rot in jail for the rest of his life.

255
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,610
Thank you for your cooperation.

256
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,470
I watched the news.

257
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,500
You must find that child.

258
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,910
I'm upset thinking about him like he's my own.

259
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,530
Where do you think that asshole, No Sang Cheol, is?

260
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,790
Joo Hyeok was discovered at the reservoir nearby.

261
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,200
Let's try going there first.

262
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,890

263
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,310
Are you going where No Sang Cheol's car was found?

264
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,900
No. You have already been there.

265
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,270
Tell me what you saw.

266
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,990
Was the interior of the car clean or messy?

267
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,880
The car was old, but the interior was clean.

268
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,840
The atmosphere was unlike his house.

269
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,640
The house was messy, but the car was clean...

270
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,950
Usually, pedophiles hide their identities and tastes obsessively.

271
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,110
Since they have to show a different side of themselves to others.

272
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,300
Go to the trunk.

273
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,200
There was only Hyeon Soo's bag inside the trunk.

274
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,410
He was locked up in here.

275
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,220
What else?

276
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,880
The back light was broken.

277
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,070
The trunk was a little dented.

278
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,390
I think there was an accident.

279
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,460
It looks like a fresh mark.

280
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,680
A collision?

281
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,090
Why did he abandon his car?

282
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,100
He would have known it would be discovered quickly.

283
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,690
There should be something nearby that's a clue.

284
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,700
If you want to find the child, you need to remember everything.

285
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,010
Even minor things. Everything.

286
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,540
There's just old trash.

287
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,150
Anything that doesn't go with this scene is evidence.

288
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,590
This might not be anything but...

289
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,380
Tell me.

290
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,970
There's a feather.

291
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,900
What kind of feather?

292
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,170
I think it's duck down.

293
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,960
Duck down?

294
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,970
Let's go eat.

295
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,640
Look at the dust.

296
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,180
Shake off the dust before you go.

297
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,650
Besides No Sang Cheol, there was a third person on the scene.

298
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,920
Another person?

299
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,980
There's a blanket factory over that hill.

300
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,370
Go there.

301
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,980
Okay.

302
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,840
Hyeon Soo is probably alive, right?

303
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,690
Kidnapping cases are investigated with the hope that the child is still alive.

304
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,830
But it could be a Pandora’s box without any hope

305
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,130
since it’s a case with that big of a trauma.

306
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,970
Even if it's false hope,

307
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,010
we should still believe that he's still alive for now.

308
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,440
Sure.

309
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Will he call me?

310
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,350
We'll have to wait for it.

311
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,460
Hi, Son.

312
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,430
Daddy's working right now.

313
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,580
You have so many toys already. Why would you—

314
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,350
Son, I'll call you later.

315
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,280
Okay.

316
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,730
The missing child...

317
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,370
He's the same age as my child.

318
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,900
He's probably alive, right?

319
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,330

320
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,950
 Come to 29 Sohong Road.

321
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,440
Take a look around.

322
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,680
Okay.

323
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,800
Excuse me, have you seen this child?

324
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,930
No, I haven't.

325
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,630
Excuse me, have you seen this child?

326
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,350
Please take another look.

327
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,890
He's about this tall.

328
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,960
What is it?

329
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,150
It looks like you went hiking somewhere.

330
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,470
Your shoes are covered with dirt.

331
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,580
And this watch isn't yours, is it?

332
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,940
I got it as a gift.

333
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,990
This way.

334
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,990
I'll go up this way.

335
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,860
Okay.

336
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,150
- Drop it.
- Who are you guys?!

337
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,920
Drop your weapon!

338
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,740
- Don’t move. 
 - It’s not me.

339
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,530
- Get him up.
- Okay.

340
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,850
It’s not me. It's not.

341
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,950
You know Hyeon Soo, right? What did you do with him?

342
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,370
I don’t know. He was already dead.

343
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,860
I- I don’t know anything.

344
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,520
He really was already dead.

345
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,400
I’m only guilty of burying him.

346
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,930
What are you talking about?

347
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,670
What are you saying?!

348
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,220
There’s something here.

349
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,950
Team Leader.

350
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,080
We found it.

351
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,880
Move aside.

352
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,850
We found No Sang Cheol’s body.

353
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,120
The location is 29 Sohong Road. 29 Sohong Road.

354
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,800
We haven’t found the child yet.

355
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,660
Probably...

356
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,570
he’s in a situation where he can’t call.

357
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,610

358
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,860

359
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,050
I don’t know. I- I- I don’t know anything.

360
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,040
Park Jeong Woo.

361
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,520
Where's the child?

362
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,510
I don’t know.

363
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,170
You killed No Sang Cheol.

364
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,200
What did you do with the kid?

365
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,460
I-I don't remember.

366
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,930
Hey, asshole, should I help you remember?

367
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,030
- Where is Hyeon Soo? 
 - Hey.

368
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,890
 This asshole is lying!

369
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,620
Step outside.

370
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,560
Park Jeong Woo, I think I understand where you're coming from.

371
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,070
That person No Sang Cheol...

372
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,350
was a bad guy, right?

373
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,430
I heard Hyeon Soo is a very studious and smart child.

374
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,090
Right now, his grandmother is waiting anxiously for him.

375
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,130
Jeong Woo, you're a good guy.

376
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,930
Please just tell me where Hyeon Soo is.

377
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,830
My attorney will come.

378
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,110

379
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,860
There are signs of an accident on No Sang Cheol's car.

380
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,270
There are no signs of an accident on Park Jeong Woo's car.

381
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,680
There is a third person.

382
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,810
A third person?

383
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,620
The person who hit No Sang Cheol's car.

384
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
When we looked into insurance records and car centers in the vicinity,

385
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,110
there weren’t any cars brought in for service from a collision on the day of the kidnapping.

386
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,930

387
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,770
How are things going with Park Jeong Woo?

388
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,010
He keeps saying he doesn't know anything and is feigning ignorance.

389
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,450
He won't say anything until his attorney comes.

390
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,630
His attorney? That's strange.

391
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,910
Park Jeong Woo is a day laborer who has even been to the juvenile detention center.

392
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,280
But he has an attorney?

393
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,660
Look into Park Jeong Woo's past and his surroundings.

394
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,410
And look up the location of his attorney's office.

395
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,950
Okay.

396
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,270
Hello?

397
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,690
Ah, okay, I'll be right there.

398
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,410
Okay.

399
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,270
Yoo Bin.

400
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,380
What can I do?

401
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,840
I'm busy so I have to leave now.

402
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,880
Don't play too many games and be good, okay?

403
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,610
Mom will be right back.

404
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,950

405
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,260
What can I do?

406
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,680
I don't like that nickname for some reason.

407
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,740
Yoo Bin is such a nice name, isn't it?

408
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,030

409
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,270
Yoo Bin, you didn't do anything wrong at all.

410
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:16,670
Oh, right. The phone is broken, so don't use it.

411
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,650
And I will lock the door from outside when I leave,

412
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,840
so don't even think about leaving.

413
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,150
You play outside for too long if I let you.

414
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,500
If you get into an accident like before...

415
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,870
No.

416
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,480
I was wrong.

417
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,330
I shouldn't have brought that up.

418
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,580
Be good and have fun until Mom comes back, okay?

419
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,870
Okay.

420
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,170
Okay, I understand.

421
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,300
What? Do we have to change the direction of the investigation?

422
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,710
He said the investigation will change into a search for a body.

423
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,800
He wants to search the hills in the vicinity as well as the reservoir.

424
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,520
This crazy asshole must have done something to the child after killing No Sang Cheol.

425
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,330
Do you remember the Manbu-dong case?

426
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,510
Of course. The entire Metropolitan Investigation Unit was on that case.

427
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,510
We found evidence and we had believed 100% that the suspect was the culprit,

428
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,380
but after further investigation, he wasn't.

429
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,840
Are you saying that Park Jeong Woo isn't the culprit, like in the Manbu-dong case?

430
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,930
Park Jeong Woo isn't the culprit.

431
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,730
- No way... 
 - It looks like borderline intellectual disability.

432
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,160
He's big, but he's like a kid.

433
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,810
Then, are you saying the culprit is someone else?

434
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,430
It seems like he's being used.

435
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,140

436
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,740
Hello, I'm Attorney Cha Mi Rye.

437
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,080
I came here for Park Jeong Woo's case.

438
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,420
- They're coming out!
- Did the suspect confess?

439
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,730
Is the child still alive?

440
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,130
We're still looking for him.

441
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,620
We heard that the kidnapping suspect was found dead

442
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,540
and that the police has changed the direction of the investigation.

443
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,420
It's already been three days. Doesn't that honestly mean there isn't a possibility that he's alive?

444
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,700
Where did he say the child's body was abandoned?

445
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,290
The child is still alive.

446
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,890
How can you guarantee that?

447
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,430
Aren't you giving us false hope?

448
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,150
 We believe that he is alive because we're the police.

449
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,000
 Please give us more detail!

450
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,280
The media and the internet are going crazy.

451
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,300
Team Leader Hwang seems to think the child is still alive.

452
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,660
What do you think?

453
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,610
The critical hour has passed.

454
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,330
At least finding his corpse quickly is a part of the police's role, isn't it?

455
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,230
I ordered a search of the hills in the vicinity as well as the reservoir.

456
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,530
The ground is frozen so he wouldn't have been able to bury him deep.

457
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,210
If we're unlucky, we will find him around spring time.

458
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,560
Either way, have you looked into it?

459
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,470
The higher up who ordered to cover up Oh Hyeon Jae's case.

460
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,870
I'm looking into it.

461
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,020
It seems that there is someone on Oh Hyeon Jae's side.

462
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,410
I have a bad feeling about it.

463
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,220

464
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,150

465
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,550

466
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,290

467
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,920
I think they're closed.

468
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,470
Look into whether Cha Mi Rye is a court-appointed attorney.

469
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,380
Okay.

470
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,610
Detective Jang, is Park Jeong Woo's attorney a court-appointed attorney?

471
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,060

472
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,900
Okay.

473
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,020
She's not a court-appointed attorney.

474
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,620

475
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,420

476
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,700
What brings you here?

477
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,780
We're here to see Attorney Cha Mi Rye.

478
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,830
Did she go somewhere?

479
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,800
Oh, Attorney Cha doesn't really work these days.

480
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,660
What about Attorney Kim Na Hui?

481
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,060
What kind of a case?

482
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,820
Custody issues.

483
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,850
Ah, okay, hold on.

484
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,100

485
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,730
Please go in.

486
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,840
Welcome. I'm Kim Na Hui.

487
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,950
Please sit here.

488
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,880
Because her head hurts,

489
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,540
I think it's better if she stands.

490
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,220
Ah, I see. That's okay.

491
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,270
What brings you here?

492
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,340
I came here because of a divorce problem.

493
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,120
We have a child.

494
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,960
So it's a custody problem.

495
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,120
Are you two a married couple?

496
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,110
She's my sister. It's not like I could bring my wife.

497
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,410
Ah, I see.

498
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,770
Excuse me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't touch that.

499
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,930
Ah, I'm sorry. I was just marveling at it.

500
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,930
You've done quite a lot of good work.

501
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,570
A lot of volunteer work as well.

502
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,650
Yes, well, I love children.

503
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,760
Kids don't try to fool you.

504
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,880
That's right.

505
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,590
Shall we continue discussing your custody case?

506
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,740
Yes.

507
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,630
Oppa, you should try to discuss it with Unni again.

508
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,150
It seems that I should.

509
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,730
Yes, you should.

510
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,220
But no matter what you decide,

511
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,960
your child's happiness is the most important.

512
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,440
Please don't forget that.

513
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,020
I won't.

514
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,010
Kim Na Hui and Park Jeong Woo are members of the same volunteer group.

515
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,000
Did you find anything weird?

516
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,390
Her books and other things were too perfectly aligned.

517
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,090
She has obsessive compulsive disorder.

518
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,850
What is she obsessed with?

519
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,410
There weren't any mirrors. From the entrance onwards.

520
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,140
Anxious state, sense of loss, lack of presence.

521
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,810
Out of these, which one is it?

522
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,550
A type like these may look perfect on the outside

523
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,670
but in reality, they are completely different.

524
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,540
Any clues to Hyeon Soo?

525
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,940
There weren't any.

526
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,820
There weren't any...

527
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,600
There weren't any...

528
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,080
It's not that we couldn't find it?

529
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,370
Kim Na Hui...

530
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,480
We need to investigate her further.

531
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,440

532
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,670
He keeps repeating that he doesn't remember.

533
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,900
How's the investigation on Kim Na Hui?

534
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,830
Team Leader, when Park Jeong Woo was in juvie,

535
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,600
his attorney was Kim Na Hui.

536
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,800
When Park Jeong Woo applied for the blanket factory job,

537
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,840
the person who vouched for him was also Kim Na Hui.

538
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,750
I think this is ...

539
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,950
grooming.

540
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,510
If Park Jeong Woo is being controlled,

541
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,570
he probably has a strong desire to receive affection and recognition from Kim Na Hui.

542
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,000
Kim Na Hui was the one who hit No Sang Cheol's car.

543
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,830
Of course, it was an accident at first.

544
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,210
 Are you okay?

545
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,620
 I'm sorry.

546
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,710
 I couldn't see well because it is dark.

547
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,970
 Where did you put your eyes?!

548
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,070
 But... why are you speaking informally to me?

549
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,200
 - Just leave. I'm fine. 
 - No, it's fine.

550
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,250
 Let's exchange insurance information.

551
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,560
 I said I'm fine. Didn't you hear me?

552
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,210
 - Why- why are you acting like this? 
 - Damn it!

553
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,560
 I told you to leave since I'm fine!

554
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,790
 Why, why are you acting like this?

555
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,680
 You don't have to deal with this accident. Just leave.

556
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,500
Then why did Kim Na Hui kill No Sang Cheol?

557
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:32,450
Kim Na Hui saw Hyeon Soo in No Sang Cheol's trunk.

558
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:58,050
The one who killed No Sang Cheol was Kim Na Hui.

559
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,290
Then, what about Park Jeong Woo?

560
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,310
Kim Na Hui made Park Jeong Woo take care of the body.

561
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,390
 It's me. Come here and take care of this.

562
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,000
After Park Jeong Woo, who arrived later at the scene, took care of the body,

563
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,030
he drove No Sang Cheol's car up the mountain

564
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,630
because he needed to make it seem like

565
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,550
No Sang Cheol took Hyeon Soo up the mountain.

566
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,250
Of course, all of this is just my hypothesis.

567
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,100
It makes sense.

568
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,950
Find Kim Na Hui's whereabouts and contact the local police.

569
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,630
Okay.

570
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,930

571
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,440
- Search. 
 - Yes.

572
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,700
Kim Na Hui fled.

573
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,940
Detective Lee, find Kim Na Hui's license plate number and track her car.

574
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,430
She's our prime suspect.

575
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,480
I've found Kim Na Hui's car.

576
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,090
The license plate number is 48 N2465.

577
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,360
 12. She is on highway 12.

578
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,870
48 N2465.

579
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,320
Hyung-nim, I think it's that car.

580
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,320
48 N2465, stop your car.

581
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,620
48 N2465, stop your car. We're the police.

582
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,580
48 N2465, stop your car!

583
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,620
We found Kim Na Hui's car.

584
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,390
She's going in the direction of Hongwoon Creek.

585
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,970
- Stop right there! 
 - Stop!

586
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,580
Freeze!

587
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,030
What is it?

588
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,110
I'm just doing as I was told.

589
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,830
I was told to get rid of this.

590
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,890
Detective Cha!

591
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,010
Kim Na Hui told her office manager to get rid of it.

592
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,570
Cha Mi Rye is an attorney paid by Kim Na Hui.

593
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,310
She doesn't know Hyeon Soo.

594
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,810
Her car is here and her phone is off.

595
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,960
Where should we look for her?

596
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,970
Thanks for your hard work.

597
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,750
Hyeon Soo is with Kim Na Hui right now.

598
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,650
That means the child is still alive, right?

599
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,680
Probably.

600
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,090
There's only one way left.

601
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,080
Any lead will be good. Can you find it?

602
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,180
I'll give it a try.

603
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,790

604
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,910
There was a flyer.

605
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,190
What kind of a flyer?

606
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,800
It's a missing child flyer.

607
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,100
Lee Yoo Bin, 12 years old.

608
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,360
Lee Yoo Bin?

609
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,760
I think I've seen that flyer too at the terminal.

610
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,660
But that child is the same age as Hyeon Soo.

611
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,820
Look into Lee Yoo Bin and his relationship to Kim Na Hui.

612
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,870
Detective Lee, look into Lee Yoo Bin and Kim Na Hui's relationship right now.

613
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,090
Kim Na Hui was edgy when you touched the snow globe.

614
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:36,850
 Excuse me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't touch that.

615
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,380
What was there?

616
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,900
Inside there was just a miniature...

617
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,480
There's definitely a clue there. Find it.

618
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,920
 Team Leader.

619
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,970
Five years ago, Kim Na Hui's child went missing.

620
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,500
His corpse was found a few days later.

621
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,220
- As expected. 
 - What?

622
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,630
The child died five years ago,

623
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,770
but Kim Na Hui is distributing missing child flyers.

624
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,200
She can't accept what happened.

625
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,450
Right now, Kim Na Hui thinks of Hyeon Soo as her own child.

626
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,030
This is driving me nuts.

627
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,880
Where do we find Hyeon Soo?

628
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,710
Miroland.

629
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,470
- What? 
 - Miroland, an amusement park.

630
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,000
Hey, what's with this nonsense all of a sudden?

631
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,870
Detective Lee, see if Miroland really exists.

632
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:44,030
If it exists, find out how it relates to Kim Na Hui.

633
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,820
It's urgent.

634
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,780
I found it.

635
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,130
Kim Na Hui's father used to run it, but it's out of business now.

636
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,600
 I'll send you the address right now.

637
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,510
He found it.

638
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,810
I told you

639
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,670
that I am really confident in this game!

640
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,410
I won't be losing you again. No.

641
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,840
Yoo Bin, I won!

642
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,700
You can't go anywhere!

643
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,170
I will never part with you again.

644
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,050
Yoo Bin! Come here.

645
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,870
Yoo Bin, open the door!

646
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,860
Yoo Bin.

647
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,740
You have to open the door.

648
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,400
Yoo Bin.

649
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,170
Yoo Bin!

650
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,700
Yoo Bin!

651
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,680
I will forgive you.

652
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,480
Yoo Bin, where are you?

653
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,000
Yoo Bin.

654
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,710
Yoo Bin, where are you?

655
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,910
Yoo Bin.

656
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,050
Kim Na Hui has an extreme case of delusional disorder.

657
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,950
When she first saw Hyeon Soo,

658
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,400
she must have thought of him as her own child.

659
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,110
Because she doesn't want to re-live her past of losing her child.

660
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,500
If Kim Na Hui thinks of Hyeon Soo as her own child,

661
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,960
then what does she think of the police?

662
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,490
We're people who will interfere with her happiness.

663
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,480
Yoo Bin, we have to go home.

664
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,530
Yoo Bin.

665
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,610
My Yoo Bin is a good boy.

666
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,890
I found you.

667
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,260
Back up will arrive soon.

668
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,010
Detective Cha and I will go this way.

669
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,150
We'll go this way.

670
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,010
Team Leader, here.

671
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,960
You go that way.

672
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,690
Okay.

673
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,270
Hyeon Soo!

674
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:21,740
I found Hyeon Soo! He's on the roof.

675
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,260
Hyeon Soo! Hyeon Soo!

676
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,820
Hyeon Soo, are you okay?

677
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,840
I'm here now. Everything will be okay.

678
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,070
Is your injury okay?

679
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:59,450

680
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,470

681
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:16,610
 This murder case seems to be about who has power over Haewol-dong.

682
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,600
 Ha Tae Sik is not an easy opponent.

683
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,240
 He's always been freed due to lack of evidence.

684
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,520
 - Please call in Oh Hyeon Jae.
- What?

685
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,970
 Why did you want to see me?

686
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,450
 Maybe I just wanted to be caught by a competent detective?

687
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,300
 You have to look through the eyes of the assailants.

688
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,350
 With their logic, through their eyes.

689
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,660
 I killed them.

690
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,060
 They betrayed me, so I couldn't just let them be.

691
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,220
 Ha Tae Sik is hiding something.

692
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,450
 We have to find that first.
